UK agrees free trade deal with New Zealand,"It is thought New Zealand will be able to sell more lamb to the UK under the deal The UK has agreed a free trade deal with New Zealand which it says will benefit consumers and businesses. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the deal will cut costs for exporters and open up New Zealand's job market to UK professionals. The government hopes it is a step towards joining a trade club with the likes of Canada and Japan. The New Zealand deal itself is unlikely to boost UK growth, according to the government's own estimates. Overall, only a tiny proportion of UK trade is done with New Zealand, less than 0.2%. Labour and the National Farmers Union (NFU) said the deal could hurt UK farmers and lower food standards. But International Trade Secretary Anne-Marie Trevelyan said it ""affords opportunities in both directions for great sharing of produce"" and British farmers should not be worried. How many trade deals has the UK done? UK 'cut climate pledges' to clinch Australia trade deal UK wants to join the club - but what is the CPTPP? China applies to join key Asia-Pacific trade pact Mr Johnson and New Zealand's Prime Minister, Jacinda Ardern, agreed the pact in a video call on Wednesday after 16 months of negotiations. Tariffs will be removed on UK goods including clothing, ships and bulldozers, and on New Zealand goods including wine, honey and kiwi fruits. Professionals such as lawyers and architects will be able to work in New Zealand more easily, the government said. However, the deal is not likely to increase UK economic growth - or GDP - according to theUK government's own assessments,external. New Zealand will fare slightly better as it may be able to sell more lamb to the UK. But, like the trade deal recently struck with Australia, the UK hopes this is a step towards joining the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) - a trade bloc that includes Australasia, Canada, Mexico and Japan among others. The UK already has deals with many of the members, rolled over from when it was in the EU. But CPTPP membership would give it more access in terms of services and digital trade. Ina video of the deal being struck,external, Mr Johnson said: ""We've scrummed down, we've packed tight, and together we've got the ball over the line and we have a deal. And I think it's a great deal."" Ms Ardern said: ""I loved your use of rugby metaphors, but if we were going to continue that on, then naturally it would conclude with the All Blacks winning. ""And I know that New Zealand feels that way with this free trade agreement, but actually, it's good for both of us, as it happens."" The NFU said the deal, like the one with Australia, could have a ""huge downside"", especially for UK dairy and meat farmers. Its president, Minette Batters, said the Australia and New Zealand deals mean ""we will be opening our doors to significant extra volumes of imported food - whether or not produced to our own high standards - while securing almost nothing in return for UK farmers"". ""The fact is that UK farm businesses face significantly higher costs of production than farmers in New Zealand and Australia, and it's worth remembering that margins are already tight here due to ongoing labour shortages and rising costs on farm,"" she said. ""The government is now asking British farmers to go toe-to-toe with some of the most export-orientated farmers in the world, without the serious, long-term and properly funded investment in UK agriculture that can enable us to do so. Emily Thornberry, shadow trade secretary, said the government's own figures showed the deal would ""cut employment in our farming communities, produce zero additional growth, and generate just Â£112m in additional exports for UK firms compared to pre-pandemic levels"". She added that the only winners were ""the mega-corporations who run New Zealand's meat and dairy farms"". ""As our economy recovers from the pandemic, we need trade deals that will boost jobs and growth, open up big new markets for UK exporters, and support our objectives to buy, make and sell more in Britain. This trade deal with New Zealand fails on every count,"" she said. The international trade secretary said British farmers should not be concerned about increased lamb imports because the lambing seasons were different in the UK and New Zealand. Anne-Marie Trevelyan said: ""I'm very comfortable it's a complimentary - because of the seasonsâ¦ consumers will have more choice."" She said trade with New Zealand was currently worth Â£2.3bn a year but had the potential to increase by up to 30% by 2030. Analysis: Ramzan Karmali, BBC Business reporter A bottle of New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc could cost 20p less as a result of this trade deal and other products like Manuka honey and kiwi fruits could also cost less. In terms of overall trade, even by the UK government's own analysis a tariff free trade deal will make no difference at all to the country's GDP - the total value of the goods and services the UK produces. Overall the trade between the two countries is less than 0.2% of the UK total and in fact in 2018 New Zealand ranked as only our 53rd biggest trading partner. So why does this deal matter? The UK signed its first big post-Brexit deal with Japan last year and in June it also signed a draft agreement for a trade deal with Australia. Both countries, as well as New Zealand, are members of the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership or CPTPP. The combined GDP for the 11 nations that form the CPTPP in 2020 was Â£8.4trn - one of the key reasons given by the UK government when it formally applied earlier this year. This deal is the first agreed during the tenure of Britain's new Secretary of State for International Trade, Anne-Marie Trevelyan, who took over from Liz Truss last month. She believes that by getting this deal done the UK's application to the CPTPP will be looked upon more favourably. That being said, the trade deal the UK really wants is with the US. But with the recent change in administration in the White House that seems further away. What trade deals has the UK done so far?

"Nearly 1,500 arrests in drug dealing crackdown","Nearly 1,500 people have been arrested in England and Wales in a week-long operation against so-called county lines drug dealing networks. Police say they have started focusing on senior figures controlling phone numbers used to sell drugs. Officers are also using modern slavery and human trafficking laws to prosecute gangs exploiting vulnerable children. Some 139 county lines were closed, and almost Â£2m of Class A drugs, including cocaine and heroin, seized. County line gangs are urban drug dealers who sell to customers in more rural areas via dedicated phone lines. They have become central to the trade in illegal substances across Britain and the way they operate is often accompanied by serious violence. Gangs in cities operate phone lines advertised in other towns and rural areas to supply drugs, while remaining at arm's length to reduce the risk of arrest. 'A drugs gang made life like a horror movie' Drugs county lines fight 'to last a generation' But police changed tactics two years ago and now have a strategy of identifying the ""line holder"" by analysing phone records, meaning gang leaders can often be arrested in possession of the phone, proving their involvement. As a result the number of arrests has been growing during regular week-long operations in which different police forces co-ordinate their efforts. A total of 85% of defendants are now pleading guilty and the conviction rate is 99%, said Graham McNulty, deputy assistant commissioner of the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC). ""We are making significant inroads into dismantling violent county lines. ""The figures speak for themselves. We're stopping abhorrent criminals abusing young people and lining their own pockets in the process,"" he said. An assessment of county lines drug dealing produced by the NPCC suggests the number of active lines has fallen from around 2,000 in 2018 to 600. In the latest police push, between 11 October and 17 October: 1,468 people were arrested 2,664 vulnerable people, including 2,209 children, were identified - with work beginning to protect their safety 6kg of crack cocaine, 28.8kg of heroin and 26.8kg of cocaine were seized, along with Â£1,254,384 in cash 289 weapons were seized, including 49 guns and 120 knives Police also visited 894 addresses used by drug gangs for their operations against the will of the resident, a practice known as ""cuckooing"". Most of the gangs operate from Merseyside, the West Midlands and London. County lines gangs groom children and vulnerable adults to get them moving drugs around the country, often using threatening and coercive behaviour. Nearly Â£2m worth of class A drugs were seized during operations between 11 and 17 October Police are pioneering the use of ""victimless prosecutions"" which aims to reduce the need for victims to give evidence in court. However, the Children's Society, a charity that works with young people facing abuse, neglect and exploitation, wants the government to boost the law on the criminal exploitation of children by adding a definition of the offence to the new Policing Bill. Iryna Pona, Policy Manager at The Children's Society, said: ""This should also provide clarity for professionals in identifying young victims and would be strengthened further by a national strategy, supported by funding, to ensure more children get earlier help, ending the current postcode lottery in support."" ""There needs to be a relentless focus among professionals upon identifying and supporting children at risk of exploitation as early as possible."" The Children's Society runs a campaign, Look Closer, designed to help people spot signs that children and vulnerable adults are involved with county lines. James Simmonds-Read, from The Children's Society'sâ¯ prevention programme which has worked alongside police said: ""It's vital that professionals spot instances where children have been exploited by criminals, so we are pleased that many vulnerable people - including young people - have been identified as being in need of support."" ""The public can also play a crucial role in spotting signs of exploitation and reporting them to the police and Look Closer highlights how everyone from commuters to transport and shop staff can help children to escape horrific exploitation."" ""Young people may not ask for help themselves because they have been manipulated into thinking they are making a choice or because they have been subjected to terrifying threats."" This video can not be played Hunting for children caught up in county lines drug gangs The British Transport Police try to stop drugs being transported on trains. Meanwhile, the National Crime Agency is focusing on stopping drugs getting into the country in the first place. Recently the NCA has charged six men with importing 2.3 tonnes of cocaine worth Â£190m. Other seizures include 5.2 tonnes of cocaine being transported by sea, and the discovery of heroin and cocaine inside a British lorry. NCA Director of Investigations Nikki Holland said: ""It is a high priority for the NCA to build on the successes we have had in source countries and along the drugs supply routes, so that organised crime groups land fewer drugs in our towns and cities and prevent them being pushed further afield through county lines groups.""

Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice,"The Queen was pictured on Tuesday evening, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle The Queen has cancelled a trip to Northern Ireland and has ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"", Buckingham Palace says. The 95-year-old monarch will remain at Windsor Castle but is still expected to attend the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow later this month. The Queen is in ""good spirits"" but ""disappointed"" that the visit cannot go ahead, the palace said. She was due to begin the two-day trip on Wednesday. The nation's longest-reigning monarch has attended a series of events in recent days, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening. Queen declines Oldie of the Year award Queen 'irritated' by climate change inaction Earlier in the day, she held two audiences via video link, greeting the Japanese ambassador Hajime Hayashi and the EU ambassador Joao de Almeida. On Monday, she held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand, and at the weekend, she attended the races at Ascot. It was revealed on Tuesday that the Queen had declined the Oldie of the Year award, from the magazine of the same name, saying: ""You are only as old as you feel"". A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days. ""Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow. ""The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and looks forward to visiting in the future."" The Queen's decision is understood to be unrelated to coronavirus. Buckingham Palace is keen not to cause any alarm and has stressed that the Queen has ""reluctantly accepted"" the advice of doctors to rest for the next few days. She has had a busy schedule of engagements over the past couple of weeks that would test the resilience of many people far younger than her. I saw her last Tuesday at an event at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time she had used a walking stick in public. She also took a shorter route into the Abbey. We were told this was ""for her own comfort."" But she still looked incredibly well and engaged for a 95-year-old. It is clear though that getting older takes its toll on us all and the Queen's diary will be carefully managed going forward. The Queen had been due to arrive in Hillsborough in County Down on Wednesday afternoon and attend a church service marking the centenary of the formation of Northern Ireland in Armagh tomorrow. An advance team was already in Northern Ireland making preparations for the two-day visit. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales was also at Windsor Castle on Wednesday for an investiture ceremony where the chef and TV presenter Mary Berry was made Dame Commander. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,said on Twitter,external: ""We thank Her Majesty for her good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and trust that she will keep well and benefit from a period of rest. ""It is always a joy to have Her Majesty in Royal Hillsborough and we look forward to a further visit in the near future."" Wishing her well, Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the Queen had been ""a source of great comfort during Northern Ireland's darkest days and provided lasting leadership as we moved into a new era for all our people"". Prince Charles held the investiture ceremony for Dame Mary Berry on Wednesday Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wished the Queen ""all the very best as she takes a few days' rest"". Church leaders in Northern Ireland said in a joint statement that they were sorry she would not attend the Service of Reconciliation and Hope in Armagh, and acknowledged ""the significance of her commitment to the work of peace and reconciliation, which has meant a great deal to people throughout this island"". The Queen first travelled to Northern Ireland in 1945, just after the end of World War Two, when she was a princess. If it had gone ahead, this week's trip would have been her 26th visit. Royal visits to Northern Ireland during its centenary year have included the first in line to the throne, Prince Charles who went to Belfast in May, and Prince William who visited Londonderry in September.

TV chef Mary Berry 'proud' to be made a dame,"Mary Berry with her husband Paul Hunnings after she was made a dame TV chef Mary Berry has said she is ""proud and honoured"" to be made a Dame Commander for services to cooking, writing and baking. Dame Mary was honoured on Wednesday by the Prince of Wales during an investiture ceremony at Windsor Castle. As well as her 50-year culinary and broadcasting career, the honour also recognises her charity work. She said she would celebrate by ""going home for a sandwich and the children are coming tonight."" The 86-year-old former Bake Off judge recently had surgery after breaking her hip following a fall in the summer. Yet she was able to attend the ceremony alongside husband Paul Hunnings, a retired antiquarian bookseller. Dame Mary previously baked alongside the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge for the TV show A Berry Royal Christmas, praising the latter for being a ""remarkable, enthusiastic cook"". Speaking after her latest royal engagement, she said: ""I'm extremely proud and honoured. I just wish my parents were here - they're looking down and my children are quite excited. ""My aim is to pass on the skill that I love so much, because everybody has to cook each day. Whether it's a student or whatever it is, you've got to feed yourself so why not learn to do it well and enjoy it."" At the same ceremony, Peaky Blinders writer Steven Knight - whose latest film, Spencer, explores three days in the life of Diana, Princess of Wales - was made a CBE. Karen Gibson, founder and director of the Kingdom Choir that performed during the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's wedding, was also honoured with an MBE. Berry was honoured on Wednesday for services to cooking, writing and baking After studying cooking in France and the UK, Dame Mary worked for a number of food industry bodies and wrote recipe pages of Housewife magazine. Her first cookbook, The Hamlyn All Colour Cookbook, was published in 1970 and she has gone on to write more than 50 others, selling millions of copies around the world. She became a household name to a new generation of cake lovers thanks to her role as a judge on The Great British Bake Off, alongside Paul Hollywood, Mel Giedroyc and Sue Perkins. ""I thoroughly enjoyed being on Bake Off, I was there seven years. We were a great team Paul Hollywood, Mel and Sue - we enjoyed every minute,"" she said. In her latest upcoming BBC series, the veteran broadcaster will come to the rescue of novice cooks hoping to impress a loved one. She revealed she loves it when she meets people in the supermarket who say they have successfully learned how to make her lemon drizzle cake or lasagne. Aside from cooking, Dame Mary has committed herself to charity work down the years. Her youngest son William was killed in a car crash at the age of 19, after which she became a patron of Child Bereavement UK. ""I was lucky to have a very supportive family but there are many people who are not in that position,"" she said. ""Whether it's the siblings who are left or the husband or the wife, it's a hand to hold and to realise other people are in the same boat.""

Rare 370-year-old US coin found in sweet tin,"The New England shilling was struck in 1652 and is said to be one of the earliest US coins A rare example of one of the US's first coins has been found hidden in a collection kept inside a sweet tin. The mid-17th Century New England shilling was found by Wentworth Beaumont at his family's home of Bywell Hall in Northumberland. The coin was struck in 1652 for use as currency by early settlers in the Massachusetts Bay Colony. It is hoped the coin could sell for Â£200,000 when it goes for auction in London next month. Mr Beaumont, an art adviser, said the old confectionery tin which contained the coin and a number of others had been found in the hall's study, He said: ""I'd never seen it before and when I opened it I thought it was just a rather bizarre collection of random old coinage. ""However, as I don't know anything about coins, I felt it was worth checking out."" The jumble of coins was kept in an old Barker and Dobson confectionery tin Coin specialist James Morton, who inspected the discovery for auctioneers Morton and Eden, said: ""I could hardly believe my eyes when I realised that it was an excellent example of a New England shilling."" He said the coin is the ""star of the collection"", which also includes a Massachusetts ""Pine Tree"" shilling, two examples of ""Continental Currency"" pewter dollars dated 1776, a ""Libertas Americana"" bronze medal and several British hammered gold coins. Mr Beaumont is descended from William Wentworth, who visited New England in 1636, and several members of the family went on to hold prominent positions in colonial America. He said: ""I can only assume that the shilling was brought back from America years ago by one of my forebears.""

WHO warns pandemic will drag on into 2022,"A patient receives Covid care in Tunisia Covid has severely affected healthcare staff and may have killed between 80,000 and 180,000, the World Health Organization (WHO) says. Healthcare workers must be prioritised for vaccines, WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said, and he criticised unfairness in the distribution of jabs. The deaths occurred between January 2020 and May of this year. Earlier, another senior WHO official warned a lack of jabs could see the pandemic continue well into next year. There are an estimated 135 million healthcare workers globally. ""Data from 119 countries suggest that on average, two in five healthcare workers globally are fully vaccinated,"" Dr Tedros said. ""But of course, that average masks huge differences across regions and economic groupings."" Fewer than one in 10 healthcare workers were fully vaccinated in Africa, he said, compared with eight in 10 in high-income countries. A failure to provide poorer countries with enough vaccines was highlighted earlier by Dr Bruce Aylward, a senior leader at the WHO, who said it meant the Covid crisis could ""easily drag on deep into 2022"". Less than 5% of Africa's population have been vaccinated, compared with 40% on most other continents. The vast majority of Covid vaccines overall have been used in high-income or upper middle-income countries. Africa accounts for just 2.6% of doses administered globally. More than 50 countries missing Covid vaccine target Covax: How many Covid vaccines have the US and the other G7 countries pledged? Covid vaccines: How fast is progress around the world? The original idea behind Covax, the UN-backed global programme to distribute vaccines fairly, was that all countries would be able to acquire vaccines from its pool, including wealthy ones, writes BBC Global Affairs correspondent Naomi Grimley. But most G7 countries decided to hold back once they started making their own one-to-one deals with pharmaceutical companies. This video can not be played Ros Atkins looks at the ethics of Western countries rolling out Covid booster jabs while millions globally remain unvaccinated Dr Aylward appealed to wealthy countries to give up their places in the queue for vaccines so that pharmaceutical companies can prioritise the lowest-income countries instead. He said wealthy countries needed to ""stocktake"" where they were with their donation commitments made at summits such as the G7 meeting in St Ives this summer. ""I can tell you we're not on track,"" he said. ""We really need to speed it up or you know what? This pandemic is going to go on for a year longer than it needs to."" The People's Vaccine - an alliance of charities - has released new figures suggesting just one in seven of the doses promised by pharmaceutical companies and wealthy countries are actually reaching their destinations in poorer countries. The alliance, which includes Oxfam and UNAids, also criticised Canada and the UK for procuring vaccines for their own populations via Covax. Official figures show that earlier this year the UK received 539,370 Pfizer doses from Covax while Canada took just under a million AstraZeneca doses. Oxfam's Global Health Adviser, Rohit Malpani, acknowledged that Canada and the UK were technically entitled to get vaccines via this route having paid into the Covax mechanism, but he said it was still ""morally indefensible"" given that they had both obtained millions of doses through their own bilateral agreements. The UK government pointed out it was one of the countries which had ""kick-started"" Covax last year with a donation of Â£548m. The UK has also delivered more than 10 million vaccines to countries in need, and has pledged a total of 100 million. The Canadian government was keen to stress that it had now stopped using Covax vaccines. The country's International Development Minister, Karina Gould, said: ""As soon as it became clear that the supply we had secured through our bilateral deals would be sufficient for the Canadian population, we pivoted the doses which we had procured from Covax back to Covax, so they could be redistributed to developing countries."" Covax originally aimed to deliver two billion doses of vaccines by the end of this year, but so far it has shipped 371m doses.

What could happen if Covid gets out of control?,"Wales' beauty spots were closed to tourists in March 2020 when the pandemic hit Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced that England will be heading into what's become known as the ""Plan B"" set of restrictions. Its in response to the emergence of Omicron, with officials increasingly concerned at the variant's transmissibility and pressure it could put on the NHS. In Wales, the devolved government has a set of regulations that look very much like Mr Johnson's announcement for England. People are already asked to work from home, and Covid passes are required in more venues than in England. Mask wearing has remained mandatory in many indoor public places, barring pubs and restaurants. Yet case rates have remained high - with seven day rates not fallen below 470 per 100,000 for months. Boosters are being rolled out to more people, but should officials want to slow the spread while more arms are being jabbed, there is a plan they could implement. It involves a return to the restrictions on our social lives and on businesses that were axed in summer. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Ministers, before Omicron, were at pains to stress they did not think a lockdown would be necessary again. Now, the picture is unclear. Welsh ministers have never ruled out needing to return to restrictions on businesses and our social lives, but have played down the chance of a new lockdown in the past. But ministers in Cardiff face potentially difficult choices if the decisions they want to take are different to those being considered in London, and the money to support Welsh restrictions does not emerge. Wales, in common with the rest of the UK, currently has no restrictions on social contact and all businesses are allowed to open. Butmask wearing is the law in indoor public spaces, including shops, public transport, hospitals and social care settings. The exception is in pubs, restaurants and nightclubs. The UK government had scrapped mask rules in England during the summer, but re-introduced them after Omicron emerged. People in Wales are also legally required toobtain a NHS Covid passif they are going to large events, a nightclub or a venue that's similar to a nightclub. The law goes further than the requirement in England, with passes also now needed to go to cinemas, theatres and concert halls. The pass needs to show if an individual has had a recent negative lateral flow test in the last 48 hours, or two vaccinations. And it is not a legal restriction, but individuals are advised to work from home if they can. While there are no plans, the picture has become uncertain. Ministers had hoped expanding the NHS Covid pass system would avoid the need to take more drastic action. But in recent days Welsh ministers have not been able to say what restrictions will be in place during the festive period. They have instead emphasised people should take precautions - like taking a lateral flow test before meeting relatives. What is Plan B for Covid in England this winter? Why are UK Covid cases so high? First Minister Mark Drakeford has previously said he has no plans to shut businesses. But he had also written a letter to the prime minister asking for financial support if he needed to implement ""more interventionist measures"". He said the point of the letter was to make it clear to the UK government it they ""can't do what they did last year"", referring to a row when the Welsh government decided to go into a firebreak lockdown in October 2020 but furloughwas not extended in response. Under the latest Covid control plan,external, Wales is currently classed as being ""Covid Stable"", where there are very few restrictions. But the Welsh government could move to ""Covid Urgent"", drawn up if new and unexpected Covid pressures emerge - like a new variant that does not respond to vaccines, or if there is unsustainable pressure on the NHS. In that scenario, the Welsh government plans to return to the alert level lists of restrictions it had in place last year - stretching from restrictions on socialising to a Welsh lockdown. Ministers have given no clues what alert level they may choose in response to Omicron, or even if they will move to Covid urgent. The lightest set of restrictions, classed asalert level one,external, would see the rule of six on social contact indoors, and nightclubs closed. At alert level two,external, meetings with people outside your extended household in a private home would be effectively banned, and ice rinks shut. In alert level three,external, more venues would be forced to close, and pubs and restaurants would only be able to serve outside, and outdoor gatherings limited to six. Finally,alert level four,externalwould reintroduce a stay-at-home lockdown like that seen in January. But the rules are not set in stone. Laws on coronavirus in Wales have changed rapidly as the pandemic and they could be changed again. The Alpha variant contributed to large Covid wave at the end of last year, overwhelming hospital services. Wales was badly hit. Cinemas and other indoor entertainment venues were closed at the start of December, and alcohol was banned from sale in pubs, restaurants and cafes. But the situation saw Labour ministers go further. The country went into lockdown on 23 December, and plans to allow social contact indoors over the Christmas break were limited to just Christmas Day. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has no plans to reintroduce furlough Moving to Covid Urgent, combined with a ramping up of restrictions on businesses, poses real dilemmas for a devolved government that cannot summon large pots of cash. A long Welsh lockdown without the help the Welsh government has asked for from the UK government could leave thousands out of work and facing significant financial hardship. While the individual UK nations have pursued sometimes different lockdown policies, they did it with financial firepower from Westminster in the background - including the furlough scheme. Furlough ended on 30 Septemberand as things stand there are no plans to bring it back. Should a situation develop where pressure on the NHS in Wales was acute, but furlough did not return, the stakes in a Wales-only lockdown where businesses shut would be high for Mark Drakeford. But if the situation is bad in Wales, it may be the same in England, where Boris Johnson's government will face similar pressures.

"Clean out online cesspit now, Starmer tells PM","This video can not be played The PM speaks of âcriminal sanctions with tough sentencesâ for those who add âfoul contentâ to the internet. Sir Keir Starmer is demanding urgent government action to ""clean out the cesspit"" of online extremism. The Labour leader offered to work with Prime Minister Boris Johnson to fast track new online safety laws. Mr Johnson promised to get the first stage of the long-awaitedOnline Safety Bill,externalthrough the Commons by Christmas. He said it would include criminal sanctions for those allowing ""foul content"" - but did not confirm whether that would include company directors. Labour is calling for the directors of internet firms to be held liable for the content of messages posted on their sites. Can new law tackle social media abuse of MPs? Government lays out plans to protect users online Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir said it was now three years since the government had promised a crackdown on online extremism and hate speech but the proposals had yet to begin their passage into law. ""Meanwhile, the damage caused by harmful content online is worse than ever,"" he told MPs. He criticised ""dangerous algorithms"" on Facebook and Instagram - and said he had been shown examples of ""violent Islamism and far-right propaganda"" on TikTok, a social media site popular with teenagers. But he added: ""Telegram has been described as the app of choice for extremists."" Telegram, which has half-a-billion users, is a messaging app, which also has ""channels"" allowing individuals to broadcast to an unlimited audience. Telegram has risen to global prominence as an app of choice to co-ordinate global protest movements; but has also been accused of not doing enough to purge extremist channels run by those involved with the so-called Islamic State group and the Capitol Hill riots. Campaign group Hope Not Hate and the Board of Deputies of British Jews had both said the free-to-use encrypted messaging service had ""facilitated and nurtured a sub-culture that cheerleads terrorists"", Sir Keir said. The messages shown to Sir Keir by Hope Not Hate, posted by anonymous Telegram users, include threats to ""kill all women"", ""kill politicians"" as well as homophobic, Islamophobic and racist abuse. Sir Keir said ""tough sanctions"" were needed - but the government's proposed legislation did not include criminal sanctions against the directors of online platforms. Mr Johnson said the government would look at ways to ""toughen up"" the law and promised to ""come down hard on those who irresponsibly allow dangerous and extremist content to permeate the internet"". He added: ""What we hope for also, is that no matter how tough the proposals we produce, that the opposition will support it."" Regulator Ofcom would have the power to levy fines of up to Â£18m or 10% of global profits, whichever is higher, on social media platforms which fail to comply with the new online safety laws. The regulator would also be given the power to block services from the UK if they are deemed to present a risk of significant harm to UK citizens. The bill also includes an option to introduce a new criminal offence for senior managers if further action is needed to ensure compliance - something Labour has been calling for. Asked if Mr Johnson was now backing criminal sanctions, a Downing Street spokesperson said the government was ""alive"" to the issue, adding: ""We will continue to listen and work with the companies involved."" Conservative MP and chairman of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport committee Julian Knight said a quicker timetable for the bill risked undermining scrutiny of it. ""We find ourselves in an unworkable situation where, at the whim of the prime minister at the despatch box, the process of scrutiny of this important piece of legislation to tackle online harms will be undermined. We need urgent clarity on this matter,"" said Mr Knight. By Alistair Coleman, BBC Monitoring Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer claimed that the messaging app Telegram is ""the app of choice"" for extremists. But is he right? Extremist content has been largely forced off mainstream social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, and terror groups have moved elsewhere in attempts to spread their ideologies. Telegram has half a billion users, the vast majority using the service in the way it was designed - to exchange messages, images and video with friends, family, and people with shared interests. In countries like Iran, it's one of the few platforms where people can speak freely about social issues and politics without fear of persecution. However, there are significant numbers who use Telegram to share extremist content and illegal pornography. Attracted by the platform's secret chats with end-to-end encryption and its seemingly relaxed content moderation policies, Telegram became a haven for jihadist groups, earning it the name ""Terrorgram"". Working with international law enforcement agencies, Telegram has been successful in eliminating most jihadist content. But other extreme content, including what might be defined as ""terrorist"" is still present. It's easy to find racism, sexist and homophobic abuse, anti-Semitism, neo-Nazism, violent imagery, and encouragement of criminal activity on Telegram from users in the UK and around the world. Telegram told the BBC that it was ""surprised"" by Sir Keir's statement, saying that ""calls for violence are expressly forbidden on Telegram"". ""Our moderators routinely remove content that violates this rule using a combination of proactive monitoring of public spaces and user reports,"" the Telegram statement concluded.

"Covid cases could hit 100,000 a day this winter - Javid","At a Downing Street news conference, Health Secretary Sajid Javid says Covid cases could reach 100,000 a day this winter Four million people in the UK have now had a Covid booster vaccine, the health secretary adds He also says the UK has bought 730,000 doses of two antiviral drugs that could help treat Covid - but they still need regulator approval And Mr Javid says ""it's a very fair point"", when asked why more MPs don't wear masks in the Commons A further 49,139 cases have been reported in the UK - meaning eight consecutive days of more than 40,000 cases Another 179 deaths within 28 days of a positive test have also been reported; deaths remain well below last winter's peak Health leaders say ministers' Covid Plan B, which would bring back social distancing rules, should be implemented to avoid a ""winter crisis"" Morocco has banned flights to and from the UK, Germany, and Netherlands because of Covid Edited by Owen Amos Our Covid-19 live page is about to close for the day - here are some of the main headlines:  And that concludes Sajid Javid's Downing Street news conference, which lasted about an hour. During it, he said the government was not complacent about rising Covid rates, was investing in new treatments, and was constantly reviewing the situation. There was, however, no sign than the ""Plan B"" of further restrictions is going to be introduced in England. Javid urged the public to get vaccinated and to take precautions - such as wearing masks - where possible, to stem the surge in infections expected over the winter. He warned daily cases could hit more than 100,000 - the latest figure is 49,139 - but he did say the UK had hit a milestone, with 4m booster jabs now delivered. In the final question of the news conference, Sajid Javid is asked by Sebastian Payne of the Financial Times whether, as Covid cases rise across the country, more Conservative MPs should wear masks in the House of Commons. ""I think that's a very fair point,"" he replies. ""As I say, we've all got our role to play in this and we the people standing on this stage play our public roles as a secretary of state, as someone in the NHS, as the head of UKHSA (UK Health Security Agency). ""We also have a role to play to set an example as private individuals as well - I think that's a very fair point and I'm sure a lot of people will have heard you."" Jenny Harries reminds people that there is a ânatural breakâ
coming up - with half term beginning next week for most schools in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. She says that with the break, and if people adopt behavioural changes and children come forward to get vaccinated, then the R rate can fall
below 1. That would mean each infected person infects, on average, less than one other person - meaning the pandemic is shrinking. Asked if people should have second thoughts about going to parties as the festive season approaches, Sajid Javid says the UK is ""heading back to normal"" - but is not there yet. He reiterates that there's a need to take precautions, such as wearing a mask in busy settings. He also recommends taking lateral flow tests before attending get-togethers, or visiting potentially vulnerable people. National Medical Director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, says there is not a number of daily cases, deaths, or hospital admissions that would automatically trigger further interventions - such as the""Plan B"" of extra restrictions in England. He says it is complex and there is a variety of things
that are looked at in a decision like this. Powis says they look at infection rates, vaccine
effectiveness and the number of admissions - and also what is happening with
other admissions such as flu. ""We do see geographical variation, that is typical of the
pandemic and it is possible that we will see that variation again. ""There is no one number to look at,"" he insists. The UK reported almost 50,000 cases on Wednesday - and as this chart shows, the seven-day average daily number is not far off the peak of last January. However, although they are increasing slightly, daily deaths are way below the peak of last winter - as this chart shows. Sajid Javid says the government is ""concerned"" over cases rising and the number of deaths. But vaccines are clearly working, and areestimated to have saved 130,000 lives, he adds. The health secretary urges the public to appeal to people who haven't had their jabs to do so - and get a flu vaccine ahead of winter. He later adds he expects there to be ""a lot more flu around"" this winter, compared to last. Sajid Javid is asked by Romilly Weeks from ITV whether the government is in danger of
ignoring warning signs. âI think the plan we have set out is taking into account the
situation,â he responds. âIn my remarks, the entire focus is on what we can do to
help ourselves, obviously the government has a huge role to play, the vaccine programme,
testing programme, but we need people to take up vaccines when offered, especially
boosters."" He again called on people to stick to a testing regime - and
to remember to isolate if they have tested positive. Javid said he has contingency measures ready if the situation
âbecame more challengingâ but says âwe are not at that point yetâ. As Sajid Javid's news conference continues, here's our graphic of the latest UK virus data, which was released at 4pm. The BBC's Sophie Hutchinson asks about theNHS Confederation's warningthat more needs to be done to cut Covid rates over the winter. Sajid Javid says current levels are not ""unsustainable"" and the extra support the NHS is getting is ""certainly helping"" - but the situation will be kept under review. National Medical Director of NHS England Steven Powis says that, with infection rates rising, hospital admissions will continue to rise. And other viruses are around, adding to pressure on medical staff, he adds. Like the health secretary, he also urges people to take precautions, such as wearing masks in crowded places, as well as getting vaccinated. Ruth in Cornwall asks the health secretary whether the government should make face masks mandatory in certain settings in England again. Javid says the government has set out a clear plan - and he still feels it was ""the right decision to start to learn to live with the virus"". But he says that when it comes to face coverings, everyone should
follow guidance and think about others around them, and the setting they are in. He adds that if the government needs to turn to plan B,
it would include making face masks mandatory in some settings - which may include
public buildings. UK Health Security Agency chief executive Jenny Harries says the high level of cases isn't yet being reflected in the number of daily deaths. The most recent seven-day average of daily deaths has been ""flat"" - but daily deaths are now ""moving in the wrong direction"", she says. The number of people in hospital is also seeing a ""steady increase"" as we approach winter - although we're well off last winter's peak, she adds. ""We must get the jab when the time comes, for covid or flu,"" the health secretary says. But he suggests other ""little steps"" to help reduce the spread of Covid - including:  Javid also suggests making rapid tests a part of your weekly
routine. ""A quarter of the positive cases we are identifying, come
from those lateral flow tests,"" he says. ""These little steps make a big difference."" The ""race between"" the virus and vaccines is narrowing, Sajid Javid says, adding that the government will redouble efforts to get people to get a jab. He urges people to ""take this huge step"" towards helping themselves and others. Booster injections are ""vital"" to keeping people safe over the next few months, Javid adds. The new Delta variant is spreading and, while there's no proof it poses a greater threat, there's a need to be ready for ""whatever's around the corner"", the health secretary says. He reveals thatfour million booster jabshave been given so far - that's up from the most recent figure of 3.8m. As we reported just after 17:00, the UK has announced new antiviral drug deals. ""We should be proud that the
UK is at the forefront of treatments,"" says the health secretary. ""Dexamethasone is estimated to have saved one million lives
across the world. Some of the most vulnerable patients across the NHS are
already benefitting from ronapreve. ""We are seeing promising developments around antivirals too.
They work by targeting the virus at the early stage and disrupting the way they
develop and multiply. ""I am pleased to announce we have signed two landmark deals
to supply hundreds of thousands of doses of two new antivirals. ""These
antivirals have the potential to speed up recovery time and to stop infections
from progressing. ""If they get MHRA approval then we can provide vulnerable patients
with vital protection this summer. I want to deploy them as quickly as
possible."" Sajid Javid says winter poses the ""greatest threat"" to the recovery from Covid, with cases rising. He adds that case numbers could go as high as 100,000 per day - but that the NHS is performing with ""distinction"".  The health secretary's news conference is now under way - stay tuned for the latest top lines... Molnupiravir is one of the antiviral drugs The UK government has announced deals for Covid-19 antivirals which it says could be groundbreaking this
winter. Antivirals are
treatments used to either treat those who are infected with a virus or protect high-risk people who may have been exposed to the virus. The two new treatments are molnupiravir from Merck (MSD) and PF-07321332/ritonavir from Pfizer. The two new antivirals are
expected to be given to those most at risk from the virus, helping reduce the
severity of symptoms and ease pressure on the NHS over winter, the government says. Both first need to be evaluated by the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A recent interim clinical trial resultssuggested that molnupiravir cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. Chair of the Antivirals Taskforce Eddie Gray said: ""This
is a very important development in our mission to find antivirals for those
exposed to Covid-19, supporting the renowned vaccination programme and the NHS
over the coming months."" The health secretary is now expected to start at 17:10 BST. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Deadly bomb blasts hit military bus in Damascus,"The bus was hit as it passed under Jisr al-Rais bridge A bomb attack on a military bus in central Damascus has killed 14 people, Syrian state media say. Two explosive devices attached to the vehicle blew up as it passed under Jisr al-Rais bridge during the morning rush hour,Sana news agency reported,external. Although Syria has been embroiled in civil war for a decade, such attacks in the capital are increasingly rare. Soon afterwards, army shellfire also reportedly killed at least 10 people in the opposition-held north-west. The region is the last stronghold of the rebel and jihadist groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad since 2011. The war has left at least 350,000 people dead, and caused half the population to flee their homes, including almost six million refugees abroad. Wednesday's bombing in Damascus was reportedly the deadliest in the city since March 2017, when 31 people were killed ina suicide attack at the main court complexthat was claimed by the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). ""I was sleeping when I heard a strong explosion. I woke up and saw a bus on fire, which came to a halt after hitting the sidewalk,"" Abu Ahmed, a fruit vendor at a market near the bridge, told AFP news agency. ""I later heard the sound of a second explosion, but this one was not as strong as the first one."" Video from the scene showed the charred remains of the bus, with smoke billowing from its broken windows as firefighters put out the flames. Sana said military engineers defused a third explosive device that had fallen from the vehicle. EXPLAINER:Why has the Syrian war lasted 10 years? CHILDREN OF IS:'It's a disaster we cannot deal with' Interior Minister Mohammed al-Rahman told state TV that security forces would ""pursue the terrorists who committed this heinous crime wherever they are"". No group has yet said it was behind the bombing, but suspicion will fall on IS, which has attacked military vehicles in the east of the country this year. This video can not be played Two children, a decade of war in Syria: Rahaf and Mustafa symbolise the suffering inflicted by Syria's war Four children and a female teacher were among the 10 people killed in the town of Ariha,external, in the north-western province of Idlib, according to the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets. Another 20 people were wounded, some of them critically, when shells struck main roads and a busy market while children were heading to school at the start of the day, the organisation said, blaming pro-government forces. ""When we arrived at the school and the students were there, the shelling and air strikes started,""a local teacher told Save the Children,external. ""The students were horrified, they started screaming, we didn't know what to do. We were worried the students would get injured as the buildings are not protected."" Shells struck residential areas and a busy market in Ariha as children were going to school The UN children's agency said Wednesday's violence was ""yet another reminder that the war in Syria has not come to an end"". ""Civilians, among them many children, keep bearing the brunt of a brutal decade-long conflict,"" it added. North-western Syria has seen sporadic violence since a ceasefire brokered in March 2020 by Turkey and Russia ended a government offensive. Turkey, which backs the opposition, and Russia, a key ally of Mr Assad, have deployed troops to the region in an attempt to prevent a major escalation.

Like the health secretary, he also urges people to take precautions, such as wearing masks in crowded places, as well as getting vaccinated. Ruth in Cornwall asks the health secretary whether the government should make face masks mandatory in certain settings in England again. Javid says the government has set out a clear plan - and he still feels it was ""the right decision to start to learn to live with the virus"". But he says that when it comes to face coverings, everyone should
follow guidance and think about others around them, and the setting they are in. He adds that if the government needs to turn to plan B,
it would include making face masks mandatory in some settings - which may include
public buildings. UK Health Security Agency chief executive Jenny Harries says the high level of cases isn't yet being reflected in the number of daily deaths. The most recent seven-day average of daily deaths has been ""flat"" - but daily deaths are now ""moving in the wrong direction"", she says. The number of people in hospital is also seeing a ""steady increase"" as we approach winter - although we're well off last winter's peak, she adds. ""We must get the jab when the time comes, for covid or flu,"" the health secretary says. But he suggests other ""little steps"" to help reduce the spread of Covid - including:  Javid also suggests making rapid tests a part of your weekly
routine. ""A quarter of the positive cases we are identifying, come
from those lateral flow tests,"" he says. ""These little steps make a big difference."" The ""race between"" the virus and vaccines is narrowing, Sajid Javid says, adding that the government will redouble efforts to get people to get a jab. He urges people to ""take this huge step"" towards helping themselves and others. Booster injections are ""vital"" to keeping people safe over the next few months, Javid adds. The new Delta variant is spreading and, while there's no proof it poses a greater threat, there's a need to be ready for ""whatever's around the corner"", the health secretary says. He reveals thatfour million booster jabshave been given so far - that's up from the most recent figure of 3.8m. As we reported just after 17:00, the UK has announced new antiviral drug deals. ""We should be proud that the
UK is at the forefront of treatments,"" says the health secretary. ""Dexamethasone is estimated to have saved one million lives
across the world. Some of the most vulnerable patients across the NHS are
already benefitting from ronapreve. ""We are seeing promising developments around antivirals too.
They work by targeting the virus at the early stage and disrupting the way they
develop and multiply. ""I am pleased to announce we have signed two landmark deals
to supply hundreds of thousands of doses of two new antivirals. ""These
antivirals have the potential to speed up recovery time and to stop infections
from progressing. ""If they get MHRA approval then we can provide vulnerable patients
with vital protection this summer. I want to deploy them as quickly as
possible."" Sajid Javid says winter poses the ""greatest threat"" to the recovery from Covid, with cases rising. He adds that case numbers could go as high as 100,000 per day - but that the NHS is performing with ""distinction"".  The health secretary's news conference is now under way - stay tuned for the latest top lines... Molnupiravir is one of the antiviral drugs The UK government has announced deals for Covid-19 antivirals which it says could be groundbreaking this
winter. Antivirals are
treatments used to either treat those who are infected with a virus or protect high-risk people who may have been exposed to the virus. The two new treatments are molnupiravir from Merck (MSD) and PF-07321332/ritonavir from Pfizer. The two new antivirals are
expected to be given to those most at risk from the virus, helping reduce the
severity of symptoms and ease pressure on the NHS over winter, the government says. Both first need to be evaluated by the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A recent interim clinical trial resultssuggested that molnupiravir cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. Chair of the Antivirals Taskforce Eddie Gray said: ""This
is a very important development in our mission to find antivirals for those
exposed to Covid-19, supporting the renowned vaccination programme and the NHS
over the coming months."" The health secretary is now expected to start at 17:10 BST. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Manager Bruce leaves Newcastle after takeover,"This video can not be played Steve Bruce speaks about his future at Newcastle after their 3-2 defeat by Tottenham in his 1,000th match as a manager. Manager Steve Bruce has left Newcastle United by mutual consent just 13 days afterthe Saudi Arabia-backed Â£305m takeoverof the club was completed. The 60-year-old took charge of his 1,000th match as a manager inSunday's 3-2 defeat by Tottenham- his only game as Magpies boss under the new owners. Bruce said there had been ""highs and lows"" and that he hoped the new owners could ""take the club forward"". Graeme Jones will take interim charge of the Premier League side. Newcastle said the appointment of a new manager ""will be announced in due course"". Bruce is understood to have received in the region of Â£8m after his contract was paid up in full. Who will be the next Newcastle boss? Assess the candidates and vote All the reaction to Bruce leaving Newcastle Newcastle ask fans not to wear 'culturally inappropriate' clothing The Tyneside club have made a winless start to the Premier League season and sit second from bottom after three draws from their opening eight games. Bruce was appointed Magpies manager in July 2019 and achieved finishes of 13th and 12th in his two full seasons in charge. ""I am grateful to everyone connected with Newcastle United for the opportunity to manage this unique football club,"" said Bruce.

""There have been highs and lows, but they have given everything even in difficult moments and should be proud of their efforts.

Bruce had a 27.4% win percentage from 84 league games at Newcastle, which was the ninth best compared to previous Magpies managers who had been in charge of at least 20 Premier League matches. A Newcastle statement said the club ""would like to place on record its gratitude to Steve for his contribution and wishes him well for the future"". The club's next game will be at Crystal Palace at 15:00 BST on Saturday, 23 October. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalBruce said: ""I think this might be my last job. ""It's not just about me; it's taken its toll on my whole family because they are all Geordies and I can't ignore that. ""They have been worried about meâ¦ especially my wife Jan. ""I'm 60 years old and I don't know if I want to put her through it again. We've got a good life so, yeah, this will probably be me done as a manager - until I get a phone call from a chairman somewhere asking if I can give them a hand. Never say never, I've learnt that."" He added: ""I wanted so badly to make it work. ""I was so proud to be manager of Newcastle United, even in the dark times, I was determined to keep going and to keep this club in the Premier League."" Newcastle forward Allan Saint-Maximin, who joined the Magpies in August 2019, is one of the side's key players and he said it had been an ""honour and a privilege"" to have Bruce as his coach. ""You are, without a doubt, one of the most gentle people that I have ever met in the world of football,""wrote Saint-Maximin on social media.,external ""You have been a man of your word, a caring man and a fair man who never hesitated to protect us. I will never forget how you treated me, for that I will be forever grateful."" Newcastle's record goalscorer Alan Shearer said Bruce's sacking felt ""inevitable"". But, having managed the club himself on an interim basis at the end of the 2008-09 season, Shearer added he felt some sympathy for those working under previous owner Mike Ashley. ""I think it was right for both parties,"" the former England striker told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""As tough as it will be, Steve's big enough and strong enough to know you have to take criticism when you don't win games. And he hasn't won any games this season. ""It was an almost impossible club to manage in the circumstances. Every manager who's been in over the last 14 years has found it very, very difficult.""

During his final game against Spurs, some Magpies fans sang, 'We want Brucey out' as they made the new owners aware about their feelings about his position. ""Fantastic news, I think every single Newcastle United fan is over the moon with this,"" supporter Alex Hurst from The True Faith podcast told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's been a long time coming, arguably it should have happened at least a week earlier but I think we're not going to worry too much about that now. ""It's a new era for the football club and it was essential that Steve Bruce was moved on."" He added: ""No wins this season and, quite simply, if you look at Steve Bruce's record this season but also over the last 38 games as a whole, I think they've won seven of those 38 games, very few football managers in any division in any country would be able to survive that sort of record. ""To put it simply, I think he was yesterday's man. He might have been a good manager 20 years ago but he's not any more."" Former Newcastle defender Steven Taylor spent 13 years at the club between 2003 and 2016 and he had sympathy for Bruce as well as other managers who had been at the club during Ashley's reign. ""The upstairs hierarchy were the ones that were controlling everything that was going on,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""There are previous managers that I've played under who didn't want to play certain players, they got told to play these players and that's how it was at the football club at the time. It has been difficult."" Ian Dennis - BBC Radio 5 Live senior football reporter It was always Steve Bruce's dream job to take charge of Newcastle United but he has received a lot of criticism from the supporters, a lot of abuse which I know he feels has gone too far at times. I think he is a realist. He would have said the takeover from a footballing sense is the best thing for Newcastle United Football Club in terms of the investment it will undoubtedly bring. I think he is also a realist in that he knew that it would probably mean that they'd want to bring in their own manager and I think in that sense what will be, will be. Yes he'll be disappointed, any manager would be to lose his job, but I think when he reflects there might be an element of relief as well because of the criticism and abuse that he has received, that he's no longer in the firing line. It became quite clear at the weekend that the supporters were not going to tolerate such a position for much longer, it's very very hard for any manager to survive in those sort of circumstances.

"People won't have to pay more to go green, says Kwarteng","The business secretary has denied that individuals will bear the cost of changing to greener ways of living. Kwasi Kwarteng said it was ""not true"" to say that the move to more environmentally friendly transport and energy production would ""cost us"". The government plans to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to reach a target of net zero by 2050. The Treasury has hinted tax rises may be necessary as revenues from fossil fuel-related activity dry up. Achieving net zero means the UK will no longer be adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without action on climate change, the world faces a hotter planet, rising sea levels and extreme weather. The Treasury said hitting the target would put pressure on public spending, but added ""the biggest impact"" came from ""the erosion of tax revenues from fossil fuel-related activity"". Last year, Â£37bn was raised through fuel duty and vehicle excise duty, but is believed the transition to electric vehicles could create a temporary tax vacuum by the 2040s, meaning new revenue-raising measures would be needed. A net-zero report by the Treasury said future governments ""may need to consider changes to existing taxes and new sources of revenue"" rather than relying on higher borrowing. UK sets out net zero plans for greenhouse gases What does net zero mean? How much do heat pumps cost and how do they work? It also warned policies to support the adoption of electric vehicles ""may disproportionately benefit"" richer people, with those on lower incomes potentially bearing the brunt of increased costs. ""As higher income households drive more and are likely to adopt EVs [electric vehicles] earlier, the costs and benefits of EV adoption are likely to fall on higher income households first,"" the Treasury report said. ""Conversely, any changes to the cost of running an internal combustion engine vehicle will fall disproportionately on lower-income households, so there could be a trade-off in some instances."" Asked on the BBC's Today programme if there was a danger that poorer people could lead to ""subsiding the green guilt of the rich"", Mr Kwarteng replied: ""No, I don't accept that at all."" He added that the transition to electric vehicles was ""successful and we should be doing it more rapidly"", but admitted there was still ""range anxiety"" over how far such vehicles could travel. Mr Kwarteng said up to Â£90bn by 2030 of private investment would help the country to source more energy from renewables, with ""evidence"" for such forecasts based on previous investments of Â£100bn being ploughed into offshore wind farms since 2012. ""It's not a heroic assumption to say that by 2030, we would have attracted an additional Â£90bn,"" he said. As well as plans to encourage more people to drive electric cars, the government is also going to offer subsidies of Â£5,000 from next April for people to switch from gas boilers to low-carbon heat pumps. Heat pumps extract warmth from the air, the ground or water - a bit like a fridge operating in reverse - and are powered by electricity. An air-source heat pump costs between Â£6,000 and Â£18,000, depending on the type installed and the size of a property. Although up to 25 million UK homes have gas boilers, the government's grants will fund just 90,000 pumps over three years. Critics have said the plans do not go far enough. Mr Kwarteng added the cost of heat pumps could ""come down"" as more companies began manufacturing them, which would see more people ""adopt them"". ""People will have seen that in their own lives. A few years ago with things like iPhones, at the beginning they were very, very expensive. Of course, the unit cost, as the private sector invests in producing these things, comes down,"" he said. The recently released iPhone 13 handset is currently priced at Â£779 onApple's website.,external Mr Kwarteng admitted it was a ""lot of money"" to install a heat pump, adding: ""No-one is saying we are imposing heat pumps on anybody.

Facebook fined Â£50m by UK competition watchdog,"Facebook has been fined Â£50.5m ($70m) by the UK's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which accuses it of deliberately breaking rules. The case related toFacebook's 2020 acquisition of Gif-sharing service Giphy,which is under investigation. The CMA said Facebook had not provided information, ignored many warnings, and committed a ""major breach"". The firm denies deliberately breaking rules. There are also reports that its parent company might change its name. Tech news site The Verge,externalrevealed the news about the firm - which owns the Facebook service itself, as well as WhatsApp, Instagram, Oculus VR, and other brands. The Â£50m fine the CMA handed Facebook is more than 150 times higher than the previous record handed down for similar offences, at Â£325,000. Speaking about its decision to fine the social media giant,the CMA said in a statement:,external""This is the first time a company has been found by the CMA to have breached an [order] by consciously refusing to report all the required information."" Giphy is widely used by Facebook's competitors to power animated Gif images used in social media apps, on mobile keyboards, and elsewhere online. That led to potential competition concerns. Facebook's Giphy takeover under investigation Facebook buys GIF-maker Giphy The CMA issued something called an ""initial enforcement order"", which limits how companies that are merging, but under investigation, operate. It is designed to keep the entities semi-separate and in competition with each other until the investigation is over. Facebook is obliged to provide updates and information to make clear how it is complying with the order. ""Given the multiple warnings it gave Facebook, the CMA considers that Facebook's failure to comply was deliberate,"" the CMA said. That ""fundamentally undermined its ability to prevent, monitor and put right any issues"". The fine for that offence is Â£50m. Separately, the CMA announced a Â£500,000 fine for Facebook changing its chief compliance officer - twice - ""without seeking consent first"". Facebook refutes the allegation that it deliberately broke rules, saying it had complied with the main obligations, and the row is instead about the details of how it did so. ""We strongly disagree with the CMA's unfair decision to punish Facebook for a best effort compliance approach, which the CMA itself ultimately approved. We will review the CMA's decision and consider our options,"" a spokesperson said. The Verge's report,externalsaying that Facebook plans to rebrand next week suggested that the new name will reflect Facebook's ambition to build the metaverse - the next version of the internet - rather than its traditional social media site roots. Earlier this week, the company announced it plans to hire 10,000 employees in the European Union to do just that. Facebook to hire 10,000 in EU to work on metaverse Apparently, it's the next big thing. What is the metaverse? The company's annual Connect conference, scheduled for 28 October, may provide the backdrop for such an announcement. It also comes after weeks of news stories about Facebook's alleged shortcomings, fuelled by internal leaks by whistleblower Frances Haugen, who gave evidence to the US Congress. Asked about the potential name change, a Facebook spokesperson said: ""We don't comment on rumour or speculation."" A Facebook name change would actually make a lot of sense. When Facebook started out, there was no real distinction between Facebook the platform and Facebook the company. But as Facebook has snapped up companies like Instagram and WhatsApp, the name has become confusing. And with the number of people who actually use Facebook declining in many countries in the West, it's likely the name will become increasingly divorced from the growth areas of the company. That said, it's hard to fathom why Facebook would think now is a good time to change its name. Facebook is currently in a whirlwind of negative press attention over leaks from whistleblower Frances Haugen. This video can not be played Watch: ""The buck stops with Mark"" Rather than simply apologise, as Facebook often does, it has adopted a different media strategy. The social network has come out guns blazing, rejecting Ms Haugen's testimony, and claiming both her and the media have misrepresented the documents she leaked. Changing the company's name, at this point, would seem like it is doing so because the brand is toxic. Perhaps Facebook has decided to change tack, or this was something planned for a while, or they feel they've been left with little option? Perhaps the story isn't true? Whatever the truth, by not denying this story, Facebook has fuelled speculation that the company is in crisis mode.

How smart appliances can help fix the energy gap Kerry says Glasgow last best hope for the world With the COP26 climate conference just over a week away, there is already a huge focus on the carbon-cutting ambitions of the biggest emitters. But despite the flurry of net zero emission goals and the increased pledges of many countries, some of the biggest oil, gas and coal producers have not set out plans for the rapid reductions in fossil fuels that scientists say are necessary to limit temperatures in coming years. Earlier this year, researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)warned of the dangers for humanityof allowing temperatures to rise by more than 1.5C this century. To keep under this threshold will require cuts in carbon emissions of around 45% by 2030 based on 2010 levels. An oil rig sets sail - oil production is set to increase over the next decade But instead of curbing carbon, many of the biggest emitting countries are also planning to significantly increase their production of fossil fuels, according to the UN. The production gap report finds that countries plan to produce around 110% more fossil fuel than would be compatible with a 1.5C temperature rise by the end of this century. The plans are around 45% more than what's needed to keep the temperature rise to 2C. According to the study, coal production will drop but gas will increase the most over the next 20 years, to levels that are simply incompatible with the Paris agreement. The report profiles 15 major production countries including Australia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the US and UK. Most governments continue to provide significant policy support for fossil fuel production, the authors say. Fracking has seen huge increases in oil and gas production in the US ""The research is clear: global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5C,"" says Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author on the report from the Stockholm Environment Institute. ""However, governments continue to plan for and support levels of fossil fuel production that are vastly in excess of what we can safely burn."" While countries have devoted far more of their recovery spending after the Covid pandemic towards fossil fuel activities, there are some positives when it comes to financing. Funding for oil, coal and gas from multilateral banks has decreased significantly in recent years - and also from some of the richer nations. ""This report shows, once again, a simple but powerful truth: we need to stop pumping oil and gas from the ground if we are to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" said Andrea Meza, Costa Rica's minister for environment and energy. ""We must cut with both hands of the scissors, addressing demand and supply of fossil fuels simultaneously. That is why, together with Denmark, we are leading the creation of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance to put an end to the expansion of fossil fuel extraction, plan a just transition for workers and start winding down existing production in a managed way.""

Rise in cost of living slows in September,"Price rises dipped slightly in September as the economy continued to reopen, according to official figures. The increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, fell to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in August. Higher prices for transport were the biggest contributor to price rises. It comes after the Bank of England warned it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation, suggesting interest rates may rise soon. The inflation rate fell back slightly last month, partly due to lower prices in the hospitality sector. Prices in restaurants and cafes rose less this summer than the last, when the government's Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running,the Office for National Statistics said.,external Under the scheme, diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Mike Hardie, head of prices at the ONS, said: ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year. ""The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer."" Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Although price rises edged lower in September, the increase of 3.1% remains far above the Bank of England's target of 2%. Last month, transport costs made the biggest contribution to price increases. Average petrol prices stood at 134.9 pence a litre, compared with 113.3 pence a litre in September of 2020, when travel was reduced under travel restrictions. The ONS added that the September 2021 price for fuel was the highest recorded since September 2013. A rise in used car prices, which were 2.9% higher in September than in August, also contributed to higher transport costs. Other factors such as demand for oil and gas rising around the world have pushed up the price of energy. Meanwhile, there are shortages and bottlenecks affecting the availability of some important goods like computer chips, which are also increasing costs for businesses. Why is the cost of living going up? Bank of England says it will act on inflation Food price rises are terrifying, warns industry Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that further price increases were expected in the coming months ""with the increase in the energy price cap, partial reversal of the VAT reductions for hospitality and tourism and persistent supply chain disruption"". He warned that rising inflation could disrupt UK's economic recovery by squeezing people's spending power and companies' profit margins. Everyone is affected by rising costs, but if you're on a low income or don't have savings to fall back on, you're more likely to feel the impact. And if your pay isn't going up in line with price rises, you may notice a fall in the ""real value"" of your wages - what you earn buys less. ""We're just starting to notice the pinch a little bit,"" Ruth Holroyd told BBC Breakfast. She usually takes on the task of doing the family's weekly shop. ""I've noticed that the prices are higher for the overall shop, but where prices stay the same for things like grapes and strawberries that come in a punnet, the punnets have shrunk, so you don't get as much."" She is mostly worried about the impact of rising energy bills. She was previously a People's Energy customer, but the firm ceased trading earlier in September, collapsing because of rising gas prices. Ruth expects that the family's energy bill will double from Â£120 to Â£250 per month. A bit of inflation is considered to be a good thing. If prices were falling, then people might delay buying non-essential items in the hope of getting them cheaper. But if prices rise too quickly, it's seen as a sign that the economy is running into difficulties. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday that price rises were a ""a real cause of some concern"", adding that the government wanted inflation rates to be lower. He suggested that price increases were partially due to higher demand as the economy reopens. ""When you see quite strong economic growth, there is always the danger you will have inflation. Now the critical question is, how long is that inflation going to last for?"" he said. He added that he had recently spoken with the governor of the Bank of England and that it was ""hopeful"" price rises would be contained. Referring to the new figures out on Wednesday, Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We can't stand down our concerns about inflation just because this number was a bit lower than expected. ""Since September, there's been a big rise in natural gas prices, a rise in petrol prices and global oil prices and from the Bank of England's point of view, we've also seen more people start to get worried about inflation."" She warned that the economy was not ""out of the woods yet"". Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Sunday that the Bank of England ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4% before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. Governor Andrew Bailey's warning on Sunday is seen as his clearest hint yet that interest rates will rise. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in a bid to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In principle, it means that when borrowing costs rises, such as when mortgages become more expensive, people spend less and prices are driven down. Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought. The slight easing of inflation in September comes more as a temporary respite in the surging cost of living than a sign that it's over. Last month's figures compared August with a year before, when prices in restaurants and hotels were artificially low because of the government's Eat out to Help Out scheme. This month's figures, by contrast, compare prices now with where they were in September 2020, when the scheme was no longer operating. The average rise in the cost of living of 3.1% masked sharp price rises in items such as air fares, up 9.7%, or carpets, up 9.6%. And there are signs of further inflationary pressure coming down the line, with manufacturers paying 11.4% more for raw materials and prices of goods leaving the factory gate up 6.7% - the biggest rise in a decade. An interest rate rise by the end of the year, with rates continuing to rise in the new year, still looks more likely than not. Why are prices rising in the UK?

LiveLiveJohnson faces PMQs and leads tributes to Tory ministerLess than a minute ago,"Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer have faced each other across the Commons despatch box for PMQs The PM said the Online Safety Bill will be introduced by Christmas The bill would bring in new powers to tackle online abuse MPs have called for the legislation to be speeded up following the killing of Sir David Amess MP The NHS Confederation says ministers should implement their ""Plan B"" Covid strategy and reintroduce some restrictions in England to avoid a winter crisis in the NHS The Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has said there are no plans to introduce new restrictions but the government is continually assessing the data The National Care Forum says community care services in England are being forced to turn patients away because of staff shortages MPs have paid tribute to former minister James Brokenshire, who died earlier this month Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Weâre going to bring our coverage of this weekâs Prime Ministerâs
Questions to a close. As we mentioned earlier, the Health Secretary Sajid Javid will hold a press conference in Downing Street at 17:00 BST on the Covid booster vaccination programme and the procurement of antiviral drugs. You will find our live coverage and analysis here as it happens. With you on board for PMQs were Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel and Paul Seddon. Thanks for following along with us today. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News A word we heard throughout today's PMQs was âcollegiate.â Both the prime minister and the Labour leader emphasised they
would like to work together on tackling certain issues like online abuse,
extremism and terrorism, and male violence against women. Coming down the road, however, will no doubt be further debate
about how this is achieved. Particularly contentious are issues like whether cracking down on
anonymity online could play a role - something some MPs have called for this
week, but something that Sir Keir Starmer said would not have prevented
recent acts of terrorism. Similarly, we can expect sanctions for tech companies who fail to
crack down on abuse and extremism to be a theme of debate for weeks to come. As we wind down our coverage from the Commons for today, here's a quick recap today's PMQs Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Tributes to Sir David Amess MP During PMQs, Boris Johnson said his party has invested ""record sums"" to tackle counter-terrorism. But, the government is facing a difficult dilemma over its controversial counter-extremism programme called Prevent. News that the suspect held in custody overthe killing of MP Sir David Amesshad earlier been referred to this scheme has reinforced calls for it to be overhauled and made ""more robust"". What is the point, some argue, in referring people to this Â£40m a year programme - which aims to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting them - if they may then go on to commit murder? But others argue that hardening it up with more involvement of police and MI5 officers will simply scare away the very people who currently agree to take part in its voluntary de-radicalisation course, the Channel scheme.

Theresa May watches Prince Charles knight her husband - wearing the same green coat she had on in the Commons. Away from Parliament, Theresa May's husband Philip May has been given a knighthood for his ""political service"". When Mrs May stepped down as prime minister she described her husband as her ""greatest supporter and my closest companion"". At the same event former Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry was made a Dame Commander by the Prince of Wales. And Steven Knight, who created the drama Peaky Blinders and wrote the film Spencer about Diana, Princess of Wales was made an MBE. Allow Twitter content?

Theresa May, who worked with James Brokenshire during her time as home secretary before appointing him in her own cabinet, calls him a ""remarkable man, an outstanding minister, a great constituency member of parliament and a true friend"". The former prime minister praises his work in government, saying how much he ""understood the importance of the decisions he was making"", and ""cared about people"" affected. And she says he was always helping his own constituents when he could. But he wasn't just ""a hard working, workaholic"", says May. He was ""great fun"" and a ""loving family man"". She recalls his concern about how his cancer diagnosis would impact his wife and family - who are in the Commons public gallery to hear the tributes. She concludes: ""The government is the poorer for his loss, this parliament is poorer for his loss and our country is the poorer for his loss."" Sir Keir Starmer begins his own tribute. ""One of first things you learn in Parliament is that there are not many glamorous roles in opposition. ""No one gives you a guide book - you can ask older wiser heads - but generally you are on your own."" However he tells MPs there is ""one little known exception to this rule, a secret in Westminster"". ""That is when you shadow a minister of such decency and with such a sense of fair play that they reach out across the divide and provide helpful pointers. ""So it was for me."" He tells MPs that when he shadowed him as immigration minister, James Brokenshire willingly offered him advice and support. He says Brokenshire was a friend to many in Parliament and that his family should be ""enormously proud"". Opening the tributes, the prime minister says James Brokenshire's death was ""tragically early"" and came whilst he was in ""the prime of his life"". Boris Johnson pays tribute to his work to reduce the ""stigma"" surrounding lung cancer, the disease that claimed his life. He says he was a ""gentleman politician"" who served in some of the most ""sensitive and demanding"" positions in government. He adds that his lawyerly ""diligence"" and ""composure"" were valuable assets in ministerial office - and praises him as ""unflappable, earnest, and sincere"". ""We can only imagine how much more he would have done if he had been given the chance,"" he adds. After PMQs ends, MPs observe a minute's silence in memory of James Brokenshire.  Tory Shailesh Vara has the final question and says while the focus since Sir David's death had been on the security of MPs,  one aspect has been overlooked - their staff. ""It is our staff that are on the front line, receiving abusive emails and correspondents, and taking the abusive phone calls,"" he adds. Vara says staff are ""simply trying to earn a living"" and calls on the PM to ""give them the credit they deserve"". Johnson says his colleague spoke for everyone in the Commons with his words. ""It is our staff, case workers and office managers who have to deal with anger and intemperant abuse and they cope with it magnificently,"" he says. He concludes that he ""thoroughly echoes, supports and concurs"" with Vara. Labour's Colleen Fletcher says a hospital in her constituency has seen ""more than 600 attacks on staff"" and that workers have resorted to wearing body cameras to deter attacks. ""It simply isn't right that doctors and nurses have to go to such lengths to feel safe at work,"" she says and asks the PM what steps he will take to ""better protect NHS heroes"". Boris Johnson replies that the government has ""toughened sentences for those who assault or harass public servants"". After paying tribute to the two MPs lost over recess, Labour's Virendra Sharma points to the the rising bills for heating, food and fuel, saying they are increasing ""at staggering speed"". The MP asks Johnson whether he will reinstate the ""lifeline"" uplift in universal credit that was scrapped earlier this month, given the ""crisis"" in living costs. The PM says the government is taking a number of measures to tackle the issue, such as increasing the warm homes allowance. But he says the ""most important thing"" happening in the country is wages are going up and  there is a ""huge jobs boom thanks to policies of this government"". Conservative MP Mary Robinson asks Boris Johnson whether thinks Greater Manchester Police should urgently review its ""internal culture"". The force is in special measures - and she says the local newspaper has described a ""culture of denial and secrecy"" at the force. She also calls for more action to help whistleblowers. The PM says the people of Manchester ""deserve better"" from the force - and people should have the confidence to speak up against wrongdoing. However, he says this is primarily the responsibility of Greater Manchester's Labour mayor, Andy Burnham. Conservative Brendan Clarke-Smith says he understands the need to build more houses but adds that his local constituents are ""concerned about over-intensive developments"". He asks the PM to confirm the that number of houses set to be built in his Bassetlaw constituency will be a minimum of 4,896 not 10,000 ""as claimed by the Labour-run council"". Boris Johnson says the MP is right and that the government is determined to ""build the houses people need"". Tory MP Anthony Mangnall says the fishing community in his constituency is looking forward to benefits from the government's ""levelling up"" plans. But he says they are also waiting for their share of the post-EU Â£100m fisheries scheme and calls on the PM to ""reaffirm his commitment to our coastal communities and our fishing sector"". Johnson says the government will continue to support fishing and seafood business across the country, and says a further Â£100m would be made available. The SNP's Westminster leader is up next, and asks about the UK's government's recent decision not to select acarbon capture and storage facility in Aberdeenfor funding. Struggling with a sore throat, he says this was a ""devastating blow"" to the renewable energy sector in Scotland, ahead of this month's COP 26 summit in Glasgow. Boris Johnson says the government ""absolutely committed"" to helping industry decarbonise. But following up, Blackford says the UK government is ""holding back"" the development of carbon capture, and proving an ""active barrier"" in the development of renewable energy. The prime minister rejects this, saying the government is putting ""huge sums"" into clean energy. Conservative Crispin Blunt urges the PM to ""cut through"" barriers to research into the drug psilocybin which he says has the potential to help people suffering with depression, trauma and addiction. Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug found in magic mushrooms. Boris Johnson says the government is considering the Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs's advice on research and promises to ""get back"" to the MP. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The exchanges between Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson have been
much less lively than usual. Both leaders are dressed in black ties and have reflected on
parliamentâs continuous mourning following the killing of Sir David Amess MP on
Friday. As a result, both appeared to try and strike a more constructive
and âcollegiateâ tone than the usual jibes - and often personal criticisms -
that weâre used to seeing at PMQs. Sir Keir did criticise the prime minister, however, when Boris
Johnson accused Labour of opposing legislation to block the early release of
terrorist offenders from prison - saying that after the week that had just
passed he did not want to centre âthat kind of knockabout.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical adviceBuckingham Palace says she has ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"".","The Queen was pictured on Tuesday evening, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle The Queen has cancelled a trip to Northern Ireland and has ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"", Buckingham Palace says. The 95-year-old monarch will remain at Windsor Castle but is still expected to attend the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow later this month. The Queen is in ""good spirits"" but ""disappointed"" that the visit cannot go ahead, the palace said. She was due to begin the two-day trip on Wednesday. The nation's longest-reigning monarch has attended a series of events in recent days, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening. Queen declines Oldie of the Year award Queen 'irritated' by climate change inaction Earlier in the day, she held two audiences via video link, greeting the Japanese ambassador Hajime Hayashi and the EU ambassador Joao de Almeida. On Monday, she held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand, and at the weekend, she attended the races at Ascot. It was revealed on Tuesday that the Queen had declined the Oldie of the Year award, from the magazine of the same name, saying: ""You are only as old as you feel"". A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days. ""Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow. ""The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and looks forward to visiting in the future."" The Queen's decision is understood to be unrelated to coronavirus. Buckingham Palace is keen not to cause any alarm and has stressed that the Queen has ""reluctantly accepted"" the advice of doctors to rest for the next few days. She has had a busy schedule of engagements over the past couple of weeks that would test the resilience of many people far younger than her. I saw her last Tuesday at an event at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time she had used a walking stick in public. She also took a shorter route into the Abbey. We were told this was ""for her own comfort."" But she still looked incredibly well and engaged for a 95-year-old. It is clear though that getting older takes its toll on us all and the Queen's diary will be carefully managed going forward. The Queen had been due to arrive in Hillsborough in County Down on Wednesday afternoon and attend a church service marking the centenary of the formation of Northern Ireland in Armagh tomorrow. An advance team was already in Northern Ireland making preparations for the two-day visit. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales was also at Windsor Castle on Wednesday for an investiture ceremony where the chef and TV presenter Mary Berry was made Dame Commander. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,said on Twitter,external: ""We thank Her Majesty for her good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and trust that she will keep well and benefit from a period of rest. ""It is always a joy to have Her Majesty in Royal Hillsborough and we look forward to a further visit in the near future."" Wishing her well, Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the Queen had been ""a source of great comfort during Northern Ireland's darkest days and provided lasting leadership as we moved into a new era for all our people"". Prince Charles held the investiture ceremony for Dame Mary Berry on Wednesday Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wished the Queen ""all the very best as she takes a few days' rest"". Church leaders in Northern Ireland said in a joint statement that they were sorry she would not attend the Service of Reconciliation and Hope in Armagh, and acknowledged ""the significance of her commitment to the work of peace and reconciliation, which has meant a great deal to people throughout this island"". The Queen first travelled to Northern Ireland in 1945, just after the end of World War Two, when she was a princess. If it had gone ahead, this week's trip would have been her 26th visit. Royal visits to Northern Ireland during its centenary year have included the first in line to the throne, Prince Charles who went to Belfast in May, and Prince William who visited Londonderry in September.

Ex-German troops arrested over alleged terror plot,"Prosecutors say the accused wanted to fight in Yemen, which has been gripped by civil war for years Two former German soldiers have been arrested on suspicion of trying to form a terrorist mercenary force to fight in Yemen's civil war, prosecutors say. Arend-Adolf G and Achim A face terrorism charges after police raids in southern Germany on Wednesday. They allegedly planned to recruit up to 150 men for a private army made up of former police officers and soldiers. They wanted to offer their services to Saudi Arabia's government for illegal missions in Yemen, prosecutors said. Yemen has been racked by a civil war between the Saudi Arabia-backed internationally recognised government and the armed Houthi movement since 2014. Saudi Arabia entered the civil war in 2015 shortly after the capture of the capital, Sanaa, by the Houthis, who are supported by Iran. EXPLAINER:Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? PROFILE:The rise of Yemen's Houthi rebels The accused former soldiers wanted Saudi Arabia to finance their private operations in Yemen, prosecutors in Germany said. The men tried to approach Saudi Arabian government agencies but they received no response and their efforts were unsuccessful. In a statement, federal prosecutors outlined extensive and serious allegations against the two ""ringleaders"", who had ""military knowledge and skills"". The prosecutors allege that Arend-Adolf G and Achim A decided to set up a mercenary force under their exclusive command at the start of 2021. They planned to pay each member of their unit a wage of about â¬40,000 (Â£33,700; $46,400) a month for their services, prosecutors said. Arend-Adolf G had allegedly already tried to recruit at least seven people. Germany's Spiegel magazine, which first reported the arrests, said the mercenary force was supposed to attack and capture areas held by the Houthi rebels in Yemen. Arend-Adolf G and Achim A ""expected civilians to be killed and injured in connection with fighting"" in Yemen, prosecutors said. Prosecutors also suspect the accused men wanted to advertise their military service for deployments in other conflicts. Citing sources, Spiegel said a tip from Germany's Military Counter-Intelligence Service (MAD) put the investigators on the trail of the men. One of the accused was arrested in Munich and the other in Germany's south-western Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald district. Their apartments in Bavaria and Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg were searched. The former soldiers are expected to appear in court on Wednesday for a hearing about pre-trial detention.

Afghan refugees declaring themselves homeless,"Afghan refugees have been living in hotels for two months Dozens of Afghan families staying in hotels as part of a scheme to resettle them are declaring themselves homeless. More than 200 families have asked councils in London for emergency accommodation. They are concerned that the Home Office scheme they are currently part of could see them moved to anywhere in the UK and away from family and friends. London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs, says people should stay with the government scheme. The organisation found 89% of the 204 families who have registered as homeless were unsure whether they are on the resettlement scheme. It said if they leave the scheme and sign on with the councils, they would lose all support provided by the Home Office and could still be placed in temporary accommodation outside of their chosen area. How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Where will resettled Afghans live in the UK? Afghans who worked for UK can stay permanently Government sorry for 'short notice' over Afghans Darren Rodwell of London Councils is urging all families in hotels to wait for clarification. ""The last thing we want is vulnerable people placed in more vulnerable communities,"" he said. But some refugees believe they may not qualify for the scheme because a family member holds a British passport. They think leaving the scheme is a safer option because they can sign on to council lists sooner, and even if they are moved temporarily away by councils, they could ultimately be moved back to the capital once a permanent place is found. What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years The frenzied final hours in the Afghan palace A new order begins under Taliban rule The city is already facing a housing crisis with about 165,000 people living in temporary accommodation organised by their borough. The Home Office Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme's policy states families can be placed anywhere in the UK. If families leave their hotels, they will lose Home Office support. Refugees have also said they are frustrated with the slow pace of the scheme and a lack of communication. Said Shinwari is a British citizen Said Shinwari, who is a British citizen after previously working in the UK for more than 20 years, returned with his wife and eight children when the Taliban took control of their town. He has been staying in hotels for nearly two months and is grateful for the help he has received. However, he is considering registering as homeless in the hope of accessing emergency accommodation. As he worked in London for 20 years and has family in the capital, he wants to be housed there. ""I am concerned about my family and children because they are just inside the room. They need to go to school,"" he said. Mr Shinwari says he has had very little communication from the government despite numerous attempts to contact officials. Harrow Council has received 10 applications and has moved five families into emergency accommodation. Councillor Peymana Assad, also an Afghan refugee, said the applications were putting pressure on the council, which has very little housing stock available. Ms Assad said she believes the problem is only going to get worse. ""We have such a large Afghan community already. We understand that we're going to have more cases come to us with more families leaving hotels,"" she said. ""We need the Home Office to communicate with Afghan refugees to give them clarity as to how the process is actually going to work. The council needs this too."" The Home Office said the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities (DLUHC) was responsible for British nationals. In a statement the DLUHC said: ""Through the effort and support of local councils, thousands of people were swiftly evacuated by our Armed Forces and have now been warmly welcomed to the UK and are being provided with permanent homes as quickly as possible."" ""Those resettling here have access to essential provision, healthcare, education, and Universal Credit, while we arrange further wrap around support to enable these families to build a successful life in the UK.""

LiveLiveJohnson faces PMQs and leads tributes to Tory minister2 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer have faced each other across the Commons despatch box for PMQs The PM said the Online Safety Bill will be introduced by Christmas The bill would bring in new powers to tackle online abuse MPs have called for the legislation to be speeded up following the killing of Sir David Amess MP The NHS Confederation says ministers should implement their ""Plan B"" Covid strategy and reintroduce some restrictions in England to avoid a winter crisis in the NHS The Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has said there are no plans to introduce new restrictions but the government is continually assessing the data The National Care Forum says community care services in England are being forced to turn patients away because of staff shortages MPs have paid tribute to former minister James Brokenshire, who died earlier this month Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Weâre going to bring our coverage of this weekâs Prime Ministerâs
Questions to a close. As we mentioned earlier, the Health Secretary Sajid Javid will hold a press conference in Downing Street at 17:00 BST on the Covid booster vaccination programme and the procurement of antiviral drugs. You will find our live coverage and analysis here as it happens. With you on board for PMQs were Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel and Paul Seddon. Thanks for following along with us today. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News A word we heard throughout today's PMQs was âcollegiate.â Both the prime minister and the Labour leader emphasised they
would like to work together on tackling certain issues like online abuse,
extremism and terrorism, and male violence against women. Coming down the road, however, will no doubt be further debate
about how this is achieved. Particularly contentious are issues like whether cracking down on
anonymity online could play a role - something some MPs have called for this
week, but something that Sir Keir Starmer said would not have prevented
recent acts of terrorism. Similarly, we can expect sanctions for tech companies who fail to
crack down on abuse and extremism to be a theme of debate for weeks to come. As we wind down our coverage from the Commons for today, here's a quick recap today's PMQs Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Tributes to Sir David Amess MP During PMQs, Boris Johnson said his party has invested ""record sums"" to tackle counter-terrorism. But, the government is facing a difficult dilemma over its controversial counter-extremism programme called Prevent. News that the suspect held in custody overthe killing of MP Sir David Amesshad earlier been referred to this scheme has reinforced calls for it to be overhauled and made ""more robust"". What is the point, some argue, in referring people to this Â£40m a year programme - which aims to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting them - if they may then go on to commit murder? But others argue that hardening it up with more involvement of police and MI5 officers will simply scare away the very people who currently agree to take part in its voluntary de-radicalisation course, the Channel scheme.

Theresa May, who worked with James Brokenshire during her time as home secretary before appointing him in her own cabinet, calls him a ""remarkable man, an outstanding minister, a great constituency member of parliament and a true friend"". The former prime minister praises his work in government, saying how much he ""understood the importance of the decisions he was making"", and ""cared about people"" affected. And she says he was always helping his own constituents when he could. But he wasn't just ""a hard working, workaholic"", says May. He was ""great fun"" and a ""loving family man"". She recalls his concern about how his cancer diagnosis would impact his wife and family - who are in the Commons public gallery to hear the tributes. She concludes: ""The government is the poorer for his loss, this parliament is poorer for his loss and our country is the poorer for his loss."" Sir Keir Starmer begins his own tribute. ""One of first things you learn in Parliament is that there are not many glamorous roles in opposition. ""No one gives you a guide book - you can ask older wiser heads - but generally you are on your own."" However he tells MPs there is ""one little known exception to this rule, a secret in Westminster"". ""That is when you shadow a minister of such decency and with such a sense of fair play that they reach out across the divide and provide helpful pointers. ""So it was for me."" He tells MPs that when he shadowed him as immigration minister, James Brokenshire willingly offered him advice and support. He says Brokenshire was a friend to many in Parliament and that his family should be ""enormously proud"". Opening the tributes, the prime minister says James Brokenshire's death was ""tragically early"" and came whilst he was in ""the prime of his life"". Boris Johnson pays tribute to his work to reduce the ""stigma"" surrounding lung cancer, the disease that claimed his life. He says he was a ""gentleman politician"" who served in some of the most ""sensitive and demanding"" positions in government. He adds that his lawyerly ""diligence"" and ""composure"" were valuable assets in ministerial office - and praises him as ""unflappable, earnest, and sincere"". ""We can only imagine how much more he would have done if he had been given the chance,"" he adds. After PMQs ends, MPs observe a minute's silence in memory of James Brokenshire.  Tory Shailesh Vara has the final question and says while the focus since Sir David's death had been on the security of MPs,  one aspect has been overlooked - their staff. ""It is our staff that are on the front line, receiving abusive emails and correspondents, and taking the abusive phone calls,"" he adds. Vara says staff are ""simply trying to earn a living"" and calls on the PM to ""give them the credit they deserve"". Johnson says his colleague spoke for everyone in the Commons with his words. ""It is our staff, case workers and office managers who have to deal with anger and intemperant abuse and they cope with it magnificently,"" he says. He concludes that he ""thoroughly echoes, supports and concurs"" with Vara. Labour's Colleen Fletcher says a hospital in her constituency has seen ""more than 600 attacks on staff"" and that workers have resorted to wearing body cameras to deter attacks. ""It simply isn't right that doctors and nurses have to go to such lengths to feel safe at work,"" she says and asks the PM what steps he will take to ""better protect NHS heroes"". Boris Johnson replies that the government has ""toughened sentences for those who assault or harass public servants"". After paying tribute to the two MPs lost over recess, Labour's Virendra Sharma points to the the rising bills for heating, food and fuel, saying they are increasing ""at staggering speed"". The MP asks Johnson whether he will reinstate the ""lifeline"" uplift in universal credit that was scrapped earlier this month, given the ""crisis"" in living costs. The PM says the government is taking a number of measures to tackle the issue, such as increasing the warm homes allowance. But he says the ""most important thing"" happening in the country is wages are going up and  there is a ""huge jobs boom thanks to policies of this government"". Conservative MP Mary Robinson asks Boris Johnson whether thinks Greater Manchester Police should urgently review its ""internal culture"". The force is in special measures - and she says the local newspaper has described a ""culture of denial and secrecy"" at the force. She also calls for more action to help whistleblowers. The PM says the people of Manchester ""deserve better"" from the force - and people should have the confidence to speak up against wrongdoing. However, he says this is primarily the responsibility of Greater Manchester's Labour mayor, Andy Burnham. Conservative Brendan Clarke-Smith says he understands the need to build more houses but adds that his local constituents are ""concerned about over-intensive developments"". He asks the PM to confirm the that number of houses set to be built in his Bassetlaw constituency will be a minimum of 4,896 not 10,000 ""as claimed by the Labour-run council"". Boris Johnson says the MP is right and that the government is determined to ""build the houses people need"". Tory MP Anthony Mangnall says the fishing community in his constituency is looking forward to benefits from the government's ""levelling up"" plans. But he says they are also waiting for their share of the post-EU Â£100m fisheries scheme and calls on the PM to ""reaffirm his commitment to our coastal communities and our fishing sector"". Johnson says the government will continue to support fishing and seafood business across the country, and says a further Â£100m would be made available. The SNP's Westminster leader is up next, and asks about the UK's government's recent decision not to select acarbon capture and storage facility in Aberdeenfor funding. Struggling with a sore throat, he says this was a ""devastating blow"" to the renewable energy sector in Scotland, ahead of this month's COP 26 summit in Glasgow. Boris Johnson says the government ""absolutely committed"" to helping industry decarbonise. But following up, Blackford says the UK government is ""holding back"" the development of carbon capture, and proving an ""active barrier"" in the development of renewable energy. The prime minister rejects this, saying the government is putting ""huge sums"" into clean energy. Conservative Crispin Blunt urges the PM to ""cut through"" barriers to research into the drug psilocybin which he says has the potential to help people suffering with depression, trauma and addiction. Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug found in magic mushrooms. Boris Johnson says the government is considering the Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs's advice on research and promises to ""get back"" to the MP. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The exchanges between Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson have been
much less lively than usual. Both leaders are dressed in black ties and have reflected on
parliamentâs continuous mourning following the killing of Sir David Amess MP on
Friday. As a result, both appeared to try and strike a more constructive
and âcollegiateâ tone than the usual jibes - and often personal criticisms -
that weâre used to seeing at PMQs. Sir Keir did criticise the prime minister, however, when Boris
Johnson accused Labour of opposing legislation to block the early release of
terrorist offenders from prison - saying that after the week that had just
passed he did not want to centre âthat kind of knockabout.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Average cash withdrawal climbs to Â£80,"People are taking out more money when they visit ATMs, with the average amount climbing more than Â£10 to just under Â£80 in the last two years. But they're using cash machines 40% less than before and withdrawing Â£44 a month less. Withdrawals are now nearly Â£100m less a day than in 2019, said cash machine network Link. ""Covid has turbocharged the switch to digital,"" said Nick Quin, head of financial inclusion at the network. Before the pandemic, each adult in the UK visited a cash machine on average three times a month, taking out on average Â£66.99. That amount has climbed to Â£78.54. However, 18 months after the coronavirus crisis started, visits are now less than twice a month. That means the total average amount each month withdrawn per person has fallen Â£44, from Â£200.97 to Â£157.08. Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK The total value of Link ATM withdrawals is currently running at around Â£1.6bn a week, compared with around Â£2.2bn in 2019. Meanwhile the amount people can spend on a contactless card rocketed to Â£100 earlier this month, after climbing to Â£45 in April 2020. ""Crucially, even though we're withdrawing almost Â£100m less per day, millions still rely on cash, especially in the most deprived areas of the country,"" said Mr Quin. ""It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country."" The latestFinancial Lives survey from the Financial Conduct Authority,externalshowed that more than five million people rely on cash every day. Link's new figures suggest that some wealthier parts of Edinburgh and London have shown a fall in cash machine use by as much as 60%. But there remains a greater reliance on cash in areas such as Liverpool, Bradford and Birmingham where the fall in ATM usage is considerably smaller. Link said it heard from more 400 communities this year wanting better cash access. It has installed more than 70 machines across the country in response to those requests and a further 30 in areas identified as lacking cash access. It said it is encouraging people to speak up if they find it difficult to access cash free of charge. ""It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country,"" said Mr Quin. Link said the number of ATMs has not dropped as quickly as cash usage. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of free-to-use ATMs has dropped 9% from 45,000 to 41,000. In July the Financial Conduct Authority warned that people living in rural areas are having to travel further to find somewhere to withdraw and deposit cash free of charge. The City watchdog said almost every urban resident has access to a bank, building society, post office or ATM within two kilometres of their home, but only three-quarters of the UK rural population has similar access. It is considering stronger requirements of the sector to ensure the millions of people who rely on notes and coins have access to it. Meanwhile the charity Age UK said that people required the same guarantee of access to cash as they did for running water, electricity and the post. About 2.4 million people aged 65-and-over rely on cash in their daily lives, it said. The charity warned that many would face being excluded from society if they could not get hold of notes and coins. Constituency areas with the smallest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals: Liverpool Walton, 20% Bradford South, 20% Birmingham, Hodge Hill, 20% Leicester East, 21% Bradford East, 22% Boston and Skegness, 23% Birmingham, Perry Barr, 23% Warley, 24% Cynon Valley, 25% Rochdale, 25% *based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021 Constituency areas with the biggest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals: Edinburgh East, 63% Cities of London and Westminster, 60% Edinburgh North and Leith, 60% Holborn and St Pancras, 58% Edinburgh South, 56% Glasgow Central, 56% Edinburgh West, 56% Crawley, 55% Belfast South, 54% Bristol West, 53% *based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021 Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

The 95-year-old monarch will remain at Windsor Castle but is still expected to attend the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow later this month. The Queen is in ""good spirits"" but ""disappointed"" that the visit cannot go ahead, the palace said. She was due to begin the two-day trip on Wednesday. The nation's longest-reigning monarch has attended a series of events in recent days, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening. Queen declines Oldie of the Year award Queen 'irritated' by climate change inaction Earlier in the day, she held two audiences via video link, greeting the Japanese ambassador Hajime Hayashi and the EU ambassador Joao de Almeida. On Monday, she held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand, and at the weekend, she attended the races at Ascot. It was revealed on Tuesday that the Queen had declined the Oldie of the Year award, from the magazine of the same name, saying: ""You are only as old as you feel"". A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days. ""Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow. ""The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and looks forward to visiting in the future."" The Queen's decision is understood to be unrelated to coronavirus. Buckingham Palace is keen not to cause any alarm and has stressed that the Queen has ""reluctantly accepted"" the advice of doctors to rest for the next few days. She has had a busy schedule of engagements over the past couple of weeks that would test the resilience of many people far younger than her. I saw her last Tuesday at an event at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time she had used a walking stick in public. She also took a shorter route into the Abbey. We were told this was ""for her own comfort."" But she still looked incredibly well and engaged for a 95-year-old. It is clear though that getting older takes its toll on us all and the Queen's diary will be carefully managed going forward. The Queen had been due to arrive in Hillsborough in County Down on Wednesday afternoon and attend a church service marking the centenary of the formation of Northern Ireland in Armagh tomorrow. An advance team was already in Northern Ireland making preparations for the two-day visit. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales was also at Windsor Castle on Wednesday for an investiture ceremony where the chef and TV presenter Mary Berry was made Dame Commander. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,said on Twitter,external: ""We thank Her Majesty for her good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and trust that she will keep well and benefit from a period of rest. ""It is always a joy to have Her Majesty in Royal Hillsborough and we look forward to a further visit in the near future."" Wishing her well, Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the Queen had been ""a source of great comfort during Northern Ireland's darkest days and provided lasting leadership as we moved into a new era for all our people"". Prince Charles held the investiture ceremony for Dame Mary Berry on Wednesday Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wished the Queen ""all the very best as she takes a few days' rest"". Church leaders in Northern Ireland said in a joint statement that they were sorry she would not attend the Service of Reconciliation and Hope in Armagh, and acknowledged ""the significance of her commitment to the work of peace and reconciliation, which has meant a great deal to people throughout this island"". The Queen first travelled to Northern Ireland in 1945, just after the end of World War Two, when she was a princess. If it had gone ahead, this week's trip would have been her 26th visit. Royal visits to Northern Ireland during its centenary year have included the first in line to the throne, Prince Charles who went to Belfast in May, and Prince William who visited Londonderry in September.

LiveLiveBoris Johnson faces MPs' questions at PMQs1 minute ago,"Boris Johnson and Keir Starmer have faced each other across the Commons despatch box for PMQs The PM said the Online Safety Bill will be introduced by Christmas The bill would bring in new powers to tackle online abuse MPs have called for the legislation to be speeded up following the killing of Sir David Amess MP The NHS Confederation says ministers should implement their ""Plan B"" Covid strategy and reintroduce some restrictions in England to avoid a winter crisis in the NHS The Business Secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng, has said there are no plans to introduce new restrictions but the government is continually assessing the data The National Care Forum says community care services in England are being forced to turn patients away because of staff shortages MPs have paid tribute to former minister James Brokenshire, who died earlier this month Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics Weâre going to bring our coverage of this weekâs Prime Ministerâs
Questions to a close. As we mentioned earlier, the Health Secretary Sajid Javid will hold a press conference in Downing Street at 17:00 BST on the Covid booster vaccination programme and the procurement of antiviral drugs. You will find our live coverage and analysis here as it happens. With you on board for PMQs were Jennifer Scott, Kate Whannel and Paul Seddon. Thanks for following along with us today. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News A word we heard throughout today's PMQs was âcollegiate.â Both the prime minister and the Labour leader emphasised they
would like to work together on tackling certain issues like online abuse,
extremism and terrorism, and male violence against women. Coming down the road, however, will no doubt be further debate
about how this is achieved. Particularly contentious are issues like whether cracking down on
anonymity online could play a role - something some MPs have called for this
week, but something that Sir Keir Starmer said would not have prevented
recent acts of terrorism. Similarly, we can expect sanctions for tech companies who fail to
crack down on abuse and extremism to be a theme of debate for weeks to come. As we wind down our coverage from the Commons for today, here's a quick recap today's PMQs Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Tributes to Sir David Amess MP During PMQs, Boris Johnson said his party has invested ""record sums"" to tackle counter-terrorism. But, the government is facing a difficult dilemma over its controversial counter-extremism programme called Prevent. News that the suspect held in custody overthe killing of MP Sir David Amesshad earlier been referred to this scheme has reinforced calls for it to be overhauled and made ""more robust"". What is the point, some argue, in referring people to this Â£40m a year programme - which aims to stop people becoming terrorists or supporting them - if they may then go on to commit murder? But others argue that hardening it up with more involvement of police and MI5 officers will simply scare away the very people who currently agree to take part in its voluntary de-radicalisation course, the Channel scheme.

Theresa May watches Prince Charles knight her husband - wearing the same green coat she had on in the Commons. Away from Parliament, Theresa May's husband Philip May has been given a knighthood for his ""political service"". When Mrs May stepped down as prime minister she described her husband as her ""greatest supporter and my closest companion"". At the same event former Great British Bake Off judge Mary Berry was made a Dame Commander by the Prince of Wales. And Steven Knight, who created the drama Peaky Blinders and wrote the film Spencer about Diana, Princess of Wales was made an MBE. Allow Twitter content?

Theresa May, who worked with James Brokenshire during her time as home secretary before appointing him in her own cabinet, calls him a ""remarkable man, an outstanding minister, a great constituency member of parliament and a true friend"". The former prime minister praises his work in government, saying how much he ""understood the importance of the decisions he was making"", and ""cared about people"" affected. And she says he was always helping his own constituents when he could. But he wasn't just ""a hard working, workaholic"", says May. He was ""great fun"" and a ""loving family man"". She recalls his concern about how his cancer diagnosis would impact his wife and family - who are in the Commons public gallery to hear the tributes. She concludes: ""The government is the poorer for his loss, this parliament is poorer for his loss and our country is the poorer for his loss."" Sir Keir Starmer begins his own tribute. ""One of first things you learn in Parliament is that there are not many glamorous roles in opposition. ""No one gives you a guide book - you can ask older wiser heads - but generally you are on your own."" However he tells MPs there is ""one little known exception to this rule, a secret in Westminster"". ""That is when you shadow a minister of such decency and with such a sense of fair play that they reach out across the divide and provide helpful pointers. ""So it was for me."" He tells MPs that when he shadowed him as immigration minister, James Brokenshire willingly offered him advice and support. He says Brokenshire was a friend to many in Parliament and that his family should be ""enormously proud"". Opening the tributes, the prime minister says James Brokenshire's death was ""tragically early"" and came whilst he was in ""the prime of his life"". Boris Johnson pays tribute to his work to reduce the ""stigma"" surrounding lung cancer, the disease that claimed his life. He says he was a ""gentleman politician"" who served in some of the most ""sensitive and demanding"" positions in government. He adds that his lawyerly ""diligence"" and ""composure"" were valuable assets in ministerial office - and praises him as ""unflappable, earnest, and sincere"". ""We can only imagine how much more he would have done if he had been given the chance,"" he adds. After PMQs ends, MPs observe a minute's silence in memory of James Brokenshire.  Tory Shailesh Vara has the final question and says while the focus since Sir David's death had been on the security of MPs,  one aspect has been overlooked - their staff. ""It is our staff that are on the front line, receiving abusive emails and correspondents, and taking the abusive phone calls,"" he adds. Vara says staff are ""simply trying to earn a living"" and calls on the PM to ""give them the credit they deserve"". Johnson says his colleague spoke for everyone in the Commons with his words. ""It is our staff, case workers and office managers who have to deal with anger and intemperant abuse and they cope with it magnificently,"" he says. He concludes that he ""thoroughly echoes, supports and concurs"" with Vara. Labour's Colleen Fletcher says a hospital in her constituency has seen ""more than 600 attacks on staff"" and that workers have resorted to wearing body cameras to deter attacks. ""It simply isn't right that doctors and nurses have to go to such lengths to feel safe at work,"" she says and asks the PM what steps he will take to ""better protect NHS heroes"". Boris Johnson replies that the government has ""toughened sentences for those who assault or harass public servants"". After paying tribute to the two MPs lost over recess, Labour's Virendra Sharma points to the the rising bills for heating, food and fuel, saying they are increasing ""at staggering speed"". The MP asks Johnson whether he will reinstate the ""lifeline"" uplift in universal credit that was scrapped earlier this month, given the ""crisis"" in living costs. The PM says the government is taking a number of measures to tackle the issue, such as increasing the warm homes allowance. But he says the ""most important thing"" happening in the country is wages are going up and  there is a ""huge jobs boom thanks to policies of this government"". Conservative MP Mary Robinson asks Boris Johnson whether thinks Greater Manchester Police should urgently review its ""internal culture"". The force is in special measures - and she says the local newspaper has described a ""culture of denial and secrecy"" at the force. She also calls for more action to help whistleblowers. The PM says the people of Manchester ""deserve better"" from the force - and people should have the confidence to speak up against wrongdoing. However, he says this is primarily the responsibility of Greater Manchester's Labour mayor, Andy Burnham. Conservative Brendan Clarke-Smith says he understands the need to build more houses but adds that his local constituents are ""concerned about over-intensive developments"". He asks the PM to confirm the that number of houses set to be built in his Bassetlaw constituency will be a minimum of 4,896 not 10,000 ""as claimed by the Labour-run council"". Boris Johnson says the MP is right and that the government is determined to ""build the houses people need"". Tory MP Anthony Mangnall says the fishing community in his constituency is looking forward to benefits from the government's ""levelling up"" plans. But he says they are also waiting for their share of the post-EU Â£100m fisheries scheme and calls on the PM to ""reaffirm his commitment to our coastal communities and our fishing sector"". Johnson says the government will continue to support fishing and seafood business across the country, and says a further Â£100m would be made available. The SNP's Westminster leader is up next, and asks about the UK's government's recent decision not to select acarbon capture and storage facility in Aberdeenfor funding. Struggling with a sore throat, he says this was a ""devastating blow"" to the renewable energy sector in Scotland, ahead of this month's COP 26 summit in Glasgow. Boris Johnson says the government ""absolutely committed"" to helping industry decarbonise. But following up, Blackford says the UK government is ""holding back"" the development of carbon capture, and proving an ""active barrier"" in the development of renewable energy. The prime minister rejects this, saying the government is putting ""huge sums"" into clean energy. Conservative Crispin Blunt urges the PM to ""cut through"" barriers to research into the drug psilocybin which he says has the potential to help people suffering with depression, trauma and addiction. Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug found in magic mushrooms. Boris Johnson says the government is considering the Advisory Council on Misuse of Drugs's advice on research and promises to ""get back"" to the MP. Ione WellsWestminster Correspondent, BBC News The exchanges between Sir Keir Starmer and Boris Johnson have been
much less lively than usual. Both leaders are dressed in black ties and have reflected on
parliamentâs continuous mourning following the killing of Sir David Amess MP on
Friday. As a result, both appeared to try and strike a more constructive
and âcollegiateâ tone than the usual jibes - and often personal criticisms -
that weâre used to seeing at PMQs. Sir Keir did criticise the prime minister, however, when Boris
Johnson accused Labour of opposing legislation to block the early release of
terrorist offenders from prison - saying that after the week that had just
passed he did not want to centre âthat kind of knockabout.â Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Fossil fuel production set to soar in next decadeGovernment plans to extract coal, oil and gas are incompatible with safe temperatures, says the UN.","Coal mining in China has increased in 2021 Plans by governments to extract fossil fuels up to 2030 are incompatible with keeping global temperatures to safe levels, says the UN. TheUNEP production gap report,externalsays countries will drill or mine more than double the levels needed  to keep the 1.5C threshold alive. Oil and gas recovery is set to rise sharply with only a modest decrease in coal. There has been little change since the first report was published in 2019. Households to get Â£5,000 to replace gas boilers Why does a climate summit need 25,000 people? How smart appliances can help fix the energy gap Kerry says Glasgow last best hope for the world With the COP26 climate conference just over a week away, there is already a huge focus on the carbon-cutting ambitions of the biggest emitters. But despite the flurry of net zero emission goals and the increased pledges of many countries, some of the biggest oil, gas and coal producers have not set out plans for the rapid reductions in fossil fuels that scientists say are necessary to limit temperatures in coming years. Earlier this year, researchers from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)warned of the dangers for humanityof allowing temperatures to rise by more than 1.5C this century. To keep under this threshold will require cuts in carbon emissions of around 45% by 2030 based on 2010 levels. An oil rig sets sail - oil production is set to increase over the next decade But instead of curbing carbon, many of the biggest emitting countries are also planning to significantly increase their production of fossil fuels, according to the UN. The production gap report finds that countries plan to produce around 110% more fossil fuel than would be compatible with a 1.5C temperature rise by the end of this century. The plans are around 45% more than what's needed to keep the temperature rise to 2C. According to the study, coal production will drop but gas will increase the most over the next 20 years, to levels that are simply incompatible with the Paris agreement. The report profiles 15 major production countries including Australia, Russia, Saudi Arabia, the US and UK. Most governments continue to provide significant policy support for fossil fuel production, the authors say. Fracking has seen huge increases in oil and gas production in the US ""The research is clear: global coal, oil, and gas production must start declining immediately and steeply to be consistent with limiting long-term warming to 1.5C,"" says Ploy Achakulwisut, a lead author on the report from the Stockholm Environment Institute. ""However, governments continue to plan for and support levels of fossil fuel production that are vastly in excess of what we can safely burn."" While countries have devoted far more of their recovery spending after the Covid pandemic towards fossil fuel activities, there are some positives when it comes to financing. Funding for oil, coal and gas from multilateral banks has decreased significantly in recent years - and also from some of the richer nations. ""This report shows, once again, a simple but powerful truth: we need to stop pumping oil and gas from the ground if we are to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement,"" said Andrea Meza, Costa Rica's minister for environment and energy. ""We must cut with both hands of the scissors, addressing demand and supply of fossil fuels simultaneously. That is why, together with Denmark, we are leading the creation of the Beyond Oil and Gas Alliance to put an end to the expansion of fossil fuel extraction, plan a just transition for workers and start winding down existing production in a managed way.""

Investigations continue into Ayr explosion,"One home was completely destroyed in the blast in Ayr Dozens of people will spend a third night away from home after an explosion at a property in Ayr. Four houses in Gorse Park, Kincaidston, are likely to be demolished while 35 others are damaged or strewn with debris. A family of four remains in hospital after the blast on Monday, the cause of which is still being investigated. Police Scotland said it was too early to determine whether it had been caused by gas. Engineers from Scottish Gas Networks (SGN) remained at the scene on Wednesday. Family of four seriously injured in Ayr explosion Man helps evacuate boy from blast wreckage A 43-year-old woman and a 16-year-old boy are being treated for serious injuries at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. A 47-year-old man is in the city's Queen Elizabeth University Hospital while an 11-year-old boy is in the adjoining Royal Hospital for Children. On Wednesday afternoon, South Ayrshire Council confirmed residents of 46 properties could safely return to their homes. Work is ongoing to re-establish gas supply in the wider area Of the properties that will be left standing, four have been ""significantly"" damaged and will need extensive repairs before householders can return, the council said. Others were damaged by debris and some are not safe to access due to broken windows or debris strewn across gardens or inside properties. The council said teams were working to remove debris, but that some people could return to their homes while their next-door neighbours could not. Work is ongoing to re-establish gas supply to the wider area. Emergency services will decide whether people can return to their homes Council leader Peter Henderson said: ""I know that council teams, the emergency services and partners have been working tirelessly to help as many people as possible to return to their homes. ""This is no easy task and I am relieved that their painstaking work has allowed some families to get back home today. Of course, it's still very early days and the devastation caused by this tragic event will take considerable time to rectify. ""We are committed to working alongside our communities and partners to support them through the aftermath of this terrible event."" Earlier, the deputy leader of South Ayrshire Council, Brian McGinley, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that some residents were back in their homes, some were staying with family and friends and others were in hotels. ""We need to realise that this has been a very major incident, it's a very demanding and technical situation,"" he said. ""Clearly we're working as fast and as hard as we can to make sure everybody is safe, that everyone's needs are met. But it's going to take a long time for this community to recover.""

Mr McGinley added: ""Volunteers are providing rest and food for local people and emergency services - they have clothes, drinks and foodstuffs available. Some people have been a bit traumatised by it so they can come down, have a cup of tea and chat to people about it."" The council also said it had been overwhelmed by donations from the public and offers of help from local businesses. A hub for residents affected by the incident and emergency service workers has been set up at Kincaidston Community Pavilion. One community worker told the BBC that about 120 residents were initially unable to return to their homes following the explosion. ""[They] had to register to say what location they were in approximate to the explosion and then they could get let back in their houses,"" he said. ""We had kids in getting their evening meals. ""As far as I'm led to believe one of the local hotels has put some of the residents up, that was [Tuesday] afternoon - I don't know what the situation is now."" He said the centre had received donations from local businesses, including takeaways, supermarkets, bakers and butchers to support displaced people. ""It's been quite hectic but the emergency services are very appreciative of what we've done for them - the community has rallied round."" A total of 35 homes were damaged or strewn with debris Scottish Fire and Rescue Service area commander Ian McMeekin described the aftermath of the explosion as ""extremely challenging"". At its height, nine appliances responded to the explosion, which happened shortly after 19:00 on Monday, as well as urban search and rescue teams. Mr McMeekin said: ""There is significant damage to the properties and the surrounding area."" He also thanked the local community for their ""support and understanding"". Residents needing support following the blast have been urged to contact 0300 123 0900. The gas distribution company SGN said it would continue to work with ""expert parties"" in the coming days to establish the cause of the explosion. A temporary, above-ground gas pipeline has been installed for homes in Kincaidston. The company said: ""We'd like to reiterate our reassurance to the local community that the gas network across the area remains safe and secure to use. ""Our engineers have carried out full safety checks in the area to ensure the safety of all the homes close to the damaged properties. ""We're aware some residents may have turned off their gas supply at the meter as a result of the incident. ""If this applies to you, then our engineers are available to visit your property and safely turn your gas supply back on.""

NI is 'gateway' for black-market puppies to GB,"Dealers are shipping younger puppies out of the Republic of Ireland before the legal age of 15 weeks, the programme discovered Northern Ireland is the gateway for a multi-million pound black market in puppies into Great Britain, according to an investigation by BBC NI's Spotlight programme. Animal protection societies told the programme the illicit trade sees tens of thousands of dogs moved from the Republic of Ireland through Northern Ireland every year. The demand for puppies has increased during lockdown. Prices have been driven up as a result. Reporter Mandy McAuley tracked dealers moving dogs and confronted one dealer from Coalisland, County Tyrone, who sold sick and dying puppies in Scotland. The high demand has also increased incentives for dealers to ship younger puppies out of the Republic of Ireland before the age of 15 weeks, when they could be legally moved. The Scottish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SSPCA) told the programme that members of three large extended family networks in Northern Ireland are responsible for much of the traffic in puppies across the Irish Sea. ""For the puppy trade in Scotland, I would say 90% of all problems come through Belfast,"" SSPCA Chief Superintendent Mike Flynn said. ""Considering last year we seized over 150 pups and at least 90% of them came over from Belfast. ""Whether they were bred in Northern Ireland or Southern Ireland, that is the route they came through. ""To me it's the new drugs - if you come into Cairnryan with Â£20,000 worth of drugs you are going to go to jail; Â£20,000 worth of pups, you'll get a Â£500 fine."" Stephanie Western spent thousands of pounds to keep her puppy alive after purchasing it Speaking on BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, USPCA chief executive Brendan Mullan said it was a ""lucrative"" trade. ""We have been undertaking an undercover investigation ourselves, which helped inform the Spotlight programme, and identified the licensed pet transporters that are involved in this trade, collecting dogs from the south of Ireland, but also collecting dogs from illegal breeders in Northern Ireland and trafficking them into GB,"" he said. ""We are aware of 20 such transporters doing this. One them does 120 dogs a week and if you take the average price of Â£1,875 for a pup in GB, that individual has criminal proceeds of almost Â£16m a year."" How the pandemic sparked a puppy craze The Spotlight team established that puppy dealer Bernard Ward, from Coalisland, had sold sick and dying puppies on at least five occasions in Scotland. Stephanie Western, who spent thousands of pounds to keep her puppy, Thor, alive, said: ""We obviously felt so stupid, gutted that we handed over, you know, our hard-earned money to these people who are just abusing these little animals. ""How is it so easy for people to just hop on a ferry with a load of sick dogs and just scam people? ""That is something that really needs to change; that is something that needs to be addressed."" Mandy McAuley then went undercover to buy a puppy which was also later traced back to Mr Ward. Bonnie, the puppy purchased by the Spotlight team, was later found to be infected with two intestinal parasites. That should have made the sale a criminal offence under Scottish law. The puppy was treated and then adopted by a family in Scotland. ""It's a low-risk, high-gain opportunity to smuggle in puppies and make quick money,"" according to a former president of the British Veterinary Association. Spotlight confronted Bernard Ward over the phone. He insisted they had phoned the wrong number, but it was the same phone he used in one of the Scottish sales. They also wrote to him, but he did not respond. Daniella Dos Santos, a former president of the British Veterinary Association, told the programme: ""Everybody wants a dog at the moment, and it's an emotional purchase. ""What these people are seeing, is low-risk, high-gain opportunities here to smuggle in puppies and make quick money without any thought for the people or the animals they are harming in the process. ""But what they do know, [is] that even if they're caught, the consequences are so low compared [to] if they're successful, which, is quite clear they are being successful, and the financial rewards that they get for it."" In a statement to the programme, Northern Ireland Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots said it is ""not possible nor practical to stop every vehicle moving through Northern Ireland's ports"". However, he said multiple interceptions had been made in recent months, including 10 springer spaniel pups seized last month. He said his department will do all it can to deter the trade in puppies and said his officials are working with local councils, the PSNI, the Harbour Police and ferry companies to identify suspect movements through the ports. ""No dog owner should have to see their pet suffer because it has been treated like a commodity and bred purely to line the pockets of lawbreakers,"" he said. The USPCA believes that about one third of trafficked puppies will die.

"Queen cancels NI visit on medical adviceBuckingham Palace says she has ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"".UK","The Queen was pictured on Tuesday evening, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle The Queen has cancelled a trip to Northern Ireland and has ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"", Buckingham Palace says. The 95-year-old monarch will remain at Windsor Castle but is still expected to attend the COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow later this month. The Queen is in ""good spirits"" but ""disappointed"" that the visit cannot go ahead, the palace said. She was due to begin the two-day trip on Wednesday. The nation's longest-reigning monarch has attended a series of events in recent days, hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening. Queen declines Oldie of the Year award Queen 'irritated' by climate change inaction Earlier in the day, she held two audiences via video link, greeting the Japanese ambassador Hajime Hayashi and the EU ambassador Joao de Almeida. On Monday, she held a virtual audience with the new governor-general of New Zealand, and at the weekend, she attended the races at Ascot. It was revealed on Tuesday that the Queen had declined the Oldie of the Year award, from the magazine of the same name, saying: ""You are only as old as you feel"". A Buckingham Palace spokesman said: ""The Queen has reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days. ""Her Majesty is in good spirits and is disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland, where she had been due to undertake a series of engagements today and tomorrow. ""The Queen sends her warmest good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and looks forward to visiting in the future."" The Queen's decision is understood to be unrelated to coronavirus. Buckingham Palace is keen not to cause any alarm and has stressed that the Queen has ""reluctantly accepted"" the advice of doctors to rest for the next few days. She has had a busy schedule of engagements over the past couple of weeks that would test the resilience of many people far younger than her. I saw her last Tuesday at an event at Westminster Abbey. It was the first time she had used a walking stick in public. She also took a shorter route into the Abbey. We were told this was ""for her own comfort."" But she still looked incredibly well and engaged for a 95-year-old. It is clear though that getting older takes its toll on us all and the Queen's diary will be carefully managed going forward. The Queen had been due to arrive in Hillsborough in County Down on Wednesday afternoon and attend a church service marking the centenary of the formation of Northern Ireland in Armagh tomorrow. An advance team was already in Northern Ireland making preparations for the two-day visit. Meanwhile, the Prince of Wales was also at Windsor Castle on Wednesday for an investiture ceremony where the chef and TV presenter Mary Berry was made Dame Commander. Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party,said on Twitter,external: ""We thank Her Majesty for her good wishes to the people of Northern Ireland and trust that she will keep well and benefit from a period of rest. ""It is always a joy to have Her Majesty in Royal Hillsborough and we look forward to a further visit in the near future."" Wishing her well, Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie said the Queen had been ""a source of great comfort during Northern Ireland's darkest days and provided lasting leadership as we moved into a new era for all our people"". Prince Charles held the investiture ceremony for Dame Mary Berry on Wednesday Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said he wished the Queen ""all the very best as she takes a few days' rest"". Church leaders in Northern Ireland said in a joint statement that they were sorry she would not attend the Service of Reconciliation and Hope in Armagh, and acknowledged ""the significance of her commitment to the work of peace and reconciliation, which has meant a great deal to people throughout this island"". The Queen first travelled to Northern Ireland in 1945, just after the end of World War Two, when she was a princess. If it had gone ahead, this week's trip would have been her 26th visit. Royal visits to Northern Ireland during its centenary year have included the first in line to the throne, Prince Charles who went to Belfast in May, and Prince William who visited Londonderry in September.

Afghan refugees declaring themselves homelessRefugees are leaving their hotels as they fear being moved to any part of the UK if they stay there.,"Afghan refugees have been living in hotels for two months Dozens of Afghan families staying in hotels as part of a scheme to resettle them are declaring themselves homeless. More than 200 families have asked councils in London for emergency accommodation. They are concerned that the Home Office scheme they are currently part of could see them moved to anywhere in the UK and away from family and friends. London Councils, which represents the city's 32 boroughs, says people should stay with the government scheme. The organisation found 89% of the 204 families who have registered as homeless were unsure whether they are on the resettlement scheme. It said if they leave the scheme and sign on with the councils, they would lose all support provided by the Home Office and could still be placed in temporary accommodation outside of their chosen area. How many Afghan asylum seekers has the UK taken in? Where will resettled Afghans live in the UK? Afghans who worked for UK can stay permanently Government sorry for 'short notice' over Afghans Darren Rodwell of London Councils is urging all families in hotels to wait for clarification. ""The last thing we want is vulnerable people placed in more vulnerable communities,"" he said. But some refugees believe they may not qualify for the scheme because a family member holds a British passport. They think leaving the scheme is a safer option because they can sign on to council lists sooner, and even if they are moved temporarily away by councils, they could ultimately be moved back to the capital once a permanent place is found. What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years The frenzied final hours in the Afghan palace A new order begins under Taliban rule The city is already facing a housing crisis with about 165,000 people living in temporary accommodation organised by their borough. The Home Office Afghan Citizens Resettlement Scheme's policy states families can be placed anywhere in the UK. If families leave their hotels, they will lose Home Office support. Refugees have also said they are frustrated with the slow pace of the scheme and a lack of communication. Said Shinwari is a British citizen Said Shinwari, who is a British citizen after previously working in the UK for more than 20 years, returned with his wife and eight children when the Taliban took control of their town. He has been staying in hotels for nearly two months and is grateful for the help he has received. However, he is considering registering as homeless in the hope of accessing emergency accommodation. As he worked in London for 20 years and has family in the capital, he wants to be housed there. ""I am concerned about my family and children because they are just inside the room. They need to go to school,"" he said. Mr Shinwari says he has had very little communication from the government despite numerous attempts to contact officials. Harrow Council has received 10 applications and has moved five families into emergency accommodation. Councillor Peymana Assad, also an Afghan refugee, said the applications were putting pressure on the council, which has very little housing stock available. Ms Assad said she believes the problem is only going to get worse. ""We have such a large Afghan community already. We understand that we're going to have more cases come to us with more families leaving hotels,"" she said. ""We need the Home Office to communicate with Afghan refugees to give them clarity as to how the process is actually going to work. The council needs this too."" The Home Office said the Department for Levelling Up, Housing & Communities (DLUHC) was responsible for British nationals. In a statement the DLUHC said: ""Through the effort and support of local councils, thousands of people were swiftly evacuated by our Armed Forces and have now been warmly welcomed to the UK and are being provided with permanent homes as quickly as possible."" ""Those resettling here have access to essential provision, healthcare, education, and Universal Credit, while we arrange further wrap around support to enable these families to build a successful life in the UK.""

Bruce leaves Newcastle after takeover,"This video can not be played Steve Bruce speaks about his future at Newcastle after their 3-2 defeat by Tottenham in his 1,000th match as a manager. Manager Steve Bruce has left Newcastle United by mutual consent just 13 days afterthe Saudi Arabia-backed Â£305m takeoverof the club was completed. The 60-year-old took charge of his 1,000th match as a manager inSunday's 3-2 defeat by Tottenham- his only game as Magpies boss under the new owners. Bruce said there had been ""highs and lows"" and that he hoped the new owners could ""take the club forward"". Graeme Jones will take interim charge of the Premier League side. Newcastle said the appointment of a new manager ""will be announced in due course"". Bruce is understood to have received in the region of Â£8m after his contract was paid up in full. Who will be the next Newcastle boss? Assess the candidates and vote All the reaction to Bruce leaving Newcastle Newcastle ask fans not to wear 'culturally inappropriate' clothing The Tyneside club have made a winless start to the Premier League season and sit second from bottom after three draws from their opening eight games. Bruce was appointed Magpies manager in July 2019 and achieved finishes of 13th and 12th in his two full seasons in charge. ""I am grateful to everyone connected with Newcastle United for the opportunity to manage this unique football club,"" said Bruce. Everything you need to know about Newcastle United, all in one place What Newcastle need to do to stay in Premier League - Danny Murphy analysis ""I would like to thank my coaching team, the players and the support staff in particular for all their hard work. ""There have been highs and lows, but they have given everything even in difficult moments and should be proud of their efforts. ""This is a club with incredible support and I hope the new owners can take it forward to where we all want it to be. I wish everyone the very best of luck for the rest of this season and beyond.""

Bruce had a 27.4% win percentage from 84 league games at Newcastle, which was the ninth best compared to previous Magpies managers who had been in charge of at least 20 Premier League matches. A Newcastle statement said the club ""would like to place on record its gratitude to Steve for his contribution and wishes him well for the future"". The club's next game will be at Crystal Palace at 15:00 BST on Saturday, 23 October. In an interview with the Daily Telegraph,,externalBruce said: ""I think this might be my last job. ""It's not just about me; it's taken its toll on my whole family because they are all Geordies and I can't ignore that. ""They have been worried about meâ¦ especially my wife Jan. ""I'm 60 years old and I don't know if I want to put her through it again. We've got a good life so, yeah, this will probably be me done as a manager - until I get a phone call from a chairman somewhere asking if I can give them a hand. Never say never, I've learnt that."" He added: ""I wanted so badly to make it work. ""I was so proud to be manager of Newcastle United, even in the dark times, I was determined to keep going and to keep this club in the Premier League."" Newcastle forward Allan Saint-Maximin, who joined the Magpies in August 2019, is one of the side's key players and he said it had been an ""honour and a privilege"" to have Bruce as his coach. ""You are, without a doubt, one of the most gentle people that I have ever met in the world of football,""wrote Saint-Maximin on social media.,external ""You have been a man of your word, a caring man and a fair man who never hesitated to protect us. I will never forget how you treated me, for that I will be forever grateful."" Newcastle's record goalscorer Alan Shearer said Bruce's sacking felt ""inevitable"". But, having managed the club himself on an interim basis at the end of the 2008-09 season, Shearer added he felt some sympathy for those working under previous owner Mike Ashley. ""I think it was right for both parties,"" the former England striker told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""As tough as it will be, Steve's big enough and strong enough to know you have to take criticism when you don't win games. And he hasn't won any games this season. ""It was an almost impossible club to manage in the circumstances. Every manager who's been in over the last 14 years has found it very, very difficult.""

During his final game against Spurs, some Magpies fans sang, 'We want Brucey out' as they made the new owners aware about their feelings about his position. ""Fantastic news, I think every single Newcastle United fan is over the moon with this,"" supporter Alex Hurst from The True Faith podcast told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's been a long time coming, arguably it should have happened at least a week earlier but I think we're not going to worry too much about that now. ""It's a new era for the football club and it was essential that Steve Bruce was moved on."" He added: ""No wins this season and, quite simply, if you look at Steve Bruce's record this season but also over the last 38 games as a whole, I think they've won seven of those 38 games, very few football managers in any division in any country would be able to survive that sort of record. ""To put it simply, I think he was yesterday's man. He might have been a good manager 20 years ago but he's not any more."" Former Newcastle defender Steven Taylor spent 13 years at the club between 2003 and 2016 and he had sympathy for Bruce as well as other managers who had been at the club during Ashley's reign. ""The upstairs hierarchy were the ones that were controlling everything that was going on,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""There are previous managers that I've played under who didn't want to play certain players, they got told to play these players and that's how it was at the football club at the time. It has been difficult."" Ian Dennis - BBC Radio 5 Live senior football reporter It was always Steve Bruce's dream job to take charge of Newcastle United but he has received a lot of criticism from the supporters, a lot of abuse which I know he feels has gone too far at times. I think he is a realist. He would have said the takeover from a footballing sense is the best thing for Newcastle United Football Club in terms of the investment it will undoubtedly bring. I think he is also a realist in that he knew that it would probably mean that they'd want to bring in their own manager and I think in that sense what will be, will be. Yes he'll be disappointed, any manager would be to lose his job, but I think when he reflects there might be an element of relief as well because of the criticism and abuse that he has received, that he's no longer in the firing line. It became quite clear at the weekend that the supporters were not going to tolerate such a position for much longer, it's very very hard for any manager to survive in those sort of circumstances.

Squid Game helps Netflix subscriptions pick up,"Squid Game was watched by 142 million households in its first four weeks Netflix subscriptions picked up in the third quarter of 2021 as non-English language shows continued to be the streaming platform's best performers. The US firm added 4.4 million users in the three months to 30 September, more than double the previous quarter. Korean TV series Squid Game was its biggest hit, watched by 142 million households in its first four weeks. It comes as some Netflix staff prepare to walk out on Wednesday amid a backlash over comedian Dave Chappelle. They accuse the star of mocking transgender people in his latest Netflix special, but the firm has defended him. The strong performance for Netflix follows a sluggish start to 2021, when the surging demand for streaming  seen earlier on in the pandemic petered out. The US firm - which is the world's largest streaming platform - now expects to add some 8.5 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter, above analysts' expectations. It's being driven by popular shows such as Sex Education, the Queen's Gambit and the global smash Squid Game. Squid Game warning sent to parents by council Squid Game knocks Bridgerton off Netflix top spot The dystopian series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money - has become a viral sensation and dethroned period drama Bridgerton as Netflix's most popular show to date. According to Bloomberg,external, the Korean series is thought to be worth some $900m to the streaming giant, after costing $21.4m to make. Another non-English language show, La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), also did well, with series five being watched by 69 million viewers in its first four weeks. ""We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world,""Netflix said in a letter to shareholders,external. The firm expects to attract more new users in the run up to Chirstmas with returning seasons of popular shows such as ""Tiger King"" and ""Cobra Kai"". It also agreed to acquire the Roald Dahl Story Company in September, pending regulatory approval, so will own the rights to titles like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda. A special by comedian Dave Chappelle sparked anger among some Netflix staff The David Chappelle special ""The Closer"" saw the boundary-pushing comic joking that ""gender is a fact"" and accuse LGBTQ people of being ""too sensitive"". In one skit, Mr Chappelle, who is black, says: ""In our country you can shoot and kill [a black man], but you'd better not hurt a gay person's feelings."" Ahead of a rally on Wednesday at Netflix's California headquarters, a group representing trans staff told the firm to stop ""platforming hate speech"" and issued a series of demands. ""We want the company to adopt measures in the areas of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction, all of which are necessary to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,"" they said in a statement. In a memo to staff earlier this month, Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos acknowledged some staff were ""left angry"" by Mr Chappelle's show, but defended the comic's artistic freedom and said the material had not caused ""real world harm"". On Tuesday, however, Mr Sarandostold Deadline,externalhe regretted this initial response and should have done more to recognise staff's ""pain"". But he also said the firm did not plan to take down, edit or add content warnings to Mr Chappelle's show. ""Stand-up comedy is a pretty singular voice art form,"" he told Deadline. ""We really don't get involved and interfere with the material itself, and I think it's consistent with a brand of stand-up comedy and certainly consistent with Dave Chappelle's comedy, so I don't think a warning card or an edit would've been appropriate.""

Deadly blast on military bus in Damascus,"The bus was hit as it passed under Jisr al-Rais bridge A bomb attack on a military bus in central Damascus has killed 14 people, Syrian state media say. Two explosive devices attached to the vehicle blew up as it passed under Jisr al-Rais bridge during the morning rush hour,Sana news agency reported,external. Although Syria has been embroiled in civil war for a decade, such attacks in the capital are increasingly rare. Soon afterwards, army shellfire also reportedly killed at least 10 people in the opposition-held north-west. The region is the last stronghold of the rebel and jihadist groups that have been trying to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad since 2011. The war has left at least 350,000 people dead, and caused half the population to flee their homes, including almost six million refugees abroad. Wednesday's bombing in Damascus was reportedly the deadliest in the city since March 2017, when 31 people were killed ina suicide attack at the main court complexthat was claimed by the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). ""I was sleeping when I heard a strong explosion. I woke up and saw a bus on fire, which came to a halt after hitting the sidewalk,"" Abu Ahmed, a fruit vendor at a market near the bridge, told AFP news agency. ""I later heard the sound of a second explosion, but this one was not as strong as the first one."" Video from the scene showed the charred remains of the bus, with smoke billowing from its broken windows as firefighters put out the flames. Sana said military engineers defused a third explosive device that had fallen from the vehicle. EXPLAINER:Why has the Syrian war lasted 10 years? CHILDREN OF IS:'It's a disaster we cannot deal with' Interior Minister Mohammed al-Rahman told state TV that security forces would ""pursue the terrorists who committed this heinous crime wherever they are"". No group has yet said it was behind the bombing, but suspicion will fall on IS, which has attacked military vehicles in the east of the country this year. This video can not be played Two children, a decade of war in Syria: Rahaf and Mustafa symbolise the suffering inflicted by Syria's war Four children and a female teacher were among the 10 people killed in the town of Ariha,external, in the north-western province of Idlib, according to the Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are widely known as the White Helmets. Another 20 people were wounded, some of them critically, when shells struck main roads and a busy market while children were heading to school at the start of the day, the organisation said, blaming pro-government forces. ""When we arrived at the school and the students were there, the shelling and air strikes started,""a local teacher told Save the Children,external. ""The students were horrified, they started screaming, we didn't know what to do. We were worried the students would get injured as the buildings are not protected."" Shells struck residential areas and a busy market in Ariha as children were going to school The UN children's agency said Wednesday's violence was ""yet another reminder that the war in Syria has not come to an end"". ""Civilians, among them many children, keep bearing the brunt of a brutal decade-long conflict,"" it added. North-western Syria has seen sporadic violence since a ceasefire brokered in March 2020 by Turkey and Russia ended a government offensive. Turkey, which backs the opposition, and Russia, a key ally of Mr Assad, have deployed troops to the region in an attempt to prevent a major escalation.

Brewdog's solid gold beer can ad misleading,"Mark Craig's Brewdog can collection A Brewdog promotion which said customers could win ""solid gold"" beer cans was misleading, the advertising watchdog has found. The Scottish brewer offered shoppers the chance to find a gold can hidden in cases sold from its online store. But some winners complained to the Advertising Standards Authority after they discovered the cans were not solid gold, but were gold-plated instead. The ASA upheld the complaints and said three adverts were misleading. In response to the ASA's ruling, James Watt, co-founder and chief executive at Brewdog, said: ""We hold our hands up, we got the first gold can campaign wrong."" Brewdog in row over Â£15,000 gold can price Ex-Brewdog staff allege culture of fear at brewer Craft beer accused of being 'sexist boys' club' The ruling comes amid heavy criticism of Brewdog in recent months, with a letter from ex-workers stating former staff had ""suffered mental illness"" as a result of working for the craft beer brewer. It made a number of allegations, including that Brewdog fostered a culture where staff were afraid to speak out about concerns. The ASA said it received 25 complaints in relation to three social media adverts stating its can prize was made from ""solid gold"". In its ruling, the watchdog said it ""understood the prize consisted of 24 carat gold-plated replica cans"", but added ""because the ads stated that the prize included a solid gold can when that was not the case, we concluded the ads were misleading"". The ASA said it had told Brewdog not to state or imply that consumers would receive a solid gold can when it was not the case. One of the competition winners, Mark Craig, still contests the value of the gold-plated can that he won and believes it is ""not worth anything"". Mr Craig, from Lisburn, Northern Ireland, told the BBC: ""They are meant to be there for the little guy and this is two fingers to their customers who are the ones who were taken by this."" He criticised the company's apology, which he said appeared to be encouraging people to buy more beer in a ""new competition run correctly this time"". Brewdog said its social media posts which contained the words ""solid gold"" did so in error and repeated that mistakes were a result of miscommunication between its marketing and social media teams. As well as complaints over the prize's authenticity, some winners questioned how much the can was worth. Brewdog claimed it was valued at Â£15,000. This video can not be played James Watt said he would reflect on how to become a better leader Mr Watt said the company stood by its valuation which it previously said was based on several factors, including the manufacturing price, metal and quality of the product. The ASA said Brewdog told investigators that a single 330ml can, made with the equivalent 330ml of pure gold, would have a gold value of about $500,000 (Â£363,000). The ASA said it considered a general audience ""was unlikely to be aware of the price of gold, how that would translate into the price of a gold can, and whether that was inconsistent with the valuation as stated in the ad"". The brewer has been heavily criticised in recent months with allegations being made about its culture, which has led to an independent review of the organisation. So far, more than 100 interviews with former staff have ""either taken place or are scheduled for the coming weeks"" as part of the review, according the firm's website. Mr Watt has previously apologised to former staff and said their complaints would help make him a better chief executive. However, in a recent interview with theDaily Telegraph,external, he said the brewer ""should have been clearer about the high-performance culture"" and suggested there was a ""mismatch of expectations"" among certain employees. The BBC previously reported that a note from Mr Watt to staff said it was ""fair to say that this type of fast-paced and intense environment is definitely not for everyone, but many of our fantastic long-term team members have thrived in our culture"". As well as the ruling on Brewdog, the ASA also upheld a complaint against an advert by plant-drink maker Alpro on the side of a bus. The complainant believed commercial almond farming caused environmental damage and challenged whether the product was ""good for the planet"" as stated. The ASA said there was ""no qualification"" to the claim and ""little context provided"" in the ad to interpret it. It added that Alpro revealed the almonds used in its almond drink were cultivated in a sustainable way and not sourced from regions with environmentally damaging processes.

During it, he said the government was not complacent about rising Covid rates, was investing in new treatments, and was constantly reviewing the situation. There was, however, no sign than the ""Plan B"" of further restrictions is going to be introduced in England. Javid urged the public to get vaccinated and to take precautions - such as wearing masks - where possible, to stem the surge in infections expected over the winter. He warned daily cases could hit more than 100,000 - the latest figure is 49,139 - but he did say the UK had hit a milestone, with 4m booster jabs now delivered. In the final question of the news conference, Sajid Javid is asked by Sebastian Payne of the Financial Times whether, as Covid cases rise across the country, more Conservative MPs should wear masks in the House of Commons. ""I think that's a very fair point,"" he replies. ""As I say, we've all got our role to play in this and we the people standing on this stage play our public roles as a secretary of state, as someone in the NHS, as the head of UKHSA (UK Health Security Agency). ""We also have a role to play to set an example as private individuals as well - I think that's a very fair point and I'm sure a lot of people will have heard you."" Jenny Harries reminds people that there is a ânatural breakâ
coming up - with half term beginning next week for most schools in England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. She says that with the break, and if people adopt behavioural changes and children come forward to get vaccinated, then the R rate can fall
below 1. That would mean each infected person infects, on average, less than one other person - meaning the pandemic is shrinking. Asked if people should have second thoughts about going to parties as the festive season approaches, Sajid Javid says the UK is ""heading back to normal"" - but is not there yet. He reiterates that there's a need to take precautions, such as wearing a mask in busy settings. He also recommends taking lateral flow tests before attending get-togethers, or visiting potentially vulnerable people. National Medical Director of NHS England, Stephen Powis, says there is not a number of daily cases, deaths, or hospital admissions that would automatically trigger further interventions - such as the""Plan B"" of extra restrictions in England. He says it is complex and there is a variety of things
that are looked at in a decision like this. Powis says they look at infection rates, vaccine
effectiveness and the number of admissions - and also what is happening with
other admissions such as flu. ""We do see geographical variation, that is typical of the
pandemic and it is possible that we will see that variation again. ""There is no one number to look at,"" he insists. The UK reported almost 50,000 cases on Wednesday - and as this chart shows, the seven-day average daily number is not far off the peak of last January. However, although they are increasing slightly, daily deaths are way below the peak of last winter - as this chart shows. Sajid Javid says the government is ""concerned"" over cases rising and the number of deaths. But vaccines are clearly working, and areestimated to have saved 130,000 lives, he adds. The health secretary urges the public to appeal to people who haven't had their jabs to do so - and get a flu vaccine ahead of winter. He later adds he expects there to be ""a lot more flu around"" this winter, compared to last. Sajid Javid is asked by Romilly Weeks from ITV whether the government is in danger of
ignoring warning signs. âI think the plan we have set out is taking into account the
situation,â he responds. âIn my remarks, the entire focus is on what we can do to
help ourselves, obviously the government has a huge role to play, the vaccine programme,
testing programme, but we need people to take up vaccines when offered, especially
boosters."" He again called on people to stick to a testing regime - and
to remember to isolate if they have tested positive. Javid said he has contingency measures ready if the situation
âbecame more challengingâ but says âwe are not at that point yetâ. As Sajid Javid's news conference continues, here's our graphic of the latest UK virus data, which was released at 4pm. The BBC's Sophie Hutchinson asks about theNHS Confederation's warningthat more needs to be done to cut Covid rates over the winter. Sajid Javid says current levels are not ""unsustainable"" and the extra support the NHS is getting is ""certainly helping"" - but the situation will be kept under review. National Medical Director of NHS England Steven Powis says that, with infection rates rising, hospital admissions will continue to rise. And other viruses are around, adding to pressure on medical staff, he adds. Like the health secretary, he also urges people to take precautions, such as wearing masks in crowded places, as well as getting vaccinated. Ruth in Cornwall asks the health secretary whether the government should make face masks mandatory in certain settings in England again. Javid says the government has set out a clear plan - and he still feels it was ""the right decision to start to learn to live with the virus"". But he says that when it comes to face coverings, everyone should
follow guidance and think about others around them, and the setting they are in. He adds that if the government needs to turn to plan B,
it would include making face masks mandatory in some settings - which may include
public buildings. UK Health Security Agency chief executive Jenny Harries says the high level of cases isn't yet being reflected in the number of daily deaths. The most recent seven-day average of daily deaths has been ""flat"" - but daily deaths are now ""moving in the wrong direction"", she says. The number of people in hospital is also seeing a ""steady increase"" as we approach winter - although we're well off last winter's peak, she adds. ""We must get the jab when the time comes, for covid or flu,"" the health secretary says. But he suggests other ""little steps"" to help reduce the spread of Covid - including:  Javid also suggests making rapid tests a part of your weekly
routine. ""A quarter of the positive cases we are identifying, come
from those lateral flow tests,"" he says. ""These little steps make a big difference."" The ""race between"" the virus and vaccines is narrowing, Sajid Javid says, adding that the government will redouble efforts to get people to get a jab. He urges people to ""take this huge step"" towards helping themselves and others. Booster injections are ""vital"" to keeping people safe over the next few months, Javid adds. The new Delta variant is spreading and, while there's no proof it poses a greater threat, there's a need to be ready for ""whatever's around the corner"", the health secretary says. He reveals thatfour million booster jabshave been given so far - that's up from the most recent figure of 3.8m. As we reported just after 17:00, the UK has announced new antiviral drug deals. ""We should be proud that the
UK is at the forefront of treatments,"" says the health secretary. ""Dexamethasone is estimated to have saved one million lives
across the world. Some of the most vulnerable patients across the NHS are
already benefitting from ronapreve. ""We are seeing promising developments around antivirals too.
They work by targeting the virus at the early stage and disrupting the way they
develop and multiply. ""I am pleased to announce we have signed two landmark deals
to supply hundreds of thousands of doses of two new antivirals. ""These
antivirals have the potential to speed up recovery time and to stop infections
from progressing. ""If they get MHRA approval then we can provide vulnerable patients
with vital protection this summer. I want to deploy them as quickly as
possible."" Sajid Javid says winter poses the ""greatest threat"" to the recovery from Covid, with cases rising. He adds that case numbers could go as high as 100,000 per day - but that the NHS is performing with ""distinction"".  The health secretary's news conference is now under way - stay tuned for the latest top lines... Molnupiravir is one of the antiviral drugs The UK government has announced deals for Covid-19 antivirals which it says could be groundbreaking this
winter. Antivirals are
treatments used to either treat those who are infected with a virus or protect high-risk people who may have been exposed to the virus. The two new treatments are molnupiravir from Merck (MSD) and PF-07321332/ritonavir from Pfizer. The two new antivirals are
expected to be given to those most at risk from the virus, helping reduce the
severity of symptoms and ease pressure on the NHS over winter, the government says. Both first need to be evaluated by the Medicines and
Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA). A recent interim clinical trial resultssuggested that molnupiravir cuts the risk of hospitalisation or death by about half. Chair of the Antivirals Taskforce Eddie Gray said: ""This
is a very important development in our mission to find antivirals for those
exposed to Covid-19, supporting the renowned vaccination programme and the NHS
over the coming months."" The health secretary is now expected to start at 17:10 BST. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Australian ex-cricketer Michael Slater arrestedThe former batsman was arrested in Sydney over an alleged domestic violence incident.,"Mr Slater - now a cricket commentator - was arrested at his home in Sydney Former Australian cricketer Michael Slater has been arrested over an alleged domestic violence incident. The 51-year-old - now a cricket commentator - was arrested at his Sydney home on Wednesday and taken to a police station, local media reported. New South Wales Police confirmed an alleged incident happened last week. They have not disclosed further details. No charges have been laid and Mr Slater has not commented publicly. The former batsman was part of the Australian cricket team from 1993 to 2001, playing 74 Tests. He has since held prominent positions on TV but was let go last week by Australia's Channel Seven, which cited financial pressures. Mr Slater made headlines in May when he accused Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison of having ""blood on his hands"" over his response to the pandemic. It followed the government issuing a two-week ban on Australian citizens returning from India during the height of that nation's coronavirus crisis. The father-of-three had been in India at the time, commentating for local networks on the Indian Premier League season.

UK cost of living increases dip in September,"Price rises dipped slightly in September as the economy continued to reopen, according to official figures. The increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, fell to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in August. Higher prices for transport were the biggest contributor to price rises. It comes after the Bank of England warned it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation, suggesting interest rates may rise soon. The inflation rate fell back slightly last month, partly due to lower prices in the hospitality sector. Prices in restaurants and cafes rose less this summer than the last, when the government's Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running,the Office for National Statistics said.,external Under the scheme, diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Mike Hardie, head of prices at the ONS, said: ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year. ""The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer."" Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Although price rises edged lower in September, the increase of 3.1% remains far above the Bank of England's target of 2%. Last month, transport costs made the biggest contribution to price increases. Average petrol prices stood at 134.9 pence a litre, compared with 113.3 pence a litre in September of 2020, when travel was reduced under travel restrictions. The ONS added that the September 2021 price for fuel was the highest recorded since September 2013. A rise in used car prices, which were 2.9% higher in September than in August, also contributed to higher transport costs. Other factors such as demand for oil and gas rising around the world have pushed up the price of energy. Meanwhile, there are shortages and bottlenecks affecting the availability of some important goods like computer chips, which are also increasing costs for businesses. Why is the cost of living going up? Bank of England says it will act on inflation Food price rises are terrifying, warns industry Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that further price increases were expected in the coming months ""with the increase in the energy price cap, partial reversal of the VAT reductions for hospitality and tourism and persistent supply chain disruption"". He warned that rising inflation could disrupt UK's economic recovery by squeezing people's spending power and companies' profit margins. Everyone is affected by rising costs, but if you're on a low income or don't have savings to fall back on, you're more likely to feel the impact. And if your pay isn't going up in line with price rises, you may notice a fall in the ""real value"" of your wages - what you earn buys less. ""We're just starting to notice the pinch a little bit,"" Ruth Holroyd told BBC Breakfast. She usually takes on the task of doing the family's weekly shop. ""I've noticed that the prices are higher for the overall shop, but where prices stay the same for things like grapes and strawberries that come in a punnet, the punnets have shrunk, so you don't get as much."" She is mostly worried about the impact of rising energy bills. She was previously a People's Energy customer, but the firm ceased trading earlier in September, collapsing because of rising gas prices. Ruth expects that the family's energy bill will double from Â£120 to Â£250 per month. A bit of inflation is considered to be a good thing. If prices were falling, then people might delay buying non-essential items in the hope of getting them cheaper. But if prices rise too quickly, it's seen as a sign that the economy is running into difficulties. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday that price rises were a ""a real cause of some concern"", adding that the government wanted inflation rates to be lower. He suggested that price increases were partially due to higher demand as the economy reopens. ""When you see quite strong economic growth, there is always the danger you will have inflation. Now the critical question is, how long is that inflation going to last for?"" he said. He added that he had recently spoken with the governor of the Bank of England and that it was ""hopeful"" price rises would be contained. Referring to the new figures out on Wednesday, Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We can't stand down our concerns about inflation just because this number was a bit lower than expected. ""Since September, there's been a big rise in natural gas prices, a rise in petrol prices and global oil prices and from the Bank of England's point of view, we've also seen more people start to get worried about inflation."" She warned that the economy was not ""out of the woods yet"". Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Sunday that the Bank of England ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4% before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. Governor Andrew Bailey's warning on Sunday is seen as his clearest hint yet that interest rates will rise. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in a bid to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In principle, it means that when borrowing costs rises, such as when mortgages become more expensive, people spend less and prices are driven down. Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought. The slight easing of inflation in September comes more as a temporary respite in the surging cost of living than a sign that it's over. Last month's figures compared August with a year before, when prices in restaurants and hotels were artificially low because of the government's Eat out to Help Out scheme. This month's figures, by contrast, compare prices now with where they were in September 2020, when the scheme was no longer operating. The average rise in the cost of living of 3.1% masked sharp price rises in items such as air fares, up 9.7%, or carpets, up 9.6%. And there are signs of further inflationary pressure coming down the line, with manufacturers paying 11.4% more for raw materials and prices of goods leaving the factory gate up 6.7% - the biggest rise in a decade. An interest rate rise by the end of the year, with rates continuing to rise in the new year, still looks more likely than not. Why are prices rising in the UK?

The US firm added 4.4 million users in the three months to 30 September, more than double the previous quarter. Korean TV series Squid Game was its biggest hit, watched by 142 million households in its first four weeks. It comes as some Netflix staff prepare to walk out on Wednesday amid a backlash over comedian Dave Chappelle. They accuse the star of mocking transgender people in his latest Netflix special, but the firm has defended him. The strong performance for Netflix follows a sluggish start to 2021, when the surging demand for streaming  seen earlier on in the pandemic petered out. The US firm - which is the world's largest streaming platform - now expects to add some 8.5 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter, above analysts' expectations. It's being driven by popular shows such as Sex Education, the Queen's Gambit and the global smash Squid Game. Squid Game warning sent to parents by council Squid Game knocks Bridgerton off Netflix top spot The dystopian series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money - has become a viral sensation and dethroned period drama Bridgerton as Netflix's most popular show to date. According to Bloomberg,external, the Korean series is thought to be worth some $900m to the streaming giant, after costing $21.4m to make. Another non-English language show, La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), also did well, with series five being watched by 69 million viewers in its first four weeks. ""We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world,""Netflix said in a letter to shareholders,external. The firm expects to attract more new users in the run up to Chirstmas with returning seasons of popular shows such as ""Tiger King"" and ""Cobra Kai"". It also agreed to acquire the Roald Dahl Story Company in September, pending regulatory approval, so will own the rights to titles like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda. A special by comedian Dave Chappelle sparked anger among some Netflix staff The David Chappelle special ""The Closer"" saw the boundary-pushing comic joking that ""gender is a fact"" and accuse LGBTQ people of being ""too sensitive"". In one skit, Mr Chappelle, who is black, says: ""In our country you can shoot and kill [a black man], but you'd better not hurt a gay person's feelings."" Ahead of a rally on Wednesday at Netflix's California headquarters, a group representing trans staff told the firm to stop ""platforming hate speech"" and issued a series of demands. ""We want the company to adopt measures in the areas of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction, all of which are necessary to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,"" they said in a statement. In a memo to staff earlier this month, Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos acknowledged some staff were ""left angry"" by Mr Chappelle's show, but defended the comic's artistic freedom and said the material had not caused ""real world harm"". On Tuesday, however, Mr Sarandostold Deadline,externalhe regretted this initial response and should have done more to recognise staff's ""pain"". But he also said the firm did not plan to take down, edit or add content warnings to Mr Chappelle's show. ""Stand-up comedy is a pretty singular voice art form,"" he told Deadline. ""We really don't get involved and interfere with the material itself, and I think it's consistent with a brand of stand-up comedy and certainly consistent with Dave Chappelle's comedy, so I don't think a warning card or an edit would've been appropriate.""

"Care staff shortage harming services, say managers","Managers of community care services supporting more than 15,000 people in England, say acute staff shortages are forcing them to turn down new clients. The National Care Forum of mainly not-for-profit organisations, says care providers are having to make tough decisions about who they can help. Last week health bosses said the care shortage meant more patients judged fit to go home were stuck in hospital. The government is promising extra money to train and recruit new care workers. Care staff shortages pile pressure on NHS How do I find a new job and who is hiring? Care providers are facing acute problems in recruiting and retaining frontline staff for a variety of reasons including burnout from the pandemic and higher pay rates being available elsewhere as the economy picks up. Managers told researchers many existing staff were struggling with an increased workload and wanted to quit. Researchers for National Care Forum (NCF), together with the Outstanding Managers Network, questioned 340 managers and said their answers highlighted the ""stark reality"" in the care sector. Between them, those questioned employ more than 21,000 staff who care for more than 15,000 people at home or in care homes. The findings suggest that they have nearly a fifth of positions vacant, with backroom staff having to fill in as frontline carers. More than two thirds said they were having to stop or limit services. These pressures are resulting in having to say no to new clients, including those being discharged from hospital, researchers say. In other instances, managers say they have had to hand home-care contracts back to councils. The researchers estimate that, between them, they have turned down nearly 5,000 requests for help in the past six weeks. Hospitals are already warning of the knock on effect this is having on them, and managers fear that with existing workers exhausted, this may be just the beginning of the staffing crisis. One manager told the researchers it was ""heartbreaking, turning down 10 plus packages of care that are needed a day"". Another, in the same position, said: ""Sadly, have not got enough staff to look after them safely"". Another was worried about financial viability, having increased wages to compete for staff, without any increase in funding. A fourth was ""seriously considering having to close"". NCF chief executive, Vic Rayner, said the findings were ""uncomfortable reading and offer evidence of the stark reality"". ""Providers are having to make very difficult decisions about who they can support, sometimes resulting in people with high or complex needs not getting access to the care and support they desperately need,"" Mr Rayner added. Separate research, last week,suggested that more care jobs are unfilled than before the pandemic,external. NHS Providers, which represents health service trusts, has called the situation ""dire"" and particularly worrying with winter about to put extra pressure on services. A Department of Health and Social Care official said the government was providing at least Â£500m to support the care workforce as part of the Â£5.4bn to reform social care. ""We are also working to ensure we have the right number of staff with the skills to deliver high quality care to meet increasing demands,"" said the statement.

Australian ex-cricketer Michael Slater arrested,"Mr Slater - now a cricket commentator - was arrested at his home in Sydney Former Australian cricketer Michael Slater has been arrested over an alleged domestic violence incident. The 51-year-old - now a cricket commentator - was arrested at his Sydney home on Wednesday and taken to a police station, local media reported. New South Wales Police confirmed an alleged incident happened last week. They have not disclosed further details. No charges have been laid and Mr Slater has not commented publicly. The former batsman was part of the Australian cricket team from 1993 to 2001, playing 74 Tests. He has since held prominent positions on TV but was let go last week by Australia's Channel Seven, which cited financial pressures. Mr Slater made headlines in May when he accused Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison of having ""blood on his hands"" over his response to the pandemic. It followed the government issuing a two-week ban on Australian citizens returning from India during the height of that nation's coronavirus crisis. The father-of-three had been in India at the time, commentating for local networks on the Indian Premier League season.

"Average cash withdrawal climbs to Â£80The average amount Britons take out of cash machines rises by over Â£10, but there are fewer visits.Business","People are taking out more money when they visit ATMs, with the average amount climbing more than Â£10 to just under Â£80 in the last two years. But they're using cash machines 40% less than before and withdrawing Â£44 a month less. Withdrawals are now nearly Â£100m less a day than in 2019, said cash machine network Link. ""Covid has turbocharged the switch to digital,"" said Nick Quin, head of financial inclusion at the network. Before the pandemic, each adult in the UK visited a cash machine on average three times a month, taking out on average Â£66.99. That amount has climbed to Â£78.54. However, 18 months after the coronavirus crisis started, visits are now less than twice a month. That means the total average amount each month withdrawn per person has fallen Â£44, from Â£200.97 to Â£157.08. Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK The total value of Link ATM withdrawals is currently running at around Â£1.6bn a week, compared with around Â£2.2bn in 2019. Meanwhile the amount people can spend on a contactless card rocketed to Â£100 earlier this month, after climbing to Â£45 in April 2020. ""Crucially, even though we're withdrawing almost Â£100m less per day, millions still rely on cash, especially in the most deprived areas of the country,"" said Mr Quin. ""It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country."" The latestFinancial Lives survey from the Financial Conduct Authority,externalshowed that more than five million people rely on cash every day. Link's new figures suggest that some wealthier parts of Edinburgh and London have shown a fall in cash machine use by as much as 60%. But there remains a greater reliance on cash in areas such as Liverpool, Bradford and Birmingham where the fall in ATM usage is considerably smaller. Link said it heard from more 400 communities this year wanting better cash access. It has installed more than 70 machines across the country in response to those requests and a further 30 in areas identified as lacking cash access. It said it is encouraging people to speak up if they find it difficult to access cash free of charge. ""It is important we continue to protect access to cash across the country,"" said Mr Quin. Link said the number of ATMs has not dropped as quickly as cash usage. Since the beginning of the pandemic, the number of free-to-use ATMs has dropped 9% from 45,000 to 41,000. In July the Financial Conduct Authority warned that people living in rural areas are having to travel further to find somewhere to withdraw and deposit cash free of charge. The City watchdog said almost every urban resident has access to a bank, building society, post office or ATM within two kilometres of their home, but only three-quarters of the UK rural population has similar access. It is considering stronger requirements of the sector to ensure the millions of people who rely on notes and coins have access to it. Meanwhile the charity Age UK said that people required the same guarantee of access to cash as they did for running water, electricity and the post. About 2.4 million people aged 65-and-over rely on cash in their daily lives, it said. The charity warned that many would face being excluded from society if they could not get hold of notes and coins. Constituency areas with the smallest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals: Liverpool Walton, 20% Bradford South, 20% Birmingham, Hodge Hill, 20% Leicester East, 21% Bradford East, 22% Boston and Skegness, 23% Birmingham, Perry Barr, 23% Warley, 24% Cynon Valley, 25% Rochdale, 25% *based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021 Constituency areas with the biggest percentage declines in the volume of cash withdrawals: Edinburgh East, 63% Cities of London and Westminster, 60% Edinburgh North and Leith, 60% Holborn and St Pancras, 58% Edinburgh South, 56% Glasgow Central, 56% Edinburgh West, 56% Crawley, 55% Belfast South, 54% Bristol West, 53% *based on figures from Link comparing August 2019 with August 2021 Rural vacuum for getting hold of cash Cash access as vital as running water, says Age UK Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Science shortfall risks prosperity - ex-ministerThe science committee chair will hear of the impact of possible changes to research spending.Science & Environment,"Vaccine pioneer Prof Sir Andrew Pollard: ""Our very lives depend on our investment in science."" One of the scientists behind the Oxford Covid vaccine has said that our lives depend on future investment in science. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard told BBC News that other nations will overtake the UK unless the Chancellor sticks to his commitment to double science spending. Scientific leaders have been making representations to the Treasury ahead of next week's Autumn Budget. There is concern that a pledge to increase funding to Â£22bn by 2024 will not be met. Prof Pollard told BBC News: ""Our very lives depend on our investment in science because so much of what we aspire to in our society requires a strong scientific base. We absolutely have to invest in science otherwise we will fall behind other countries over the months and years ahead."" Those lobbying the Treasury to stick to its commitment have highlighted the key role UK science played in developing vaccines, drugs and providing invaluable scientific advice to the public and ministers throughout the pandemic. And the chair of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, Greg Clark, said a failure to keep to the pledge could threaten the UK's economic growth: ""As we prepare to compete as a country in the future, it is unquestionable that one of our strongest assets is our science and technology base. ""The world is becoming scientifically more intensive. For us to go backwards would be to opt out of future prosperity."" Two British Nobel prize winners gave evidence to Mr Clark's committee this morning. One, Prof Sir Paul Nurse, said: ""We have to have a country that thrives on brains and skills and that is driven by science and research."" The other, Prof Sir Peter Ratcliffe, told MPs that the UK government failing to invest in science would be like New Zealand not investing in rugby. ""We are good at it. Why wouldn't you invest behind strength,"" he said. ""You might get away with slightly smaller investment than other countries for a while, but that's not going to last."" In November 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to double the amount the government spends on scientific research. That pledge was reinforced by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak in March 2020, when he committed the government to the Â£22bn increase. The spending hike was to keep up with the UK's economic competitors, which have been investing heavily in research. British science is seen as among the best in the world, but successive governments have been spending a smaller proportion of GDP on research and development (R&D) compared with other advanced economies. The UK's increase in R&D spending as a proportion of GDP between 1999 and 2019 has been 0.1%, considerably less than many of its economic competitors. The ambitious spending boost announced by the Chancellor last year was to help the government meet another of its objectives: for private and public spending on research in the UK to reach 2.4% of GDP by 2027. But even that target is a relatively modest aim as it would still leave the UK behind Germany, Japan, Korea and the US. An analysis by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) indicates that if the government puts off increasing annual research spending to Â£22bn by 2024 by three years it will lose Â£11bn of investment from the private sector and so fail to reach its target of 2.4% of GDP. Prof Sarah Main, who is the campaign's executive director, said that without the investment that has been promised, the UK could lose jobs and economic growth in the process: ""While the UK target is ambitious, it is the least ambitious target of all the G7 countries,"" she told BBC News. ""Across the world, other countries are pushing fast and hard on their science and innovation capability. The risk is that ideas, talented people and opportunities for investment ad partnerships will move overseas."" Those close to negotiations with the Treasury told BBC News they received ""strong signals"" last week that, while the government would maintain its target of increasing annual science spending to Â£22bn, it would not commit to do so by 2024. There was also concern that the chancellor would give the appearance of an increase by adding existing spending to the science budget - but the reality could be flat cash for several more years. With a week to go before the chancellor's Autumn budget, all the submissions have been made. The Treasury has produced its calculations and come up with its plan. The proposed budgets for each part of government are now in a political phase and simply put, it is now up to Boris Johnson whether to exert pressure on the Treasury to deliver on the promise he made to transform the UK economy into a ""science superpower"".

"Breaking|Breaking newsUK cost of living increases dip in SeptemberAccording to the Office for National Statistics, the UK inflation rate fell slightly to 3.1% in September.Business","Price rises dipped slightly in September as the economy continued to reopen, according to official figures. The increase in the cost of living, as measured by the Consumer Prices Index, fell to 3.1% in the year to September, down from 3.2% in August. Higher prices for transport were the biggest contributor to price rises. It comes after the Bank of England warned it ""will have to act"" over rising inflation, suggesting interest rates may rise soon. The inflation rate fell back slightly last month, partly due to lower prices in the hospitality sector. Prices in restaurants and cafes rose less this summer than the last, when the government's Eat Out to Help Out Scheme was running,the Office for National Statistics said.,external Under the scheme, diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. Mike Hardie, head of prices at the ONS, said: ""However, this was partially offset by most other categories, including price rises for furniture and household goods and food prices falling more slowly than this time last year. ""The costs of goods produced by factories rose again, with metals and machinery showing a notable price rise. Road freight costs for UK businesses also continued to rise across the summer."" Simply put, inflation is the rate at which prices are rising - if the cost of a Â£1 jar of jam rises by 5p, then jam inflation is 5%. It applies to services too, like having your nails done or getting your car valeted. You may not notice low levels of inflation from month to month, but in the long term, these price rises can have a big impact on how much you can buy with your money. Read more about inflation here. Although price rises edged lower in September, the increase of 3.1% remains far above the Bank of England's target of 2%. Last month, transport costs made the biggest contribution to price increases. Average petrol prices stood at 134.9 pence a litre, compared with 113.3 pence a litre in September of 2020, when travel was reduced under travel restrictions. The ONS added that the September 2021 price for fuel was the highest recorded since September 2013. A rise in used car prices, which were 2.9% higher in September than in August, also contributed to higher transport costs. Other factors such as demand for oil and gas rising around the world have pushed up the price of energy. Meanwhile, there are shortages and bottlenecks affecting the availability of some important goods like computer chips, which are also increasing costs for businesses. Why is the cost of living going up? Bank of England says it will act on inflation Food price rises are terrifying, warns industry Suren Thiru, head of economics at the British Chambers of Commerce, said that further price increases were expected in the coming months ""with the increase in the energy price cap, partial reversal of the VAT reductions for hospitality and tourism and persistent supply chain disruption"". He warned that rising inflation could disrupt UK's economic recovery by squeezing people's spending power and companies' profit margins. Everyone is affected by rising costs, but if you're on a low income or don't have savings to fall back on, you're more likely to feel the impact. And if your pay isn't going up in line with price rises, you may notice a fall in the ""real value"" of your wages - what you earn buys less. ""We're just starting to notice the pinch a little bit,"" Ruth Holroyd told BBC Breakfast. She usually takes on the task of doing the family's weekly shop. ""I've noticed that the prices are higher for the overall shop, but where prices stay the same for things like grapes and strawberries that come in a punnet, the punnets have shrunk, so you don't get as much."" She is mostly worried about the impact of rising energy bills. She was previously a People's Energy customer, but the firm ceased trading earlier in September, collapsing because of rising gas prices. Ruth expects that the family's energy bill will double from Â£120 to Â£250 per month. A bit of inflation is considered to be a good thing. If prices were falling, then people might delay buying non-essential items in the hope of getting them cheaper. But if prices rise too quickly, it's seen as a sign that the economy is running into difficulties. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told BBC Breakfast on Wednesday that price rises were a ""a real cause of some concern"", adding that the government wanted inflation rates to be lower. He suggested that price increases were partially due to higher demand as the economy reopens. ""When you see quite strong economic growth, there is always the danger you will have inflation. Now the critical question is, how long is that inflation going to last for?"" he said. He added that he had recently spoken with the governor of the Bank of England and that it was ""hopeful"" price rises would be contained. Referring to the new figures out on Wednesday, Liz Martins, senior economist at HSBC, told the BBC's Today programme: ""We can't stand down our concerns about inflation just because this number was a bit lower than expected. ""Since September, there's been a big rise in natural gas prices, a rise in petrol prices and global oil prices and from the Bank of England's point of view, we've also seen more people start to get worried about inflation."" She warned that the economy was not ""out of the woods yet"". Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey warned on Sunday that the Bank of England ""will have to act"" over rising inflation. The Bank has already said UK inflation is set to exceed 4% before falling back as the economy recovers from Covid. Governor Andrew Bailey's warning on Sunday is seen as his clearest hint yet that interest rates will rise. The UK's central bank can raise interest rates in a bid to tackle inflation if prices are rising quickly. In principle, it means that when borrowing costs rises, such as when mortgages become more expensive, people spend less and prices are driven down. Investors are expecting interest rates to be raised later this year or early in 2022, in an effort to bring inflation back down to the Bank's2% target. However, he gave no suggestion of when the Bank might increase rates from the current record low of 0.1%. The governor said that rising energy bills could push inflation higher for longer than previously thought. The slight easing of inflation in September comes more as a temporary respite in the surging cost of living than a sign that it's over. Last month's figures compared August with a year before, when prices in restaurants and hotels were artificially low because of the government's Eat out to Help Out scheme. This month's figures, by contrast, compare prices now with where they were in September 2020, when the scheme was no longer operating. The average rise in the cost of living of 3.1% masked sharp price rises in items such as air fares, up 9.7%, or carpets, up 9.6%. And there are signs of further inflationary pressure coming down the line, with manufacturers paying 11.4% more for raw materials and prices of goods leaving the factory gate up 6.7% - the biggest rise in a decade. An interest rate rise by the end of the year, with rates continuing to rise in the new year, still looks more likely than not. Why are prices rising in the UK?

Science cuts would harm prosperity - ex-minister,"Vaccine pioneer Prof Sir Andrew Pollard: ""Our very lives depend on our investment in science."" One of the scientists behind the Oxford Covid vaccine has said that our lives depend on future investment in science. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard told BBC News that other nations will overtake the UK unless the Chancellor sticks to his commitment to double science spending. Scientific leaders have been making representations to the Treasury ahead of next week's Autumn Budget. There is concern that a pledge to increase funding to Â£22bn by 2024 will not be met. Prof Pollard told BBC News: ""Our very lives depend on our investment in science because so much of what we aspire to in our society requires a strong scientific base. We absolutely have to invest in science otherwise we will fall behind other countries over the months and years ahead."" Those lobbying the Treasury to stick to its commitment have highlighted the key role UK science played in developing vaccines, drugs and providing invaluable scientific advice to the public and ministers throughout the pandemic. And the chair of the Commons Science and Technology Committee, Greg Clark, said a failure to keep to the pledge could threaten the UK's economic growth: ""As we prepare to compete as a country in the future, it is unquestionable that one of our strongest assets is our science and technology base. ""The world is becoming scientifically more intensive. For us to go backwards would be to opt out of future prosperity."" Two British Nobel prize winners gave evidence to Mr Clark's committee this morning. One, Prof Sir Paul Nurse, said: ""We have to have a country that thrives on brains and skills and that is driven by science and research."" The other, Prof Sir Peter Ratcliffe, told MPs that the UK government failing to invest in science would be like New Zealand not investing in rugby. ""We are good at it. Why wouldn't you invest behind strength,"" he said. ""You might get away with slightly smaller investment than other countries for a while, but that's not going to last."" In November 2019, Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to double the amount the government spends on scientific research. That pledge was reinforced by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak in March 2020, when he committed the government to the Â£22bn increase. The spending hike was to keep up with the UK's economic competitors, which have been investing heavily in research. British science is seen as among the best in the world, but successive governments have been spending a smaller proportion of GDP on research and development (R&D) compared with other advanced economies. The UK's increase in R&D spending as a proportion of GDP between 1999 and 2019 has been 0.1%, considerably less than many of its economic competitors. The ambitious spending boost announced by the Chancellor last year was to help the government meet another of its objectives: for private and public spending on research in the UK to reach 2.4% of GDP by 2027. But even that target is a relatively modest aim as it would still leave the UK behind Germany, Japan, Korea and the US. An analysis by the Campaign for Science and Engineering (Case) indicates that if the government puts off increasing annual research spending to Â£22bn by 2024 by three years it will lose Â£11bn of investment from the private sector and so fail to reach its target of 2.4% of GDP. Prof Sarah Main, who is the campaign's executive director, said that without the investment that has been promised, the UK could lose jobs and economic growth in the process: ""While the UK target is ambitious, it is the least ambitious target of all the G7 countries,"" she told BBC News. ""Across the world, other countries are pushing fast and hard on their science and innovation capability. The risk is that ideas, talented people and opportunities for investment ad partnerships will move overseas."" Those close to negotiations with the Treasury told BBC News they received ""strong signals"" last week that, while the government would maintain its target of increasing annual science spending to Â£22bn, it would not commit to do so by 2024. There was also concern that the chancellor would give the appearance of an increase by adding existing spending to the science budget - but the reality could be flat cash for several more years. With a week to go before the chancellor's Autumn budget, all the submissions have been made. The Treasury has produced its calculations and come up with its plan. The proposed budgets for each part of government are now in a political phase and simply put, it is now up to Boris Johnson whether to exert pressure on the Treasury to deliver on the promise he made to transform the UK economy into a ""science superpower"".

Squid Game helps Netflix subscriptions bounce back,"Squid Game was watched by 142 million households in its first four weeks Netflix subscriptions picked up in the third quarter of 2021 as non-English language shows continued to be the streaming platform's best performers. The US firm added 4.4 million users in the three months to 30 September, more than double the previous quarter. Korean TV series Squid Game was its biggest hit, watched by 142 million households in its first four weeks. It comes as some Netflix staff prepare to walk out on Wednesday amid a backlash over comedian Dave Chappelle. They accuse the star of mocking transgender people in his latest Netflix special, but the firm has defended him. The strong performance for Netflix follows a sluggish start to 2021, when the surging demand for streaming  seen earlier on in the pandemic petered out. The US firm - which is the world's largest streaming platform - now expects to add some 8.5 million new subscribers in the fourth quarter, above analysts' expectations. It's being driven by popular shows such as Sex Education, the Queen's Gambit and the global smash Squid Game. Squid Game warning sent to parents by council Squid Game knocks Bridgerton off Netflix top spot The dystopian series - which tells the story of a group of people forced to play deadly children's games for money - has become a viral sensation and dethroned period drama Bridgerton as Netflix's most popular show to date. According to Bloomberg,external, the Korean series is thought to be worth some $900m to the streaming giant, after costing $21.4m to make. Another non-English language show, La Casa de Papel (aka Money Heist), also did well, with series five being watched by 69 million viewers in its first four weeks. ""We are now producing local TV and film in approximately 45 countries and have built deep relationships with creative communities around the world,""Netflix said in a letter to shareholders,external. The firm expects to attract more new users in the run up to Chirstmas with returning seasons of popular shows such as ""Tiger King"" and ""Cobra Kai"". It also agreed to acquire the Roald Dahl Story Company in September, pending regulatory approval, so will own the rights to titles like Charlie and the Chocolate Factory and Matilda. A special by comedian Dave Chappelle sparked anger among some Netflix staff The David Chappelle special ""The Closer"" saw the boundary-pushing comic joking that ""gender is a fact"" and accuse LGBTQ people of being ""too sensitive"". In one skit, Mr Chappelle, who is black, says: ""In our country you can shoot and kill [a black man], but you'd better not hurt a gay person's feelings."" Ahead of a rally on Wednesday at Netflix's California headquarters, a group representing trans staff told the firm to stop ""platforming hate speech"" and issued a series of demands. ""We want the company to adopt measures in the areas of content investment, employee relations and safety, and harm reduction, all of which are necessary to avoid future instances of platforming transphobia and hate speech,"" they said in a statement. In a memo to staff earlier this month, Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos acknowledged some staff were ""left angry"" by Mr Chappelle's show, but defended the comic's artistic freedom and said the material had not caused ""real world harm"". On Tuesday, however, Mr Sarandostold Deadline,externalhe regretted this initial response and should have done more to recognise staff's ""pain"". But he also said the firm did not plan to take down, edit or add content warnings to Mr Chappelle's show. ""Stand-up comedy is a pretty singular voice art form,"" he told Deadline. ""We really don't get involved and interfere with the material itself, and I think it's consistent with a brand of stand-up comedy and certainly consistent with Dave Chappelle's comedy, so I don't think a warning card or an edit would've been appropriate.""
