NI SoS criticised over failure to meet partiesRCN nurses in NI are set to strike for the first time on Wednesday amid complaints about pay.Northern Ireland,"Four of Stormont's main parties have criticised Julian Smith after refusing to meet with them Stormont parties have criticised the secretary of state for not meeting them on Tuesday to discuss the upcoming healthcare strike. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP, Alliance and the UUP all hit out at the decision. The NIO said health is a devolved matter. About 9,000 nurses are to strike for 12 hours on Wednesday from 08:00 GMT. The five main Stormont party leaders have sent a letter to Julian Smith, which they said ""provides cover"" for him to intervene. The Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) said the strikes pose a ""major challenge"". The latest information on strike action and how it might affect patients can be found onthe Health and Social Care Board website.,external Representatives from the five parties met with with the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service, David Sterling, and Department of Health Permanent Secretary Richard Pengelly on Tuesday afternoon in a last-minute effort to avert the strike action. That meeting was unsuccessful. The parties had hoped they could then meet with Mr Smith, but the Northern Ireland Office said health remained a devolved matter. Nichola Mallon at Stormont on Tuesday evening SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon said she is ""angry"" Mr Smith did not meet the parties. ""On the eve of significant strike action in our health service by healthcare workers who have been left with no other choice, it is unacceptable that the secretary of state chose not to engage with parties this evening. ""What message does that send to healthcare staff?"" she asked. This video can not be played Nurse's plea to politicians in Northern Ireland Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill said the decision not to meet was ""regrettable"". ""The pay and staffing issue must not be used as a political football within the talks,"" she said. ""Party leaders restated there is consensus if the Executive is restored byÂ 13 JanuaryÂ that we will adopt a policy to award pay parity."" The letter to Julian Smith, signed by Arlene Foster, Michelle O'Neill, Naomi Long, Colum Eastwood and Steve Aiken, said there was ""collective support for the restoration of pay parity"". ""In our view this statement, making clear that any health and finance ministers in any future Northern Ireland Executive formed before 13 January 2020 would restore pay parity, provides cover for you as secretary of state to intervene to ensure that pay parity is restored independently of the ongoing talks to restore the Executive,"" the letter said. Health crisis: Nurses continue industrial action Health crisis 'years in the making' Steve Aiken, leader of the UUP, said: ""Here we had today an opportunity for both politicians here and for the secretary of state to do what was right."" Alliance leader Naomi Long said: ""It is disappointing that on such an important issue, one that effects people in Northern Ireland directly and could have serious consequences tomorrow, he wasn't willing to actually come into the room and have the conversation with us this evening."" Nurses and other healthcare workers have been taking industrial action for several weeks amid complaints of poor pay and staffing levels. Paramedics are set to take 24-hour strike action. A spokesperson for Health and Social Care Board (HSCB) said ""major challenges are expected across all health and social care services in Northern Ireland tomorrow"". The HSCB announced that the South Tyrone Hospital Minor Injury Unit (MIU), Mid Ulster MIU, Bangor MIU and Ards MIU will all be closed on Wednesday. It also advised that if patients or service users have not been contacted about their Trust then they should attend their appointment/ service as normal. All emergency departments remain open, but ""significant pressure"" was expected within the departments. ""The priority will be on the treating emergency and life threatening conditions first. Patients with less urgent conditions may have to wait for lengthy periods,"" said the spokesperson. By Marie-Louise Connolly, BBC News NI Health Correspondent There are just under 2,800 unfilled nursing posts within the health service in Northern Ireland. The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) estimates that a similar level of unfilled posts exists within nursing homes. The nursing vacancy rate in NI is within 13%, compared with about 11% in England and about 6% in Scotland. This means that for every eight nurses who should be working in Northern Ireland, one is missing. Nurses are demanding better work force planning. Last year, the local health service spent Â£52m on agency nurses to fill these gaps in the workforce. That money, the RCN argues, could be better managed to train and pay health service nurses. These are exceptional times which require an exceptional intervention. The RCN says no time is a good time to strike but years of negotiations between various health ministers failed and years of warnings were ignored. Kevin McAdam from the Unite union said the trade unions were ""working hard"" to ensure there was necessary staff cover. ""All of the local reps (of the trade unions) have been given authority to ensure that where critical care is required it is delivered,"" he added. Trade unions have said they are working to ensure there is necessary staff cover Anne Speed from Unison said joint meetings were taking place with employers on Tuesday and that it had provided an exemption from striking for staff working in ""cancer treatment and children's homes"". The Royal College of Nursing (RCN) said it was working with management to ensure there is enough staff cover in ""critical departments"". The heads of all of Northern Ireland's health trusts have stated the current crisis in the servicehas been ""years in the making"".

Teenager jailed for lawyer's screwdriver murder,"This video can not be played Ewan Ireland caught on CCTV shoplifting screwdrivers A teenager who stabbed a lawyer to death with a screwdriver as he was walking home from work has been jailed for a minimum of 15 years. Ewan Ireland was 17 when he attacked Peter Duncan, 52, at the entrance to a shopping centre in Newcastle in August. A court heard the two brushed past each other when the teenager pulled out a screwdriver he had shoplifted and stabbed Mr Duncan in the heart. Ireland admitted murder and was jailed for life with a minimum of 15 years. The killer, who was able to be identified after he turned 18 in October, had 17 previous convictions for 31 offences between 2017 and 2019. At the time of the murder he was on bail for an offence of affray, was under investigation for a robbery and still subject to a 12-month conditional discharge for a battery offence the previous summer. In a victim impact statement read out at Newcastle Crown Court, Mr Duncan's widow Maria said her life ""was ruined by a senseless and unprovoked act"". ""The person who did this had convictions. Nothing stopped him. He continued and he murdered my husband,"" she said. Peter Duncan's family described him as a ""devoted father and husband"" Mr Duncan came into contact with Ireland at the entrance to Eldon Square shopping centre when they were walking in opposite directions. The court heard the teenager was looking for another youth with whom he had previously argued about cigarettes. Mr Duncan, who was an in-house lawyer for an international maritime firm, raised his arm to let Ireland past, but ""the defendant took exception to that"" and a struggle ensued, prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said. After pushing him off, Mr Duncan was stabbed once through the heart and collapsed a short distance away near a Greggs outlet. The court heard Mr Duncan's 15-year-old son was in the city centre that evening for a cinema trip and saw the cordoned off area without realising his father had been attacked. ""I am angry he was out free, and cannot understand why he was not locked up,"" he said in a victim impact statement. ""If he had been we would still have my dad to this day."" Ewan Ireland had a string of convictions when he murdered Mr Duncan During sentencing, Mr Justice Lavender said it was Mr Duncan's ""bad luck to bump into you that day on his way home from work"". ""You started a fight, in the course of which you took out a screwdriver and stabbed him through the heart,"" he said. The judge said Ireland's offending started at the age of 14, with a string of convictions including theft, battery and making threats with knives. ""All too often, young men like you, who get into the habit of carrying weapons and using them to threaten others, move on to using those weapons to harm others, as you have done,"" he added. Ireland also admitted stealing screwdrivers and carrying an offensive weapon. Caroline Goodwin QC, defending, said the teenager ""had spoken of his absolute remorse and devastation at the act he occasioned which was needless and senseless and took away from the family their father"". The court heard Mr Duncan had been in the wrong place at the wrong time Det Ch Insp Jane Fairlamb said Ireland had been a promising young footballer who had been offered a lot of help to change his criminal behaviour. ""I think one of the most shocking elements of this crime is that it was in such a public place in a major shopping centre in our city and we probably all had that feeling that it could have been any one of us walking home from work,"" she said. ""With every contact that Ewan Ireland has had with the police and criminal justice system he gets opportunities to change his behaviour - support from different agencies to change that life of crime - he's had those opportunities."" She also said Mr Duncan's family was devastated by the loss and she did not have the words to express how deeply they were grieving.

NHS board to take action over hospital contractor,"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has instructed legal action against a contractor involved in the construction of its biggest hospital. Brookfield Multiplex was responsible for the design and construction of the Â£575m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) complex in Glasgow. There have beenproblems at the campussince it opened in 2015. Lawyers have been instructed to raise court proceedings against the contractor ""as a matter of urgency"". MacRoberts LLP are acting on behalf of the health board, according to official papers. Apublic inquiry is expectedto look at how the design, handover and maintenance contributed to ineffective infection control at the QEUH complex. It will also cover the new children's hospital in Edinburgh, which also involved Brookfield Multiplex. This was due to open in 2017, but will now not be ready until next autumn at the earliestafter serious problems with the ventilation systemwere uncovered. Chief executive at NHS Glasgow and Greater Clyde, Jane Grant, confirmed that the board had agreed the legal move but she added no further comment would be made about the proceedings. Last month,NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde was placed in ""special measures""following issues over infection prevention, management and control at the hospitals. In January it emerged thattwo patients at the QEUH had died after contracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings. In November it came to light that two children who had died in 2017 at the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC), which is part of the complex, were treated on award affected by water contamination. That year it was also announced thatcladding similar to that used on Grenfell Towerwould be replaced, at a cost to the taxpayer of Â£6m. In 2018 a panel fell from the 10th floor of the QEUH, shattering near the front entrance. No-one was injured, but safety netting was erected around the hospital. Reports claimed panels had fallen from the building on at least three occasions since it opened. The health board said an investigation into what caused the fall was inconclusive. 10-year-old Milly Main, pictured here with her mother, died in 2017 In 2017, 10-year-old Milly Main was recovering from leukaemia at the Royal Hospital for Children. But her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Milly went into toxic shock and died days later. Her family say they were kept in the dark about a potential link to contaminated water problems at the hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time. At the end of last month, the board was placed in ""special measures"". Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said stage four of the NHS Board Performance Escalation Framework was necessary to implement because of the issues over infection prevention and control. The move in effect means an oversight board is in place, chaired by chief nursing officer Prof Fiona McQueen. Both NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Ms Freeman have apologised to the parents of two children who died at the hospital. Three-year-old Mason Djemat, who was being treated for a rare genetic disease, died on 9 August 2017. Milly died three weeks later while recovering from leukaemia treatment. Both were treated on a ward affected by water contamination at the Royal Hospital for Children. The trials of Scotland's super hospital The troubled past of the QEUH Jane Grant, chief executive of NHS GGC, said ""Since its opening, a number of issues have arisen around the operational effectiveness of the hospital which have impacted on the seamless delivery of safe and effective healthcare. ""I am sorry for the distress this has caused."" She added that she had commissioned three reviews, which had considered capacity, facilities and clinical outcomes at the hospitals. They had ""confirmed a number of issues"" which the board are ""determined to resolve"", she said. Ms Grant continued: ""Having sought independent legal advice, we can confirm the board today has agreed to pursue legal action. ""In light of this, the report we commissioned on facilities and environmental impact cannot be published as this would potentially cause significant prejudice to NHS GGC. ""We will, however, publish the report when it is possible, but at the moment we are unable to comment any further on legal proceedings.""

Pet ban for woman who gagged dog to go on holidayElizabeth Steel left the Collie cross without food or water while she went away for the weekend.,"Elizabeth Steel covered the dog's face face with a taped-on muzzle so it could not bark A dog owner who gagged her pet with duct tape to go on holiday for the weekend has been banned from keeping animals for 15 years Elizabeth Steel abandoned the Collie cross without adequate food or water after covering its face with a taped-on muzzle so it could not bark. Neighbours in Kilmarnock, East Ayrshire, alerted police after hearing the animal whimpering. Steel, 44, admitted causing unnecessary suffering to the dog. Sheriff Alistair Watson placed her on supervision for 18 months and also imposed an 80-day tagging order. He said: ""Ordinary members of the public would be absolutely shocked about what you did here, and when I heard the circumstances I was disgusted."" Police forced entry to Steel's home after the neighbour spotted the dog, called Rio, through a window. He was found to be infested with fleas and suffering from sores and a skin condition, the town's sheriff court heard. Steel admitted causing unnecessary suffering by taping a muzzle to the dog's face, denying it food, water or a means of escape, and failing to provide adequate care and treatment between 18 and 19 July. Blaire Ford, prosecuting, said an upstairs neighbour could hear whimpering below and knew Steel had left the day before for a weekend away. Miss Ford added: ""He looked through the kitchen window and observed the dog locked within the kitchen with a muzzle on, which was wrapped with black tape, and noted that there was no food or water."" The man called the Scottish SPCA, which was unable to respond initially, before contacting police the following day. Officers broke in using a battering ram after seeing Rio lying motionless. Miss Ford said: ""The dog was alive and had begun to move around and police noted there was no food or water in the dog bowls. ""The dog was wearing a muzzle wrapped in black tape and had a collar on which was too tight."" Rio was taken to a vet for treatment, found temporary refuge and has since been re-homed. Sheriff Watson told Steel: ""On reading the terms of the report I am persuaded you are a foolish person who has behaved disgracefully towards the animal, but not with a cruel intention. ""You are clearly not a suitable person to own or have charge of an animal for the long-term. ""You and animals will not be coming close for the near future."" Scottish SPCA Ch Supt Mike Flynn said: ""Whilst we always look for a lifetime ban on keeping animals in cases of neglect like this, we are pleased the accused has received a 15-year ban. ""We hope Steel will seriously consider her ability to care for any other pets in the future."" Man who caused woman 'fear or alarm' given legal slap on the wrist Do you know this pooch?

Persimmon 'lacks minimum house standards',"The UK's second biggest housing firm does not have an agreed minimum standard for all the homes it builds, an independent report has found. A report into Persimmon says that a lack of a group build policy increases the risk of defects in its houses. Persimmon has been under pressure after a number of buyers complained about the safety of its homes. The review found that some houses did not have fire-stopping cavity barriers or they had been wrongly installed. It said that the issue of missing or improperly fitted cavity barriers was ""a systemic nationwide problem"", which it said was ""a manifestation of poor culture coupled with the lack of a group build process"". Persimmon's chairman Roger Devlin commissioned the report in April after complaints emerged about the quality of its new homes. One couple, Phil and Nicola Bentley, said that they haddiscovered 700 defectsin the Persimmon home they paid Â£280,000 for in 2017. Couple's fears as part of new-build home collapses New homes built by Persimmon missing fire safety barriers Couple's dream Persimmon home had 700 faults The independent review into Persimmon,external, led by barrister Stephanie Barwise QC of Atkin Chambers, said that there were no agreed procedures to supervise or inspect its employees or sub-contractors' work and that staff were only given limited training. It recommended that the firm ""should take sufficient time to formulate and embed a 'Persimmon Way' of building"". It also said that the company's corporate culture needed to change. Persimmon's former chief executive Jeff Fairburn was forced out last year amid criticism of a pay deal which awarded him Â£75m. Mr Devlin said that the ""very thorough and comprehensive review"" ""found that Persimmon had focused on policies around inspections immediately before and after the sale of a home, rather than those governing build quality inspections"". ""In my view, this is one of its central findings and I am encouraged that the company is already embracing the review's recommendations in this area through significant operational investment and procedural change,"" he said. Ms Barwise said: ""The board of Persimmon deserve significant credit for commissioning this review and publishing its findings. ""It demonstrates their willingness to confront some difficult truths as they focus the business on rapid change and improvement. In February,the company announced that its annual profits had passed Â£1bn for the first time- up from Â£966m in 2017. At the time, a source close to Housing Minister James Brokenshire said the minister was ""increasingly concerned"" by Persimmon's practices, including its use of leasehold contracts, the quality of its buildings and its leadership. He said this meant its inclusion in the Help to Buy scheme was under review.

"Scottish unemployment falls by 9,000","The number of Scots seeking work fell by 9,000 to 100,000 between August and October, according to official figures. The jobless rate now stands at 3.7%, just below the UK figure of 3.8%. Data from the Office for National Statistics also showed that the number of Scots in employment fell by 21,000, to 2,648,000. At the same time, there was a rise of 30,000 in the number of people counted as unavailable for work, including the ill, students and unpaid carers. Meanwhile, UK-wide wage growth, excluding bonuses, slowed to 3.5% from 3.6% from July to September. Scotland's Business Minister Jamie Hepburn said the Scottish labour market was resilient, despite uncertainty raised by Brexit. He said: ""These statistics indicate that Brexit may be negatively impacting employment in Scotland. ""However, there are signs of resilience in our labour market and positive results for those out of work."" Scottish Secretary Alister Jack said: ""It is encouraging that Scotland's unemployment figures have fallen slightly, with the overall UK rate now at its lowest since 1974. ""However, I remain concerned that employment has also fallen in Scotland."" The job numbers vary from one quarter to another, but the broader picture, by historic standards, is that they look strong. However, they fail to tell us anything about the quality of jobs. There is now some help with that, highlighted in the latest commentary from the Fraser of Allander Institute. It reports on new ""exploratory"" statistics which seek to measure the ""good jobs"" market. A good job is one where employees work 48 or fewer hours a week, without wishing to do more hours; the employee has either a permanent contract or a non-permanent contract out of choice; and pay is above two-thirds of median earnings. One interesting finding, when the analysis is broken down to council areas, is that the more prosperous parts of Scotland are not the ones with the ""good jobs"". Edinburgh, Aberdeen, Aberdeenshire, South Ayrshire and Stirling have the lowest proportion of quality jobs. The highest ranked include South Lanarkshire, Clackmannanshire, West Dunbartonshire and West Lothian. Why? The Strathclyde University economists say they'll get back to us on that. My guess: the higher the share of manufacturing, the higher the share of quality employment. Those with insecure jobs seem more likely to be in cleaning and catering on the urban margins. Good news, meanwhile, for Scottish earnings. Growth is muted, but survey evidence suggests a turnaround for Scottish pay - growing at a faster rate than earnings across the whole UK. However, that is much clearer at the upper end of the earnings range, so it doesn't look so good for reducing income inequality.

The Book People goes into administration,"Book retailer The Book People has filed for administration with just one week to go before Christmas. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has been appointed as the administrator while the troubled firm looks for a buyer. Founded in 1988 in Godalming, Surrey, The Book People has faced stiff competition from Amazon and other online retailers over the last decade. The business will continue to trade and there are no plans to make any of the 393 employees redundant, PwC said. As a result, customers should receive their orders in time for Christmas. The majority of the business's employees - 229 - are based in Bangor, Gwynedd. The firm sells books, gifts, toys and stationery online and via a catalogue, often at discounted prices. It has an annual turnover of Â£50m and sells more than 17 million children's books a year, PwC said. This video can not be played How to get kids to read books The company, one of the UK's largest independent book retailers, was acquired as part of a rescue deal in 2014 by private equity group Endless. James Woolley, partner at Endless, said it had ""worked hard"" to secure the firm's future and was ""disappointed"" not to have succeeded. ""The well-documented challenges in the retail environment, compounded by the strength of global online booksellers, has severely impacted operating cash flows over recent years,"" he added. Why are people shopping online late at night? Pre-Christmas shopping discounts 'could hit 50%' Toby Underwood, joint administrator and restructuring partner for PwC, said it was now exploring a sale of the business. ""I appreciate the obvious concerns that staff in particular will have as we move towards Christmas,"" he said. ""Whilst the administrators have funding to meet the payroll for December, the longer-term prospects for the business, staff, customers and suppliers will clearly be dependent upon whether a sale can be secured.""

This morning Boris Johnson chaired his first cabinet meeting since the country went to the polls, and this afternoon he addressed the Commons -you can read what he said here.The remainder of the day has been spent swearing in MPs one-by-one, in a lengthy process that will run well into tomorrow.  All that, and we're still not even halfway through Parliament's first week back. Here's what's left to come: WednesdayThere'll be more swearing in. To recap, MPs are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Two to three days are usually set aside for this.

FridayDepending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a Queen's Speech been defeated. Thanks for joining us, see you again tomorrow.

It's been pitched as the Brexit election, so did people actually vote according to their stance on the European Union? YouGov have been looking into this. And its survey of 40,000 British adults suggests the Conservatives did manage to win the votes of around three-quarters of Leave voters. Labour, on the other hand, only managed to attract about half of Remain voters - a reduction in the share they had in the 2017 election. That drop came mainly at the hands of the Lib Dems, who boosted their vote share amongst Remain voters to 21%, up from 12% in 2017: The Conservatives didn't manage to hold on to their Remainers - down to 19% from 25% in 2017. But Labour didn't hold onto Leavers either - their vote share amongst Leavers was 14%, down from 24% in 2017.

Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government intends to bring down a Brexit process guillotine at the end of December 2020. If we haven't agreed a trade deal by then, we are out anyway. The ghost of no-deal, it seems, will be haunting business in Christmas future. The financial markets took fright and we saw the pound immediately give up all the gains it enjoyed since the Conservatives wona thumping majority last Friday. Suddenly pundits and investors who thought an 80-seat majority would neutralise the party's hard Brexit elements prepared - or even wanting - to leave without a deal were seemingly proved wrong. Read the full analysis here. Dipping out of Westminster for a moment, Nicola Sturgeon has made a statement on the outcome of the election to MSPs today. She told them leaving the European Union in January ""now seems inevitable"" and accused the Conservative government of ignoring the wishes of Scottish voters. ""The hard, possibly no deal, Brexit favoured by the prime minister poses a real danger to our economy and to social and environmental safeguards, at a time when we must substantially step up our efforts to tackle climate change,"" she said. ""And of course, Brexit is the cause of significant uncertainty and worry for our fellow EU citizens who contribute so much to modern Scotland. ""Scotland must respond to and seek to overcome these challenges."" She also insisted that if the UK government pressed ahead with its Withdrawal Agreement Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament it would be ""further proof"" of Westminster's ""contempt for devolution"". What's going on right now? We're knee-deep in Parliamentary ceremony here, but a lot of talk today has been about Brexit. A quick summary for you: Number one priority, of course, is the prime minister's favourite slogan - ""get Brexit done"" (spot the abbreviation).

MPs are patiently waiting to be sworn in one at a time. But when the time comes, what do they actually have to say? They have two options in accordance with theOaths Act 1878,external. First, they can swear an oath of allegiance to the Crown as specified in thePromissory Oaths Act 1868,external, with the wording: âI, [name], do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.â A slightly different phrase can be used for MPs wanting to be sworn in the Scottish manner. The second option is by making what's called a solemn affirmation, by saying: âI, [name], do solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law.â You can read more about all this in the Hansard Society'shandy guide,external. No doubt to the MPs' relief, they don't have to learn these statements off by heart - they're written out on a card that is held up for them when they reach the front of the line. Parliament is notorious for its bizarre traditions that go back to the mists of time. But one custom will be notably absent during Thursday's Queen's Speech: Dennis Skinner's heckle. The former Labour MP has become synonymous with the State Opening of Parliament for shouting dry jokes once Black Rod has instructed MPs into the House of Lords. But the veteran of the Commons lost the seat he had held since 1970 last week, after being defeated by the Conservative candidate. This video can not be played In 2017 he told Black Rod: ""Get your skates on, first race is at half past two"", in reference to the Queen's love of racing and her engagement at Ascot later that day His interventions are so common that when he stayed silent in 2015,we wrote an article on it(he said he had ""other things on my mind""). So, since we'll be missing that particular light-hearted moment, let's recap some of his most memorable heckles:  Will anyone fill those mighty shoes and give a shout-out in his absence? We'll find out on Thursday. After members of the cabinet file through, it's the turn of the opposition and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is followed by members of his shadow cabinet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces his constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip as he stands up and swears allegiance to the crown. He opts to swear on the King James Bible rather than other options from the Christian faith. MPs of other faiths
can swear on their own holy book: the Koran, the Guru Granth Sahib and the Old
Testament in Hebrew are all available...read more in this article from 2015. Non-believers can opt out of any mention of religion. One of the slightly arcane, or if you prefer traditional, features of this afternoon's events is the repeated hat-doffing by members of the Royal Commission.

The Queen wore full state dress at the last state opening in October Speaking of the Queen's Speech,the state opening,externalon Thursday is the second in a couple of months. It'll have nearly all the usual ceremonial
elements - except the Queen will be wearing day dress and a hat, instead of
sparkly court dress and a tiara. The Crown will come along to the event, but not on the monarch's head. And sheâll arrive by car, not coach and horses, according to the office of Black Rod. The Speaker was elected at the end of the last Parliament, re-elected earlier this afternoon, taken to the House of Lords for Royal Approbation, and has taken his oath to be sworn in. Now, finally, Sir Lindsay Hoyle gets to sit down in the Speaker's chair (as you can see in the right of the picture). He's followed by the Father of the House, the prime minister, and then all of the other MPs. The process will carry on into the evening and then be suspended until 11:30 tomorrow morning. Sir Lindsay says he hopes it will be finished by tomorrow afternoon, but if necessary they can do one more session on Thursday, before the Queen's Speech. First up for swearing in is new Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. According to tradition he makes his oath of allegiance before signing the Common's roll. After a brief interlude, things are happening again in Parliament, with a bit more to-ing and fro-ing between Commons and Lords. Spot some big-hitters above observing cereonial proceedings as Sir Lindsay Hoyle is confirmed as Speaker. The swearing in process for MPs can now begin. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Surprised that Boris Johnson's new government is raising eyebrows already? Don't be. The new clause in the Brexit bill might rattle business - and the opposition parties - because it is, in theory, making it more likely that we could exit the EU departure lounge without a full trade deal in place. Whatever metaphor you want to use, be it a trap door or a new cliff edge, there is outrage already in some quarters of Westminster at the move. But if you are taken aback, then the last few extraordinary months must have passed you by. Read more from Laura here. Meanwhile, as ceremonial matters continue at Westminster, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has given his reaction to the news that Boris Johnson plans to formally enshrine in law a UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal deadline of 31 December 2020. ""We will do the maximum,"" Mr Barnier told reporters, when asked if it was possible to reach such a deal in just 11 months. Â© 2025 BBC.

Brexit bill to rule out extension,"The government is to add a new clause to the Brexit bill to rule out any extension to the transition period beyond the end of next year. The post-Brexit transition period - due to conclude in December 2020 -Â  can currently be extended by mutual agreement for up to two years. But an amended Withdrawal Agreement Bill the Commons is set to vote on this week would rule out any extension. The PM told MPs it would put an end to years of ""deadlock, dither and delay"". As the House of Commons assembled for the first time since the election, Boris Johnson said his priority was to ""get Brexit done"". He also promised to seek ""common ground"" and to approach politics with a ""new and generous spirit"" after the rancour of recent years. Jeremy Corbyn congratulated the Conservative leader on his victory but said he would be ""judged"" on whether he delivered on the ""many, many promises"" he had made during the campaign, including to longstanding Labour voters. Is a no-deal Brexit back on the table? All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January, more than three and a half years after the public backed Brexit in a referendum. Soon after, the two sides will begin talking about their future economic relationship, including controversial areas such as fishing rights, consumer and environmental standards and financial services. Trade deals typically take many years to conclude and senior EU figures are sceptical that a deal can be agreed within that time. If it is not, the economic relationship will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, with the likelihood of tariffs on imports and exports. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc would ""do the maximum"" to finalise the deal in time. Asked about the UK's refusal to contemplate any extra time for the talks, he said ""it is the British choice to choose the procedure it wants"". This is a political signal, a moment of early chest beating too, designed to disappoint those who might have been hoping No 10 might slide to a softer Brexit over the next few months. And designed to gratify those who are adamant that Brexit must be completely ""done"" as soon as possible. Boris Johnson seems to have concluded that if the talks are to go anywhere fast, there has to be a convincing clear deadline. It was his vow of a Halloween deadline that got him to Downing Street in the first place, and although it was broken in the end, there's little question that his attitude towards extending again and again changed the dynamics of the talks with the EU that got the revised deal done. Putting the deadline into law may also be designed to focus minds in Brussels. How effective that might be? That's a different question. Read Laura's full analysis Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's move was ""reckless and irresponsible"" and he argued that Mr Johnson was ""prepared to put people's jobs at risk"". Liberal Democrat interim leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""The only way Johnson can meet the December 2020 timetable is by giving up all his previous promises to Leave voters and agreeing to all the demands of the EU."" Downing Street has said the government plans to ask the new Parliament to have its first debate and vote on the withdrawal agreement - the legislation needed to ratify Brexit - on Friday. With a majority of 80following Thursday's general election, Mr Johnson is expected to get the bill into law with few changes in time for the UK to end its EU membership on 31 January. So, the government is going to pass a law to stop itself doing something that it had already promised not to do. On the surface, that doesn't change much. Because the decision on whether to extend the transition period lies with the prime minister anyway, not with Parliament. And with his new majority, Mr Johnson knows his critics can't do anything to force his hand. But as a statement of intent, this announcement is important. By reaffirming Mr Johnson's guarantee that the transition period will not be extended, it suggests there will only be enough time to agree a pretty basic trade deal which would leave many important issues unresolved. That means a quick 'zero tariffs zero quotas' deal on goods could be done, as long as the UK is prepared to sign up to the EU's main conditions. They include the UK sticking with EU rules on environmental and social policy, and on state aid for companies. Such an agreement wouldn't get rid of all border checks, though, and it wouldn't do anything for the services sector. The PM could of course change his mind again - he's done that before. But this is also a warning for businesses - they could be in for a bit of a bumpy ride at the end of next year. As well as ruling out an extension, theIndependent reports,externalthat the amended withdrawal agreement may omit previous ""provisions to ensure that workers' rights were not weakened after Brexit"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove said workers' rights would be ""safeguarded"" in separate legislation, adding that the government wanted to make sure the Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes through Parliament ""cleanly and clearly"". But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government would ""sacrifice our basic rights and certainty for business at the altar of turning the UK into a Trump-supporting tax haven"". This video can not be played Government to bring back Brexit bill to Commons this Friday And Labour's Barry Gardiner said his party would be less likely to support the bill if clauses on workers' rights and the environment were removed. The prime minister promised during the general election campaign that he would not seek an extension to the transition period - persuading Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage to stand down candidates in Tory seats. Sam Lowe, from the Centre for European Reform think tank, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a December 2020 deadline could help the PM manage his own party when it comes to making concessions to the EU. What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? What the election fall-out means for the BBC Who's in Boris Johnson's cabinet? ""The prospect of a no-deal is still there,"" Mr Lowe said. ""The question is whether Boris Johnson wants a no-deal but the evidence of recent time suggests no he doesn't."" Meanwhile, in the first act of the new Parliament, MPs re-confirmed Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle in his post without any opposition. The MP for Chorley, who was only succeeded John Bercow at the start of November, said it was the ""greatest privilege"" to be asked to take the chair again and he would do his utmost to ""cherish the best traditions"" of the Parliament. Commons officials have begun the process of swearing in the new MPs - which will continue on Wednesday. Tuesday and Wednesday After the election of the Speaker, the process of swearing in MPs begins. They are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process.

Trade deals typically take many years to conclude and senior EU figures are sceptical that a deal can be agreed within that time. If it is not, the economic relationship will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, with the likelihood of tariffs on imports and exports. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc would ""do the maximum"" to finalise the deal in time. Asked about the UK's refusal to contemplate any extra time for the talks, he said ""it is the British choice to choose the procedure it wants"". This is a political signal, a moment of early chest beating too, designed to disappoint those who might have been hoping No 10 might slide to a softer Brexit over the next few months. And designed to gratify those who are adamant that Brexit must be completely ""done"" as soon as possible. Boris Johnson seems to have concluded that if the talks are to go anywhere fast, there has to be a convincing clear deadline. It was his vow of a Halloween deadline that got him to Downing Street in the first place, and although it was broken in the end, there's little question that his attitude towards extending again and again changed the dynamics of the talks with the EU that got the revised deal done. Putting the deadline into law may also be designed to focus minds in Brussels. How effective that might be? That's a different question. Read Laura's full analysis Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's move was ""reckless and irresponsible"" and he argued that Mr Johnson was ""prepared to put people's jobs at risk"". Liberal Democrat interim leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""The only way Johnson can meet the December 2020 timetable is by giving up all his previous promises to Leave voters and agreeing to all the demands of the EU."" Downing Street has said the government plans to ask the new Parliament to have its first debate and vote on the withdrawal agreement - the legislation needed to ratify Brexit - on Friday. With a majority of 80following Thursday's general election, Mr Johnson is expected to get the bill into law with few changes in time for the UK to end its EU membership on 31 January. So, the government is going to pass a law to stop itself doing something that it had already promised not to do. On the surface, that doesn't change much. Because the decision on whether to extend the transition period lies with the prime minister anyway, not with Parliament. And with his new majority, Mr Johnson knows his critics can't do anything to force his hand. But as a statement of intent, this announcement is important. By reaffirming Mr Johnson's guarantee that the transition period will not be extended, it suggests there will only be enough time to agree a pretty basic trade deal which would leave many important issues unresolved. That means a quick 'zero tariffs zero quotas' deal on goods could be done, as long as the UK is prepared to sign up to the EU's main conditions. They include the UK sticking with EU rules on environmental and social policy, and on state aid for companies. Such an agreement wouldn't get rid of all border checks, though, and it wouldn't do anything for the services sector. The PM could of course change his mind again - he's done that before. But this is also a warning for businesses - they could be in for a bit of a bumpy ride at the end of next year. As well as ruling out an extension, theIndependent reports,externalthat the amended withdrawal agreement may omit previous ""provisions to ensure that workers' rights were not weakened after Brexit"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove said workers' rights would be ""safeguarded"" in separate legislation, adding that the government wanted to make sure the Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes through Parliament ""cleanly and clearly"". But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government would ""sacrifice our basic rights and certainty for business at the altar of turning the UK into a Trump-supporting tax haven"". This video can not be played Government to bring back Brexit bill to Commons this Friday And Labour's Barry Gardiner said his party would be less likely to support the bill if clauses on workers' rights and the environment were removed. The prime minister promised during the general election campaign that he would not seek an extension to the transition period - persuading Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage to stand down candidates in Tory seats. Sam Lowe, from the Centre for European Reform think tank, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a December 2020 deadline could help the PM manage his own party when it comes to making concessions to the EU. What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? What the election fall-out means for the BBC Who's in Boris Johnson's cabinet? ""The prospect of a no-deal is still there,"" Mr Lowe said. ""The question is whether Boris Johnson wants a no-deal but the evidence of recent time suggests no he doesn't."" Meanwhile, in the first act of the new Parliament, MPs re-confirmed Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle in his post without any opposition. The MP for Chorley, who was only succeeded John Bercow at the start of November, said it was the ""greatest privilege"" to be asked to take the chair again and he would do his utmost to ""cherish the best traditions"" of the Parliament. Commons officials have begun the process of swearing in the new MPs - which will continue on Wednesday. Tuesday and Wednesday After the election of the Speaker, the process of swearing in MPs begins. They are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days. Friday Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days in order to leave the EU by the then Brexit deadline of 31 October. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated. What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?

Persimmon 'lacks minimum house standards'Review also says the housebuilder's corporate culture needs to change.Business,"The UK's second biggest housing firm does not have an agreed minimum standard for all the homes it builds, an independent report has found. A report into Persimmon says that a lack of a group build policy increases the risk of defects in its houses. Persimmon has been under pressure after a number of buyers complained about the safety of its homes. The review found that some houses did not have fire-stopping cavity barriers or they had been wrongly installed. It said that the issue of missing or improperly fitted cavity barriers was ""a systemic nationwide problem"", which it said was ""a manifestation of poor culture coupled with the lack of a group build process"". Persimmon's chairman Roger Devlin commissioned the report in April after complaints emerged about the quality of its new homes. One couple, Phil and Nicola Bentley, said that they haddiscovered 700 defectsin the Persimmon home they paid Â£280,000 for in 2017. Couple's fears as part of new-build home collapses New homes built by Persimmon missing fire safety barriers Couple's dream Persimmon home had 700 faults The independent review into Persimmon,external, led by barrister Stephanie Barwise QC of Atkin Chambers, said that there were no agreed procedures to supervise or inspect its employees or sub-contractors' work and that staff were only given limited training. It recommended that the firm ""should take sufficient time to formulate and embed a 'Persimmon Way' of building"". It also said that the company's corporate culture needed to change. Persimmon's former chief executive Jeff Fairburn was forced out last year amid criticism of a pay deal which awarded him Â£75m. Mr Devlin said that the ""very thorough and comprehensive review"" ""found that Persimmon had focused on policies around inspections immediately before and after the sale of a home, rather than those governing build quality inspections"". ""In my view, this is one of its central findings and I am encouraged that the company is already embracing the review's recommendations in this area through significant operational investment and procedural change,"" he said. Ms Barwise said: ""The board of Persimmon deserve significant credit for commissioning this review and publishing its findings. ""It demonstrates their willingness to confront some difficult truths as they focus the business on rapid change and improvement. In February,the company announced that its annual profits had passed Â£1bn for the first time- up from Â£966m in 2017. At the time, a source close to Housing Minister James Brokenshire said the minister was ""increasingly concerned"" by Persimmon's practices, including its use of leasehold contracts, the quality of its buildings and its leadership. He said this meant its inclusion in the Help to Buy scheme was under review.

Pope lifts 'pontifical secret' rule over sex abuse,"Pope Francis has faced pressure to address the sexual abuse crisis in the Church The Pope has declared that the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" no longer applies to the sexual abuse of minors, in a bid to improve transparency in such cases. The Church previously shrouded sexual abuse cases in secrecy, in what it said was an effort to protect the privacy of victims and reputations of the accused. But new papal documents on Tuesday lifted restrictions on those who report abuse or say they have been victims. Church leaders called for the rule's abolition at a February Vatican summit. They said the lifting of the rule in such cases would improve transparency and the ability of the police and other civil legal authorities to request information from the Church. Information in abuse cases should still be treated with ""security, integrity and confidentiality"", the Pope said in his announcement. He instructed Vatican officials to comply with civil laws and assist civil judicial authorities in investigating such cases. The Pope also changed the Vatican's definition of child pornography, increasing the age of the subject from 14 or under to 18 or under. Charles Scicluna, the Archbishop of Malta and the Vatican's most experienced sex abuse investigator, called the move an ""epochal decision that removes obstacles and impediments"", telling Vatican news that ""the question of transparency now is being implemented at the highest level"". Pope orders clergy to report sex abuse Child sexual abuse and the Catholic Church: What you need to know Francis condemns child sex abuse and cover-ups The Church has been rocked by thousands of reports of sexual abuse by priests and accusations of cover-ups by senior clergy around the world. Pope Francis has faced serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to the crisis, which has engulfed the Church in recent years. Pontifical secrecy was designed to protect sensitive information such as communications between the Vatican and papal embassies - in a similar fashion to the secrecy applied to diplomatic cables. But it was also applied over the years to judicial cases, to protect the privacy of victims and the identities of those accused. Critics said pontifical secrecy had been abused by some Church officials to avoid co-operation with the police in abuse cases. ""Certain jurisdictions would have easily quoted the pontifical secret ... to say that they could not, and that they were not, authorised to share information with either state authorities or the victims,"" Archbishop Scicluna said. ""Now that impediment, we might call it that way, has been lifted, and the pontifical secret is no more an excuse."" Under the new instruction, the pontifical secret no longer binds those working in offices of the Roman Curia to confidentiality on other offences if committed in conjunction with child abuse or child pornography. Witnesses, alleged victims, and the person who filed the report are also be unbound from obligations of silence. On his 83rd birthday, Pope Francis has responded to a longstanding complaint from survivors by announcing that any testimony gathered by the Church in relation to cases of sexual violence, the abuse of minors and child pornography will now be made available to state authorities. In the past, the Church has been accused of using secrecy laws as a justification for not reporting cases of abuse. The consequence of breaching the pontifical secret was excommunication from the Church, so there was little incentive to be open to state authorities. That prohibition has now been abolished. It is the latest attempt by the Roman Catholic Church to address the scourge of clerical abuse that has manifested itself across continents and in a range of religious institutions.

The hunt for dangerous dryers," By Kevin Peachey The tumble dryer in the Garnham family home was on the list. It needed a simple alteration by an engineer, but the Garnhams had been told it was fine to use it while they waited. Susan Garnham, a quietly spoken grandmother, was worried and says she rang Whirlpool several times. More than a year later the company finally called back to book the engineer’s visit. “You're a bit too late,” she told them. “My house has already burnt down.” It was a chilly January evening in 2016 when Susan went home to her Guildford council house after visiting a craft fair at the nearby racecourse. The healthcare assistant had thrown a few things into the washing machine before she left, and now put them into the dryer before cooking dinner. Upstairs, her husband Graeme, a cleaner, was just about to get in the bath. It was the smell that came first. Each thought the other had left something on the stove. “Then I saw smoke in the corner of the kitchen diner,” Susan says. “I ran over to the dryer and saw flames.” Her husband was downstairs by then. “I started to fill a bucket of water. That wasn’t a good idea,” he says. “By the time I had filled it up, the room was filling with black smoke. It was everywhere. I knew we had to get out.” They left the house. Graeme was in just his underwear and his son's jacket, which he had grabbed on the way out. Outside, a neighbour lent him a pair of trousers. “I was stood there in my bare feet, at the bottom of the alleyway, watching it all go up. The windows were popping out,” he says. “I just couldn't talk.” Graeme Garnham Graeme Garnham The fire started in the tumble dryer before spreading across the kitchen and the rest of the house, according to Surrey Fire Service investigators. Victims of house fires often say it’s photographs that they miss the most when a home is gutted. That’s certainly true of the Garnhams. “Thirty years of memories were gone,” Susan says. “We don't have any photos of our wedding anymore. It was 33 years ago at Guildford Register Office.” Pictures of their children - James, Jason, Natasha, Chelsea and Kerry - had also been lost to the flames. They only have a single frame of family portraits on the wall now, borrowed from Susan's father. Graeme is a keen Chelsea fan. One of the children is named after the team, another after 1980s star striker Kerry Dixon. Mementoes of decades of support all went up in flames. “It happened so quickly. We weren't allowed back in,” says Susan. In their late 50s and homeless, along with their sons who had also lived in the house, they were put up by the council in a nearby Travelodge. They stayed for three weeks before moving into another council property. They knew the house - partly because Graeme used to clean the windows there, but mostly because it overlooked the gutted remains of their old home just a few yards away. The view of the Garnhams' old house from their rented property The view of the Garnhams' old house from their rented property  The view was a reminder of what they had lost - so was their bank balance. “We had kept on saying we have got to get insurance, but we did not have the money,” Susan says. The family are still waiting for compensation, reliant on the outcome of a claim being made against Whirlpool by lawyers representing the council’s insurers. That has yet to be resolved. Whirlpool will not comment on the case.  Relatives rallied around the family, lending money for replacement furniture. Friends also set up a JustGiving page which raised more than £800 to help out, alongside other local collections. The couple are grateful that their fate was not considerably worse. “We used to put the dryer on in the middle of the night, whenever we needed it. Thank God we didn't that time,” Susan says. “We lost lots and lots of priceless things, but in some respects we have been very lucky.” Whirlpool Corporation building, Benton Harbor in Michigan Whirlpool Corporation building, Benton Harbor in Michigan “For more than a century, Whirlpool has been doing the right thing,” the company says in one of its promotional videos. In 2014, the US-based firm bought its Italian rival Indesit, and reviewed the products now under its ownership. The company’s managers found something worrying with some models of dryers. Excess fluff or lint could travel from the filter over time to the back of the machine and end up touching the heating element and causing a fire. This design problem seemed to have existed for years. In November 2015, Whirlpool issued a notice revealing there were risks with 5.3 million dryers sold across the UK between April 2004 and September 2015. The dryers had been made by Indesit and sold under the Hotpoint, Indesit and Creda brands. Subsequently, models under the Swan and Proline brands were added to the list. They were also found in Croatia, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain. A full list of the affected models was never published. Instead, owners were urged to check their model ona self-service checker system. Many welcomed the admission by Whirlpool that something needed to be done about a problem it inherited - but in the years since the company has been heavily criticised for the way it went about putting things right. The defect in these dryers led to at least 750 fires in the UK since 2004, according to a report published by a committee of MPs in January 2018. When Whirlpool revealed the problem, it did not immediately tell owners to stop using their dryers nor did it quickly offer refunds or new models. Instead of a full recall, the company announced a repair programme, in agreement with trading standards officers. Whirlpool would send a trained engineer to visit homes and modify machines by adding a widget so the fluff and the heating element never came into contact - a one-hour job. The company sent nine million letters to four million owners, followed up with calls and messages to those who did not respond. It placed adverts and worked with landlords and consumer groups. Whirlpool says its “unprecedented” programme has been up to six times more successful than a normal product recall, with resolutions for 1.7 million affected tumble dryers. Typically, only 10% of products in a recall are repaired or returned. While there were 5.3 million dryers made, Whirlpool says many would have fallen out of use. In 2015, it estimated 3.8 million of them were still in use. After the modifications, and more customers replacing their dryers, it now believes that between 300,000 and 500,000 is a “conservative estimate” of how many are still being used as of June 2019.  The government has now stepped in to order Whirlpool to issue a recall of the remaining, unmodified appliances - a move that would require the company to offer refunds or replacements. “Nothing matters more to us than people’s safety, which is why we proactively raised this product safety issue and have worked diligently and responsibly to resolve it,” a Whirlpool spokeswoman says. But the guidance at the time of the modification scheme was controversial. In Australia, the country’s Competition and Consumer Commission advised owners to stop using these machines in January 2016. Crucially, in the UK, owners were initially told they could still use the dryers, as long as they were not left running when householders went out or to bed. That advice was only changed a year later. It was the advice being followed by the Garnham family in Guildford when their home burned down. It was the advice being followed in August 2016 by the Defreitas family who lived in a seventh-floor flat in Shepherd's Bush in London when a fire gutted their home too. The Defreitas family's flat in Shepherd's Bush, London, after an appliance fire The Defreitas family's flat in Shepherd's Bush, London, after an appliance fire Flames ripped up the side of the building - 100 families were evacuated. Many were uninsured for the loss of their belongings. Investigations by the London Fire Brigade (LFB) found the fire started in a tumble dryer, putting Whirlpool - and its advice - under intense pressure.  The LFB - through the Local Government Association - said that owners still using these machines were “unwittingly playing Russian roulette”. There were debates in Parliament, and consumer group Which? sought a judicial review into what it regarded as failures by the trading standards department overseeing the case - the small team at Peterborough Council. That is one quirk of the system in the UK - in an attempt to offer consistency to businesses with multiple premises, companies deal with just one trading standards department which other local regulators must respect. This “primary authority” system, set up in 2009, means Whirlpool - a massive corporation, with 92,000 employees, 2017 sales of $21bn, and a presence in almost every country in the world - was being checked on in the UK by a handful of officers at a financially stretched local council. One MP described this as a “David and Goliath” relationship. In 2016, I spent six months using Freedom of Information requests to gain access to correspondence between Whirlpool and Peterborough Council's Trading Standards department in a bid to shed some light on the deliberations between the two about the tumble dryer risks. I was eventually sent 140 pages of correspondence, much of it redacted. But one email reads: “...one further question from the Whirlpool side if I may - is there a way at all of possibly weaving into this sentence in any way that: 'this is not a recall campaign…” Another calls for some agreed wording that states “this activity is correctly a REPAIR campaign and not a RECALL…” A spokesperson for Peterborough Trading Standards said: ""The initial advice that we gave was based on a risk assessment which deemed the level of risk to customers to be low. ""Our priority is the safety and protection of the public and we acted within government regulations at all times."" A committee of MPs concluded that the response of Whirlpool was “woeful”.  Their approach to correcting the defects had been “delayed and dismissive”, according to Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee, causing “huge worry to people with these appliances in their homes”. The U-turn on the controversial advice given alongside this campaign came in February 2017. Trading Standards ordered new guidance, namely that the dryers should not be used until they had been repaired - matching the information given to owners by authorities in Australia a year earlier. Whirlpool suggested that owners should unplug the machine and not use it until the modification had taken place. But there have been reports that evenmodified dryers were causing fires- a claim that has been vigorously challenged by the manufacturer.  Whirlpool said: ""There have been no reported incidents where the modification has shown to be ineffective. Recent criticisms of the effectiveness of the modification are based on fundamental technical misunderstandings of what it addresses."" The fault that the programme repaired wasn’t the only problem Whirlpool faced. An inquest into the deaths of two men in north Wales meant the company was thrust back into the spotlight.  Tributes to members of the Elmufatish family who died in a house fire, believed to have been caused by a faulty freezer Tributes to members of the Elmufatish family who died in a house fire, believed to have been caused by a faulty freezer Bernard Hender was 19 years old when he died. He was in bed when the fire started and smoke filled the room. His partner, funeral director Garry Lloyd Jones, tried to pull him out after being woken by the smell. “I said 'get to the floor' because you could see the smoke was less dense on the floor,” Mr Lloyd Jones told the inquest. “He said 'I can't find the door' and he just screamed and that was the last I heard of him.” Bernard Hender Bernard Hender Doug McTavish, 39, a lodger at the flat in Llanrwst, Conwy county, also died in the fire in October 2014. Assistant Coroner David Lewis concluded at the inquest in 2017 that the fire was caused “on the balance of probabilities” by an electrical fault with the door switch on the dryer. Forensic evidence suggested there was an issue over how the wiring was protected and whether fluff could get into the door switch. Whirlpool had claimed the fire was caused by “spontaneous combustion” inside the tumble dryer. Leigh Day solicitors, who represented the victims' families, said Whirlpool had brought US experts to the inquest and “at no time did they accept there was a problem”. The company did accept after the inquest that the tumble dryer was the source of the fire, but there was no admission over the specific mechanism. There has never been a safety notice issued about that type of door switch. The flat in Llanwrst where two men died in a 2014 house fire The flat in Llanwrst where two men died in a 2014 house fire The coroner identified a problem. The door switch in this case was used in hundreds of thousands of machines, and might have been a factor in a significant number of fires. “I did not emerge from the hearing confident that Whirlpool's risk assessment processes have fully identified or appreciated the extent of the risk of fire (and its potential consequences),” he wrote in his report to prevent future deaths. The claim was denied by Whirlpool in its response to the report. Campaigners say there is something wrong in the way we assess risk in home appliances. Manufacturers produce many thousands of units and if there are comparatively few reports of faults or fires, then the risk is deemed to be low. But campaigners say at the first stage of a risk assessment, the number of units sold should be irrelevant. Sian Lewis, from the Association of Manufacturers of Domestic Appliances (AMDEA) , argues that standards are always being improved and updated. Products are tested thoroughly before they are put on the market and once they are in homes. Martyn Allen, technical director at charity Electrical Safety First, says the companies which should be applauded are those aiming to reduce the regularity of faults. When a fire does break out, one of the greatest vulnerabilities - as the Llanrwst fire tragically exposed - is sleep. “By the time a smoke alarm goes off, you still may not have much time - and your reaction times are slower if you are asleep,” says Deputy Assistant Commissioner Charlie Pugsley, of the London Fire Brigade. A couple of breaths of thick, acrid smoke from burning plastic can knock out someone who already suffers from breathing difficulties. Mr Pugsley has 23 years' service with the LFB, starting in London's East End before spending 14 years in the fire investigation team. It was one fire in Neasden, north London, in 2011, in which the risks and response “really hit home”, he says. Muna Elmufatish, 41, her daughters Hanin Kua, 14, Basma, 13, Amal, nine, and sons Mustafa, five, and Yehya, two, died in the fire which started following a fault in a Whirlpool-branded chest freezer. “The house had a working smoke alarm, but the fire developed so quickly,” he says. Bassam Kua tried to save his wife and children but only he and his daughter Nur survived. At the inquest the following year, Whirlpool said it had been unable to find a link between the freezer and the cause of the fire. “I naively thought manufacturers would be keen to make a difference,” said Mr Pugsley. “Instead there was terrible inertia.” The home of the Elmufatish family in Neasden, London, five of whom died in a house fire The home of the Elmufatish family in Neasden, London, five of whom died in a house fire Everyone accepts fires will continue to occur and risks will always remain with electrical equipment but there is pressure on manufacturers to ensure an improvement in safety. “Companies are more than happy to take data for their own purposes,” says consumer group Which?, “so they must be able to use it for the public good.” There is now anew code of practicefor product recalls. Whirlpool says it contributed with information from its own experiences. Which? says the new code does not go far enough to get dangerous products out of the home. In London alone, there have been more than 300 fires which started from white goods each year for at least the past five years. That is nearly one fire a day. The London Fire Brigade launched its Total Recalls campaign - a bid to make appliances in our homes safer. Among the campaign’s demands are for risk assessments to recognise the threat if appliances are switched on when people are asleep, and for risk assessments to be published. It has particular concerns over fridges and freezers that are plugged in for 24 hours a day. A fridge (brand unknown) burnt out in an accidental fire A fridge (brand unknown) burnt out in an accidental fire Most owners will never have looked at the back of their fridge-freezer. There’s a layer of rigid polyurethane foam for insulation - about 5cm thick. The foam is highly flammable and, when it burns, creates dangerous gases and thick, toxic smoke. Fire investigator Mr Pugsley describes it as almost akin to a “solid block of petrol”. Because of the fridge-freezer’s height - usually about 1.8m - a fire starts some way above the ground and can draw in oxygen more easily. It burns fast, the heat is extreme, so other parts of the kitchen soon reach ignition temperature and the fire quickly spreads. That smoke can knock someone unconscious in seconds. Evidence from firefighters suggests that the heat and poisonous emissions from a fridge would leave a typical two-storey, three-bedroom home “unable to support life within three minutes of a fire breaking out”. The foam is covered at the back of the fridge-freezer either by metal, or by a thin plastic panel. Both pass the same British Standards safety tests, but the speed at which a fire can develop is very different. Tests by Which? found that no plastic-backed fridge could withstand a flame for 30 seconds, unlike every one of the metal and aluminium laminate-backed appliances that were tested. Some of the metal-backed products could withstand an open flame for five minutes. So how could the plastic-backed fridges pass the tests? The British Standards test puts a hot wire - traditionally used in safety tests - through a sample of the fridge backing. The Which? test used an open flame instead. “If there is a pan fire, there is a flame,” says Alex Neill, arguing that the Which? tests are more realistic. Sian Lewis says work is going on to make testing closer to the consumer experience. However, she points out that it must be consistent. Every test, ideally in every country, needs to work at the same level. They also need to evolve. Firefighters called for a change in the way these products are made, butWhich? went a step further. In its reviews, it has urged consumers not to buy any of the 250 plastic-backed fridges models it has listed - an unprecedented move. These include a range of brands, from AEG to Zanussi.  Other campaigners have chosen to work with manufacturers, with some success. Some have moved to manufacturing metal-backed appliances, and some online retailers have made the type of backing clearer to customers. The campaigners say a four-sided metal box is clearly safer than a three-sided one. The UK authorities have tried to change international standards - a benchmark for manufacturers operating across borders. That is important because, in the UK, manufacturers could be challenged to prove their plastic-backed models are safe by trading standards officers. They cannot simply presume conformity with the official journal of standards. The law states that any products made here must be safe. Campaigners say manufacturers dominate the committees that set the standards. They could change the rules around plastic backing tomorrow. Five years after the LFB began its campaign there has still been no European agreement. Appliances in the US and Canada are only metal-backed. The LFB has said that there is an injury for every 25 fires involving fridges, freezers or fridge-freezers in the US. In the UK, one in every five results in someone being hurt.   In Australia and New Zealand, the authorities have decided they cannot wait for international agreement. In Britain, the safety of fridges is being tightened up, but campaigners want even tougher rules. The most deadly residential fire ever in the UK is thought to have started in a fridge-freezer in a fourth-floor flat of a tower block in North Kensington. A total of 72 people died in Grenfell Tower in June 2017 - one of the UK’s worst modern disasters. The public inquiry has heard that the fire probably started because a tiny “crimp” connection had not kept the wires at the back of the fridge tightly gripped. “The overheating connector in my opinion was the first event that started burning the insulation on the wires that led to a short circuit. The overheating of the crimp starts the fire. It overheats, it glows, it ignites,” John Duncan Glover, the principal engineer of Failure Electrical, told the inquiry. The fridge-freezer - a Hotpoint FF175BP - had plastic backing. A subsequent investigation found the appliance carried a low fire risk, but the results of the fire were catastrophic.  Tributes left to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Tributes left to the victims of the Grenfell Tower fire Whirlpool - which owns Hotpoint - argued that it was not possible to say that the fridge-freezer was the cause of the blaze. But it has been changing the manufacture of its refrigeration appliances to only use solid metal or aluminium laminate flame-retardant back panels. Other manufacturers have made the same commitment. And within months of the Grenfell Tower blaze, there was a new body ready to tackle product safety.   Source: Electrical Safety First  The Office for Product Safety and Standards (OPSS) has an operating budget of £25m a year, and more than 200 staff. Trading standards officers still police product safety out in the community but the OPSS sets the strategy. In the summer of 2018 it published a two-year plan. “We have a good [safety] system,” says OPSS chief executive Graham Russell. “Consumers can be confident about the safety of the products they buy.” He does admit that the events of recent years will have “caused consumers to have concerns”. Those can be easily summed up as three questions:  Immediately after its launch, the OPSS began reviewing compliance systems at white goods manufacturers. There is a general requirement for manufacturers, importers and distributors to ensure products are safe. But the safety standards across the board are still in effect voluntary, although some are referenced in EU law. So, the British Standards Institution at UK level (and others at EU and global levels) are private bodies which bring manufacturers and experts together to agree what should be considered safe to sell. Some products will develop faults over time, but a priority for the OPSS is to work out how many products are causing damage and injury and how many people are affected. Data is patchy, and so far nobody has been pulling it together and analysing it. Campaigner Lynn Faulds Wood raised the issue in a report, saying she was surprised at how little data and information was shared. An injury database is regarded as “vital” in the US but there is nothing to compare in the UK or Europe. Consider a small fire caused by a faulty appliance in the home. Firefighters might put it out and not inform anyone. An insurance company might replace it and not inform anyone. A resident might throw out the dangerous appliance and have burns treated at the local walk-in clinic which does not tell anyone what caused the injury. All three - the firefighters, the insurance company, and the NHS - have data about the incident, but it might never be pulled together. Nobody knows about the fault and the damage and injury it has caused. There is less chance of anyone stopping it happening again. “A strategy focused on analysis and intelligence is where we can make the biggest impact,” Mr Russell says. That intelligence must surely be helped if firefighters, for example, knew exactly which appliances had been at the centre of a fire. The LFB's Mr Pugsley says that even after his 14 years of investigative work, it still could be impossible for him to identify a gutted appliance. Unlike the vehicle identification number in cars, there is no requirement for fireproof labelling on white goods. Which? research suggested that of 3,203 fires in the UK thought to have been caused by faulty appliances in the year from April 2016, investigators could only find the product make and model information in 33% of cases. That is fewer than the previous three years. The OPSS says it is researching indelible marking used in the US and elsewhere, but has yet to draw any conclusions.   Only a third of households register their appliances, according to rather limited research quoted by the OPSS. TheRegister My Appliance system, introduced by AMDEA in 2015, is voluntary and covers about 90% of large white goods in the UK. Filling in the registration form would give owners an automatic alert, usually by letter, if there is a safety issue - but many people have (unfounded) concerns they will be blitzed with spam if they register. Whirlpool says: “Of all the lessons we have learned through our dryer campaign, the importance of product registration has been the most crucial. It is vital that consumers always register ownership of their appliances as soon as they acquire them.” The system becomes even more difficult when items are bought second-hand. AMDEA says buyers should check the retailer, the reviews and the recalls. There is anofficial recall website, but it is not searchable and not particularly user-friendly. That means consumers are usually told about recalled faulty products via adverts, signs in shops, and the media. Typically, only 10% of recalled items are actually recalled or returned. “Our ambition, clearly, is to get this to 100%,” says Mr Russell, from the OPSS. “It is not technology that is the barrier, it is mainly the culture.” The evidence, he says, is from the case of Samsung's burning batteries. The Galaxy Note 7 phone was recalled after cases of overheating. The saga is thought to have cost $5.3bn (£4.3bn) and was hugely damaging for the South Korean firm's reputation. However, from a product safety viewpoint, the recall was almost entirely successful. The company knew who owned the phones, and they were able to send updates that limited or prevented charging by anyone who kept hold of them. That is a modern solution that may make some consumers feel uncomfortable. New technology will change the products in our homes beyond recognition - but will they be safe? A future of 5G-connected home appliances may make things safer. Electronic labelling might solve the problem of identification after a fire, but it still needs to work when the device has a flat battery or no screen. Artificial intelligence may prove to be more adept at spotting unsafe products than the much-criticised risk assessment system. Internet-connected appliances may be switched on automatically, when they are needed, at any time of day. However, they can also be switched off automatically at any sign of danger. All these questions are being asked and researched by the OPSS. In the meantime, appliances are leading to 60 house fires a week in the UK, according to Which?. These are fires which are destroying the wedding photographs and belongings of people like the Garnhams, are taking the young lives of people like Bernard Hender, and are the likely source of the devastation which ripped through the community in Grenfell Tower. We must all hope the authorities come up with the answers, and soon. "

All that, and we're still not even halfway through Parliament's first week back. Here's what's left to come: WednesdayThere'll be more swearing in. To recap, MPs are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Two to three days are usually set aside for this.

FridayDepending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a Queen's Speech been defeated. Thanks for joining us, see you again tomorrow.

Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government intends to bring down a Brexit process guillotine at the end of December 2020. If we haven't agreed a trade deal by then, we are out anyway. The ghost of no-deal, it seems, will be haunting business in Christmas future. The financial markets took fright and we saw the pound immediately give up all the gains it enjoyed since the Conservatives wona thumping majority last Friday. Suddenly pundits and investors who thought an 80-seat majority would neutralise the party's hard Brexit elements prepared - or even wanting - to leave without a deal were seemingly proved wrong. Read the full analysis here. Dipping out of Westminster for a moment, Nicola Sturgeon has made a statement on the outcome of the election to MSPs today. She told them leaving the European Union in January ""now seems inevitable"" and accused the Conservative government of ignoring the wishes of Scottish voters. ""The hard, possibly no deal, Brexit favoured by the prime minister poses a real danger to our economy and to social and environmental safeguards, at a time when we must substantially step up our efforts to tackle climate change,"" she said. ""And of course, Brexit is the cause of significant uncertainty and worry for our fellow EU citizens who contribute so much to modern Scotland. ""Scotland must respond to and seek to overcome these challenges."" She also insisted that if the UK government pressed ahead with its Withdrawal Agreement Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament it would be ""further proof"" of Westminster's ""contempt for devolution"".

MPs are patiently waiting to be sworn in one at a time. But when the time comes, what do they actually have to say? They have two options in accordance with theOaths Act 1878,external. First, they can swear an oath of allegiance to the Crown as specified in thePromissory Oaths Act 1868,external, with the wording: âI, [name], do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.â A slightly different phrase can be used for MPs wanting to be sworn in the Scottish manner. The second option is by making what's called a solemn affirmation, by saying: âI, [name], do solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law.â You can read more about all this in the Hansard Society'shandy guide,external. No doubt to the MPs' relief, they don't have to learn these statements off by heart - they're written out on a card that is held up for them when they reach the front of the line. Parliament is notorious for its bizarre traditions that go back to the mists of time. But one custom will be notably absent during Thursday's Queen's Speech: Dennis Skinner's heckle. The former Labour MP has become synonymous with the State Opening of Parliament for shouting dry jokes once Black Rod has instructed MPs into the House of Lords. But the veteran of the Commons lost the seat he had held since 1970 last week, after being defeated by the Conservative candidate. This video can not be played In 2017 he told Black Rod: ""Get your skates on, first race is at half past two"", in reference to the Queen's love of racing and her engagement at Ascot later that day His interventions are so common that when he stayed silent in 2015,we wrote an article on it(he said he had ""other things on my mind""). So, since we'll be missing that particular light-hearted moment, let's recap some of his most memorable heckles:  Will anyone fill those mighty shoes and give a shout-out in his absence? We'll find out on Thursday. After members of the cabinet file through, it's the turn of the opposition and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is followed by members of his shadow cabinet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces his constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip as he stands up and swears allegiance to the crown.

The Queen wore full state dress at the last state opening in October Speaking of the Queen's Speech,the state opening,externalon Thursday is the second in a couple of months. It'll have nearly all the usual ceremonial
elements - except the Queen will be wearing day dress and a hat, instead of
sparkly court dress and a tiara. The Crown will come along to the event, but not on the monarch's head. And sheâll arrive by car, not coach and horses, according to the office of Black Rod. The Speaker was elected at the end of the last Parliament, re-elected earlier this afternoon, taken to the House of Lords for Royal Approbation, and has taken his oath to be sworn in. Now, finally, Sir Lindsay Hoyle gets to sit down in the Speaker's chair (as you can see in the right of the picture). He's followed by the Father of the House, the prime minister, and then all of the other MPs. The process will carry on into the evening and then be suspended until 11:30 tomorrow morning. Sir Lindsay says he hopes it will be finished by tomorrow afternoon, but if necessary they can do one more session on Thursday, before the Queen's Speech. First up for swearing in is new Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. According to tradition he makes his oath of allegiance before signing the Common's roll. After a brief interlude, things are happening again in Parliament, with a bit more to-ing and fro-ing between Commons and Lords. Spot some big-hitters above observing cereonial proceedings as Sir Lindsay Hoyle is confirmed as Speaker. The swearing in process for MPs can now begin. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Surprised that Boris Johnson's new government is raising eyebrows already? Don't be. The new clause in the Brexit bill might rattle business - and the opposition parties - because it is, in theory, making it more likely that we could exit the EU departure lounge without a full trade deal in place. Whatever metaphor you want to use, be it a trap door or a new cliff edge, there is outrage already in some quarters of Westminster at the move. But if you are taken aback, then the last few extraordinary months must have passed you by. Read more from Laura here. Meanwhile, as ceremonial matters continue at Westminster, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has given his reaction to the news that Boris Johnson plans to formally enshrine in law a UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal deadline of 31 December 2020. ""We will do the maximum,"" Mr Barnier told reporters, when asked if it was possible to reach such a deal in just 11 months. Â© 2025 BBC.

The Queen wore full state dress at the last state opening in October Speaking of the Queen's Speech,the state opening,externalon Thursday is the second in a couple of months. It'll have nearly all the usual ceremonial
elements - except the Queen will be wearing day dress and a hat, instead of
sparkly court dress and a tiara. The Crown will come along to the event, but not on the monarch's head. And sheâll arrive by car, not coach and horses, according to the office of Black Rod. The Speaker was elected at the end of the last Parliament, re-elected earlier this afternoon, taken to the House of Lords for Royal Approbation, and has taken his oath to be sworn in. Now, finally, Sir Lindsay Hoyle gets to sit down in the Speaker's chair (as you can see in the right of the picture). He's followed by the Father of the House, the prime minister, and then all of the other MPs. The process will carry on into the evening and then be suspended until 11:30 tomorrow morning. Sir Lindsay says he hopes it will be finished by tomorrow afternoon, but if necessary they can do one more session on Thursday, before the Queen's Speech. First up for swearing in is new Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. According to tradition he makes his oath of allegiance before signing the Common's roll. After a brief interlude, things are happening again in Parliament, with a bit more to-ing and fro-ing between Commons and Lords. Spot some big-hitters above observing cereonial proceedings as Sir Lindsay Hoyle is confirmed as Speaker. The swearing in process for MPs can now begin. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Surprised that Boris Johnson's new government is raising eyebrows already? Don't be. The new clause in the Brexit bill might rattle business - and the opposition parties - because it is, in theory, making it more likely that we could exit the EU departure lounge without a full trade deal in place. Whatever metaphor you want to use, be it a trap door or a new cliff edge, there is outrage already in some quarters of Westminster at the move. But if you are taken aback, then the last few extraordinary months must have passed you by. Read more from Laura here. Meanwhile, as ceremonial matters continue at Westminster, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has given his reaction to the news that Boris Johnson plans to formally enshrine in law a UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal deadline of 31 December 2020. ""We will do the maximum,"" Mr Barnier told reporters, when asked if it was possible to reach such a deal in just 11 months. Â© 2025 BBC.

The Book People goes into administrationPricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has been appointed as the administrator while the troubled firm looks for a buyer.Business,"Book retailer The Book People has filed for administration with just one week to go before Christmas. PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has been appointed as the administrator while the troubled firm looks for a buyer. Founded in 1988 in Godalming, Surrey, The Book People has faced stiff competition from Amazon and other online retailers over the last decade. The business will continue to trade and there are no plans to make any of the 393 employees redundant, PwC said. As a result, customers should receive their orders in time for Christmas. The majority of the business's employees - 229 - are based in Bangor, Gwynedd. The firm sells books, gifts, toys and stationery online and via a catalogue, often at discounted prices. It has an annual turnover of Â£50m and sells more than 17 million children's books a year, PwC said. This video can not be played How to get kids to read books The company, one of the UK's largest independent book retailers, was acquired as part of a rescue deal in 2014 by private equity group Endless. James Woolley, partner at Endless, said it had ""worked hard"" to secure the firm's future and was ""disappointed"" not to have succeeded. ""The well-documented challenges in the retail environment, compounded by the strength of global online booksellers, has severely impacted operating cash flows over recent years,"" he added. Why are people shopping online late at night? Pre-Christmas shopping discounts 'could hit 50%' Toby Underwood, joint administrator and restructuring partner for PwC, said it was now exploring a sale of the business. ""I appreciate the obvious concerns that staff in particular will have as we move towards Christmas,"" he said. ""Whilst the administrators have funding to meet the payroll for December, the longer-term prospects for the business, staff, customers and suppliers will clearly be dependent upon whether a sale can be secured.""

Teenager jailed for lawyer's screwdriver murderEwan Ireland stabbed Peter Duncan in the heart after they brushed past each other at a shopping centre.Tyne & Wear,"This video can not be played Ewan Ireland caught on CCTV shoplifting screwdrivers A teenager who stabbed a lawyer to death with a screwdriver as he was walking home from work has been jailed for a minimum of 15 years. Ewan Ireland was 17 when he attacked Peter Duncan, 52, at the entrance to a shopping centre in Newcastle in August. A court heard the two brushed past each other when the teenager pulled out a screwdriver he had shoplifted and stabbed Mr Duncan in the heart. Ireland admitted murder and was jailed for life with a minimum of 15 years. The killer, who was able to be identified after he turned 18 in October, had 17 previous convictions for 31 offences between 2017 and 2019. At the time of the murder he was on bail for an offence of affray, was under investigation for a robbery and still subject to a 12-month conditional discharge for a battery offence the previous summer. In a victim impact statement read out at Newcastle Crown Court, Mr Duncan's widow Maria said her life ""was ruined by a senseless and unprovoked act"". ""The person who did this had convictions. Nothing stopped him. He continued and he murdered my husband,"" she said. Peter Duncan's family described him as a ""devoted father and husband"" Mr Duncan came into contact with Ireland at the entrance to Eldon Square shopping centre when they were walking in opposite directions. The court heard the teenager was looking for another youth with whom he had previously argued about cigarettes. Mr Duncan, who was an in-house lawyer for an international maritime firm, raised his arm to let Ireland past, but ""the defendant took exception to that"" and a struggle ensued, prosecutor Kevin Wardlaw said. After pushing him off, Mr Duncan was stabbed once through the heart and collapsed a short distance away near a Greggs outlet. The court heard Mr Duncan's 15-year-old son was in the city centre that evening for a cinema trip and saw the cordoned off area without realising his father had been attacked. ""I am angry he was out free, and cannot understand why he was not locked up,"" he said in a victim impact statement. ""If he had been we would still have my dad to this day."" Ewan Ireland had a string of convictions when he murdered Mr Duncan During sentencing, Mr Justice Lavender said it was Mr Duncan's ""bad luck to bump into you that day on his way home from work"". ""You started a fight, in the course of which you took out a screwdriver and stabbed him through the heart,"" he said. The judge said Ireland's offending started at the age of 14, with a string of convictions including theft, battery and making threats with knives. ""All too often, young men like you, who get into the habit of carrying weapons and using them to threaten others, move on to using those weapons to harm others, as you have done,"" he added. Ireland also admitted stealing screwdrivers and carrying an offensive weapon. Caroline Goodwin QC, defending, said the teenager ""had spoken of his absolute remorse and devastation at the act he occasioned which was needless and senseless and took away from the family their father"". The court heard Mr Duncan had been in the wrong place at the wrong time Det Ch Insp Jane Fairlamb said Ireland had been a promising young footballer who had been offered a lot of help to change his criminal behaviour. ""I think one of the most shocking elements of this crime is that it was in such a public place in a major shopping centre in our city and we probably all had that feeling that it could have been any one of us walking home from work,"" she said. ""With every contact that Ewan Ireland has had with the police and criminal justice system he gets opportunities to change his behaviour - support from different agencies to change that life of crime - he's had those opportunities."" She also said Mr Duncan's family was devastated by the loss and she did not have the words to express how deeply they were grieving.

Kuenssberg: A moment of early chest beating,"Boris Johnson held the first cabinet of his new government on Tuesday Surprised that Boris Johnson's new government is raising eyebrows already? Don't be. The new clause in the Brexit bill might rattle business - and the opposition parties - because it is, in theory, making it more likely that we could exit the EU departure lounge without a full trade deal in place. Whatever metaphor you want to use, be it a trap door or a new cliff edge, there is outrage already in some quarters of Westminster at the move. But if you are taken aback, then the last few extraordinary months must have passed you by. Brexit bill to rule out extension Can Tories deepen shallow roots? New ministers named as Johnson cabinet takes shape Most straightforwardly, the government, with its new whopping majority, promised in their manifesto that after we leave the EU, the trade talks would be wrapped up in a year and we will have left the transition - the period when we live more or less with the status quo. The new clause in the bill would put that vow into law (although as ever, until we have seen the bill in black and white it's worth reserving a bit of judgement). On the basis of the manifesto, Boris Johnson's opponents can hardly argue that they weren't warned. But with a majority of 80 at his back, it's not exactly likely that Parliament would have forced him to extend if he didn't want to. So this is a political signal, a moment of early chest beating too, designed to disappoint those who might have been hoping No 10 might slide to a softer Brexit over the next few months. And designed to gratify those who are adamant that Brexit must be completely ""done"" as soon as possible. Second of all, Boris Johnson seems to have concluded that if the talks are to go anywhere fast, there has to be a convincing clear deadline. It was his vow of a Halloween deadline that got him to Downing Street in the first place, and although it was broken in the end, there's little question that his attitude towards extending again and again changed the dynamics of the talks with the EU that got the revised deal done. Putting the deadline into law may also be designed to focus minds in Brussels. How effective that might be? That's a different question. But it's worth noting too that getting a trade deal done is not binary. There are potential ""patches"", as described by Rupert Harrison, George Osborne's former advisor. He suggests, for example, that a bare bones deal could be done covering goods, with ongoing talks covering other areas. It may not be as simple as an all singing, all dancing deal, or leaving the transition dramatically and suddenly on World Trade Organisation terms. Lastly, if the Brexit Bill is passed with this extension block in it, there is nothing, save a sense of potential embarrassment, to stop No 10 passing another law to undo it if they need to later on. Cynical? Perhaps. But with an 80 seat majority that SW1 is only barely beginning to understand, Downing Street is going to be able to change its mind, miss targets, go back on its word, without there being an immediate cost that puts their position in jeopardy. That doesn't mean shifting position would be desirable, or that it would be trouble free. But we are now in a different era. Whether you are delighted or devastated by the result, the new government is insulated from political shocks in a way that none has been since Tony Blair's last general election in 2005. During the coalition years, David Cameron could rely on a solid majority in Parliament, but only after careful, negotiation with the Lib Dems. The Conservatives have the chance here to govern in the way they please. Boris Johnson now has a majority of 80 in Parliament It's a total contrast to the last last three years, when the Tories have lived permanently on the edge of a government meltdown. Remember too, this government also includes some people who enjoy goading their opponents - just as they did during the Vote Leave campaign, just as they did in the summer and autumn in No 10, just as they did during the election campaign, and just as they may well do in government. It will be fascinating to see if, secure in Downing Street, Boris Johnson curbs his and his team's enthusiasm to court controversy. Even with a hefty majority, there's a limit to the amount of sabre rattling and reform the government machine can handle. But at least for now, there's plenty of political capital available to be used to follow the pattern of provoke and repeat (then retreat if necessary) while the opposition can only really look on. And if you're frothing at No 10's plan for the Brexit bill, be warned, as the prime minister told his cabinet this morning, maybe ""you ain't seen nothing yet"".

UK unemployment falls to lowest level since 1975,"UK unemployment fell to its lowest level since January 1975 in the three months to October this year. The number of people out of work fell by 13,000 to 1.281 million,Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.,external The employment rate rose to an all-time high of 76.2%, with an increase of 24,000 taking the number of people in work up to a total of 32.8 million. However, annual wage growth, excluding bonuses, slowed to 3.5% from 3.6% from July to September. ONS head of labour market David Freeman said: ""While the estimate of the employment rate nudged up in the most recent quarter, the longer-term picture has seen it broadly flat over the last few quarters. However, unemployment among women has reached a new record low. ""Vacancies have fallen for 10 months in a row and are now below 800,000 for the first time in over two years. ""Pay is still increasing in real terms, but its growth rate has slowed in the last few months."" There were an estimated 794,000 vacancies in the UK for September to November 2019. That is 20,000 fewer than in the last quarter and 59,000 fewer than a year earlier. The estimated employment rate for men was 80.4% and for women was 72%. The increase in women's employment in recent years is partly a result of changes to their State Pension age, which has meant fewer retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. The growing importance of the night-time economy The jobs eight out of 10 Britons do The slight slowdown in wage growth is partly caused by the fact that in October 2018, some unusually high bonuses were paid to some workers. Bonuses given this October returned to more expected levels. For October 2019, average regular pay, before tax and other deductions, was estimated at Â£509.68 per week. Chancellor Sajid Javid said: ""There's talent up and down this country - three-quarters of employment growth in the last year has been outside London and the South East. ""I'm looking forward to getting Brexit done and unleashing Britain's potential, levelling up opportunity across the country."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""The UK's jobs boom continues to be a big plus point for the economy, but it is slowly losing momentum. ""Businesses have shown a strong appetite to take on staff in recent years, and climbing employment levels have boosted household incomes, adding buoyancy to the economy. However, firms are now cutting back on new hires as it becomes harder to find the skills they need. ""Uncertainty and slowing global growth have also made businesses a bit more cautious in their recruitment plans, and vacancies are expected to continue falling into 2020."" Employment is at a record high and unemployment at a record low in October's figures, but the Office for National Statistics says that both are broadly flat. How can that be true? These records involve the kind of tiny changes we're used to seeing with new records in the 100-metre sprint. Employment's previous record high was January's figure of 76.13%. October's estimate is 76.15%: an improvement of 0.02 percentage points. For unemployment, the record has gone down from 3.797% in May to 3.757% in October's figures - a change of 0.04 percentage points. So the estimates haven't been better in a long time, but the improvements are tiny and certainly smaller than the margin of error in any figures like these. Coupled with the substantial fall in job vacancies and a hint of slowing wage growth, the emerging picture is less of rampaging record highs and more of decelerating demand for new workers.

New ministers named as Johnson cabinet takes shape,"Simon Hart said he had been given an amazing opportunity Boris Johnson is carrying out a limited reshuffle of his government after urging newly elected Tory MPs to ""change our country for the better"". Simon Hart has been named as Welsh secretary, replacing Alun Cairns, who quit at the start of the election. And Nicky Morgan stays as culture secretary, despite standing down as an MP. She is taking a peerage and will sit as a cabinet minister in the Lords. Opposition parties said she had been ""rewarded for political sycophancy"". But Ms Morgan, who will be in charge of broadband and media policy, suggested she might only be in the role for a few weeks - pending what are expected to be far-reaching changes to the PM's top team after the UK has left the EU on 31 January.

Ms Morgan took many by surprise when she announced that she would not be standing as MP for Loughborough at the election. Nicky Morgan stood down as MP for Loughborough at the general election However, the former education secretary - who cited the abuse that female MPs had received as one of the reasons for her standing down - was one of Mr Johnson's most visible backers during the campaign, prompting speculation she intended to remain in public life. And the news that she has accepted a life peerage and will remain in cabinet has attracted criticism. Liberal Democrat culture spokeswoman Layla Moran said only an elected Upper Chamber would stop ""this kind of sycophancy being rewarded"" while Labour's Jo Stevens said the appointment was ""absolutely disgraceful"".

While it is rare for cabinet ministers in charge of government departments not to be in the elected Commons, both the transport and business briefs were held by peers in the last Labour government. The choice of Simon Hart as Welsh secretary marks a big promotion for the 56-year old MP, who was previously a junior Cabinet Office minister. Reacting to his appointment, Mr Hart said: ""It's great to have this opportunity. I've got my orders and I'm going to try and do it as best I can."" The Welsh post has been vacant since early last month, whenAlun Cairns quit over claimshe knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. The PM has welcomed the new Conservative MPs to Westminster Mr Hart and Ms Morgan both backed Remain in the 2016 referendum but have been strong supporters of the PM's Brexit deal. Mr Johnson has been getting down to business following last week's election victory, speaking to foreign leaders, including US President Donald Trump, and addressing all Conservative MPs at a private meeting in Parliament. Earlier, he hailed the ""incredible achievement"" of the 109 Tory MPs elected for the first time last week, including many representing areas that had previously been die-hard Labour territory. ""You've come from places that the Conservative Party have not been represented for a hundred years, if ever,"" he said at a photo call in the Palace of Westminster. ""That's a fantastic tribute to you. ""But it also shows what we've got to do now because you have not only changed the political map of this country but you've changed our party for the better.

WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external Downing Street has said the government plans to ask the new Parliament to have its first debate and vote on the PM's withdrawal agreement - the legislation needed to ratify Brexit - on Friday. A spokesman said it planned to start the process of getting the Withdrawal Agreement Bill through Parliament in the ""proper constitutional way"". With a Commons majority of 80, the PM is expected to get the bill into law with few changes in time for the UK to leave the EU on 31 January. Before that, the PM will set out his legislative plans for the year ahead in a Queen's Speech on Thursday. Tuesday Proceedings begin when MPs gather for their first duty: to elect the Speaker, Sir Lindsay Hoyle, who replaced John Bercow in November. Technically, MPs can hold a vote on this motion but this has never happened in practice. Later in the day, the Speaker will begin the process of swearing in MPs, who are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days. Friday Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill - the legislation that will implement Brexit - to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days in order to leave the EU by the then Brexit deadline of 31 October. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated. What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?

It's been pitched as the Brexit election, so did people actually vote according to their stance on the European Union? YouGov have been looking into this. And its survey of 40,000 British adults suggests the Conservatives did manage to win the votes of around three-quarters of Leave voters. Labour, on the other hand, only managed to attract about half of Remain voters - a reduction in the share they had in the 2017 election. That drop came mainly at the hands of the Lib Dems, who boosted their vote share amongst Remain voters to 21%, up from 12% in 2017: The Conservatives didn't manage to hold on to their Remainers - down to 19% from 25% in 2017. But Labour didn't hold onto Leavers either - their vote share amongst Leavers was 14%, down from 24% in 2017.

Simon JackBBC Business Editor The government intends to bring down a Brexit process guillotine at the end of December 2020. If we haven't agreed a trade deal by then, we are out anyway. The ghost of no-deal, it seems, will be haunting business in Christmas future. The financial markets took fright and we saw the pound immediately give up all the gains it enjoyed since the Conservatives wona thumping majority last Friday. Suddenly pundits and investors who thought an 80-seat majority would neutralise the party's hard Brexit elements prepared - or even wanting - to leave without a deal were seemingly proved wrong. Read the full analysis here. Dipping out of Westminster for a moment, Nicola Sturgeon has made a statement on the outcome of the election to MSPs today. She told them leaving the European Union in January ""now seems inevitable"" and accused the Conservative government of ignoring the wishes of Scottish voters. ""The hard, possibly no deal, Brexit favoured by the prime minister poses a real danger to our economy and to social and environmental safeguards, at a time when we must substantially step up our efforts to tackle climate change,"" she said. ""And of course, Brexit is the cause of significant uncertainty and worry for our fellow EU citizens who contribute so much to modern Scotland. ""Scotland must respond to and seek to overcome these challenges."" She also insisted that if the UK government pressed ahead with its Withdrawal Agreement Bill without the consent of the Scottish Parliament it would be ""further proof"" of Westminster's ""contempt for devolution"". What's going on right now? We're knee-deep in Parliamentary ceremony here, but a lot of talk today has been about Brexit. A quick summary for you: Number one priority, of course, is the prime minister's favourite slogan - ""get Brexit done"" (spot the abbreviation).

MPs are patiently waiting to be sworn in one at a time. But when the time comes, what do they actually have to say? They have two options in accordance with theOaths Act 1878,external. First, they can swear an oath of allegiance to the Crown as specified in thePromissory Oaths Act 1868,external, with the wording: âI, [name], do swear that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law. So help me God.â A slightly different phrase can be used for MPs wanting to be sworn in the Scottish manner. The second option is by making what's called a solemn affirmation, by saying: âI, [name], do solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm, that I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, her heirs and successors, according to law.â You can read more about all this in the Hansard Society'shandy guide,external. No doubt to the MPs' relief, they don't have to learn these statements off by heart - they're written out on a card that is held up for them when they reach the front of the line. Parliament is notorious for its bizarre traditions that go back to the mists of time. But one custom will be notably absent during Thursday's Queen's Speech: Dennis Skinner's heckle. The former Labour MP has become synonymous with the State Opening of Parliament for shouting dry jokes once Black Rod has instructed MPs into the House of Lords. But the veteran of the Commons lost the seat he had held since 1970 last week, after being defeated by the Conservative candidate. This video can not be played In 2017 he told Black Rod: ""Get your skates on, first race is at half past two"", in reference to the Queen's love of racing and her engagement at Ascot later that day His interventions are so common that when he stayed silent in 2015,we wrote an article on it(he said he had ""other things on my mind""). So, since we'll be missing that particular light-hearted moment, let's recap some of his most memorable heckles:  Will anyone fill those mighty shoes and give a shout-out in his absence? We'll find out on Thursday. After members of the cabinet file through, it's the turn of the opposition and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is followed by members of his shadow cabinet. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announces his constituency of Uxbridge and South Ruislip as he stands up and swears allegiance to the crown. He opts to swear on the King James Bible rather than other options from the Christian faith. MPs of other faiths
can swear on their own holy book: the Koran, the Guru Granth Sahib and the Old
Testament in Hebrew are all available...read more in this article from 2015. Non-believers can opt out of any mention of religion.

The Queen wore full state dress at the last state opening in October Speaking of the Queen's Speech,the state opening,externalon Thursday is the second in a couple of months. It'll have nearly all the usual ceremonial
elements - except the Queen will be wearing day dress and a hat, instead of
sparkly court dress and a tiara. The Crown will come along to the event, but not on the monarch's head. And sheâll arrive by car, not coach and horses, according to the office of Black Rod. The Speaker was elected at the end of the last Parliament, re-elected earlier this afternoon, taken to the House of Lords for Royal Approbation, and has taken his oath to be sworn in. Now, finally, Sir Lindsay Hoyle gets to sit down in the Speaker's chair (as you can see in the right of the picture). He's followed by the Father of the House, the prime minister, and then all of the other MPs. The process will carry on into the evening and then be suspended until 11:30 tomorrow morning. Sir Lindsay says he hopes it will be finished by tomorrow afternoon, but if necessary they can do one more session on Thursday, before the Queen's Speech. First up for swearing in is new Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle. According to tradition he makes his oath of allegiance before signing the Common's roll. After a brief interlude, things are happening again in Parliament, with a bit more to-ing and fro-ing between Commons and Lords. Spot some big-hitters above observing cereonial proceedings as Sir Lindsay Hoyle is confirmed as Speaker. The swearing in process for MPs can now begin. Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor Surprised that Boris Johnson's new government is raising eyebrows already? Don't be. The new clause in the Brexit bill might rattle business - and the opposition parties - because it is, in theory, making it more likely that we could exit the EU departure lounge without a full trade deal in place. Whatever metaphor you want to use, be it a trap door or a new cliff edge, there is outrage already in some quarters of Westminster at the move. But if you are taken aback, then the last few extraordinary months must have passed you by. Read more from Laura here. Meanwhile, as ceremonial matters continue at Westminster, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has given his reaction to the news that Boris Johnson plans to formally enshrine in law a UK-EU post-Brexit trade deal deadline of 31 December 2020. ""We will do the maximum,"" Mr Barnier told reporters, when asked if it was possible to reach such a deal in just 11 months. Â© 2025 BBC.

"UK unemployment falls to lowest level since 1975Employment rises to all-time high, while wage growth slows less sharply from August to October.BusinessComments","UK unemployment fell to its lowest level since January 1975 in the three months to October this year. The number of people out of work fell by 13,000 to 1.281 million,Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures show.,external The employment rate rose to an all-time high of 76.2%, with an increase of 24,000 taking the number of people in work up to a total of 32.8 million. However, annual wage growth, excluding bonuses, slowed to 3.5% from 3.6% from July to September. ONS head of labour market David Freeman said: ""While the estimate of the employment rate nudged up in the most recent quarter, the longer-term picture has seen it broadly flat over the last few quarters. However, unemployment among women has reached a new record low. ""Vacancies have fallen for 10 months in a row and are now below 800,000 for the first time in over two years. ""Pay is still increasing in real terms, but its growth rate has slowed in the last few months."" There were an estimated 794,000 vacancies in the UK for September to November 2019. That is 20,000 fewer than in the last quarter and 59,000 fewer than a year earlier. The estimated employment rate for men was 80.4% and for women was 72%. The increase in women's employment in recent years is partly a result of changes to their State Pension age, which has meant fewer retiring between the ages of 60 and 65. The growing importance of the night-time economy The jobs eight out of 10 Britons do The slight slowdown in wage growth is partly caused by the fact that in October 2018, some unusually high bonuses were paid to some workers. Bonuses given this October returned to more expected levels. For October 2019, average regular pay, before tax and other deductions, was estimated at Â£509.68 per week. Chancellor Sajid Javid said: ""There's talent up and down this country - three-quarters of employment growth in the last year has been outside London and the South East. ""I'm looking forward to getting Brexit done and unleashing Britain's potential, levelling up opportunity across the country."" Tej Parikh, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""The UK's jobs boom continues to be a big plus point for the economy, but it is slowly losing momentum. ""Businesses have shown a strong appetite to take on staff in recent years, and climbing employment levels have boosted household incomes, adding buoyancy to the economy. However, firms are now cutting back on new hires as it becomes harder to find the skills they need. ""Uncertainty and slowing global growth have also made businesses a bit more cautious in their recruitment plans, and vacancies are expected to continue falling into 2020."" Employment is at a record high and unemployment at a record low in October's figures, but the Office for National Statistics says that both are broadly flat. How can that be true? These records involve the kind of tiny changes we're used to seeing with new records in the 100-metre sprint. Employment's previous record high was January's figure of 76.13%. October's estimate is 76.15%: an improvement of 0.02 percentage points. For unemployment, the record has gone down from 3.797% in May to 3.757% in October's figures - a change of 0.04 percentage points. So the estimates haven't been better in a long time, but the improvements are tiny and certainly smaller than the margin of error in any figures like these. Coupled with the substantial fall in job vacancies and a hint of slowing wage growth, the emerging picture is less of rampaging record highs and more of decelerating demand for new workers.

Pope scraps pontifical secrecy rule over sex abuse,"Pope Francis has faced pressure to address the sexual abuse crisis in the Church The Pope has declared that the rule of ""pontifical secrecy"" no longer applies to the sexual abuse of minors, in a bid to improve transparency in such cases. The Church previously shrouded sexual abuse cases in secrecy, in what it said was an effort to protect the privacy of victims and reputations of the accused. But new papal documents on Tuesday lifted restrictions on those who report abuse or say they have been victims. Church leaders called for the rule's abolition at a February Vatican summit. They said the lifting of the rule in such cases would improve transparency and the ability of the police and other civil legal authorities to request information from the Church. Information in abuse cases should still be treated with ""security, integrity and confidentiality"", the Pope said in his announcement. He instructed Vatican officials to comply with civil laws and assist civil judicial authorities in investigating such cases. The Pope also changed the Vatican's definition of child pornography, increasing the age of the subject from 14 or under to 18 or under. Charles Scicluna, the Archbishop of Malta and the Vatican's most experienced sex abuse investigator, called the move an ""epochal decision that removes obstacles and impediments"", telling Vatican news that ""the question of transparency now is being implemented at the highest level"". Pope orders clergy to report sex abuse Child sexual abuse and the Catholic Church: What you need to know Francis condemns child sex abuse and cover-ups The Church has been rocked by thousands of reports of sexual abuse by priests and accusations of cover-ups by senior clergy around the world. Pope Francis has faced serious pressure to provide leadership and generate workable solutions to the crisis, which has engulfed the Church in recent years. Pontifical secrecy was designed to protect sensitive information such as communications between the Vatican and papal embassies - in a similar fashion to the secrecy applied to diplomatic cables. But it was also applied over the years to judicial cases, to protect the privacy of victims and the identities of those accused. Critics said pontifical secrecy had been abused by some Church officials to avoid co-operation with the police in abuse cases. ""Certain jurisdictions would have easily quoted the pontifical secret ... to say that they could not, and that they were not, authorised to share information with either state authorities or the victims,"" Archbishop Scicluna said. ""Now that impediment, we might call it that way, has been lifted, and the pontifical secret is no more an excuse."" Under the new instruction, the pontifical secret no longer binds those working in offices of the Roman Curia to confidentiality on other offences if committed in conjunction with child abuse or child pornography. Witnesses, alleged victims, and the person who filed the report are also be unbound from obligations of silence. On his 83rd birthday, Pope Francis has responded to a longstanding complaint from survivors by announcing that any testimony gathered by the Church in relation to cases of sexual violence, the abuse of minors and child pornography will now be made available to state authorities. In the past, the Church has been accused of using secrecy laws as a justification for not reporting cases of abuse. The consequence of breaching the pontifical secret was excommunication from the Church, so there was little incentive to be open to state authorities. That prohibition has now been abolished. It is the latest attempt by the Roman Catholic Church to address the scourge of clerical abuse that has manifested itself across continents and in a range of religious institutions.

How to avoid Christmas traffic and train delays,"Traffic is expected to be heavy from 12:00 GMT on Friday Drivers are being warned to expect long tailbacks on the UK's busiest roads as millions of people travel for Christmas The RAC and AA motoring groups have warned sections of the M1, M5, M6 and M25 are likely to see heavy delays. Highways England said 98% of roadworks on motorways and major A-roads had been lifted or completed by 06:00 GMT on Friday. Rail passengers have been advised to plan ahead due to engineering works and strikes. Friday is expected to be the busiest day for people going abroad for Christmas, according to the Association of British Travel Agents (Abta). It said the Canary Islands, Cape Verde, Morocco, Turkey and Egypt were popular short-haul destinations while the long-haul market had seen high demand for Dubai and Goa. Abta chief executive Mark Tanzer said people should leave extra time to get to airports because the roads would be busy.  12:00 - 19:00Friday 10:00 - 15:00Saturday 10:00 - 16:00Sunday 10:00 - 15:00Monday 14:00 - 18:00Tuesday The RAC and traffic data company Inrix estimated about 4.7 million ""leisure"" journeys would be made by car on Friday and warned of delays as Christmas traffic mixes with commuters. Ben Aldous from the RAC said: ""While Christmas Day is still a little way off, it looks as though millions of drivers are planning to complete their getaway trips this week. ""Unfortunately, when you add in the prospect of unsettled weather, with heavy rain and strong winds in some parts, these are likely to be pretty unpleasant drives for many of us."" Inrix has also predicted places likely to have some of the longest delays, based on analysis of traffic flows during previous Christmas getaways, as well as things like planned roadworks and events. The M1 between Bedfordshire and Northamptonshire is expected to be heavily congested on Saturday and Sunday, along with the northern and western sections of the M25 around London. Delays of up to an hour are also possible from Friday morning on the M6 between Birmingham and Wolverhampton, Inrix warned. The AA said it expected traffic to reach a peak on Friday after 16:00, with the M5 between Bristol and Weston-Super-Mare likely to see hold-ups. Most roadworks on major routes will be lifted by Friday but some of those staying in place are those creating smart motorways Highways England said it would remove 98% of its roadworks by Friday morning, freeing up more than 800 miles of motorways and major roads, but that the rest would have to stay in place for safety reasons. The longest stretch of roadworks to remain in place is 43 miles on the M4 between junction six, near Slough, and junction 12 near Reading. The work is part of theÂ£848 million smart motorways,externalproject to open the hard shoulder to traffic. Other smart motorway roadworks staying in place include 20 miles of the M62 near Manchester and 19 miles of the M6 near Stafford. There is more information on theHighways England website,externaland also atTraffic Scotland,external,Traffic Wales,externalandTrafficwatch Northern Ireland,external. How smart are smart motorways? Engineering adds to weekend rail woe Northern cancels services as new timetable starts Network Rail does engineering work over Christmas because it is quieter and fewer people travel by train No trains run on Christmas Day, 25 December, and it is normal for only a few to run on 26 December. Network Rail is working on 386 engineering projects between Friday and 2 January. Most lines will remain open as normal but London Paddington station will be closed from Tuesday, Christmas Eve, until Friday 27 December, with no trains running. Changes to services include: Paddington: No trains between 24-27 December and a reduced timetable will be in effect from 28-31 December King's Cross: Reduced timetable on Friday 27 December Liverpool Street: Services to Stansted Airport to start and terminate at Tottenham Hale on 26 December Ashford International to Canterbury West: Replacement buses from 27-29 December and Southeastern high-speed and Eurostar trains will not stop at Ashford from 26-29 December.

The operatoris running a reduced timetable,external, warning peak services are likely to be busier than normal and replacement buses on some routes. A spokesman for SWR said an alternative timetable would be in place for the week starting 23 December.

NHS board to take legal action against contractor,"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has instructed legal action against a contractor involved in the construction of its biggest hospital. Brookfield Multiplex was responsible for the design and construction of the Â£575m Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) complex in Glasgow. There have beenproblems at the campussince it opened in 2015. Lawyers have been instructed to raise court proceedings against the contractor ""as a matter of urgency"". MacRoberts LLP are acting on behalf of the health board, according to official papers. Apublic inquiry is expectedto look at how the design, handover and maintenance contributed to ineffective infection control at the QEUH complex. It will also cover the new children's hospital in Edinburgh, which also involved Brookfield Multiplex. This was due to open in 2017, but will now not be ready until next autumn at the earliestafter serious problems with the ventilation systemwere uncovered. Chief executive at NHS Glasgow and Greater Clyde, Jane Grant, confirmed that the board had agreed the legal move but she added no further comment would be made about the proceedings. Last month,NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde was placed in ""special measures""following issues over infection prevention, management and control at the hospitals. In January it emerged thattwo patients at the QEUH had died after contracting a fungal infection linked to pigeon droppings. In November it came to light that two children who had died in 2017 at the Royal Hospital for Children (RHC), which is part of the complex, were treated on award affected by water contamination. That year it was also announced thatcladding similar to that used on Grenfell Towerwould be replaced, at a cost to the taxpayer of Â£6m. In 2018 a panel fell from the 10th floor of the QEUH, shattering near the front entrance. No-one was injured, but safety netting was erected around the hospital. Reports claimed panels had fallen from the building on at least three occasions since it opened. The health board said an investigation into what caused the fall was inconclusive. 10-year-old Milly Main, pictured here with her mother, died in 2017 In 2017, 10-year-old Milly Main was recovering from leukaemia at the Royal Hospital for Children. But her Hickman line, a catheter used to administer drugs, became infected. Milly went into toxic shock and died days later. Her family say they were kept in the dark about a potential link to contaminated water problems at the hospital. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde insisted it was impossible to determine the source of Milly's infection because there was no requirement to test the water supply at the time. At the end of last month, the board was placed in ""special measures"". Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said stage four of the NHS Board Performance Escalation Framework was necessary to implement because of the issues over infection prevention and control. The move in effect means an oversight board is in place, chaired by chief nursing officer Prof Fiona McQueen. Both NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde and Ms Freeman have apologised to the parents of two children who died at the hospital. Three-year-old Mason Djemat, who was being treated for a rare genetic disease, died on 9 August 2017. Milly died three weeks later while recovering from leukaemia treatment. Both were treated on a ward affected by water contamination at the Royal Hospital for Children. The trials of Scotland's super hospital The troubled past of the QEUH Jane Grant, chief executive of NHS GGC, said ""Since its opening, a number of issues have arisen around the operational effectiveness of the hospital which have impacted on the seamless delivery of safe and effective healthcare. ""I am sorry for the distress this has caused."" She added that she had commissioned three reviews, which had considered capacity, facilities and clinical outcomes at the hospitals. They had ""confirmed a number of issues"" which the board are ""determined to resolve"", she said. Ms Grant continued: ""Having sought independent legal advice, we can confirm the board today has agreed to pursue legal action. ""In light of this, the report we commissioned on facilities and environmental impact cannot be published as this would potentially cause significant prejudice to NHS GGC. ""We will, however, publish the report when it is possible, but at the moment we are unable to comment any further on legal proceedings.""

Scotland must 'walk the talk' on climate change,"Action across the economy is needed in the next 12 months if Scotland's new target for greenhouse gas emissions is to be met, a report has warned. The Committee on Climate Change (CCC) said Scotland's 2045 date for net-zero emissions was a ""step-change in ambition"" for the country. It said Scotland now needed to ""walk the talk"" ahead of the COP26 summit. CCC suggested ending sales of new fossil fuel cars by 2030 and supporting low carbon farming. Theindependent government advisory body,externalsaid the UK's presidency of next year'sUN climate talks in Glasgow- known as COP26 - will rest on ""real action at home"". The CCC annual assessment said new policies must now begin to deliver meaningful emissions reductions and be extended to all areas of the economy. Most of the rapid reductions achieved in recent years have been explained by the ending of coal-fired power stations at Cockenzie and Longannet. Committee chairman Lord Deben said: ""Scotland has set an ambitious world-leading net-zero target of 2045. Now Scotland needs to walk the talk. ""The new legally-binding target for 2030 - a 75% reduction in emissions compared to 1990 - is extremely stretching and demands new policies that begin to work immediately. The spotlight is now on Scotland's plan to deliver meaningful reductions across all sectors of the economy."" The Scottish government has said it will bring forward an updated Climate Change Plan next year. Scotland's reduced emissions can be partly explained by the ending of coal-fired power stations at Longannet and Cockenzie In November 2020, Scotland will host the UN climate conference, where world leaders will be asked to make strong commitments to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The goal is to limit global warming to between 1.5C and 2C. This year's talks in Madrid ended on Sunday, after two extra days, with a compromise deal agreed but with some issues left unresolved. Those issues - including carbon markets - may have to be revisited when the UK hosts negotiations. Ahead of those talks, the CCC report said the Scottish and UK governments must now demonstrate to the rest of the world a ""clear and credible commitment"" to achieving net-zero by the middle of the century. It said much more work still needed to be done by the Scottish government, especially in agriculture where it said plans to replace the EU's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) lag behind both England and Wales. The committee called for the new framework of incentives for low carbon farming and said it needed to be completed next year. On transport, it urged ministers to consider bringing forward the target for ending the sale of new fossil-fuel cars and vans from 2032 to 2030. Scotland's target is already eight years ahead of the UK's 2040 date. A Scottish government spokesman said the global climate emergency was at the centre of its programme for government. He added: ""We recognise that even more will need to be done for Scotland to reach net-zero emissions by 2045. ""The committee's advice for the UK government is also clear - they must 'step up and match Scottish policy ambition in areas where key powers are reserved'. ""Scottish ministers have written to their UK counterparts on several occasions to call for such action."" Gina Hanrahan, head of policy at WWF Scotland, said 2020 was a ""huge test of Scotland's climate leadership at home and abroad"" and ""rapid, transformational action and funding"" was required to maximise ""influence on the global stage"". ""Scottish agriculture is already at the frontline of climate change and emissions from the sector remain worryingly high,"" she said. ""But we can be at the forefront of climate-friendly farming if we transform rural policy and support, while providing new advice and training for farmers and land managers.""

London Fire Brigade 'slow and wasteful',"Inspectors found some London firefighters had not received essential training in years The London Fire Brigade (LFB) has been ""wasteful"" and ""slow to implement changes"" needed after the Grenfell Tower fire, a watchdog has said. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) found firefighters missed training and attended too many false alarms. The LFB saw the report six weeks ago and commissioner Dany Cotton stood down earlier than had been planned. London Assembly members are set to vote on the next commissioner later today. The Fire, Resilience and Emergency Planning Committee will vote on holding a confirmation hearing for Andy Roe to become the new commissioner. Reacting to the report Mr Roe,who was announced by Sadiq Khan as Ms Cotton's successor, said he recognised aspects of the brigade which were not ""good enough"". He added: ""Training our staff is a priority and we are heavily investing to make sure our firefighters have the right skills to carry out their roles effectively. ""We are also planning a new high tech training centre in Croydon, which will include a new Real Fire Training Venue."" Of 15 fire services to be inspected, London, Essex and Gloucestershire were the three to be rated as requiring improvement. Matt Parr, HM Inspector of Fire and Rescue Services, said of the LFB: ""Many of its projects are wasteful, projects get started and stalled. The organisation as a whole is slow to learn. ""We are absolutely not criticising every firefighter in London - there are lots of people who are very dedicated. ""But what it doesn't leave you with is the impression that the organisation is well-run and where value for money is top of their agenda."" Dany Cotton will stand down as London's fire chief at the end of this month Ms Cottonhad been due to retire in April but brought her departure forward and will stand down at the end of the year. The report said LFB had ""clearly learned lessons from the Grenfell Tower incident"". However, it ""has been slow to implement the changes needed, which is typical of the brigade's approach to organisational change"", it added. The report found some fire engine drivers had not received refresher training for up to 20 years, despite national guidance recommending this took place every five years. There has been no systematic training programme for firefighters tasked with responding to terror attacks in the capital. Many frontline officers did not have suitable personal protective equipment and ""lacked the confidence"" to respond, the report found. Inspectors said London fire crews attended too many unnecessary false alarms LFB response times - some six minutes and 39 seconds on average as of the year 2017-18 - were ""excellent"", but the report said about 48% of its call-outs were to false alarms and not enough was being done to reduce unnecessary call-outs. In another finding, relevant to the Grenfell disaster, inspectors found LFB was the only service in the country to not follow national operational guidelines. Mr Parr said: ""I don't think there's any justification for having a 'we do it our way' approach in London at all."" Andy Roe, who will replace Ms Cotton as London Fire Commissioner from January, said: ""I recognise that what's been highlighted in the report isn't good enough and as the new commissioner I am committed to making the necessary improvements when I take on the position in January. ""We are already delivering some of the key improvements they have highlighted and doing everything we can to provide the best possible service to the people of London and keep them safe."" HMICFRS carried out a root and branch examination across a third of the country's 45 fire services. Six of the 15 fire services were deemed good in effectiveness and efficiency of their services, as well as how they treated people. The report found Essex Fire Brigade required improvement in preventing fires and other risks and promoting diversity. Essex's Chief Fire Officer and chief executive, Jo Turton said: ""There are no surprises in these findings; the feedback echoes what we told the inspectorate, and reassures us that we are self-aware and that our focus is in the right areas."" Gloucestershire Fire's report said it was ""one of the worst"" services and highlighted issues leading up to theresignation of former chief Stewart Edgar. The report mentioned ""distressing examples of previous bullying and harassment by senior leaders"", which included staff being ""humiliated"" in front of peers. Those managers, the report added, threatened ""demotion for temporary promoted managers if they didn't carry out certain leaders' wishes"". But it also highlighted positives, including that the service had ""by quite a margin, the biggest proportion of female firefighters in England"", though attempts to recruit more BAME firefighters had fallen much shorter. The watchdog also carried out inspections of 12 other fire and rescue services.  It found: Concerns over some aspects of Buckinghamshire Fire and Rescue Service Cleveland Fire Brigade was performing to a good standard County Durham and Darlington Fire and Rescue Service was performing to a good standard Cumbria Fire and Rescue Service was performing to a good standard Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service rated as good by inspectors Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service needed to make improvements A mixed picture for East Sussex Fire and Rescue Service North Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service needed to make improvements Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service was performing well Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service was rated good South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service was rated good West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service was performing to a good standard Fire chief quits early amid Grenfell criticism Chief fire officer quits over vehicle sale HMICFRS London Fire Brigade Essex County Fire and Rescue Service Gloucestershire Fire and Rescue Service Croydon has been named in the top 50 places to live in England Chaos at Tube station as escalator will not be fixed for six months Police block pro-Palestine protest from gathering close to London synagogue Tough test as Town resume chase for title Which parts of Southwark saw the most crime in 2024?

"Iran threat hasn't gone away, says Royal Navy head","Admiral Tony Radakin officially replaced Sir Phillip Jones as head of the Royal Navy in June Iran's threat to British shipping in the Gulf ""hasn't gone away"", the head of the Royal Navy has told the BBC. In July, Iran's Revolutionary Guard seized British-flagged tanker the Stena Impero in the Straits of Hormuz. Admiral Tony Radakin - giving his first interview since becomingFirst Sea Lord in June,external- described it as ""aggressive"" and ""outrageous"". He said that the UK wanted to ""de-escalate"" tensions with Iran following the release of the Stena Impero. But for now, he added, the navy would maintain a heightened military presence in the Gulf. At the time of the seizure, the UK had one frigate - HMS Montrose - stationed in the region. She has since been joined by the destroyer HMS Defender. Seized British-flagged tanker leaves Iran Iran, tankers and the Gulf crisis explained Commissioning ceremony held for new carrier On a visit to the region, Adm Radakin said: ""We have to react to when a nation is as aggressive as Iran was. ""It was an outrageous act that happened on the high seas and that's why we have responded the way that we have."" The Stena Impero was released two months after it was seized by Iran for allegedly breaking maritime rules More controversially, Adm Radakin also made clear that the UK would continue to work with a US-led coalition, known as ""Operation Sentinel"", to provide maritime security in the Gulf, rather than join a rival European operation being set up by France. While he welcomed the French initiative, he said there were ""very simple practical reasons"" for the UK to remain part of the US-led operation, including existing strong military ties. He added that the UK had ""been very clear"" it did not support the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure on Iran. The Gulf isn't the only region where the Royal Navy is looking to have a more permanent presence. Adm Radakin said he was also discussing plans to station ships in the Caribbean and in the Asia Pacific region. However, he suggested his greatest challenge was in the North Atlantic, where he said Russian underwater activity was at a 30-year high. That could be a potential threat to Britain's nuclear armed submarines - which must operate undetected. He admitted that the job was becoming harder with Russia's own investment in quieter submarines. Adm Radakin was joined by the Duchess of Cornwall at a ceremony for the HMS Prince of Wales The First Sea Lord has set himself the ambitious goal of transforming the Royal Navy to meet new threats, including ""from space and cyber"", which would mean investing in new technologies. He said his hope was that the new government would soon conduct a comprehensive defence review to properly assess the threats.

Boeing to halt 737 Max production in JanuaryThe manufacturer says it will stop production of the troubled jet involved in two deadly crashes.Business,"Boeing will temporarily halt production of its troubled 737 Max airliner in January, the manufacturer said. Production of the jet had continued despite the model being grounded for nine months after two deadly crashes. More than 300 people died when two 737 Max aircraft crashed in Indonesia and Ethiopia after reported problems with a new feature. Boeing had been hoping to have the planes back in the air by the end of this year. But US regulators made it clear that they would not be certified to return to the skies that quickly. Boeing is one of the largest US exporters. The company said in a statement that it would not lay off workers associated with the 737 Max, but the stoppage is likely to affect suppliers and the wider economy. What went wrong in Boeing's cockpit? US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks 'I lost all my children in the Boeing plane crash' ""Safely returning the 737 Max to service is our top priority,"" the aircraft manufacturer said. ""We know that the process of approving the 737 Max's return to service, and of determining appropriate training requirements, must be extraordinarily thorough and robust, to ensure that our regulators, customers, and the flying public have confidence in the 737 Max updates."" Last week a congressional hearing was told that US aviation regulators were aware, following the first crash in Indonesia in October 2018, that there was a risk of further accidents. The Federal Aviation Authority's analysis suggested there could be more than a dozen more crashes over the lifetime of the aircraft unless changes were made to its design. This video can not be played Boeing 737 crashes: What went wrong? Despite that, the 737 Max was not grounded until after the second crash in Ethiopia in March 2019. Boeing is redesigning the automated control system thought to have been the primary cause of the crashes. The manufacturer said it had 400 of the 737 Max aircraft in storage and would focus on delivering those to customers. While many airlines around the world have the planes on order, delivery was halted to allow Boeing's engineers to develop software fixes. The situation surrounding the 737 Max is extraordinary. Nine months after the aircraft was grounded worldwide, it is still not clear when it will be certified to fly again. Regulators - criticised for allowing a flawed aircraft to fly in the first place - are now playing hardball. For Boeing, being forced to shut down the production line is deeply embarrassing - and likely to prove costly. But it is a huge business, and it can at least redeploy many of its workers. But if the stoppage goes on for long, suppliers could be badly hit. Boeing sits at the top of a global supply chain, ranging from major businesses to small operators. Here in the UK, for example, the company works across 65 sites, including a factory in Sheffield. But it draws on a network of some 300 suppliers. For smaller firms in particular, losing 737-related work could prove serious - hitting revenues and potentially forcing them to lay off workers as well. Travel industry analyst Henry Harteveldt said the decision to suspend production was unprecedented and likely to have a ""massive impact on Boeing, its suppliers and the airlines"". ""It's really going to create some chaos for the airlines that are involved in this as well as the 600 or so companies that are part of the 737 Max supply chain and Boeing itself."" The suspension of the 737 Max has already cost Boeing around $9bn (Â£6.75bn). Boeing shares fell more than 4% on Monday amid speculation production would be suspended. All Boeing 737 Max planes are currently grounded The production freeze is expected to be felt across the plane's global supply chain. Teal Group aviation analyst Richard Aboulafia described Boeing's options for managing the blow to its suppliers as ""bad and worse"". He said the plane maker could either allow them to take a hit, or pay them to wait for when the 737 Max is finally cleared to fly. US carriers operate the largest 737 Max fleets, though airlines around the world also use it. ""The Chinese carriers would [also] be quite badly affected. They're some of the biggest users of the Max,"" said Shukor Yusof, aviation analyst at Endau Analytics. In fact, China's three largest carrierswere among the first to press Boeing for compensationover the grounded planes. Aviation analyst Chris Tarrytold the Today programme:""The last thing any manufacturer wants is to stop the production line and it's going to take time to get it going again when the aircraft takes to the skies. ""If we look at it in terms of the volume of the impact on capacity growth in the industry, it is significant and it will take time to recover the production. Boeing's reputation will take time to recover from this as well."" US regulator knew of Boeing 737 crash risks Can China's plane maker take on Boeing? Some suppliers, such as fuselage maker Spirit AeroSystems, are highly dependent on the jet, with half of its revenue attached to it, according to Mr Aboulafia. So far, the supplier has only said it is ""working closely"" with Boeing to determine what impact the production suspension may have. The move by Boeing is unlikely to affect passengers as airlines have leased additional aircraft to replace the 737 Max. It's a different story for airlines, who have the added expense of leasing planes and managing their grounded aircraft. In July,Boeing set aside nearly $5bnto compensate those affected. However, that figure assumed that the 737 Max would fly again this year.

'Now is the moment' to restore devolution,"Northern Ireland has had no devolved government since January 2017 Now is the moment to restore devolution in Northern Ireland, Julian Smith has said. The Northern Ireland secretary was speaking after talks aimed at restoring the assembly began on Monday. The Northern Ireland Assembly has been inactive since January 2017,when its two biggest parties, the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in, split in a bitter row. Mr Smith said the biggest issue in the negotiations should be dealing with the current crisis in the health sector. He met the leaders of Northern Ireland's five biggest parties. Meanwhile, the Chief Constable of the Police Service of Northern Ireland, Simon Byrne, wrote to the leaders on Monday calling on them to agree on how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles and requesting support to hire more officers. Varadkar and Johnson pledge to restore Stormont Consequences of not restoring Stormont 'profound' Naomi Long met Julian Smith at Stormont House The British and Irish governments will work ""night and day"" over the next few weeks to restore devolution, said the TÃ¡naiste (Irish Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Coveney. The Irish deputy PM was speaking after a meeting with the NI Secretary Julian Smith at Stormont. Mr Coveney said there would be ""intensive"" discussions between the parties over the course of this week. He will hold his own meetings with the five parties on Monday night and Tuesday, ahead of a roundtable scheduled for Wednesday. He said the two governments did not ""want to bounce"" the parties into an agreement - but said they had been discussing the same issues for many months now. ""This is not about trying to force the parties into a space they don't want to move into,"" he added. ""But we've had a reality check with the nurses' strike, and I think it's a reminder to everyone that now is the time to get this done."" Round-table talks are set to happen later in the week which will involve the parties, Mr Smith and Mr Coveney. Several rounds of talks to restore the executive have ended in failure, with the two parties unable to resolve differences over issues such as the Irish language or how to deal with the legacy of the Troubles. In the general election last Thursday both the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in saw their share of the vote fall. Mr Smith said the results had given the five parties ""serious issues"" to reflect on - but maintained he is obliged to call a fresh assembly election if a deal is not reached by 13 January. The Sinn FÃ©in team speak to the media after fresh talks at Stormont on Monday Speaking after meeting Mr Smith, Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said their discussion was ""constructive and positive"" but she added her party would not go back into an assembly that was ""a stop-start mess"". Mrs Long also said there was a draft document regarding a deal but that it is not complete. She said discussions between the parties over the next week would seek to build on it. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the general election result showed people were ""sick of the Stormont standoff"". After meeting Mr Smith, he said the British and Irish governments should, in the next couple of days, publish a document detailing what has been agreed so far. ""They should force the parties to say yes or no,"" he added. Ulster Unionist leader Steve Aiken said he did not believe a deal was likely before Christmas. He called for reforms to be made, and said the ""core issues which undermined devolution previously"" must be addressed. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Arlene Foster said she hoped there would be an assembly up and running at the beginning of the year. She added that all politicians had to take responsibility for the lack of devolution. Arlene Foster was first minister before the assembly collapsed Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald said the Stormont talks process was at a ""crucial and pivotal moment"". She said the talks needed to be about resolution and delivery, but that Sinn FÃ©in had also asked for a ""big cash injection"" for public services. She did not say how much exactly the party had asked for, or what the government's response was. She also said her party would not be drawn into publicly discussing negotiating red lines - but would enter into the talks with goodwill. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI political reporter One by one the parties emerged optimistic from talks, claiming a deal is possible. The general election results have changed the mood, and Julian Smith maintains if power sharing is not restored by 13 January, a fresh assembly election will be called. The DUP and Sinn FÃ©in are unlikely to relish that prospect, and seem to be softening their respective negotiating stances. Alliance and the SDLP say they do not fear another election while the Ulster Unionists wants direct rule, if a deal isn't reached soon. The five parties will hold a roundtable meeting with the British and Irish governments on Wednesday, but so far it seems unlikely that a pre-Christmas compromise is on the cards. During a phone call on Friday evening, Mr Johnson and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar said they would work closely with the Northern Ireland parties to help bring back devolution. What is the Withdrawal Agreement? The prime minister made clear in the phone call his top priority was the restoration of a functioning executive as soon as possible.

Ex-Man Utd player: 'The pitch was like a prison',"Rhodri Jones: ""I do think it's important for young people to develop their character"" The pressure of trying to become a professional footballer can come at a high price, a former player has said. Rhodri Jones, 38, said injury, leaving home and self-imposed pressure began to take a toll after he signed a youth contract with Manchester United at 14. The association which supports players said it has seen arise in requestsfor help for mental health support in 2019. ""Despite the injury I would argue the psychological effect was more serious,"" said Mr Jones, from Cardiff. He moved to Manchester as a trainee, leaving his school, friends and family, which he said was a ""hard time"". ""Who could I tell that I was worried about moving because everyone was saying... 'you're going to play for Manchester United',"" he toldNewyddion 9. ""The pressure came from myself. That voice that says 'don't let anyone down, you have to succeed'."" Arsenal star opens up on mental health Footballers seek help in record numbers When he was 20 and playing for the reserve team, he was called to a meeting with then-manager Sir Alex Ferguson to be told he would be released from his contract. ""When you hear the words from Sir Alex Ferguson, someone you've admired since you were small, saying 'sorry son, we won't be renewing your contract', the fall is much greater,"" he said. Mr Jones joined Manchester United on a youth contract He then moved to Rotherham but became increasingly unhappy and was eventually diagnosed with depression. ""The pitch was like a prison,"" he said. ""I was on the pitch playing for Rotherham reserves just thinking 'I don't want to be here'. You just start building this prison for yourself."" More footballers seek mental health help Rose & Crouch discuss mental health The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) said there had been an increase in the number of people requesting mental health support this year. In 2016, 160 people received counselling sessions, but between January and September 2019 the number seeking help rose to 544, with more than half being former players, it said. Mr Jones moved to Manchester to pursue a professional career when he was 14 Dr Carwyn Jones, professor of sport ethics at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said the industry was ""competitive and no-one wants to show any weakness"". ""There are a lot of factors that go into the problem and also maybe make it difficult for players to ask for help,"" he said. Brian Davies, chief executive of Sport Wales, added: ""We want to do more research. If there was an increase in investment I'm sure we would put much more money aside for things like this."" Despite not playing football any more, Mr Jones thinks young people who aspire to become professionals should think seriously about the career. ""I had committed so much of myself to football that when the fall came it was much harder,"" he said. ""I do think it's important for young people to develop their character.""

Bill to block further delay to Brexit process,"The government is to add a new clause to the Brexit bill to rule out any extension to the transition period beyond the end of next year. The post-Brexit transition period - due to conclude in December 2020 -Â  can currently be extended by mutual agreement for up to two years. But an amended Withdrawal Agreement Bill the Commons is set to vote on this week would rule out any extension. The PM told MPs it would put an end to years of ""deadlock, dither and delay"". As the House of Commons assembled for the first time since the election, Boris Johnson said his priority was to ""get Brexit done"". He also promised to seek ""common ground"" and to approach politics with a ""new and generous spirit"" after the rancour of recent years. Jeremy Corbyn congratulated the Conservative leader on his victory but said he would be ""judged"" on whether he delivered on the ""many, many promises"" he had made during the campaign, including to longstanding Labour voters. Is a no-deal Brexit back on the table? All you need to know about the UK leaving the EU Could the UK and EU sort a trade deal in months? What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 January, more than three and a half years after the public backed Brexit in a referendum. Soon after, the two sides will begin talking about their future economic relationship, including controversial areas such as fishing rights, consumer and environmental standards and financial services. Trade deals typically take many years to conclude and senior EU figures are sceptical that a deal can be agreed within that time. If it is not, the economic relationship will default to World Trade Organization (WTO) terms, with the likelihood of tariffs on imports and exports. The EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the bloc would ""do the maximum"" to finalise the deal in time. Asked about the UK's refusal to contemplate any extra time for the talks, he said ""it is the British choice to choose the procedure it wants"". This is a political signal, a moment of early chest beating too, designed to disappoint those who might have been hoping No 10 might slide to a softer Brexit over the next few months. And designed to gratify those who are adamant that Brexit must be completely ""done"" as soon as possible. Boris Johnson seems to have concluded that if the talks are to go anywhere fast, there has to be a convincing clear deadline. It was his vow of a Halloween deadline that got him to Downing Street in the first place, and although it was broken in the end, there's little question that his attitude towards extending again and again changed the dynamics of the talks with the EU that got the revised deal done. Putting the deadline into law may also be designed to focus minds in Brussels. How effective that might be? That's a different question. Read Laura's full analysis Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the PM's move was ""reckless and irresponsible"" and he argued that Mr Johnson was ""prepared to put people's jobs at risk"". Liberal Democrat interim leader Sir Ed Davey said: ""The only way Johnson can meet the December 2020 timetable is by giving up all his previous promises to Leave voters and agreeing to all the demands of the EU."" Downing Street has said the government plans to ask the new Parliament to have its first debate and vote on the withdrawal agreement - the legislation needed to ratify Brexit - on Friday. With a majority of 80following Thursday's general election, Mr Johnson is expected to get the bill into law with few changes in time for the UK to end its EU membership on 31 January. So, the government is going to pass a law to stop itself doing something that it had already promised not to do. On the surface, that doesn't change much. Because the decision on whether to extend the transition period lies with the prime minister anyway, not with Parliament. And with his new majority, Mr Johnson knows his critics can't do anything to force his hand. But as a statement of intent, this announcement is important. By reaffirming Mr Johnson's guarantee that the transition period will not be extended, it suggests there will only be enough time to agree a pretty basic trade deal which would leave many important issues unresolved. That means a quick 'zero tariffs zero quotas' deal on goods could be done, as long as the UK is prepared to sign up to the EU's main conditions. They include the UK sticking with EU rules on environmental and social policy, and on state aid for companies. Such an agreement wouldn't get rid of all border checks, though, and it wouldn't do anything for the services sector. The PM could of course change his mind again - he's done that before. But this is also a warning for businesses - they could be in for a bit of a bumpy ride at the end of next year. As well as ruling out an extension, theIndependent reports,externalthat the amended withdrawal agreement may omit previous ""provisions to ensure that workers' rights were not weakened after Brexit"". Cabinet minister Michael Gove said workers' rights would be ""safeguarded"" in separate legislation, adding that the government wanted to make sure the Withdrawal Agreement Bill passes through Parliament ""cleanly and clearly"". But shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the government would ""sacrifice our basic rights and certainty for business at the altar of turning the UK into a Trump-supporting tax haven"". This video can not be played Government to bring back Brexit bill to Commons this Friday And Labour's Barry Gardiner said his party would be less likely to support the bill if clauses on workers' rights and the environment were removed. The prime minister promised during the general election campaign that he would not seek an extension to the transition period - persuading Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage to stand down candidates in Tory seats. Sam Lowe, from the Centre for European Reform think tank, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that a December 2020 deadline could help the PM manage his own party when it comes to making concessions to the EU. What does 'Get Brexit done' mean? What the election fall-out means for the BBC Who's in Boris Johnson's cabinet? ""The prospect of a no-deal is still there,"" Mr Lowe said. ""The question is whether Boris Johnson wants a no-deal but the evidence of recent time suggests no he doesn't."" Meanwhile, in the first act of the new Parliament, MPs re-confirmed Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle in his post without any opposition. The MP for Chorley, who was only succeeded John Bercow at the start of November, said it was the ""greatest privilege"" to be asked to take the chair again and he would do his utmost to ""cherish the best traditions"" of the Parliament. Commons officials have begun the process of swearing in the new MPs - which will continue on Wednesday. Tuesday and Wednesday After the election of the Speaker, the process of swearing in MPs begins. They are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days. Friday Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days in order to leave the EU by the then Brexit deadline of 31 October. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated. What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?

The MP for Chorley, who was only succeeded John Bercow at the start of November, said it was the ""greatest privilege"" to be asked to take the chair again and he would do his utmost to ""cherish the best traditions"" of the Parliament. Commons officials have begun the process of swearing in the new MPs - which will continue on Wednesday. Tuesday and Wednesday After the election of the Speaker, the process of swearing in MPs begins. They are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday The state opening of Parliament. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which usually takes days. Friday Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. The government will introduce the Withdrawal Agreement Bill to Parliament. MPs in the previous Parliament backed Mr Johnson's bill at its first stage but rejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three days in order to leave the EU by the then Brexit deadline of 31 October. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated. What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?
