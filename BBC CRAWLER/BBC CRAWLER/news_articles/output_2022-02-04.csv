Jimmy Carr sparks fury with Holocaust routine,"Carr introduced part of his routine as being ""a career ender"" Comedian Jimmy Carr has sparked outrage for a routine about the Holocaust in his latest Netflix stand-up special. Carr has been described as ""truly disturbing"" for making light of the murders of hundreds of thousands of people from Europe's traveller communities during World War Two. The Holocaust Memorial Day Trust said,externalit was ""absolutely appalled"". Netflix, which has been urged to remove the special, declined to comment. Carr has also not commented. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the comments were ""abhorrent and they just shouldn't be on television"". Carr's programme, titled His Dark Material, was released on the streaming platform on Christmas Day but the clip about the Holocaust came to light more widely when it was shared on social media. The comedian, who introduced his show as being ""a career ender"" and warned it contained ""terrible things"", said a ""positive"" of the Holocaust was that thousands of Gypsies were murdered. The comments were greeted with applause and laughter from the audience. Between 200,000 and 500,000 Roma and Sinti people were murdered by the Nazis and their collaborators, according to the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust. The charity's chief executive Olivia Marks-Woldman said: ""We are absolutely appalled at Jimmy Carr's comment about persecution suffered by Roma and Sinti people under Nazi oppression, and horrified that gales of laughter followed his remarks. ""Hundreds of thousands of Roma and Sinti people suffered prejudice, slave labour, sterilisation and mass murder simply because of their identity - these are not experiences for mockery."" The Roma Victims of the Holocaust - BBC Witness History Ms Dorries suggested the government could legislate to stop comedy people find offensive being shown on streaming platforms. ""We're already looking at future legislation to bring into scope those sort of comments,"" she told the BBC. Asked about a previous Tweet where she said ""left-wing snowflakes are killing comedy"", Ms Dorries replied: ""Well, that's not comedy."" Anti-racism campaign groupHope Not Hate said,externalCarr ""celebrates"" the suffering of the Roma and Sinti people, and called on Netflix to ""take action"". The Traveller Movement - a charity supporting the traveller community in the UK - also asked Netflix to remove the one-hour special.It said,externalthe segment in question was ""truly disturbing and goes way beyond humour"". It added,external: ""Joking about the genocide of an ethnic minority is not funny."" Fellow comedian David Baddiel tweeted that Holocaust jokes can be ""cruel and inhumane and mean-spirited and racist"" or they can target oppressors and draw attention to its fundamental evil - saying: ""Clearly, Jimmy Carr's was the former."" The Auschwitz Memorial called for Carr to learn about the Roma and Sinti people deported to the concentration camp, adding on Twitter: ""It's sad to hear words that can fuel prejudice, hurt people & defile memory of their tragedy."" SNP MP Martin Docherty-Hughes, who is co-chairman of the House of Commons All Party Parliamentary Group for Gypsies, Travellers and Roma,wrote on Twitter,externalthat he was ""utterly speechless at this disregard for the horror of the holocaust"" and its impact on the Gypsy community of Europe. He added: ""A community butchered by the Nazi regime. @NetflixUK care to comment?""

Water bills to rise almost 7% for some in Wales,"Some customers have been warned to expect water bills to rise by almost 7% Householders are facing steep rises in their water bills in 2022 and 2023, Welsh Water has warned. The not for profit company said some customers should expect to pay almost 7% more from April. It blamed the ""significant"" inflation rate rise, highlighting costs of power, chemicals and materials to make drinking water and treat wastewater. It said ""most household customers"" would see an increase between 3.8% and 6.6% from April. Welsh Water's chief financial officer, Mike Davis, said: ""We would encourage all customers who are struggling to make ends meet at this difficult time to contact us."" Rishi Sunak defends response as energy bills soar Why are gas bills so high and what's the energy price cap? Energy bills set to soar but millions may get Â£200 help Wales chairman of the Consumer Council for Water, Rhodri Williams, said some customers could save hundreds of pounds by switching to a water meter. ""Households are facing a wave of rising living costs so it's vital that customers ask for help now."" However, the firm said the average rise would be 0.1% and support was available to customers in difficulty. The company said the reason that average figure was so low was because 130,000 people were on social tariffs which reduced the amount they paid. It said it already helped 130,000 people pay their bill and had earmarked Â£12.4m to help another 54,000.

Longer waiting times put cancer patients at risk,"Cancer waiting time targets are often missed There is ""no doubt"" longer waiting lists put cancer patients at risk, the head of services in Wales has said. More patients with advanced cancer are coming to the NHS as emergency cases according to Prof Tom Crosby. He said they are waiting longer than ever and waiting time targets were often missed. Now Prof Crosby wants more staff and separate diagnostic and treatment hubs to deal with the backlog. The Welsh government said it was ""investing heavily"" in cancer services. Prof Crosby said there were about 4,500 fewer diagnoses than expected at the start of the Covid pandemic. In the past six months he said this had changed, and was seeing more patients than ever. He said he feared there was more demand on the system than it could cope with. Record NHS waiting times for 19 straight months 'My children know their dad isn't coming home' Cancer consultant fears for patients in Wales In November, 1,762 newly diagnosed cancer patients began their first treatment. This is the highest number since comparable data was first collected in June 2019. Just 57.9% began treatment within 62 days, the second lowest percentage since 2019. The target is 75%. Cathy Snape has been diagnosed with incurable cancer ""I felt terribly alone. I went for an MRI on my own and was frightened to death."" For most of her cancer appointments, Cathy Snape, from Anglesey, was by herself because of Covid restrictions. ""The staff were lovely, but no-one understands you better than the people that love you,"" she said. When she was handed medication at her first chemotherapy appointment she said she could not take in the information. ""I was staring at this one fellow who looked really, really poorly and I came out and I just cried,"" Ms Snape said. In January last year the 56-year-old noticed she often felt tired and short of breath. Then she found a large, hard lump in her armpit. She saw her GP the same day and was referred for a biopsy. This was followed by ultrasound, MRI and CT scans. They showed she had stage four secondary breast cancer and numerous lesions on her liver. Although Ms Snape's cancer can be treated, at this stage it cannot be cured ""It was a shock,"" she said. ""You think all cancers are treatable. Mine is treatable - but I'm incurable, so I will have to keep taking the medication until it doesn't work."" Within two months of her diagnosis, she and partner Sean got married. ""I was starting my chemo and I didn't want to be bald when I got married,"" she said. ""I didn't know how long I was going to live, or if I was going to be really, really sick. ""I didn't want it to interfere at all in the day. So it didn't. I didn't think about my hair thinning or anything like that - it was just a wonderful day."" A year on from her diagnosis Ms Snape is still processing it all. ""I try not to think about the future too much,"" she said. ""I get upset about things that I might not experience, especially with my daughter, who is only 18. ""We had so much we were going to do. ""I just feel robbed."" On Friday the Welsh government announced Â£11m for a breast cancer unit in Ystrad Mynach, Caerphilly. Staff from Aneurin Bevan University Health Board's Nevill Hall and Royal Gwent hospitals will be brought together at Ysbyty Ystrad Fawr. ""Demand for services was rising at about 10% a year before the pandemic,"" Prof Crosby said. ""Now because of reduced capacity and infection control measures, patients are inevitably waiting longer."" While 66.6% of patients in Betsi Cadwalladr University Health Board started treatment in 62 days, in Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, the figure was as low as 45.3%. ""There is significant and unacceptable variation between different cancer sites,"" said Prof Crosby. Treatment times can differ depending on the kind of cancer as well. Prof Crosby believes a national workforce plan is now needed. Prof Tom Crosby fears it could take years until there is a sufficient cancer care workforce in Wales He said: ""Some of the workforce just don't exist at the moment."" It could take years to develop a fit-for-purpose cancer service workforce in Wales, Prof Crosby feared. ""Funding needs to be made on a recurrent basis and linked to a redesign of the system,"" he said. Wales Macmillan chief, Richard Pugh, called for an 80% increase in Wales' cancer nurses by the end of the decade. This could cost Â£12m. He said: ""If we don't resolve this issue, we're going to see the continuation of this over a prolonged period of time. ""We'll see worse outcomes for patients, poor patient experience and also the impact on their loved ones."" The Welsh government said it had published plans to help NHS services recover after Covid that would be backed by almost Â£250million. These plans would include funding for cancer care. A spokesman said: ""We will continue to focus on cancer services and providing the resources necessary to give people the cancer care that they deserve, including significant increases in the number of training places for doctors who specialise in cancer and diagnostic care, while continuing to grow the nursing workforce.""

Trump was wrong to seek to stop Biden win - Pence,"This video can not be played Mike Pence says he had ""no right to change the outcome"" of the presidential election Former US Vice-President Mike Pence has dismissed claims by Donald Trump that he could have stopped Joe Biden becoming president last year. In his strongest rebuttal yet, he said Mr Trump was wrong to suggest he had had the right to overturn the election. Separately the Republican Party censured two of its top lawmakers for investigating the Capitol riots. A mob stormed the Capitol as lawmakers met to confirm President Joe Biden's poll win on 6 January last year. Four people died during the riots. The two legislators, Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, are the only Republicans on a congressional select committee investigating the riots. The statement by the Republican National Committee (RNC) accused the pair of helping to persecute ""ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse"". The RNC appeared to suggest rioters had been involved in legitimate political actions but RNC Chair Ronna McDaniel clarified that it was a reference to ""legitimate political discourse that had nothing to do with violence at the Capitol"". Capitol riot inquiry asks Ivanka Trump to testify US Capitol riot committee targets Rudy Giuliani Five big questions about Trump and the riot The vote was passed by an overwhelming majority of the 168 RNC members at their winter meeting in Salt Lake City, Utah, reports say. The committee said it would ""immediately cease any and all support of them"" as party members without removing them from the party. Both lawmakers issued statements in advance of the vote. ""The leaders of the Republican Party have made themselves willing hostages to a man who admits he tried to overturn a presidential election and suggests he would pardon 6 January defendants, some of whom have been charged with seditious conspiracy,"" Ms Cheney said. They also received support from other opponents of Mr Trump in the party.Senator Mitt Romney tweeted,external: ""Shame falls on a party that would censure persons of conscience, who seek truth in the face of vitriol."" Speaking in Orlando, Florida, Mr Pence was responding to Mr Trump's comments on Sunday that he could have overturned the election if he had wanted to. Mr Trump has falsely claimed that the election was stolen by Mr Biden. Days later Mr Trump said the select committee should be investigating Mr Pence instead of the rioters. ""President Trump is wrong. I had no right to overturn the election. The presidency belongs to the American people, and the American people alone,"" Mr Pence said. ""And [current Vice-President] Kamala Harris will have no right to overturn the election when we beat them in 2024."" Last May, House Republicans voted to remove Congresswoman Liz Cheney from her leadership position because, they said, her criticism of Donald Trump prevented the party from focusing on upcoming elections. On Friday, however, the Republican National Committee passed a resolution that will put Mr Trump, the 6 January Capitol riots and shifting Republican attitudes toward both into national headlines again. The committee also did so in a way that will generate storms of criticism, by censuring Ms Cheney and Congressman Adam Kinzinger for, in part, helping Democratic ""persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse"". Republicans say the line - added in a last-minute revision - was meant to reference individuals who protested the election results and not those who attacked the Capitol, but its inartful wording will ensure it is construed to include both. The resolution is just the latest example of the grip Mr Trump holds on the Republican Party apparatus, even if polls indicate that the loyalty of some conservatives may be slipping. The practical purpose behind the committee's move is that it frees the party to shift financial support from Ms Cheney to her Republican primary opponent. The political fireworks were a collateral - if not unintended - effect.

Harmful messaging offences added to online safety bill,"Sending ""genuinely threatening"" or ""knowingly false"" messages are among new criminal offences being added to proposed online safety laws. If passed, the government's online safety bill could see social networks fined 10% of their global turnover if they fail to remove harmful content. The changes mean they will also have to proactively remove harmful content. The bill also covers revenge porn, human trafficking, extremism and promoting suicide online. It already stated that websites, such as Facebook and Twitter, that host user-generated content would have to swiftly remove illegal content once it was reported to them. Now they will also have to put in place proactive measures to stop illegal activity. The issue has become a talking point recently with theracist abuse of footballers, revenge porn andcyberflashing, andCovid disinformationbeing highlighted as key safety concerns for social media companies to address. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries urged online platforms to start making the changes now before the bill comes into force. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, she said: ""They can start doing what they need to do to remove those harmful algorithms and to remove much of the damage that they do, particularly to young people and to society as a whole."" The minister added the move would ""hold the feet to the fire"" of social media companies that have ""damaged lives"" and hold them to account for the first time. Harmful content could evade new online law - MPs Facebook is 'making hate worse', whistleblower says Twitter says Online Safety Bill needs more clarity I get abuse and threats online - why can't it be stopped? Judy Thomas, whose daughter Frankie took her own life aged 15 in September 2018, said her school tablet and computer had been used to access distressing material in the hours and months before her death. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Back in January, February, March [2018] she'd been accessing, at school, horrendous sites."" Ms Thomas called for mandatory age verification to protect children online and said all websites should be included in the scope of the bill, rather than just larger platforms. ""We need to ensure young people simply cannot access online harms, and that if companies do the wrong thing... that there is a real price to pay,"" she said. Ms Thomas added these penalties must not just be financial, as many businesses could ""absorb that easily"", but the heads of these firms must also be ""held to account"". The big technology companies say they welcome the ""clarity"" that the online safety bill brings and that they recognise the need for regulation. They have, in many cases, not waited for governments to step in and they have invested in tech such as machine learning in order to identify harmful content at scale. However, while many say the bill does not go far enough, social media businesses point to free speech issues. They say they want to ensure that new rules don't stifle people's access to information by causing companies to ""over-moderate"" by removing too much content, in order to comply with them. The vast scope of the online safety bill means it will always have its critics. But experts underline that its introduction will be nothing short of a revolution in how the online world is policed, and mean it will be a very different place for the next generation. Asked about age verification, Ms Dorries said the government was looking at the idea, but said there was a ""downside"" to requiring all children to verify their age to access the internet. ""And young people go on to the internet to go shopping, you know, on clothes. Do we need to ensure that they verify their age when they're doing that?"", she added. This video can not be played Fitness influencer Elle Edwards speaks about dealing with explicit messages and cyber-flashing The government confirmed offences to have been added to the list of priority offences, which must be removed by platforms under the changes, include: Revenge porn Hate crimes Fraud The sale of illegal drugs or weapons The promotion or facilitation of suicide People smuggling Sexual exploitation Previously, companies were only forced to take down these posts after they were reported - but will now be required to be proactive in preventing people from seeing them in the first place. The government said naming these offences also enabled Ofcom - the proposed regulator - to take faster action. The changes come after three separate parliamentary committee reports warned the bill required strengthening and more clarity for tech firms. In addition, three new criminal offences have been added to the bill. The first is sending ""genuinely threatening communications"" such as a threat to rape, kill or cause financial harm, or coercive and controlling behaviour and online stalking. Sending ""harmful communications"", such as a domestic abuser sending an ex-partner a photograph of their front door to frighten them, is the second. However, offensive content with no intent to cause serious distress would not be illegal. The final new offence is ""knowingly false communications"", which would cover messages deliberately sent to inflict harm"", such as a hoax bomb threat. The government said the bill would not prohibit ""misinformation"", such as a social media post promoting a fake coronavirus cure, as long as those spreading it were unaware what they were saying was false.

TfL has said that cutting all ""uncommitted"" Healthy Streets funding, such as for cycling schemes, would save about Â£500m A spokesperson added: ""There is no UK recovery from the pandemic without a London recovery and there is no London recovery without a properly funded transport network in the capital. ""It is essential London receives the sustained long-term government funding that is vital for the coming years if a period of 'managed decline' of London's transport network is to be avoided.

The NI Protocol and its economic impactWhat is the truth around the figures quoted about the NI Protocol - are there costs or opportunities?Northern Ireland,"Under the protocol, checks are required on goods coming into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK The Northern Ireland Protocol keeps Northern Ireland (NI) inside the European Union's (EU) single market for goods. That means products coming from Great Britain (GB), which is NI's main source of imports, face additional costs in terms of new processes and paperwork. This extra cost will eventually have to show up as increased consumer prices or lower business profits. The economic flipside is that Northern Ireland businesses now have an advantage over GB exporters because they still have full access to both the EU single market and the rest of the UK. This dual market access potentially makes Northern Ireland a more attractive location for manufacturing investment. So the questions economists are trying to answer are: How big are the costs of the GB-to-NI trade barriers? To what extent is that offset by trade and investment opportunities? The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) is mainly relying onestimates produced by Northern Ireland economist Esmond Birnie,external. His analysis is based on a limited dataset - the experience of four companies, including an extrapolation of figures in Marks and Spencer's financial accounts. He uses that to estimate that NI businesses have faced an increase of around 6% in the cost of bringing goods into Northern Ireland from GB. The total flow of goods and materials coming into Northern Ireland from GB is about Â£10bn a year so the rise in costs is equivalent to a bill of about Â£600m annually. In order to get to an annual cost of Â£850m he adds the estimated Â£250m a year which the UK government is spending to assist businesses with the impact of the Protocol. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Irish Sea border checks ordered to end at midnight Timeline: The row over the Irish Sea border He treats this as an opportunity cost - in other words this money is not being spent on something more productive like education. However, it is debatable whether that entire opportunity cost should be applied to Northern Ireland. Given that the money is being spent by central government, not Stormont, it is arguable that a population share of 3% should be applied to Northern Ireland which is Â£7.5m. Dr Birnie's analysis does not attempt to calculate any offsetting impact from more trade with the EU and he has been very sceptical of official data which suggests there has been a big increase in cross-border trade with the Republic of Ireland. We also don't have good data on what has happened to Northern Ireland sales to Great Britain. SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole has critiqued the analysis on the basis that it is implicitly modelled against a ""no-Brexit scenario"". He says: ""That is self evidently flawed; the alternative to the protocol is not trade as it was before Brexit, because it can't be."" Sinn FÃ©in's economy spokesperson Caoimhe Archibald has also said the question of what the protocol is being compared to is important. 'Any serious assessment of the protocol would also compare it against the alternative [in technical terms the counterfactual]. Britain's Brexit also carries costs, not least barriers to trade with the EU, but Mr Birnie ignores these,' she said. The second, more substantial, piece of work is a forecast from the Fraser of Allander Institute, an economics research institute based at the University of Strathclyde. It uses an economic model to estimate the medium term impact of the protocol on the Northern Ireland economy, so it is not making claims about the current daily or annual costs of the Protocol. It is explicitly comparing the impact of the protocol to a scenario in which the UK had stayed in the EU. The model does not consider the impacts of migration, foreign direct investment or economic spill-over effects from Great Britain. It does include the impact of new barriers to services trade between Northern Ireland and the EU, something not covered by the Protocol. It finds that in the medium term the protocol would leave Northern Ireland's economy 2.6% smaller compared to a scenario in which the UK had stayed in the EU. In cash terms that would be about Â£900m - Â£1bn of foregone output. It finds that these impacts can potentially be halved by firms in Northern Ireland sourcing a lot more goods from the EU rather than GB. Alternatively, in a scenario in which checks and controls from GB to Northern Ireland can be reduced, the economic hit would fall to 1.5% - this is what the current negotiations between the EU and UK are trying to achieve. The UK budget watchdog, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), estimates that in the long run the UK's economic output will be 4% lower compared to a scenario where it stayed in the EU. Its forecasts assume that total UK imports and exports will eventually both be 15% lower than if the UK stayed in the EU. This reduction in trade intensity drives the 4% reduction in long-run potential productivity it assumes will eventually result from the departure from the EU.

TfL's emergency funding deal extended againUnions have warned London's public transport will grind to a halt without a long-term financial plan.London,"TfL said it had reduced annual running costs by more than Â£1bn in the past five years Transport for London's (TfL) emergency funding deal with the government has been extended by a fortnight. The current financial deal was due to run out on 4 February, but negotiations have been given a short grace period. TfL is facing a Â£1.9bn budget black hole and has warned of massive cuts to bus, Tube and road services. There have been repeatedrows over funding for TfL and the cause of its financial crisis. TfL said discussions were continuing with the government as it aimed to secure ""long-term funding"". TfL has said that cutting all ""uncommitted"" Healthy Streets funding, such as for cycling schemes, would save about Â£500m A spokesperson added: ""There is no UK recovery from the pandemic without a London recovery and there is no London recovery without a properly funded transport network in the capital. ""It is essential London receives the sustained long-term government funding that is vital for the coming years if a period of 'managed decline' of London's transport network is to be avoided. ""We have agreed with the government that our existing funding agreement will be extended until 18 February so that these discussions can be concluded.""

China joins Russia in opposing Nato expansion,"The meeting between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping was the first face-to-face talks they have had since June 2019 China has joined Russia in opposing further Nato expansion as the two countries move closer together in the face of Western pressure. Moscow and Beijing issued a statement showcasing their agreement on a raft of issues during a visit by Russia's Vladimir Putin for the Winter Olympics. Mr Putin claims Western powers are using the Nato defence alliance to undermine Russia. It comes amid tensions over Ukraine, which he denies planning to invade. Some 100,000 Russian troops remain at the border with Ukraine, which is a former Soviet republic. Mr Putin, who has written that Russians and Ukrainians are ""one nation"", has demanded that Ukraine be barred from joining Nato. While the lengthy joint statement did not refer directly to Ukraine, the two countries accused Nato of espousing a Cold War ideology. What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? The talks, which the Kremlin said were ""very warm"", were held ahead of the Games opening ceremony. It was the first time the leaders have met face-to-face since the start of the pandemic. ""Friendship between [Russia and China] has no limits, there are no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation,""the statement reads,external. The two countries said they were ""seriously concerned"" about the Aukus security pact between the US, UK and Australia. Announced last year,Aukus will see Australia build nuclear-powered submarinesas part of efforts to boost security in the Asia-Pacific region. It is largely seen as an effort to counter China, which has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea. Meanwhile Russia said it supported Beijing's One China policy, which asserts that self-ruled Taiwan is a breakaway province that will eventually be part of China again. However, Taiwan sees itself as an independent country, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. They had lunch, they had talks then they went off to see a show together - a big show. Vladimir Putin is the star guest in Beijing for the start of the winter games. Of more significance to this visit is the increased co-operation and shared view of the world that Presidents Xi and Putin are keen to show. Although Ukraine wasn't mentioned it was clearly hinted at when they both said they oppose the enlargement of the Nato alliance. For China this is a delicate balance. Beijing has relations with Ukraine - political and economic. Any Russia invasion or military attack there could be damaging for President Xi's standing. Amid a growing war of words, the US on Wednesday accused Russia of planning to stage a fake Ukrainian attack that it would use to justify an invasion. Russia denied it was planning to fabricate an attack, and the US did not provide evidence to support the claim. Putin's Olympic trip signals warmer China ties What does China want from the Ukraine crisis? China and Taiwan: A really simple guide Earlier the US said it was sending more troops to eastern Europe to support Nato allies.

Meta moves to tackle creepy behaviour in VR,"Trips to virtual worlds are not always pleasant for women trying them out for the first time Meta has announced a new feature to allow more personal space for people's avatars in virtual-reality worlds. The metaverse is still at concept stage but the latest attempts to create virtual worlds are already facing an age-old problem: harassment. Bloomberg's technology columnist Parmy Olson told the BBC's Tech Tent programme about her own ""creepy"" experiences. And one woman likened her own traumatic experience in VR to sexual abuse. Meta has now announced a new feature, Personal Boundary, which begins rolling out on 4 February. It prevents avatars from coming within a set distance of each other, creating more personal space for people and making it easier to avoid these unwanted interactions. It stops others ""invading your avatar's personal space"", said Meta. ""If someone tries to enter your Personal Boundary, the system will halt their forward movement as they reach the boundary."" It is being made available in Meta's Horizon Worlds and Horizon Venues software. The firm said it was a ""powerful example of how VR has the potential to help people interact comfortably,"" but acknowledged there was more work to be done. Listen to the latest Tech Tentpodcast, with more on Meta and the metaverse For some, the news will be welcome. ""I did have some moments when it was awkward for me as a woman,"" Ms Olson said of her interactions in virtual reality (VR). She was visiting Meta's Horizon Worlds, its virtual-reality platform where anyone 18 or older can create an avatar and hang out. To do so, users need one of Meta's VR headsets, and the space offers the chance to play games and chat to other avatars, none of whom has legs. ""I could see straight away I was the only woman, the only female avatar. And I had these men kind of come around me and stare at me silently,"" Ms Olson told Tech Tent. ""Then they started taking pictures of me and giving the pictures to me and I had a moment when a guy zoomed up to me and said something. ""And in virtual reality, if someone is close to you, then the voice sounds like someone is literally talking into your ear. And it took me aback."" She experienced similar discomfort in Microsoft's social VR platform. ""I was talking to another lady and within minutes of us chatting a guy came up and started chatting to us and following us around saying inappropriate things and we had to block him,"" she said. ""I have since heard of other women who have had similar experiences."" She said while she wouldn't describe it as harassment, it was ""creepy and awkward"". Nina Jane Patel went a lot further this week when she told theDaily Mail,externalthat she was abused in Horizon Venues, likening it to sexual assault. She described how a group of male avatars ""groped her"" and subjected her to a stream of sexual innuendo. They photographed her and sent a message reading: ""Don't pretend you didn't love it."" Meta responded to the paper saying that it was sorry. ""We want everyone to have a positive experience and easily find the safety tools that can help in a situation like this - and help us investigate and take action."" Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, says there may have to be a trade-off between privacy and safety in virtual spaces Moderating content in the nascent metaverse is going to be challenging, and Meta's chief technology officer, Andrew Bosworth, admitted that it would offer both ""greater opportunities and greater threats"". ""It could feel a lot more real to me, if you were being abusive towards me because it feels a lot more like physical space,"" he said in an interview with the BBC late last year. But he said people in virtual roles would have ""a great deal more power"" over their environments. ""If I were to mute you, you would cease to exist for me and your ability to do harm to me is immediately nullified."" This video can not be played Watch: The BBC's technology correspondent Marc Cieslak enters the metaverse And he questioned whether people would want the kind of moderation that exists on platforms such as Facebook when having chats in virtual reality. ""Do you really want the system or a person standing by listening in? Probably not"" ""So I think we have a privacy trade-off - if you want to have a high degree of content, safety or what we would call integrity, well that trades off against privacy."" And in Meta's vision of the metaverse, where different rooms are run by different companies, the trade-off gets even more complex as people move out of the Meta-controlled virtual world into others. ""I can give no guarantees about either the privacy, nor the integrity of that conversation,"" he said. The rules in the Metaverse will be very different from those governing current online spaces Ms Olson agreed that it was going to be ""a very difficult thing for Facebook, Microsoft and others to take care of"". ""When you are scanning text for hate speech, it's hard but doable - you can use machine-learning algorithms. ""To process visual information about an avatar or how close one is to another, that is going to be so expensive computationally, that is going to take up so much computer power, I don't know what technology can do that."" Facebook is investing $10bn in its metaverse plans and part of that will need to go on building new ways of moderating content. ""We have learned a tremendous amount in the last 15 years of online discourse... so we're going to bring all that knowledge with us to do the best that we can to build these things from the ground up, to give people a lot of control over their own experience,"" Mr Bosworth told the BBC. Meta's legless avatars can have all sorts of experiences - private or communal - in the metaverse Dr Beth Singler, an anthropologist at Cambridge University, who has studied the ethics of virtual worlds, said: ""Facebook has already failed to learn about what is happening in online spaces. Yes, they have changed some of their policies but there is still material out there that shouldn't be."" There is more to learn from gaming, she thinks, where the likes of Second Life and World of Warcraft have offered virtual worlds for years, limiting who avatars can talk to and the names they can choose for them. Meta's decision to use legless avatars may also be deliberate, she thinks - most likely a technical one about the lack of sensors for legs, but it could also be a way to limit ""below the belt""  issues that might arise from having a fully physical presence. But having strict rules around what avatars can look like may bring its own problems for those ""trying to express a certain identity,"" she added.

Huge leap in children in mental health crisis,"This video can not be played Five tips to boost your child's wellbeing There has been a 77% rise in the number of children needing specialist treatment for severe mental health crisis, analysis for the BBC shows. Some 409,347 under-18s were referred to the NHS in England for specialist care for issues such as suicidal thoughts and self harm between April and October 2021. Head teachers also report a huge rise in less severe mental health issues. The government plans 400 mental health teams to support schools by 2023. The NHS Digital referrals data analysed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists for the BBC, includes the most serious and urgent cases where the child faces an immediate risk from an eating disorder, self-harm or suicidal thoughts. In the same six month period in 2019, there were 230,591 referrals for under-18s. There were 349,449 under-18s in touch with NHS child and adolescent psychiatric teams at the end of October 2021, the highest number on record. Only those with the most serious mental health problems are referred for specialist care. But schools are reporting a surge in mental health problems below this high threshold, with pupils needing extra support such as counselling. Almost 1,000 teaching and support staff who responded to a survey from the children's mental health charity, Place2Be, and the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), described seeing an increase in emotional and mental health issues among pupils since the pandemic, including anxiety. ""Covid is trash,"" says Isaac, 7, as he shows me his drawing of flies buzzing around a bin on fire. It illustrates his feelings about coronavirus. He's drawn himself ""feeling sad because I feel like I'm trapped in the telly"", while his grandma tries ""to scare Covid away"". Pupils at Seascape Primary School have been taking part in mental health workshops Isaac's drawing is a task as part of a mental health workshop he's in with other Year 3 and Year 4 pupils at Seascape Primary School in Peterlee, County Durham. Grace, 8, remembers her parents telling her about the pandemic beginning. She's drawn herself ""curled in the corner"" of a prison cell, ""because I felt trapped in lockdown"". 'We've lost faith in child mental health care' Child mental health not improved since lockdown 'I was begging for help after my child overdosed' In a normal year the team of counsellors that work at the school would see about 100 children but in just the autumn term almost as many asked for help. Many are anxious or struggling to manage with being back in a busy school. As well as providing mental health support, Seascape is bringing back music lessons, football tournaments and school trips as part of its effort to boost children's wellbeing. But there are different pressures for teenagers - especially those who face exams this summer for GCSEs. Almost half of secondary schools (46%) said pupils' mental and emotional health was the biggest challenge in helping them catch up with learning,in recent government research,external. How will my exams be different this year? How is Covid being managed in UK schools? Among the Year 11 pupils feeling the pressure is Harley who has had extra support from his school, Horizon Community College in Barnsley. Harley's self-esteem plummeted after coming out of lockdown in 2021. ""It was very uncomfortable for the first two or three months. Some of us had put on weight and it felt awkward,"" he tells me. ""The time I lost with my friends didn't help and it took me a long, long road to get back."" Schools say the pressures of the pandemic have made mental health an even greater priority,with longer waits for specialist help. Harley's school has encouraged him to open up about his low self-esteem An extra Â£79m for improving mental health support in England was committed by the government last year. It has also promised 400 mental health support teams by 2023, to work with schools to provide extra counselling. The BBC has learned at least 183 are up and running, with more staff in training. These teams have been welcomed, but the charities in the Children and Young People's Mental Health Coalition warn they will only cover about a third of England's pupils. In the meantime, pupils such as Harley have to rely on the school for support - which he says is helping. ""Talking just gives you time to breathe, and it helps me control what's going on in my head,"" he says. ""It's a weight off my chest.""

Pope Francis appoints new Archbishop of Glasgow,"Pope Francis has appointed a new Archbishop of Glasgow following the death of Archbishop Philip Tartaglia. Bishop William Nolan, the Bishop of Galloway, shares the Pope's focus on concerns for social justice. Archbishop Philip Tartagliadied after testing positive for coronavirus in 2021after nine years as leader of Scotland's largest Catholic community. Bishop Nolan said he looked forward to the ""challenges that lie ahead"" after the ""initial shock"" of the appointment. The 68-year-old bishop is from Lanarkshire, where he was educated before receiving his religious training in Aberdeenshire and Rome. He served in several Scottish parishes before becoming the Bishop of Galloway in 2015 and is president of Justice and Peace Scotland, which advises the church on issues such as social justice, human rights, and climate change. ""I feel overwhelmed by the trust Pope Francis is putting in me by appointing me as Archbishop of Glasgow,"" he said, adding that it would be a ""wrench"" to leave Galloway Diocese. ""As I overcome my initial shock at being appointed archbishop my thoughts now turn to the challenges that lie ahead. I look forward to working with everyone in the archdiocese, laity and clergy, to carry out the mission that we share of proclaiming God's good news and of bringing the joy of the gospel into the lives of the people of today."" The head of Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, where Bishop Nolan serves on the board, welcomed the news. ""We deeply appreciate his presence on SCIAF's board and his commitment to social justice,"" he said. ""SCIAF has benefited greatly from his leadership, most recently his contributions throughout COP26."" Hugh Bradly, who has been administrator of Glasgow Archdiocese  since the death of Archbishop Tartaglia, said he was ""delighted"" with the appointment. ""I offer him a warm welcome to the Archdiocese of Glasgow and a promise of prayers on behalf of all the clergy, religious and laity,"" he said. Archbishop Tartaglia had been self-isolating at home after contracting coronavirus The Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Philip Tartaglia, died suddenly at his home in the city on 13 January last year - the Feast of St Mungo, the Patron Saint of Glasgow. He had been self-isolating after testing positive for Covid shortly after Christmas. Born in Glasgow in 1951, he was ordained a priest in 1975 and had served as leader of Scotland's largest Catholic community since 2012. Scotland's Catholic bishops described Archbishop Tartaglia as a ""gentle, caring and warm-hearted pastor who combined compassion with a piercing intellect"". Among those who paid tribute were First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken, who described the archbishop as ""a true Glaswegian"".

High Court suspends order over sea border checks,"DUP Minister Edwin Poots' directions to halt Irish Sea border checks will be suspended, the High Court has ordered. Mr Justice Colton confirmed inspections on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain must continue pending the outcome of legal challenges. Agriculture Minister Mr Poots hadordered his officials to halt Irish Sea border checks on Wednesday. He had threatened the action as part of the DUP's ongoing opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol was agreed by the UK and EUto ensure free movement of trade across the Irish land border after Brexit. But unionist politicians have been critical of the arrangements, saying they are damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK. The High Court development came on Friday as an unidentified member of Sinn FÃ©in and a second applicant named Edward Rooney. Checks on goods coming from Great Britain will continue Mr Justice Colton said: ""There shouldn't be any doubt or confusion hanging over those civil servants who have to comply with the law. ""I propose to make an order, suspending the order or instruction given by the Minister for Agriculture until further order of this court or completion of these proceedings."" Checks on goods along the Irish Sea border have continued despite Mr Poots' order, Downing Street said on Thursday. The prime minister's spokesman said checks were continuing, and that ""we are reviewing the legal position"". Paul Givan also announced his resignation as first minister of Northern Ireland on Thursday. The move was also part of the DUP's protest against the protocol.

Waitrose and Lidl top greenest supermarket ranking,"Waitrose and Lidl have been named the UK's greenest supermarkets in a ranking of their greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to cut plastic and food waste. The chains topped Which? magazine's first supermarket sustainability table, which examined data from annual reports and provided by the stores themselves. Which? said it hoped firms would make changes where they were falling short. It placed Iceland last, noting the frozen food chain's high energy use, but the firm called the list ""flawed"". Which? said it chose to focus its ranking on plastic use and recycling, and food waste, as shoppers say they are ""biggest issues"" for them, as well as emissions - regarded by experts as posing the greatest environmental threat.

Energy price rise includes Â£68 for failed firms,"The collapse of 28 energy suppliers during the gas price crisis has cost each household about Â£68, the boss of the energy regulator Ofgem has said. Jonathan Brearley told the BBC that about 10% of the energy price cap rise covered the cost of firms going bust. The watchdog now wants to review the price cap every three months, instead of every six months at present. It reckons the change would help bring some stability for consumers and firms in fast-moving market. Asked how much ofthe Â£693 rise in the energy price capannounced on Thursday covered the cost of suppliers going bust, Mr Brearley told the BBC's Today programme: ""About 10% of the rise was focused on the gas crisis. That's Â£68 per household."" He added: ""That money was focused on making sure everyone in the country, even if their supplier went bust, had access to energy at that price cap. That price cap has protected customers over the course of winter."" Some 28 energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since last August leaving more than 4 million customers seeing their energy firm collapse, Asked if customers were paying the price for a failure of regulation, Mr Brearley said Ofgem was working with the sector and the market needed to be more resilient. Ofgem has been widely criticised for failing to control the market and putting consumers at risk. Its move to double the number of energy cap price reviews to four a year from two is part of its proposed plan to get the energy market back under control. The regulator is also consulting on reducing the advance notice it gives to suppliers of the updated price cap level, from two months to one. ""We are confident that these changes will increase the resilience of the price cap in the interests of consumers,"" it said. ""It would significantly reduce volume risk in falling and rising markets"". We now know that, in April, the typical energy bill will rise by about Â£700 a year, or 54%. Irrespective of these new proposals, the next price cap announcement we get from Ofgem will be in six months' time and no sooner. Analysts predict that we should expect another rise in October, of something like Â£400 a year. Ofgem's boss says it is too early to make those estimates, but there is little to suggest it would come down. In summary, this is no short-term financial shock. The cost of living clouds are set in. Perhaps there is one silver lining for householders. If reviews of the price cap do become more frequent, then when wholesale prices start to fall again that should be reflected more quickly in our bills. Meanwhile,the chancellor's measures to help people facing high energy billsannounced on Thursday have come under fire. Bill Bullen, boss of prepayment specialist Utilita, told the BBC's Wake Up To Money programme that the chancellor's measures were ""not targeted enough"". He said that while the support package would ""slow down the impact of these high prices"" low income households will be hit ""really hard"" next October. ""If it was more targeted towards low income households, I think it would be fine. But to give everybody Â£200... if they can't afford these bills this year, what makes you think they're going to be able to afford them next year?"" Labour's shadow climate secretary, Ed Miliband, accused the government of siding with oil and gas companies over families. Hetold BBC Breakfast: ""The Â£200 is like a buy now, pay later scheme. But at the same time we saw Shell yesterday announcing Â£20bn profits. We should have a windfall tax on those profits and done much more for the poorest. ""The chancellor didn't side with ordinary people, he sided with the big gas and oil companies."" Meanwhile E.On's UK boss Michael Lewis said the government must focus on getting the UK off the gas grid and improve energy efficiency to reduce energy bills. ""If we're really going to tackle long-term energy prices, what we really need to do is drive hard on zero carbon, get ourselves off the global gas market and invest massively in energy efficiency,"" he told the BBC.

Waitrose and Lidl top greenest supermarket rankingResearchers examined the chains' greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to cut plastic and food waste.UK,"Waitrose and Lidl have been named the UK's greenest supermarkets in a ranking of their greenhouse gas emissions and efforts to cut plastic and food waste.

"Huge leap in children in mental health crisisAs referrals rise for self-harm and eating disorders rise by 77%, schools see a wave of other less severe issues.Family & Education","This video can not be played Five tips to boost your child's wellbeing There has been a 77% rise in the number of children needing specialist treatment for severe mental health crisis, analysis for the BBC shows. Some 409,347 under-18s were referred to the NHS in England for specialist care for issues such as suicidal thoughts and self harm between April and October 2021. Head teachers also report a huge rise in less severe mental health issues. The government plans 400 mental health teams to support schools by 2023. The NHS Digital referrals data analysed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists for the BBC, includes the most serious and urgent cases where the child faces an immediate risk from an eating disorder, self-harm or suicidal thoughts. In the same six month period in 2019, there were 230,591 referrals for under-18s. There were 349,449 under-18s in touch with NHS child and adolescent psychiatric teams at the end of October 2021, the highest number on record. Only those with the most serious mental health problems are referred for specialist care. But schools are reporting a surge in mental health problems below this high threshold, with pupils needing extra support such as counselling. Almost 1,000 teaching and support staff who responded to a survey from the children's mental health charity, Place2Be, and the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), described seeing an increase in emotional and mental health issues among pupils since the pandemic, including anxiety. ""Covid is trash,"" says Isaac, 7, as he shows me his drawing of flies buzzing around a bin on fire. It illustrates his feelings about coronavirus. He's drawn himself ""feeling sad because I feel like I'm trapped in the telly"", while his grandma tries ""to scare Covid away"". Pupils at Seascape Primary School have been taking part in mental health workshops Isaac's drawing is a task as part of a mental health workshop he's in with other Year 3 and Year 4 pupils at Seascape Primary School in Peterlee, County Durham. Grace, 8, remembers her parents telling her about the pandemic beginning. She's drawn herself ""curled in the corner"" of a prison cell, ""because I felt trapped in lockdown"". 'We've lost faith in child mental health care' Child mental health not improved since lockdown 'I was begging for help after my child overdosed' In a normal year the team of counsellors that work at the school would see about 100 children but in just the autumn term almost as many asked for help. Many are anxious or struggling to manage with being back in a busy school. As well as providing mental health support, Seascape is bringing back music lessons, football tournaments and school trips as part of its effort to boost children's wellbeing. But there are different pressures for teenagers - especially those who face exams this summer for GCSEs. Almost half of secondary schools (46%) said pupils' mental and emotional health was the biggest challenge in helping them catch up with learning,in recent government research,external. How will my exams be different this year? How is Covid being managed in UK schools? Among the Year 11 pupils feeling the pressure is Harley who has had extra support from his school, Horizon Community College in Barnsley. Harley's self-esteem plummeted after coming out of lockdown in 2021. ""It was very uncomfortable for the first two or three months. Some of us had put on weight and it felt awkward,"" he tells me. ""The time I lost with my friends didn't help and it took me a long, long road to get back."" Schools say the pressures of the pandemic have made mental health an even greater priority,with longer waits for specialist help. Harley's school has encouraged him to open up about his low self-esteem An extra Â£79m for improving mental health support in England was committed by the government last year. It has also promised 400 mental health support teams by 2023, to work with schools to provide extra counselling. The BBC has learned at least 183 are up and running, with more staff in training. These teams have been welcomed, but the charities in the Children and Young People's Mental Health Coalition warn they will only cover about a third of England's pupils. In the meantime, pupils such as Harley have to rely on the school for support - which he says is helping. ""Talking just gives you time to breathe, and it helps me control what's going on in my head,"" he says. ""It's a weight off my chest.""

""As I overcome my initial shock at being appointed archbishop my thoughts now turn to the challenges that lie ahead. I look forward to working with everyone in the archdiocese, laity and clergy, to carry out the mission that we share of proclaiming God's good news and of bringing the joy of the gospel into the lives of the people of today."" The head of Scottish Catholic International Aid Fund, where Bishop Nolan serves on the board, welcomed the news. ""We deeply appreciate his presence on SCIAF's board and his commitment to social justice,"" he said. ""SCIAF has benefited greatly from his leadership, most recently his contributions throughout COP26."" Hugh Bradly, who has been administrator of Glasgow Archdiocese  since the death of Archbishop Tartaglia, said he was ""delighted"" with the appointment. ""I offer him a warm welcome to the Archdiocese of Glasgow and a promise of prayers on behalf of all the clergy, religious and laity,"" he said. Archbishop Tartaglia had been self-isolating at home after contracting coronavirus The Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Philip Tartaglia, died suddenly at his home in the city on 13 January last year - the Feast of St Mungo, the Patron Saint of Glasgow. He had been self-isolating after testing positive for Covid shortly after Christmas. Born in Glasgow in 1951, he was ordained a priest in 1975 and had served as leader of Scotland's largest Catholic community since 2012. Scotland's Catholic bishops described Archbishop Tartaglia as a ""gentle, caring and warm-hearted pastor who combined compassion with a piercing intellect"". Among those who paid tribute were First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken, who described the archbishop as ""a true Glaswegian"".

MPs call for road tax to plug fuel duty shortfall,"The UK needs to create a new motoring tax to plug the revenue gap as drivers switch to electric cars, MPs have said. The government should tax motorists based on miles travelled as the use of petrol and diesel vehicles decreases, the Transport Select Committee said. If no action is taken this year, the UK faces a Â£35bn ""black hole"" in its finances, they said. The Treasury said tax revenues would keep pace with changes prompted by electric vehicle take-up. Sales of new petrol and diesel cars and vans will be banned in the UK from 2030 and sales of electric cars are already soaring. Taken together, vehicle excise duty - better known as ""car tax"" - and fuel duty that motorists pay at the pump, raise around Â£35bn a year, but neither tax is levied on pure electric vehicles. The committee warned there is likely to be no revenue from existing tax sources by 2040. The MPs said charging people based on how much they drive, using technology to track cars' movements, should be considered. Such a scheme could factor in the type of vehicle and congestion, and support vulnerable groups such as those with mobility issues, and people in remote areas, the committee said. Motorists should pay ""the same or less"" than they do currently, the MPs said. Road pricing is not a new idea. But it has previously proved an unpopular one in the UK. Motoring groups believe many drivers do now support the principle of paying more tax the more you drive. But public opinion is not the only factor - there are many outstanding questions. If road pricing did come in, what exact technology would be used, who would provide it, and what reassurances could be offered over privacy, given the amount of data captured? How could it work alongside the local schemes already in place, such as city congestion charges? And when would be the right time? Too early and it might put people off buying electric cars. Too late and cheaper driving could lead to more congestion, and electric car drivers who've grown used to not being taxed may not react positively to the belated introduction of a charge. Huw Merriman, the chair of the Transport Committee, said that unless the government acts now the ""loss of two major sources of motor taxation will leave a Â£35bn black hole"" in government finances. ""That's 4% of the entire tax-take, "" he said. ""Only Â£7bn of this goes back to the roads. Schools and hospitals could be [hit] if motorists don't continue to pay."" He said using road pricing technology could help ease congestion. ""By using price as a lever, we can offer better prices at less congested times and have technology compare these directly to public transport alternatives,"" he said, adding: ""Net-zero emissions should not mean zero tax revenue."" The committee called for the Treasury and the Department for Transport to set up an arms length body to look at future motoring taxation. A Treasury spokesperson said: ""The government has committed to ensuring that motoring tax revenues keep pace with the changes brought about by the switch to electric vehicles, whilst keeping the transition affordable for consumers. ""We will respond to the committee's recommendations in full in due course."" Electric car sales soar, but chip shortage hits market Car production falls to lowest level for 65 years Figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders show battery electric vehicles accounted for more than one in ten new cars registered in the UK last year. RAC Foundation director Steve Gooding said the ""silver lining of zero-carbon motoring comes wrapped in a cloud of trouble for the chancellor as his fuel duty income dries up"". ""Forget 2050, our analysis shows that fuel duty revenue from cars alone could be down by Â£5bn a year as soon as 2028 because of accelerating sales of battery-powered cars,"" he said. ""Drivers choosing to go electric deserve to know what is coming next - particularly if the promise of cheap per-mile running costs is set to be undermined by a future tax change. He added that the Treasury needed to act promptly or risk ""a furious backlash from drivers who made the choice to go electric expecting to save money"". Silviya Barrett, head of policy at the Campaign for Better Transport, said: ""Road pricing, based on distance travelled and how polluting a vehicle is, can be a fairer system for everyone. ""It can reduce congestion, air pollution and carbon emissions and encourage a shift to greener modes where possible.""

Profile: Sinn FÃ©in's Michelle O'Neill,"Michelle O'Neill, Sinn FÃ©in's deputy leader, has made history as the first nationalist to hold the role of first minister at the Northern Ireland Assembly. Sinn FÃ©in became the biggest party at Stormont after the election in May 2022, meaning Ms O'Neill has been entitled to the role since then. But the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) had refused to join a power-sharing executive as part of its protest againstpost-Brexit trading regulations, preventing her from taking up the post. Now a deal has been reached to enable the Stormont institutions to return. On Saturday Ms O'Neillaccepted her party's nomination to the post of first minister. Ms O'Neill grew up steeped in the history of Northern Ireland's Troubles. Born Michelle Doris on 10 January 1977, she was raised in the rural village of Clonoe in County Tyrone and hails from a family of prominent Irish republicans. Her father, Brendan Doris, was a former IRA prisoner who became a Sinn FÃ©in councillor in Dungannon in the 1980s. Her uncle, Paul Doris, has been president of Noraid, a republican fundraising group. Michelle O'Neill (r) was deputy first minister alongside Arlene Foster from 2020 As a teenager, she was educated at St Patrick's Girls Academy in Dungannon, County Tyrone. At the age of 16, while still a pupil there, she became pregnant with her first child. In an interview with theBBC in 2022, she recalled that she had been prayed over at the Catholic grammar school. However, she said she had ""really strong support"" from her parents and her partner during this period of her life. ""Mummy actually gave up work so that I could go back to school,"" Ms O'Neill said in a recent social media video. ""She stayed at home, she did the babysitting and allowed me to go back and finish my education which was obviously very important."" She returned to St Patrick's to sit her A Level exams and after leaving school she began training to become an accounting technician. When the Good Friday Agreement, the peace deal that helped bring an end to 30 years of violence in Northern Ireland, was signed in 1998 she began working for Sinn FÃ©in. It brought her into direct contact with the party's deputy leader Martin McGuinness, who at that time was running for election in the Mid Ulster constituency. In addition to working with him and his fellow Mid Ulster assembly member Francie Molloy, she spent this period training as a welfare rights adviser. When her father stepped down from Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council ahead of the 2005 election she won the seat he vacated in the Torrent electoral area. She would later become the first woman to hold the post of mayor in the borough. Michelle O'Neill joined Francie Molloy and Martin McGuinness as a Mid Ulster MLA in 2007 Her assembly career began in 2007, when she joined Mr McGuinness and Mr Molloy as a Mid Ulster assembly member. She became her party's spokeswoman for health and sat on the education committee. After four years on the backbenches at Stormont, Sinn FÃ©in appointed her as minister for agriculture in 2011. In 2016 she became health minister, one of Stormont's most high-profile and challenging portfolios. She was faced with mounting hospital waiting lists, a crisis in general practice and the findings of the Bengoa report into how Northern Ireland's health care is organised. Her response was a10-year plan to transform the health service, saying it would improve a system that was at ""breaking point"". Opposition politicians questioned the lack of details in the plan, which was not costed. But it set out a range of priorities, including a new model of care involving a team of professionals based around GP surgeries. On the eve of Ms O'Neill's 40th birthday in January 2017,Martin McGuinness announced his resignationas deputy first minister to protest against the DUP's handling of a botched energy scheme. At Stormont the positions of first and deputy first minister are joint roles - if one resigns it forces the resignation of the other, collapsing the power-sharing executive. When Mr McGuinness died soon afterwards, Ms O'Neill wasselected to replace him as Sinn FÃ©in deputy leader. She said it was ""the biggest honour and privilege"" of her life. Ms O'Neill had been at the forefront of her party's response tothe Renewable Heat Incentive Scandal (RHI)at the time. Michelle O'Neill with Sinn FÃ©in colleagues Conor Murphy and Gerry Kelly She became embroiled in controversy in 2017 when she addressed a rally to mark the 30th anniversary of the killing of eight IRA men by the SAS. The men were killed as they mounted agun and bomb attack on Loughgall police stationon 8 May 1987. She defended her attendance at the rally by saying she was an Irish republican and would ""always remember and commemorate our patriot dead"". When Stormont returned in January 2020 after three years of deadlock, Ms O'Neill was appointed deputy first minister, just as the Covid pandemic was beginning. Her attendance at the funeral ofrepublican Bobby Storey in June 2020sparked a major political row at Stormont, with Sinn FÃ©in being accused of disregarding Covid-19 restrictions on public gatherings. Police investigated but the Public Prosecution Service decided not to pursue any prosecutions, citing engagement between police and funeral organisers and a lack of clarity in Stormont's coronavirus regulations. Ms O'Neill defended her attendance, saying she acted within the rules and would ""never apologise for attending the funeral of my friend"". She later expressed regret over public health messaging being ""undermined"". Her time as deputy first minister ended in February 2022 whenPaul Givan tendered his resignation as first minister in February 2022. Stormont has been in stalemate since then until now. Neither Michelle O'Neill nor Paul Givan could stay in office if the other quit In May 2022, Sinn FÃ©in became the largest party at Stormont for the first time, and repeated the achievement in local council elections the following year. Ms O'Neill said both elections were historic and called for the DUP to end its boycott of Stormont. She became embroiled in further controversy in August 2022 when she toldBBC News NI's Red Lines podcast that there had been ""no alternative"" to IRA violence. The brother of a man murdered by the IRA described her remarks as ""sickening"" while opposition politicians also criticised her. In May 2023, Ms O'Neillattended the coronation of King Charles, saying it was important to show respect to others. The republican party has traditionally objected to the monarchy, particularly in relation to its role in Northern Ireland.

Executive return 'difficult' if Protocol remains,"DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was ""now an opportunity for the government and the EU to step up to the mark"" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said it will be ""difficult"" for his party to form a government after an election if issues around the NI Protocol are not addressed. He was speaking after Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursday. Ittook effect at midnightand meant Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in also lost her post. Mr Donaldson said there was ""now an opportunity for the government and the EU to step up to the mark"". The move by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was part of their opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which places a trade border in the Irish Sea. On Wednesday the DUP's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, ordered officials to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland's ports on goods arriving from Great Britain. However, that directionhas been suspended by the High Court, pending the outcome of legal challenges. ""I have withdrawn the first minister on the basis that the protocol issues have not been addressed despite clear commitments and promises given by the prime minister that they would be addressed,"" Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""If the protocol issues are not resolved by the time of the election, then of course it is difficult for us to form a government, because of the instability that the protocol creates."" Mr Donaldson said that last week Boris Johnson told him the prospect of an agreement being reached with the EU on the protocol within the next few weeks was ""20 to 30%"". Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald (centre) called for an early election on Thursday Sinn FÃ©in have called for an early election. The party's finance minister described the DUP's decision to resign from the post of first minister as ""cynical and reckless"". Conor Murphy reiterated his party president's call for an early election and said the assembly could sit extra days if parties were willing to get legislation through. ""Let's get the parties together, let's get the legislation completed in the next number of weeks however long that takes to sit in the assembly, let's go to the people and ask them their verdict on what the DUP have done,"" he said. ""We can't sit by and pretend it is business as usual and that things are OK, I think we need to give the people their verdict in all of this."" Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis In quotes: Reactions to Paul Givan's resignation Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said ""no one party should have a veto"" over the future of Stormont. ""I believe that decision is very damaging to politics itself, and to people's trust in politics,"" he added. Conor Burns said the DUP should return Paul Givan to the role of first minister Northern Ireland Office (NIO) minister Conor Burns urged the DUP to return Stormont to a stable government. ""We want Sir Jeffrey to reconsider, to put Paul Givan back in and get it stabilised and up and running again,"" he told BBC News NI. ""We'll spend time now thinking about what happens if that doesn't actually come to pass and we'll make those decisions."" Mr Burns said he did not want to speculate about the NIO's next actions but confirmed the Northern Ireland secretary does have the power to call an early election. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon of the SDLP said her party were ""not going to fall into this trap that the DUP have set where we fall into an early election"". ""It's all about creating this toxic, hostile environment where they can terrify people to the polls by telling them their identity is in crisis,"" she said. ""There are real concerns within loyalism and within unionism, we are listening to that, we want to work through it but this is being manipulated by the DUP and it is shameful,"" she added. Alliance assembly member Andrew Muir said his party was up for an election ""at any time"", but said MLAs were there to do a job and ""they should get it done"". Meanwhile, a virtual meeting of several of the NI Executive party leaders has taken place. The politicians discussed how the assembly and the executive might operate after Mr Givan's resignation. There was some confusion earlier if the meeting would take place after the DUP leader was not originally invited by Sinn FÃ©in. Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursday The UUP and Alliance said the DUP should have been invited. It is understood the party whips at Stormont are to meet to discuss how assembly business can be handled in the days ahead. UUP leader Doug Beattie was invited to the meeting but due to other commitments was unable to attend. However, he called on the secretary of state to say if he intended to call an early election ""because if we know when it's coming, we know how we can deal with the legislation"". ""But right now,we simply don't know what to do."","" he added. As the dust settles after Paul Givan's resignation - the parties and pressure groups lobbying for legislation must now assess what can be rescued in the coming days. The difficulty in holding a cross-party meeting is an example of how difficult it is to chart a way forward. Looking ahead there is also much talk about an early election and there is a clear divide. Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP want one, but the Alliance, the SDLP and the UUP say voters should go to the polls as scheduled in May. Some are now asking if full devolution can be restored after an election. Whilst the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says that depends on what happens to the protocol. There are also questions if a DUP MLA would serve as deputy first minster if Sinn FÃ©in take the first minster's role. Not for the first time the long term future of how we are governed is shrouded in doubt. An election for the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently scheduled for May. Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. Northern Ireland's Assembly continues in shadow form, but the executive - effectively Northern Ireland's government - will no longer meet. Paul Givan's political career Michelle O'Neill profile Ministers in charge of departments will be able to stay in post, but they will be limited in terms of what they can do. Ahead of the midnight deadline on Thursday, the outgoing first and deputy first ministers made a number of appointments, includingnaming Ian Jeffers as Northern Ireland's new victims' commissioner, and keeping in place for another three years Brenda King as Northern Ireland's attorney general. There are questions over key pieces oflegislation requiring executive approval, including a multi-year budget and the lifting of Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he would be seeking legal advice on his powers as health minister Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Alex Maskey, assembly speaker, said the Northern Ireland Act 1998 calls for the first and deputy first minister offices to be filled within seven days, by 12:01 on Friday 11 February. Mr Maskey also said he was aware that legislation due to be completed at Westminster next week may leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdraw DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks.

"Huge leap in children in mental health crisisAs referrals rise for self-harm and eating disorders, schools see a wave of other less severe issues.Family & Education","This video can not be played Five tips to boost your child's wellbeing There has been a 77% rise in the number of children needing specialist treatment for severe mental health crisis, analysis for the BBC shows. Some 409,347 under-18s were referred to the NHS in England for specialist care for issues such as suicidal thoughts and self harm between April and October 2021. Head teachers also report a huge rise in less severe mental health issues. The government plans 400 mental health teams to support schools by 2023. The NHS Digital referrals data analysed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists for the BBC, includes the most serious and urgent cases where the child faces an immediate risk from an eating disorder, self-harm or suicidal thoughts. In the same six month period in 2019, there were 230,591 referrals for under-18s. There were 349,449 under-18s in touch with NHS child and adolescent psychiatric teams at the end of October 2021, the highest number on record. Only those with the most serious mental health problems are referred for specialist care. But schools are reporting a surge in mental health problems below this high threshold, with pupils needing extra support such as counselling. Almost 1,000 teaching and support staff who responded to a survey from the children's mental health charity, Place2Be, and the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), described seeing an increase in emotional and mental health issues among pupils since the pandemic, including anxiety. ""Covid is trash,"" says Isaac, 7, as he shows me his drawing of flies buzzing around a bin on fire. It illustrates his feelings about coronavirus. He's drawn himself ""feeling sad because I feel like I'm trapped in the telly"", while his grandma tries ""to scare Covid away"". Pupils at Seascape Primary School have been taking part in mental health workshops Isaac's drawing is a task as part of a mental health workshop he's in with other Year 3 and Year 4 pupils at Seascape Primary School in Peterlee, County Durham. Grace, 8, remembers her parents telling her about the pandemic beginning. She's drawn herself ""curled in the corner"" of a prison cell, ""because I felt trapped in lockdown"". 'We've lost faith in child mental health care' Child mental health not improved since lockdown 'I was begging for help after my child overdosed' In a normal year the team of counsellors that work at the school would see about 100 children but in just the autumn term almost as many asked for help. Many are anxious or struggling to manage with being back in a busy school. As well as providing mental health support, Seascape is bringing back music lessons, football tournaments and school trips as part of its effort to boost children's wellbeing. But there are different pressures for teenagers - especially those who face exams this summer for GCSEs. Almost half of secondary schools (46%) said pupils' mental and emotional health was the biggest challenge in helping them catch up with learning,in recent government research,external. How will my exams be different this year? How is Covid being managed in UK schools? Among the Year 11 pupils feeling the pressure is Harley who has had extra support from his school, Horizon Community College in Barnsley. Harley's self-esteem plummeted after coming out of lockdown in 2021. ""It was very uncomfortable for the first two or three months. Some of us had put on weight and it felt awkward,"" he tells me. ""The time I lost with my friends didn't help and it took me a long, long road to get back."" Schools say the pressures of the pandemic have made mental health an even greater priority,with longer waits for specialist help. Harley's school has encouraged him to open up about his low self-esteem An extra Â£79m for improving mental health support in England was committed by the government last year. It has also promised 400 mental health support teams by 2023, to work with schools to provide extra counselling. The BBC has learned at least 183 are up and running, with more staff in training. These teams have been welcomed, but the charities in the Children and Young People's Mental Health Coalition warn they will only cover about a third of England's pupils. In the meantime, pupils such as Harley have to rely on the school for support - which he says is helping. ""Talking just gives you time to breathe, and it helps me control what's going on in my head,"" he says. ""It's a weight off my chest.""

China joins Russia in condemning Nato expansion,"The meeting between Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping was the first face-to-face talks they have had since June 2019 China has joined Russia in opposing further Nato expansion as the two countries move closer together in the face of Western pressure. Moscow and Beijing issued a statement showcasing their agreement on a raft of issues during a visit by Russia's Vladimir Putin for the Winter Olympics. Mr Putin claims Western powers are using the Nato defence alliance to undermine Russia. It comes amid tensions over Ukraine, which he denies planning to invade. Some 100,000 Russian troops remain at the border with Ukraine, which is a former Soviet republic. Mr Putin, who has written that Russians and Ukrainians are ""one nation"", has demanded that Ukraine be barred from joining Nato. While the lengthy joint statement did not refer directly to Ukraine, the two countries accused Nato of espousing a Cold War ideology. What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Ukraine: How big is Russia's military build-up? The talks, which the Kremlin said were ""very warm"", were held ahead of the Games opening ceremony. It was the first time the leaders have met face-to-face since the start of the pandemic. ""Friendship between [Russia and China] has no limits, there are no 'forbidden' areas of cooperation,""the statement reads,external. The two countries said they were ""seriously concerned"" about the Aukus security pact between the US, UK and Australia. Announced last year,Aukus will see Australia build nuclear-powered submarinesas part of efforts to boost security in the Asia-Pacific region. It is largely seen as an effort to counter China, which has been accused of raising tensions in disputed territories such as the South China Sea. Meanwhile Russia said it supported Beijing's One China policy, which asserts that self-ruled Taiwan is a breakaway province that will eventually be part of China again. However, Taiwan sees itself as an independent country, with its own constitution and democratically-elected leaders. They had lunch, they had talks then they went off to see a show together - a big show. Vladimir Putin is the star guest in Beijing for the start of the winter games. Of more significance to this visit is the increased co-operation and shared view of the world that Presidents Xi and Putin are keen to show. Although Ukraine wasn't mentioned it was clearly hinted at when they both said they oppose the enlargement of the Nato alliance. For China this is a delicate balance. Beijing has relations with Ukraine - political and economic. Any Russia invasion or military attack there could be damaging for President Xi's standing. Amid a growing war of words, the US on Wednesday accused Russia of planning to stage a fake Ukrainian attack that it would use to justify an invasion. Russia denied it was planning to fabricate an attack, and the US did not provide evidence to support the claim.

Olympics kick off despite Covid and boycotts,"Keen ice skater Yiyi (right) won't be able to attend any of the events - no tickets will be sold to the general public The most divided Olympic Games in decades gets under way in China on Friday as Beijing becomes the only city to host both the Summer and now the Winter Games. As well as tight Covid-19 controls, the Games are fraught with political tensions over allegations of human rights abuses and boycotts. Most of the snow on the slopes where the Olympic events will take place is artificial. But inside an indoor rink where the icy climate is maintained by massive freezers at the side of the dome, six-year-old ice skater Yiyi doesn't care how Beijing is making the Winter Games happen. She just can't wait to see it. She wasn't even born the first time the Olympics came to town. Now she's inspired by it. ""It's very exhausting but she presses on,"" her mum told me, after we'd watched her daughter in a lesson with a coach. ""She won't leave until she learns how to do all the moves. She doesn't quit."" But this is as close to the action as she is going to get. Life inside the Beijing Winter Olympics bubble What is China's Covid plan for the Olympics? Yiyi and her mum can't go to any of the events. The Winter Olympics is happening in Beijing, but almost everyone here is excluded from it. China is in the middle of a renewed effort to maintain ""zero Covid"". So authorities have decided that no tickets will go on sale to the general public. Only members of the ruling Communist Party or staff from government-controlled companies are being invited, and even they have to abide by strict testing and restrictions. As Yiyi's mum was telling me how disappointed she was that they could only watch the Games on TV, the six-year-old jumped in, making sure I knew that she was definitely going to be watching. Despite the restrictions, Yiyi has been inspired by the Beijing Olympics Spectators are just one part of China's strict Covid prevention measures. The athletes and officials are all inside strictly managed ""bubbles"" to try to stop any spread. They can't leave. Anyone travelling between bubbles in official cars or coaches has been told that, in the event of a crash with a member of the public, they must stay in their vehicle. They must not make contact. But it's not just Covid that makes these games unusual. There's confrontation over China's human rights record. Senior officials from the US, the UK and more than a dozen other governments aren't coming. China's leaders, and state media, have dismissed the diplomatic boycott as ""politicisation"". Why are China's Winter Olympics so controversial? Alleged rights abuses cast a shadow over Beijing Olympics Putin's Olympic trip signals warmer China ties A dad who was watching his son at the ice rink where we met Yiyi shared that view. He told us the Games is just about sport. ""I think sports are sports and they shouldn't be mixed with politics,"" he said, speaking from behind his mask, wrapped up in his thick coat. ""The Games belong to everyone and we should a participate and watch. Politics is just politics."" Five words make up the official slogan of Beijing 2022: Together for a shared future. It's similar to one of President Xi Jinping's buzz phrases, if you can call it that - building a shared future for the human race. You see the slogan on posters at bus stops and attached to walls around the city. It's in propaganda videos from state media too. We found a ""Together"" video online with smiling children, singing and dancing. It was released last month by the government in Xinjiang - the place where China denies it's committed genocide against its Uyghur minority. A Xinjiang government video showed children dancing and singing with the official Beijing 2022 slogan on screen A former Olympian who is close to US athletes this time told me why some of them are nervous about ""sharing"" this moment. ""I don't think a single athlete is going to speak out at the Games and nor do I think they should,"" Noah Hoffman told the BBC. ""If I were there I would be keeping my mouth shut."" The 32-year-old skier represented the USA in 2014 and 2018. Now he advocates for sportsmen and women. ""The risk is just too great... this is a failure of the International Olympic Committee, it's a failure of leadership that athletes are in this position,"" he said when we spoke from his base on the US east coast. He said he's been talking to teammates who are at these Games and they've told him the build-up experience is ""nothing like what we've experienced before"". All you need to know about Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics 2022: Day-by-day guide One athlete told him they'd not had a single meeting about ""sport or their athletic performance"". The preparatory meetings with the US Olympic authorities had focused on Covid-19 measures and personal safety for competitors while they are in China. There are updated rules in place to allow athletes to express their concerns, but well away from the tracks, slopes, rinks and podiums. Chinese officials have warned athletes they must adhere to Chinese law at all times. Noah Hoffman thinks the idea that athletes are ""at liberty to speak out"" about China's mass incarceration andso-called ""egregious"" abuse of thousands of minority Muslim Uyghurs""is just false"". China's leader Xi Jinping has promised an efficient and safe Games.  In many ways this looks like a normal Olympics. The torch relay in the days before the flame is lit. The universal branding emblazoned across a city. The Olympic rings popping up on myriad goods or services in shops. But what is always a cold gathering feels much frostier this time round. This is a Games defined by the big fissure on the world stage, with China on one side and the US on the other. Inside the bubble, athletes are just trying to get on with their sport.

Child mental health referrals reach record number,"This video can not be played Five tips to boost your child's wellbeing There has been a 77% rise in the number of children needing specialist treatment for severe mental health crisis, analysis for the BBC shows. Some 409,347 under-18s were referred to the NHS in England for specialist care for issues such as suicidal thoughts and self harm between April and October 2021. Head teachers also report a huge rise in less severe mental health issues. The government plans 400 mental health teams to support schools by 2023. The NHS Digital referrals data analysed by the Royal College of Psychiatrists for the BBC, includes the most serious and urgent cases where the child faces an immediate risk from an eating disorder, self-harm or suicidal thoughts. In the same six month period in 2019, there were 230,591 referrals for under-18s. There were 349,449 under-18s in touch with NHS child and adolescent psychiatric teams at the end of October 2021, the highest number on record. Only those with the most serious mental health problems are referred for specialist care. But schools are reporting a surge in mental health problems below this high threshold, with pupils needing extra support such as counselling. Almost 1,000 teaching and support staff who responded to a survey from the children's mental health charity, Place2Be, and the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT), described seeing an increase in emotional and mental health issues among pupils since the pandemic, including anxiety. ""Covid is trash,"" says Isaac, 7, as he shows me his drawing of flies buzzing around a bin on fire. It illustrates his feelings about coronavirus. He's drawn himself ""feeling sad because I feel like I'm trapped in the telly"", while his grandma tries ""to scare Covid away"". Pupils at Seascape Primary School have been taking part in mental health workshops Isaac's drawing is a task as part of a mental health workshop he's in with other Year 3 and Year 4 pupils at Seascape Primary School in Peterlee, County Durham. Grace, 8, remembers her parents telling her about the pandemic beginning. She's drawn herself ""curled in the corner"" of a prison cell, ""because I felt trapped in lockdown"". 'We've lost faith in child mental health care' Child mental health not improved since lockdown 'I was begging for help after my child overdosed' In a normal year the team of counsellors that work at the school would see about 100 children but in just the autumn term almost as many asked for help. Many are anxious or struggling to manage with being back in a busy school. As well as providing mental health support, Seascape is bringing back music lessons, football tournaments and school trips as part of its effort to boost children's wellbeing. But there are different pressures for teenagers - especially those who face exams this summer for GCSEs. Almost half of secondary schools (46%) said pupils' mental and emotional health was the biggest challenge in helping them catch up with learning,in recent government research,external. How will my exams be different this year? How is Covid being managed in UK schools? Among the Year 11 pupils feeling the pressure is Harley who has had extra support from his school, Horizon Community College in Barnsley. Harley's self-esteem plummeted after coming out of lockdown in 2021. ""It was very uncomfortable for the first two or three months. Some of us had put on weight and it felt awkward,"" he tells me. ""The time I lost with my friends didn't help and it took me a long, long road to get back."" Schools say the pressures of the pandemic have made mental health an even greater priority,with longer waits for specialist help. Harley's school has encouraged him to open up about his low self-esteem An extra Â£79m for improving mental health support in England was committed by the government last year. It has also promised 400 mental health support teams by 2023, to work with schools to provide extra counselling. The BBC has learned at least 183 are up and running, with more staff in training. These teams have been welcomed, but the charities in the Children and Young People's Mental Health Coalition warn they will only cover about a third of England's pupils. In the meantime, pupils such as Harley have to rely on the school for support - which he says is helping. ""Talking just gives you time to breathe, and it helps me control what's going on in my head,"" he says. ""It's a weight off my chest.""

Doubt over leaders meeting after Givan resignation,"DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was ""now an opportunity for the government and the EU to step up to the mark"" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said it will be ""difficult"" for his party to form a government after an election if issues around the NI Protocol are not addressed. He was speaking after Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursday. Ittook effect at midnightand meant Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in also lost her post. Mr Donaldson said there was ""now an opportunity for the government and the EU to step up to the mark"". The move by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was part of their opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which places a trade border in the Irish Sea. On Wednesday the DUP's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, ordered officials to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland's ports on goods arriving from Great Britain. However, that directionhas been suspended by the High Court, pending the outcome of legal challenges. ""I have withdrawn the first minister on the basis that the protocol issues have not been addressed despite clear commitments and promises given by the prime minister that they would be addressed,"" Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""If the protocol issues are not resolved by the time of the election, then of course it is difficult for us to form a government, because of the instability that the protocol creates."" Mr Donaldson said that last week Boris Johnson told him the prospect of an agreement being reached with the EU on the protocol within the next few weeks was ""20 to 30%"". Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald (centre) called for an early election on Thursday Sinn FÃ©in have called for an early election. The party's finance minister described the DUP's decision to resign from the post of first minister as ""cynical and reckless"". Conor Murphy reiterated his party president's call for an early election and said the assembly could sit extra days if parties were willing to get legislation through. ""Let's get the parties together, let's get the legislation completed in the next number of weeks however long that takes to sit in the assembly, let's go to the people and ask them their verdict on what the DUP have done,"" he said. ""We can't sit by and pretend it is business as usual and that things are OK, I think we need to give the people their verdict in all of this."" Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis In quotes: Reactions to Paul Givan's resignation Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said ""no one party should have a veto"" over the future of Stormont. ""I believe that decision is very damaging to politics itself, and to people's trust in politics,"" he added. Conor Burns said the DUP should return Paul Givan to the role of first minister Northern Ireland Office (NIO) minister Conor Burns urged the DUP to return Stormont to a stable government. ""We want Sir Jeffrey to reconsider, to put Paul Givan back in and get it stabilised and up and running again,"" he told BBC News NI. ""We'll spend time now thinking about what happens if that doesn't actually come to pass and we'll make those decisions."" Mr Burns said he did not want to speculate about the NIO's next actions but confirmed the Northern Ireland secretary does have the power to call an early election. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon of the SDLP said her party were ""not going to fall into this trap that the DUP have set where we fall into an early election"". ""It's all about creating this toxic, hostile environment where they can terrify people to the polls by telling them their identity is in crisis,"" she said. ""There are real concerns within loyalism and within unionism, we are listening to that, we want to work through it but this is being manipulated by the DUP and it is shameful,"" she added. Alliance assembly member Andrew Muir said his party was up for an election ""at any time"", but said MLAs were there to do a job and ""they should get it done"". Meanwhile, a virtual meeting of several of the NI Executive party leaders has taken place. The politicians discussed how the assembly and the executive might operate after Mr Givan's resignation. There was some confusion earlier if the meeting would take place after the DUP leader was not originally invited by Sinn FÃ©in. Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursday The UUP and Alliance said the DUP should have been invited. It is understood the party whips at Stormont are to meet to discuss how assembly business can be handled in the days ahead. UUP leader Doug Beattie was invited to the meeting but due to other commitments was unable to attend. However, he called on the secretary of state to say if he intended to call an early election ""because if we know when it's coming, we know how we can deal with the legislation"". ""But right now,we simply don't know what to do."","" he added. As the dust settles after Paul Givan's resignation - the parties and pressure groups lobbying for legislation must now assess what can be rescued in the coming days. The difficulty in holding a cross-party meeting is an example of how difficult it is to chart a way forward. Looking ahead there is also much talk about an early election and there is a clear divide. Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP want one, but the Alliance, the SDLP and the UUP say voters should go to the polls as scheduled in May. Some are now asking if full devolution can be restored after an election. Whilst the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says that depends on what happens to the protocol. There are also questions if a DUP MLA would serve as deputy first minster if Sinn FÃ©in take the first minster's role. Not for the first time the long term future of how we are governed is shrouded in doubt. An election for the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently scheduled for May. Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. Northern Ireland's Assembly continues in shadow form, but the executive - effectively Northern Ireland's government - will no longer meet. Paul Givan's political career Michelle O'Neill profile Ministers in charge of departments will be able to stay in post, but they will be limited in terms of what they can do. Ahead of the midnight deadline on Thursday, the outgoing first and deputy first ministers made a number of appointments, includingnaming Ian Jeffers as Northern Ireland's new victims' commissioner, and keeping in place for another three years Brenda King as Northern Ireland's attorney general. There are questions over key pieces oflegislation requiring executive approval, including a multi-year budget and the lifting of Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he would be seeking legal advice on his powers as health minister Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Alex Maskey, assembly speaker, said the Northern Ireland Act 1998 calls for the first and deputy first minister offices to be filled within seven days, by 12:01 on Friday 11 February. Mr Maskey also said he was aware that legislation due to be completed at Westminster next week may leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdraw DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks.

Sea border checks continuing despite order - No 10,"Checks are continuing on goods along the Irish Sea border despite an order by a Democratic Unionist Party minister for them to stop, Downing Street has said. Northern Ireland's Agriculture Minister Edwin Poots had ordered checks to stop from 00:01 GMT. But the prime minister's spokesman said checks were continuing, and that ""we are reviewing the legal position"". Mr Poots has said he made the move after receiving legal advice. Sinn FÃ©in, the DUP's power-sharing partners, criticised the move to halt port checks as a ""stunt"". The order is part of the DUP's ongoingopposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. First Minister Paul Givan announced his resignation lateras part of that protest. Inspections of products from Great Britain into Northern Ireland are part of the post-Brexit protocol agreement. Q&A: Irish Sea border checks A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Issues 'clear when Brexit deal was done' It was agreed by the UK and EU toensure free movement of trade across the Irish border after Brexit. Under the deal, checks on goods from Great Britain must take place at Northern Ireland's ports to ensure they comply with EU laws. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Thursday that a ""sensible solution"" was needed to the protocol, which ""recognises that it's crazy to have checks on goods that are basically circulating within the single market of the UK"". Earlier, Mr Johnson's spokesman said checks were ""a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"", adding ""we would like to see this situation resolved"". Asked whether the prime minister viewed the checks as the UK's obligation under the protocol, he said ""we are reviewing the legal position"" and said the government wanted to find ""solutions"" through ongoing negotiations with the EU. The environment secretary George Eustice is expected to make a statement in the House of Commons later, after speaking with Mr Poots. The spokesman said the prime minister wanted checks to continue and had not been informed of the decision to suspend them until the announcement was made, adding: ""We certainly weren't aware this was an approach the DUP would take."" Asked about reports that Mr Givan will resign as Northern Ireland's first minister and the possible return of powers to Westminster if Stormont collapsed, he said the government wanted to see a ""resilient"" and ""stable power-sharing executive"". Unionist politicians have criticised the arrangements, saying they damage Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Simon Coveney, the Irish Republic's foreign minister, has warned that an end to those checks would breach international law. However, the UK government said it would not interfere and that the issue was a ""matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"". The dispute over the protocol checks centres on whether Mr Poots needs the wider authority of Stormont to act. Mr Poots, who is the Stormont Executive's agriculture minister, said legal advice supported his view that he was entitled to order officials to stop. On Thursday he confirmed that the legal advice came from former Northern Ireland attorney general John Larkin, but also said he had also been receiving advice from the current attorney general Brenda King. Edwin Poots, Northern Ireland's agricultural minister, believes the Irish Sea checks are unlawful Under power-sharing arrangements,if a matter was put to the executive, it would need an agreed approach from both the first and deputy first minister for changes to be made. DUP MP Sammy Wilson said the move was a ""test"" to see if border checks were necessary, and a ""kick to get reality into talks"" over the protocol. But Sinn FÃ©in MLA John O'Dowd said Mr Poots announcement was a ""stunt"". Mr O'Dowd said Sinn FÃ©in would ""use whatever powers we have at our disposal to ensure that the protocol remains in place"". Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Doug Beattie, whose party opposes the protocol, said the Irish Sea border loomed as large as it did before Mr Poots stopped some checks. ""HMRC are still doing their checks, border force are still there. The checks are not stopped."" He told BBC NI's The Nolan Show: ""What we're trying to do is trying to get rid of the Irish Sea Border, and you'll get rid of the Irish Sea Border through negotiation."" For now, some checks appear to be continuing. However, even in the light of Edwin Poots' order, pre-Brexit checks on livestock are expected to continue as normal. Belfast City Council, which employs staff at the port's border control post, said it will ""engage with representatives and statutory partners"" on Thursday and ""assess the situation at that point"". As the sun rises at Duncrue Street in Belfast, there's no further light shed on what's happening behind the checkpoint fence. Staff in hi-vis jackets are on the ground. I watched one lorry stop, its back doors open, and a member of staff appeared to be looking at what was inside. It then left the facility, seemingly following an official-looking 4x4. Another lorry has just pulled up inside the checkpoint. Several members of staff are around it. Again it looks like something is being checked but at this point it's just not clear what. The next ferry is due to arrive in Belfast just before 10am. Seamus Leheny from Logistics UK said the directive had left hauliers in a legal limbo, but that most businesses would carry on as they had before. Mr Poots' announcement applies only to animal, food and plant products - Mr Leheny said the vast minority, only about 3%, of lorries which arrive at Belfast Port will have to open their doors for their goods to be checked. About 12% just need their documents checked, and the rest need no checks at all. He said things were ""up in the air"". ""The legal text hasn't changed - this is the situation businesses find themselves in, is that the legality side of things says one thing, the practical assessment of those checks has been instructed in another way."" AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the NI Retail Consortium, said he did not have ""clarity"" on whether the checks on goods had stopped. ""For retailers and for any business, it's not what we can get away with, but what's the safest course of action to minimise the chance that our products will get caught up in some regulatory or legal problem."" He added: ""What business has always needed is stability, certainty, simplicity and affordability, now short-term solutions of removing checks don't get us to that long-term solution which removes that friction from Great Britain to Northern Ireland."" There is now a tense wait to see what happens next. First, will checks actually be stopped? Both Downing Street and the European Commission say that checks are still going on. A second question is, if those checks did stop - what would be the consequences? The UK is suggesting that this is a matter for the Northern Ireland Executive. That won't wash with the EU who point out that the protocol is an agreement between Brussels and the UK government. If the European Commission believes the agreement is being breached, it's conceivable it could take legal action. But we're not there yet and, as things stand, the Commission says it won't ""speculate"". Everyone is aware that this is a difficult and delicate situation. Suddenly an already scheduled call between the Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has gained a whole new significance. Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, of Sinn FÃ©in, said the move was an attempt by the DUP to ""unlawfully interfere with domestic and international law"". Her party maintains that Stormont has a legal obligation to enforce the checks, and that the executive agreed in May 2020 to designate Mr Poots' department to perform those controls. But Mr Poots believes the checks are unlawful and cannot continue without approval from the Stormont Executive. Last week, his attempt to force an executive rethink on the issue was blocked by Sinn FÃ©in. Unionists have been critical of the Protocol, saying its damaging Northern Ireland's place in the UK Mr Poots had sought executive support for the checks continuing, ahead of a legal challenge by loyalist blogger Jamie Bryson. The DUP minister argued the challenge made clear that checks must be approved by all ministers as they are controversial and cut across various departments. The BBC has contacted the UK's Department for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs for a response. The Manufacturing NI trade body said it was advising members to continue to enact the measures.

Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is expected to speak to EU Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ when they meet on Thursday. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis said there was no orchestration between the government and the DUP over Mr Poots' decision. Speaking to ITV's Robert Peston, he said he first found out about the move when Mr Poots announced it, adding that the decision was a ""matter for the Northern Ireland Executive"" and ""within their legal remit"". Brandon Lewis said he had no prior warning of Mr Poots' announcement Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney described moves to ""deliberately frustrate obligations"" under the post-Brexit agreement as a ""very serious matter "". An EU diplomat told BBC News the move ""won't do the UK's reputation any good"" and questioned the decision's legality. The Alliance Party's John Blair said it was ""not a time for causing further disruption"", adding that his party would consider ""very carefully"" before deciding on any legal challenge. Matthew O'Toole, the SDLP's Brexit spokesperson, said the order was ""outrageous"" and that the public was more concerned with other matters, adding it would ""not command the support of the assembly or the executive"" and would be challenged. However, the move was welcomed by Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister, who said the protocol's implementation was ""never compatible"" with Northern Ireland's position within the UK.

Facebook owner Meta sees biggest ever market loss,"Facebook's owner Meta Platforms saw its stock market value slump by more than $230bn (Â£169bn) on Thursday, in a record daily loss for a US firm. Its shares fell 26.4% after quarterly figures disappointed investors. Meta also said that Facebook's daily active users (DAUs) had dropped for the first time in its 18-year history. The company's share price slide saw chief executive Mark Zuckerberg's net worth fall by $31bn, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. The drop in Mr Zuckerberg's personal fortune was equivalent to the annual gross domestic product of Estonia. Even after that drop, Mr Zuckerberg has an estimated net worth of almost $90bn, which means he is still one of the richest people in the world. That came after Meta revealed that Facebook's DAUs fell to 1.929bn in the three months to the end of December, compared to 1.930bn in the previous quarter. It was the first time ever that this measure of activity on the world's biggest social network had gone into reverse. Meta's stock market slump came on the eve of the 18th anniversary of the founding of Facebook. Facebook sees daily users fall for first time ever Facebook-funded cryptocurrency Diem winds down Meta also warned of slowing revenue growth in the face of competition from rival platforms including TikTok and YouTube, while advertisers were also cutting spending. Mr Zuckerberg said the firm's sales growth had been hurt as audiences, especially younger users, had left for rivals. The firm forecast revenues of between $27bn and $29bn for the first quarter of this year, which was lower than analysts had expected. Although the company has been making investments in video services to compete with TikTok, owned by Chinese technology giant ByteDance, it makes less money from those offerings than its traditional Facebook and Instagram feeds. It's clear that Meta is facing a whirlwind of different problems. Last year Apple brought in its App Tracking Transparency policy. It lets people choose whether or not they want to be tracked around the internet by companies, like Meta, who can then sell that information to advertisers. That is a major problem for Facebook, because finding information out about you and selling it to advertisers is exactly how it makes money. Its quarterly results showed advertising income falling, partly for this reason. Meta's rivals, like TikTok, are also attracting younger audiences. And user growth has stagnated around the world. There are bigger longer term issues too. Meta makes money from advertising. Yet the company's name has been changed to mark a concept - the Metaverse - a thing that doesn't exist yet and won't do for years. Mark Zuckerberg is committed to spending tens of billions of dollars on the project, even though evidence that people actually want to live their lives in virtual reality is scant. It all means many investors are unfriending. Meta, which owns the world's second largest digital advertising platform after Google, also said it had been hit by privacy changes on Apple's operating system. The changes, which make it harder for brands to target and measure their advertising on Facebook and Instagram, could have an impact ""in the order of $10bn"" for this year, the firm said. ""Clearly Meta got more impacted compared to its rivals as other social media like Snap posted healthy results,"" said Sachin Mittal, head of telecom and internet sector research at DBS Bank. ""While there has been a broad negative impact on the whole tech sector, we reckon players with lower reliance on targeted ads or better algorithms to cope with Apple's changes would still do well."" Meta's share price slump also dragged on other social media platforms, including Twitter, Snap and Pinterest during Thursday's regular trading session. However, Snap's shares jumped by almost 60% in after-hours trade as it reported its first ever quarterly profit.

NI Executive parties to meet after Givan resignation,"DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said there was ""now an opportunity for the government and the EU to step up to the mark"" DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has said it will be ""difficult"" for his party to form a government after an election if issues around the NI Protocol are not addressed. He was speaking after Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursday. Ittook effect at midnightand meant Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill of Sinn FÃ©in also lost her post. Mr Donaldson said there was ""now an opportunity for the government and the EU to step up to the mark"". The move by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) was part of their opposition to theNorthern Ireland Protocol, which places a trade border in the Irish Sea. On Wednesday the DUP's agriculture minister, Edwin Poots, ordered officials to halt post-Brexit checks at Northern Ireland's ports on goods arriving from Great Britain. However, that directionhas been suspended by the High Court, pending the outcome of legal challenges. ""I have withdrawn the first minister on the basis that the protocol issues have not been addressed despite clear commitments and promises given by the prime minister that they would be addressed,"" Sir Jeffrey told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""If the protocol issues are not resolved by the time of the election, then of course it is difficult for us to form a government, because of the instability that the protocol creates."" Mr Donaldson said that last week Boris Johnson told him the prospect of an agreement being reached with the EU on the protocol within the next few weeks was ""20 to 30%"". Sinn FÃ©in president Mary Lou McDonald (centre) called for an early election on Thursday Sinn FÃ©in have called for an early election. The party's finance minister described the DUP's decision to resign from the post of first minister as ""cynical and reckless"". Conor Murphy reiterated his party president's call for an early election and said the assembly could sit extra days if parties were willing to get legislation through. ""Let's get the parties together, let's get the legislation completed in the next number of weeks however long that takes to sit in the assembly, let's go to the people and ask them their verdict on what the DUP have done,"" he said. ""We can't sit by and pretend it is business as usual and that things are OK, I think we need to give the people their verdict in all of this."" Givan resignation triggers fresh political crisis In quotes: Reactions to Paul Givan's resignation Taoiseach (Irish PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin said ""no one party should have a veto"" over the future of Stormont. ""I believe that decision is very damaging to politics itself, and to people's trust in politics,"" he added. Conor Burns said the DUP should return Paul Givan to the role of first minister Northern Ireland Office (NIO) minister Conor Burns urged the DUP to return Stormont to a stable government. ""We want Sir Jeffrey to reconsider, to put Paul Givan back in and get it stabilised and up and running again,"" he told BBC News NI. ""We'll spend time now thinking about what happens if that doesn't actually come to pass and we'll make those decisions."" Mr Burns said he did not want to speculate about the NIO's next actions but confirmed the Northern Ireland secretary does have the power to call an early election. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon of the SDLP said her party were ""not going to fall into this trap that the DUP have set where we fall into an early election"". ""It's all about creating this toxic, hostile environment where they can terrify people to the polls by telling them their identity is in crisis,"" she said. ""There are real concerns within loyalism and within unionism, we are listening to that, we want to work through it but this is being manipulated by the DUP and it is shameful,"" she added. Alliance assembly member Andrew Muir said his party was up for an election ""at any time"", but said MLAs were there to do a job and ""they should get it done"". Meanwhile, a virtual meeting of several of the NI Executive party leaders has taken place. The politicians discussed how the assembly and the executive might operate after Mr Givan's resignation. There was some confusion earlier if the meeting would take place after the DUP leader was not originally invited by Sinn FÃ©in. Paul Givan resigned as first minister on Thursday The UUP and Alliance said the DUP should have been invited. It is understood the party whips at Stormont are to meet to discuss how assembly business can be handled in the days ahead. UUP leader Doug Beattie was invited to the meeting but due to other commitments was unable to attend. However, he called on the secretary of state to say if he intended to call an early election ""because if we know when it's coming, we know how we can deal with the legislation"". ""But right now,we simply don't know what to do."","" he added. As the dust settles after Paul Givan's resignation - the parties and pressure groups lobbying for legislation must now assess what can be rescued in the coming days. The difficulty in holding a cross-party meeting is an example of how difficult it is to chart a way forward. Looking ahead there is also much talk about an early election and there is a clear divide. Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP want one, but the Alliance, the SDLP and the UUP say voters should go to the polls as scheduled in May. Some are now asking if full devolution can be restored after an election. Whilst the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says that depends on what happens to the protocol. There are also questions if a DUP MLA would serve as deputy first minster if Sinn FÃ©in take the first minster's role. Not for the first time the long term future of how we are governed is shrouded in doubt. An election for the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently scheduled for May. Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. Northern Ireland's Assembly continues in shadow form, but the executive - effectively Northern Ireland's government - will no longer meet. Paul Givan's political career Michelle O'Neill profile Ministers in charge of departments will be able to stay in post, but they will be limited in terms of what they can do. Ahead of the midnight deadline on Thursday, the outgoing first and deputy first ministers made a number of appointments, includingnaming Ian Jeffers as Northern Ireland's new victims' commissioner, and keeping in place for another three years Brenda King as Northern Ireland's attorney general. There are questions over key pieces oflegislation requiring executive approval, including a multi-year budget and the lifting of Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he would be seeking legal advice on his powers as health minister Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Alex Maskey, assembly speaker, said the Northern Ireland Act 1998 calls for the first and deputy first minister offices to be filled within seven days, by 12:01 on Friday 11 February. Mr Maskey also said he was aware that legislation due to be completed at Westminster next week may leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdraw DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks.

European oil facilities hit by cyber-attacks,"Multiple oil transport and storage companies across Europe are dealing with cyber-attacks. IT systems have been disrupted at Oiltanking in Germany, SEA-Invest in Belgium and Evos in the Netherlands. In total dozens of terminals with oil storage and transport around the world have been affected, with firms reporting that the attacks occurred over the weekend. But experts caution against assuming this is a co-ordinated attack. The BBC understands that all three companies' IT systems went down or were severely disrupted. Belgian prosecutors say they are investigating the cyber-attack that's affected SEA-Invest terminals including the company's largest in Antwerp, called SEA-Tank. A spokeswoman for the company said they were hit on Sunday with every port they run in Europe and Africa affected. The company is working to get a back-up IT system online but says that most liquid transportation is operational. The spokeswoman said SEA-Invest is aware of the cyber-attacks against other companies but investigations have not determined if there is a link. A spokesperson for Evos in the Netherlands told the BBC that IT services at terminals in Terneuzen, Ghent and Malta have ""caused some delays in execution"". On Monday Oiltanking Deutschland GmbH & Co. KG, which stores and transports oil, vehicle fuels and other petroleum products, said it had been hacked. The company was forced to operate at a ""limited capacity"" and was investigating the incident, it said. Some reports suggest the attack on Oiltanking is ransomware, where hackers scramble data and make computer systems inoperable until they get paid a ransom. In May last year a ransomware attack on US oil supplier Colonial Pipeline saw supplies tighten across the US and multiple states declaring an emergency. The Colonial Pipeline in the US was hacked in May 2021 An employee of a major barging company in the Netherlands told the BBC that port supply chains were disrupted. The worker said they first noticed problems on Tuesday when oil deliveries started slowing down. He said ""things are moving but much slower than normal"". Should paying hacker ransoms be banned? The ransomware surge ruining lives US recovers most of Colonial Pipeline ransom The disruption comes as tensions remain high between Ukraine and Russia and as concern over rising energy prices grows. But cyber-security experts caution against jumping to the conclusion that the multiple incidents are the result of a co-ordinated effort to disrupt the European energy sector. ""Some types of malware scoop up emails and contact lists and use them to automatically spam malicious attachments or links, so companies with shared connections can sometimes be hit in quick succession,"" said Brett Callow, Threat Analyst at cyber-security company Emsisoft. ""This is why you sometimes see sector-based or geographic-based clusters of incidents."" Another possible explanation could be that all the companies use the same software for operations that may have been compromised by hackers.

WhatsApp scam costs victims thousands of pounds,"This video can not be played Sarah Capper, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, was targeted by fraudsters last month Victims of a WhatsApp scam have been left thousands of pounds poorer after being tricked into handing over cash. Con artists have been sending texts claiming to be relatives with new numbers, then asking for help with bills or other costs. Many start with: ""Hello mum, I've got a new phone, please save the number."" North Wales Police said victims in Wales had lost an average of almost Â£2,500 each in the UK-wide fraud. WhatsApp said people should request a voice note or call if they received a suspicious message. Sarah Capper, from Rhyl, Denbighshire, was targeted last month and said the messages seemed ""completely genuine"". WhatsApp tweaks privacy policy after record fine YouTube a 'major conduit of online disinformation' She added: ""I got a message which started 'Hi mum', saying their old phone had crashed and could I save this new number. ""We chatted for a while and the scammer was even talking with me about being stressed at work as if they were my daughter."" Fraudsters have been texting victims claiming to be relatives needing financial help She was asked to help pay an invoice as her ""daughter"" did not have mobile banking on her new phone and was promised she would be repaid straight away. When she spoke to her daughter the next day and she had no idea what she was talking about, Ms Capper ""burst into tears"" as she had handed over Â£2,100, including Â£1,800 borrowed from her partner. ""I would have sworn blind that I was talking to my daughter, but it was a complete stranger. It's frightening and very upsetting."" But Ms Capper got lucky as the payment bounced - police think the bank already considered the scammer's account suspicious. Scammers told Ms Capper they had no access to online banking on a new phone Zoe Burrell, from Anglesey, saved a number in her daughter's name after getting a WhatsApp message that said: ""Mumâ¦â¦ this is my new number, you can delete my old number xx."" All the scammer's messages then bore her daughter's name and ""a little thing that makes it seem more genuine,"" Ms Burrell said. ""I've lent my daughter money before, and I've always had it all back. ""She's changed her phone number in the past as well, so it all seemed very legit to begin with."" North Wales Police said many of the victims were women The fraudster claimed Ms Burrell's daughter needed cash quickly so sense went ""out of the window"" and she transferred Â£4,800. The last of Ms Burrell's four transfers did not go through as the bank became suspicious. ""I was devastated,"" Ms Burrell said. ""You just feel like you've been taken for a fool. They're very clever and the personal thing, masquerading as a loved one, it pulls you in."" Both women wanted to speak out to stop others being ripped off. Zoe Burrell transferred Â£4,800 as sense went ""out of the window"" North Wales Police Det Con Rachel Roberts said many victims were women with adult children. Investigators are trying to figure out if the fraudsters research their victims or whether they are using a confidence trick. Det Con Roberts said officers were seeing a new victim every day: ""In just two weeks at the start of January, we saw scammers try to steal Â£24,000 from people in north Wales alone. ""It's a particularly nasty scam because the criminals are often posing as someone's son or daughter. ""WhatsApp is a messenger platform that people use to talk to close friends and family, and people naturally take their children on face value."" She advised people getting requests for cash to consider whether they are genuine, taking time to think about what they are being asked and calling people back on a different number to check it is actually them. Kathryn Harnett, from WhatsApp, said: ""WhatsApp protects our users' personal messages with end-to-end encryption, but we want to remind people that we all have a role to play in keeping our accounts safe by remaining vigilant to the threat of scammers. ""If you receive a suspicious message (even if you think you know who it's from), calling or requesting a voice note is the fastest and simplest way to check someone is who they say they are - a friend in need is a friend worth calling.""

UUP leader Doug Beattie was invited to the meeting but due to other commitments was unable to attend. However, he called on the secretary of state to say if he intended to call an early election ""because if we know when it's coming, we know how we can deal with the legislation"". ""But right now,we simply don't know what to do."","" he added. As the dust settles after Paul Givan's resignation - the parties and pressure groups lobbying for legislation must now assess what can be rescued in the coming days. The difficulty in holding a cross-party meeting is an example of how difficult it is to chart a way forward. Looking ahead there is also much talk about an early election and there is a clear divide. Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP want one, but the Alliance, the SDLP and the UUP say voters should go to the polls as scheduled in May. Some are now asking if full devolution can be restored after an election. Whilst the DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says that depends on what happens to the protocol. There are also questions if a DUP MLA would serve as deputy first minster if Sinn FÃ©in take the first minster's role. Not for the first time the long term future of how we are governed is shrouded in doubt. An election for the Northern Ireland Assembly is currently scheduled for May. Due to Northern Ireland's power-sharing arrangements, the roles of first and deputy first ministers are a joint office shared between the two biggest parties at Stormont. Neither leader can stay in power if the other person resigns. Northern Ireland's Assembly continues in shadow form, but the executive - effectively Northern Ireland's government - will no longer meet. Paul Givan's political career Michelle O'Neill profile Ministers in charge of departments will be able to stay in post, but they will be limited in terms of what they can do. Ahead of the midnight deadline on Thursday, the outgoing first and deputy first ministers made a number of appointments, includingnaming Ian Jeffers as Northern Ireland's new victims' commissioner, and keeping in place for another three years Brenda King as Northern Ireland's attorney general. There are questions over key pieces oflegislation requiring executive approval, including a multi-year budget and the lifting of Northern Ireland's remaining Covid-19 restrictions. Health Minister Robin Swann said he would be seeking legal advice on his powers as health minister Health Minister Robin Swann said he was ""deeply concerned about the consequences"" of Mr Givan's resignation. Mr Swann said he had sought ""urgent legal clarification"" on the possible easing of remaining Covid-19 restrictions, in the absence of the executive. Alex Maskey, assembly speaker, said the Northern Ireland Act 1998 calls for the first and deputy first minister offices to be filled within seven days, by 12:01 on Friday 11 February. Mr Maskey also said he was aware that legislation due to be completed at Westminster next week may leave that situation subject to change, but said he could only deal with the ""legal position which exists now"". The party's current leader,Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has been threatening to withdraw DUP ministers from Stormont for monthsover its opposition to the protocol. Unionists have argued that Northern Ireland's place in the UK is being undermined by the protocol as it is being treated differently from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey first deliveredthe ultimatum in September last year, warning that the DUP may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands were not met. Talks between the EU and the UK government - which is seeking changes to the protocol - have been ongoing for months but have intensified in recent weeks.
