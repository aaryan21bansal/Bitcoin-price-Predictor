It's for the whole of Africa. This is so great. ""I am very proud for opening my doors and now the world can see me."" Adam BoothFormer trainer of David Haye on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra Indongo held it together, maintained his discipline and as far as I'm concerned he's a worthy world champion. And there you have it. Julius Indongo has unified the super-lightweight division. Well deserved. A superb performance. Burns v Indongo The smile on the face of Julius Indongo tells you he's confident of taking this one. The southpaw looks to have held on to his undefeated record. A scintillating performance. Ricky Burns claps the crowd. They love him, win or lose. But it's the red corner of the Namibian celebrating in Glasgow. Burns v Indongo Ricky Burns is throwing everything into this but he looks shattered.Â Julius Indongo barely seems to have tired. He continues to burrow forward and looks for the body of Burns as he has all night. Indongo skips out of the way of a late, desperate flurry from Burns. But that's it. Burns v Indongo Ricky Burns is smiling. But he could be a beaten man. Burns hits the canvas again as he dives in and Julius Indongo just ducks out and helps the Scot's momentum take him down. He's straight back on his feet. But it's the calm, composed figure of Indongo who's on top here. Burns v Indongo Adam BoothFormer trainer of David Haye on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra Julius Indongo is showing he is a genuine world champion. He is so far ahead and he still wants to get rid of Ricky Burns. This last round is going to be dangerous for Burns. The atmosphere in the crowd has been finished by Indongo. Burns v Indongo One last big effort from Ricky Burns.Â He saunters forward with a left-right combination but finds Julius Indongo too quick to catch. Burns then absorbs a left-hander from Indongo himself. Indongo has the height, the reach. Burns has the crowd, but he needs something more than that right now. He goes down onto the mat, that was via a wild swing rather than an Indongo punch. Burns v Indongo Mike CostelloBBC boxing correspondent, ringside at the SSE Hydro Arena Julius Indongo is about to upset the odds unless Ricky Burns produces something we have never seen. Burns v Indongo Six minutes to go. Julius Indongo has peppered the body of Ricky Burns all night, but he catches a counter punch from Burns on his way in. But Indongo gets Burns on the ropes, works the body and doesn't look like tiring here. Burns v Indongo Adam BoothFormer trainer of David Haye on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra This fight has become very repetitive - every round is identical. The brief moments of success Ricky Burns has had are when Julius Indongo has let him off first. Indongo is leading and coming back with one or two more shots. He's winning almost every round. Burns needs Indongo to tire. Burns v Indongo You have to say Julius Indongo has looked good tonight. Ricky Burns is trying everything he can to find a way round the awkward southpaw, but it's Indongo with the lead and he's the one who can afford to take a step back if he needs to. Indongo goes low again, looking for the body. Burns sidesteps his way along the edge of the ring, then finds the middle ground. But he can't land anything on Indongo. Burns v Indongo Mike CostelloBBC boxing correspondent, ringside at the SSE Hydro Arena Ricky Burns is known for his terrific stamina - but even he is tiring. He needs to throw more punches. Burns v Indongo We're into the 10th. Ricky Burns is bouncing, but it's Julius Indongo who flicks jab after jab towards the Scot. Burns finds a counter jab, and it might have cut the lip of Indongo. Is that a way in? Burns v Indongo Adam BoothFormer trainer of David Haye on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra I have to give that round to Indongo again. Indongo is taller with longer arms so Ricky Burns is trying to close the distance but he is leaving his head at same height. His lack of head movement is making it difficult for him to close the distance. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Two brilliant games. Okay, one decent game and another that didn't pipe up until late into the second half. We've seen dent to the hopes of Ospreys' play-off ambitions and Scarlets seize victory against struggling Newport Gwent Dragons who have now lost 10 straight games. In the mean time, enjoy your Saturday night and thank you for joining us. Newport Gwent Dragons 16-21 Scarletys Too little too late for the Dragons but they do score a late
consolation try through wingAdam Hugheswith Angus OâBrien converting to give
Kingsley Jonesâ men a losing bonus point. Dragons flanker Ollie Griffiths man-of-the-match as he does
his cause no harm for a Wales summer touring squad spot. The Scarlets go above the Ospreys to third in the Pro 12
table. A forgettable game. Newport Gwent Dragons 16-21 Scarlets  Newport Gwent Dragons 9-21 Scarlets Dafydd PritchardBBC Sport Wales at the Principality Stadium Moments of quality were a long time coming in this match, but the Scarlets' international class has eventually made the difference. After centre Jonathan Davies crossed for the opening try, a touchdown in the opposite corner from his Wales team-mate Liam Williams has made the game safe for the Scarlets. Newport Gwent Dragons 9-21 Scarlets The Scarlets have wrapped up the game with Liam Williams
enjoying a successful second-half. He powered over for the second try although his conversion
this time hits the post. Crunching collision as a tackle from Scarlets number eight
John Barclay injures Dorian Jones. Replacement outside-half Jones has to go off the field to be
replaced by Jack Dixon but Barclay stays on. Newport Gwent Dragons 9-16 Scarlets This video can not be played Scarlets' Jonathan Davies scores try against Dragons And here's the try that gave Scarlets some breathing room against the Dragons. Newport Gwent Dragons 9-16 Scarlets Bit-part kicker Liam Williams proving more than handy with
the boot as he slots over a penalty to restore the seven point advantage. Newport Gwent Dragons 9-13 Scarlets Newport Gwent Dragons bring on Dorian Jones with Angus OâBrien moving
to full-back. The Dragons reduce the deficit with OâBrienâs third penalty after
the Scarlets are penalised. This underwhelming match has not been decided yet. At last some class from Wales and Scarlets centreJonathan
Davies. He produces a searing break before passing to replacement scrum-half
Jonathan Evans. Dragons wing Adam Hughes is guilty of blatantly killing the
ball and yellow carded by referee Nigel Owens. Scarlets pressure continues and Jonathan Davies strolls over
for a try. Liam Williams kicks the conversion off the post. Newport Gwent Dragons 6-13 Scarlets  Illtud DafyddBBC Radio Cymru Hadleigh Parkes comes on
for Dan Jones. Parkes has played more
minutes than anyone else in the Pro12 this season. None of those minutes as
a fly-half, where he's playing at the moment for the Scarlets. Whilst you're here, who
will kick for goal for the visitors? Parkes has not successfully kicked a
penalty or conversion for the visitors. Stay tuned to find out! No recognised kicker in Scarlets side now and it shows. Liam
Williams steps up and kicks the ball dead from a penalty while attempting to
reach the corner. Sums up how poor this game as been. Outside-half Dan Jones has been replaced by a centre in
Hadleigh Parkes. Walked off the field and didnât look injured. Intriguing
change if tactical. Wales scrum-half Gareth Davies also taken off with former Newport Gwent Dragons number nine Jonathan Evans coming on. All change for Scarlets at half-back. Newport Gwent Dragons 6-6 Scarlets Dafydd PritchardBBC Sport Wales at the Principality Stadium With no entertainment on the pitch, Scarlets seem to be trying to create some by bringing on Hadleigh Parkes - a centre or wing by trade - at fly-half, replacing Dan Jones. An unexpected switch from the Scarlets. Maybe it will bring this stale encounter to life. Newport Gwent Dragons 6-6 Scarlets A thumping tackle from impressive Dragons flanker Ollie
Griffiths on Scarlets prop Rob Evans proves to no avail as the Dragons are
penalised. Dan Jones slots over his second penalty to tie things up. Adam Warren has been forced off the field and replaced by
Tom Prydie who is set to join the Scarlets next season. Scarlets are dominant at the scrum and a penalty earned
there almost provides the platform for their opening try. Dan Jones kicks to the corner for an attacking line-out but
despite the wave of Scarlets attack the Dragons defence holds firm. And the Scarlets get us under way in the second half. HT: Newport Gwent Dragons 6-3 Scarlets Illtud DafyddBBC Radio Cymru RUGBY STAT NERD KLAXON When was the last time

French election: Getting the estate to vote,"This video can not be played Meet the teenagers from Citizen Challenge. Votes have no colour, religion or class, so why so few election posters in multi-ethnic La Busserine? About 3,000 people (nobody seems to know for sure) are packed into this 1960s housing estate in northern Marseille and they have some serious issues. Think ""ghetto"" and you are on the right track. La Busserine is in the 14th Arrondissement, a district which made national headlines in 2014 when, together with the neighbouring 13th, it elected the city's first (sector-level) mayor from the far right National Front (more on that later). Yet over two days, the only traces I found of this month's presidential election were a few posters for radical leftist Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon. But one group of first-time voters do not need posters because they have smartphones and can telltheir Macron from their Hamonby actually reading their manifestos. These daughters and sons of Comorans, Moroccans and other immigrants want to reconnect their neighbours to politics. Oh and they are looking for a party of the other kind too. Fifty areas in 34 towns and cities across France are competing to see who can reduce electoral abstention the most. Citizen Challenge,external(in French) was launched in the deprived Strasbourg suburb of Neuhof after 80% of voters there stayed away from the first round of regional elections in December 2015.

He and his team are negotiating with public bodies and bands to come up with the prize: a concert in the winning area. French election: Everything you need to know Strasbourg's grassroots campaign Elections come and go but on the estate, a place full of children, people have been sinking under the same issues for years. One issue comes around ten o'clock in the morning as the spotters emerge into the sun to watch over the estate's notorious hashish trade. Another emerges after dark when therÃ©seaux(drug gangs) settle scores, sometimes with akalash(Kalashnikov). And morning, noon and night, the issues of unemployment and poverty hang over this community living 8km (five miles) from the luxury boutiques and restaurants of Marseille's Vieux Port (city centre). Discrimination is also a live issue for the numerous Muslims here. Some 200,000 live in Marseille (population 855,393 as of 2013), according to French media. ""Muslims here are like disabled people,"" says a local shipyard worker of Algerian ancestry who does not want to be named. Bullet holes at an abandoned flat on the Flamants estate, adjacent to La Busserine ""If your name is Mohamed it's like you're missing an arm or a foot or a face. We're given all the hard work, the dirtiest work, the worst jobs."" ""It's called a challenge because it's not easy,"" says French radio correspondentStephane Burgatt,external, who followed the group around the flats of La Busserine in December. ""It's the kind of place where most people don't care about politics and don't know for whom to vote."" A Citizen Challenge event in La Busserine last month brought in people from across Marseille First-time voters Amal Osman, 18, Mohamed Abdallah, 19, and Sarah Mmadi, 18, are among a couple of dozen activists who went door to door persuading people to register to vote. Today, equipped with props like a mock polling station, they focus on reminding voters in La Busserine (70% abstention at the regional elections) to actually use their ballots. The bright side of France's migrant suburbs The 14th, a working-class district, traditionally voted Communist or Socialist but in 2014 voters swung to the far right. Most of the Front's support came from outside the housing estates, among white voters. However it is clear that some Muslims also voted for Stephane Ravier as their mayor despite his party'shard line on Islam and mass immigration, says Richard Ghevontian, a politics expert atAix Marseille University,external. Professor Ghevontian says uncertainty over the election's outcome is unprecedented ""[Socialist President Francois] Hollande's policies disappointed many and Marriage For Everyone [the Socialists' same-sex marriage act of 2013, opposed by the National Front] greatly shocked Muslims, who are extremely conservative on social matters,"" he says, citing opinion surveys. ""It was a vote to punish Hollande,"" says a teacher in La Busserine, who does not want to be identified. The shipyard worker, like nearly every voter I spoke to on the estate, is voting for Mr MÃ©lenchon. ""He tells the truth and a vote for him is a vote for peace with Muslims,"" he explains. And three years under Mayor Ravier? ""He does nothing for us but he leaves us alone,"" he says with a shrug. Who are the candidates? France was once a model for voter turnout in the EU, says Professor Ghevontian, but in this election there is a real concern that abstention may rise. If election campaigners do not go into places like La Busserine, it is because they have become no-go areas even for the police, he says. Marseille is France's second-biggest city Yet the first-time voters keep up their campaign, encouraged by growing publicity for their cause and, crucially, the 100 or so people who registered to vote after talking to them. ""Citizen Challenge is good for the young because it gets them active and gives them a bit more value as human beings and citizens,"" says the teacher, ""but our politicians live on another planet and they need to come back down to Earth."" Patrick Housseini runs the estate's football team, AS Busserine Will La Busserine win the concert?

Care home fees: Can you avoid them?,"Care from the NHS is free, but if you need social care because you're physically or mentally frail, you have to pay for it yourself. And it is not cheap. The latest figures show a place in a residential care home in the UK costs, on average, more than Â£30,000 a year. A nursing home costs more than Â£40,000 a year. In the South East, it is Â£10,000 a year more than that, according to consultants LaingBuisson. There is financial help from local authorities, but it is strictly means-tested. You only qualify if your home, savings and investments are together worth less than Â£23,250. If you are worth more than that, you have to pay the full cost of your care - during your lifetime and, if necessary, from your estate after you have died. It may not leave much for your family to inherit. Which is why marketing leaflets from a will-writing firm called Universal Wealth Preservation are eye-catching. One of the leaflets issued by Universal Wealth Preservation The leaflet claims that 45,000 families are forced to sell their homes every year, to pay for care. In 2015, one of Universal's leaflets dropped through the letterbox of retired teachers Susan and Don Steer. Don had just been diagnosed with a terminal cancer. Since the Steers owned their home near Hull outright, and had savings as well, they would not qualify for council support. ""Don thought that if he had to go into a care home or nursing home that we would have to pay and we could lose the house,"" Susan recalls. ""Universal said they could protect the house from care home fees, and he thought that would be a good thing to do."" So, after a home consultation with a Universal representative, the Steers signed up, paying Universal a fee of almost Â£4,000. Susan Steer says she was told she wouldn't need to sell her house Universal's scheme works by transferring the ownership of assets like a home or savings into what it calls a ""Wealth Preservation Trust"". Trusts are legal devices designed to hold assets on behalf of named beneficiaries - often children. With a trust owning the assets, the theory is those assets will no longer be counted in the means test. That should make it more likely that the individual will qualify for local authority help. But there's a big catch. According to Bridgette Shilton, chair of the National Association of Financial Assessment Officers, if avoiding care fees is a substantial motive for putting assets into a trust, then a local authority can challenge it  as ""deliberate deprivation"". ""If people are trying to protect their house in the avoidance of care fees then that's not allowed; that is a clear deprivation of assets. It doesn't work,"" Ms Shilton says. ""As soon as we find out a property has been transferred we will be looking into the motivation, we will be asking questions."" If trusts are genuinely set up for reasons other than avoiding care fees, Mary Butler, the senior partner of solicitors Bell Buxton, says they may succeed in avoiding care fees as well. ""I'm not saying that these products would not in certain circumstances work, if you were seeking to part with ownership of a property when you're fit and healthy, when there's no prospect whatever that you're going to go into a home."" But with the financial squeeze on local authorities growing, Mary Butler says, it's getting harder to slip such trusts under the radar. ""We've got a social care crisis on our hands now, a local authority funding crisis, so they're using every possible means to get money in. The people who are looking at these forms are wise to the stunts that people pull."" Don Steer died last year. He never did pay care fees because his treatment was covered by the NHS. Universal says its representative wasn't told the Steers' main goal was protecting the family home from care fees. It says it wasn't told that Don's cancer was terminal and would have provided different advice if it had been. Surprisingly, while care fee protection is prominent on Universal's marketing fliers, the company told the BBC: ""We deny that we offer strategies to avoid paying care fees."" We wanted to explore what lies behind this apparent contradiction, but Universal did not take up the BBC's offer of an interview. Potential customers might therefore be wise to ask searching questions of their own, or to take advice from a solicitor before signing up. Universal is one of a number of firms offering such services. Almost all are unregulated, so customers have nowhere to complain if things go wrong. In 2013, Chris Grayling, then Lord Chancellor, turned down a recommendation from the legal industry and consumer groups that will-writing should be regulated. And the government has delayed the introduction of a Â£72,000 cap on the amount anyone has to pay towards their care. Originally scheduled for April last year, it's now postponed to April 2020. Economist Andrew Dilnot, the chair of the commission that first proposed the care fee cap in 2011, says a cap would remove the fear generated by a means test he describes as the ""most pernicious"" in Britain. He says a Â£72,000 cap would also reduce the incentive for people to try to avoid paying them altogether. ""If we could get the cap in place, the worst case is that you'd be liable up to the cap. So you're taking away the catastrophic element and I think then the avoidance industry would find things much tougher."" Removal of the fear of the financial catastrophe would also reduce the moral dilemma care fees now pose for people like Susan Steer. ""I'm torn about what I feel,"" she says. ""I don't like the rule about having to sell to pay for care home fees. On the other hand,  I've got socialist views so it sounds ludicrous, but it's human nature to not want to sell the house.""

"The rise of left-wing, anti-Trump fake news","Since the US election presidential race, fact checking websites report what seems like an increase in anti-Trump, 'liberal fake news'. The fact-checking siteSnopes,externaltoldBBC Trending radiothat in the past week, for example, they have debunked many more anti-Republican party stories than pro-Republican ones. One example of an incorrect story is the unflattering, digitally-manipulated image, which suggested that US President Donald Trump had diarrhoea during a recent golf outing. It's hard to gather definitive data on the political bias in fake news stories, so the evidence for a rise in 'liberal fake news' is essentially anecdotal. But a recent study did effectively debunk the stereotype that fake news tends to be shared more by uneducated people or those with right-leaning politics, as compared to other groups. ""It [fake news] affects both the right and the left. It affects educated and uneducated. So the stereotypes of it being simply right-wing and simply uneducated are 100% not true,"" says Jeff Green, who is the CEO of Trade Desk, an internet advertising company that was recently commissioned by American TV channel CBS to investigate who is reading and sharing fake news online. His company did this by initially putting out two fake news stories - one from the left which falsely stated police had raided a protestors camp at Standing Rock and burnt it down, and the other from a right-wing website about false claims there was a congressional plot to oust Donald Trump. A left-wing fake story falsely claimed police had raided a protestors camp at Standing Rock and burnt it down By using specialist software, the company's researchers then followed readers' online behaviour to get an idea of who and where they were. ""On the left if you're consuming fake news you're 34 times more likely than the general population to be a college graduate,"" says Green. If you're on the right, he says, you're 18 times more likely than the general population to to be in the top 20 percent of income earners. And the study revealed another disturbing trend: the more you consume fake news, the more likely you are to vote.  It's ""fascinating and frightening at the same time,"" says Green. One of the reasons for the growth in liberal fake news is financial. ""Those people who generate this kind of fake news don't care about politics. They just care about generating clicks, and so sometimes they generate similar messages for the right and the left,"" says Filippo Menczer, a professor of Informatics and Computer Science at Indiana University who runs the fake news tracking site Hoaxy. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external As for where the market for liberal fake news comes from, according to Claire Wardle, who is a research director at First Draft - a non-profit organisation which is looking for solutions around trust and truth in the digital age - the appetite stems from so-called confirmation bias. ""People like to share information that makes them feel good, "" she says. ""Many people on the left right now are feeling overwhelmed and fearful and unsure of what's going to happen next. While they're scrolling through their information feeds at speed on small mobile phones their critical functions are not kicking in, and they're seeing information that makes them feel immediately connected with other people who think similarly to them. And without doing the usual checks that they would do, they're sharing and very quickly passing on similarly false and problematic content that we were seeing before the election."" ""Check your sources,"" says Brooke Binkowski from fact-checking site Snopes Brooke Binkowski, who is managing editor at Snopes website, warns newsreaders to stay aware of the emotions they feel when consuming content. ""If you are a newsreader or someone who likes reading news but you don't know immediately what may or may not be fake, ask yourself by reading the headline, what emotions do I feel? Am I really angry, scared, frustrated, do I want to share this to tell everybody what's going on? If the answer to any of these questions is yes, then check your sources."" Correction 17 April 2017: A reference to Snopes finding that suggestions President Trump profited from the US missile strikes in Syria were false has been removed from this story. It found the claims unproven. You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter@BBCtrending,external, and find us onFacebook,external.  All our stories are atbbc.com/trending.

"Tale of two mothers: One deported, one not","Immigrants take part in a workshop called ""Me Preparo"" to plan what happens to their US-born children if they are deported Under Donald Trump's new immigration order, even undocumented immigrants with similar circumstances can have opposite outcomes. Under an Obama administration policy, some undocumented immigrants without criminal records and established families and careers in the US were given a temporary reprieve from deportation. In February, the Trump administration issued new enforcement memos that made virtually anyone residing in the US illegally a priority for removal, removing such considerations. The new policy leaves the decision who to deport to deportation agents and encourages a ""case-by-case"" evaluation. Such individual discretion can spur dramatically different results for immigrants with otherwise remarkably similar circumstances. This week, we looked two cases that illustrate this effect, as well as some of the others making news for facing deportation. Veronica Castro, 38 Order of supervision extended: 4 April 2017 Ms Castro, who was born in Mexico and lives in Lothian, Maryland, is the wife of an Army veteran. She has four children, including a disabled son, who are all US citizens. She also has a 20-year-old removal order that places her on uncertain ground with immigration officials. Under the Obama administration, Ms Castro had been attending regular meetings with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) since 2011 and even had a legal work permit. When the Trump administration said that it would prioritise deporting anyone with a final order for removal, Ms Castro and her family dreaded their next appointment with immigration officials. Despite her fears, Ms Castro decided to go to her appointment, hoping that the agency would allow her to stay with her family because she had no criminal record. On 4 April, Ice granted Ms Castro a ""non-detained order of supervision"" which means she is required to report her status to immigration officials, said an Ice spokesperson. Because of this agreement, she will be able to stay in the US for at least one more year until her next check-in with Ice. Ms Castro's continued order of supervision ""doesn't mean someone else in her exact same situation would be granted another year,"" Joshua Doherty, Ms Castro's lawyer says. Maribel Trujillo-Diaz, 42 Detained: 5 April 2017 Maribel Trujillo-Diaz's case mirrors Ms Castro's in many ways. She is also a mother to four US citizens living near Cincinnati, Ohio. Under the Obama administration, she too had been attending regular meetings with Ice for several years and had been allowed to stay in the US with her family. With no criminal record, Ms Trujillo-Diaz also obtained a legal work permit through US Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Ms Trujillo-Diaz came to the US in 2002, but she first encountered Ice agents during a workplace raid of the Koch Foods factory where she was working in 2007, before she had her work permit. She pursued an asylum hearing, as she had fled Mexico after gang members began targeting her family because her brother refused to join the gang, according to her lawyer, Emily Brown. Ms Trujillo-Diaz's application for asylum was rejected, as was her appeal. Despite a final order of removal issued in 2014, immigration officials had allowed Ms Trujillo-Diaz to live in the US with the understanding that she would check in with Ice once a year. At her first check in since the Trump administration issued its new enforcement priorities, Ice agents told Ms Trujillo-Diaz to prepare for deportation proceedings. She returned for a second check in on 3 April, and again Ice agents told her to be ready to be removed from the US. Two days later, Ice officers arrested her as she was leaving for work. Ms Trujillo-Diaz is now in a detention centre in Louisiana, and a request for a stay in her case has been denied. Ice has scheduled her deportation for 19 April, Ms Brown said. Some of the reasons undocumented immigrants were not deported under Obama administration policy: having an American citizen child being married to a veteran being the caretaker for a disabled family member a longstanding presence in the US and history of co-operating with immigration enforcement officials Tichelman at a court hearing in 2015 Alix Tichelman, 29 Order of Removal:6 April 2017 Ms Tichelman, a Canadian national, faces deportation after serving a two-year sentence in the Santa Clara County Jail in California. In 2014, while on board a yacht after being hired as a prostitute, Ms Tichelman injected a 51-year-old Google executive with heroin, causing the man to accidentally overdose and die. She was convicted of felony involuntary manslaughter. A judge determined that Ms Tichelman's crimes made her ineligible to remain in the US legally and issued an order for her removal on 6 April. She will remain in Ice custody until arrangements for her deportation are finalised, an Ice spokesperson said. Abdi Ali, 28 Detained:6 April, 2017 Mr Ali, a resident of Portland, fled Somalia in 1996 as a seven year old. A year later, he had gained permanent legal status in the US. According to Ice officials, Mr Ali has an ""extensive criminal record"" that includes two convictions for misdemeanour assault. None of his criminal charges have been for felonies. Ice agents arrested Mr Ali while he was visiting a country courthouse to plead not guilty to a drink-driving charge. The arrest inside the courthouse caused backlash from local immigration lawyers and advocates who worry that such arrests will discourage immigrants from seeking legal help. Mr Ali remains in Ice custody in the Strafford County Correction facility in New Hampshire. ""I've been here my whole life, and they [are] kicking me out for this one charge,"" Mr Ali toldthe Bangor Daily News,external. ""If I go back to my country, they're going to pretty much kill me. I don't know [anything] about my country. I'm American. I consider myself American."" Beristain, in blue, has been in the US for 20 years Roberto Beristain, 43 Deported: 4 April, 2017 Mr Beristain, whose wife voted for Donald Trump, was deported on 4 Aprilafter his family and community in Indianafought to keep him in the US. The restaurant owner and father was removed from the US and dropped off in JuÃ¡rez, Mexico last week, after living in the US for nearly 20 years. He can apply to have the 10-year ban on entering the US after a deportation waived and try to gain legal residency, but the outcome of such a petition is uncertain.

Delivering famine lifelines from the sky,"Planes drop aid sacks into famine-hit areas of South Sudan In the dusty, baking emptiness of Leer in South Sudan, bags of British food aid fall from the sky to relieve the hunger below. It is here in the north of the country that the United Nations has declared a famine. It is here that the fighting between government and rebel forces has driven so many into hunger and homelessness. And it is here that UK aid is being carefully targeted from the air. To watch these bags of cereal and pulses and food substitutes pour from the bellies of ageing Russian transport planes that have been hired by the aid agencies is to witness an absolute good. For without it, more people in this war-ravaged, hunger-stricken country in central Africa would starve to death. I watched the Ilyushin planes lumber slowly into view alongside Priti Patel, the International Development Secretary, who had travelled many hours to see what impact the money she had authorised was having on the ground. Despite the controversy over her Â£13bn aid budget, Ms Patel insisted that Britain's humanitarian spending gave it influence in the world. UK International Development Secretary Priti Patel inspects aid sacks that have been dropped by plane First the planes practise a low pass over the drop zone, marked by a large white cross. They make another wide circuit to let nearby villages know an aid delivery is on its way. And then, at around 300 metres above the ground, they begin to drop their cargoes. Each plane can carry about 30 metric tonnes of aid, about 600 sacks. They make three passes, dropping 200 sacks each time. These are not parachute-born crates, just individual bags hurtling towards the ground. Like some dreadful game of pass-the-parcel, each sack is bagged seven times to stop it exploding on impact. South Sudan: World's first famine since 2011 Why are there still famines? What is a famine? South Sudan ravaged by ethnic cleansing - UN To watch this, to see the gleam of hope in the eyes of those waiting below, is a moving experience. For many of them, without this aid, they would be forced to live off what nuts, leaves and water lilies they can forage, none of which provides adequate nutrition. ""UK aid is providing a much-needed lifeline to people who have been persecuted, driven off their homes, forced to flee,"" Ms Patel told me. ""The aid that we are providing right now is the difference between life and death."" Yet the problem is this. Each plane contains food enough for only 2,000 people a month. The cost of the planes is astronomic and there are only seven in the region that the World Food Programme can operate. There is a scarcity of available food aid because there are so many other droughts in the region. Each drop has to be negotiated with local community leaders and armed groups, whose permission is needed to ensure that any fighting is put on hold. The hungry will come only if they feel safe. Any food drop in a government-held area has to be matched by one in territory held by the rebels The distribution centre on the ground - a temporary, pop-up affair - can exist only for a few days before the security risks become again too great. Any food drop in a government-held area has to be matched by one in territory held by the rebels. The amount of aid has to be roughly equal in size to avoid accusations that the aid agencies are taking sides. This video can not be played A history of South Sudan in 105 seconds In other words, this aid that falls from the sky may help people who are the hardest to reach in a severe humanitarian crisis. But it is expensive, complicated and, as aid workers repeatedly told me, not nearly enough. There are three road corridors into South Sudan along which aid can travel by truck. And this can be more efficient. One truck alone can carry as much as a Russian transport plane. Yet trucks have deal with checkpoints, fighting and simple banditry. And soon they will lose the roads when the rains come and render much of the country impassable. So there is, aid workers say, a race against time to build up aid dumps before the weather closes in. Such is the reality of delivering British and other aid in the north. To the south, in the capital, Juba, the UK is funding much of South Sudan's only children's hospital - its medicines, its water tanks, its solar panels. Here doctors are seeing rising numbers of children with acute malnutrition. And inevitably they need more resources, above all more space. Children in South Sudan are suffering from acute malnutrition On the day we visited, in one ward alone, there were 43 children sharing 21 beds. I spoke to Rhoda, a 50-year-old woman who had brought in her granddaughter 10 days previously. Cecilia, only 18 months old, arrived severely malnourished. Her mother had died and Rhoda had no milk to feed her. But, she told me, Cecilia's fever and diarrhoea had abated after a few days of milk and porridge. Further south, the problem is one of refugees. More than a million South Sudanese have fled the country to escape the fighting. We travelled to northern Uganda where on average 2,000 people are pouring over the border each day. Last week there was one 24-hour period when no fewer than 7,000 refugees came across. Bidibidi refugee camp, across the border in Uganda, has quickly grown into the world's largest Uganda - unusually - welcomes refugees and gives them a plot of land with shelter and access to services. Here millions of pounds of UK aid is being spent to provide some of the basic infrastructure. Yet here again the scale of the crisis outweighs the humanitarian response. Last August there was next to nothing at the main refugee settlement at Bidibidi. Now, it is the largest such settlement in the world, home to more than 270,000 people. Clearly, the scale of the humanitarian challenge is huge and growing. But the aid agencies report that the United Nation emergency response for South Sudan is hugely underfunded, with some international donors showing reluctance to stump up the cash.

N Korea celebrates leader amid tensions,"The North Korean capital is gearing up for celebrations This week Pyongyang is a city in a frenzy of preparation. At times the crowds of people thronging the sidewalks have turned the streets into a blaze of colour - the women, vivid explosions of rainbow hues in their traditional Korean dresses, and the men, although black or grey suited, carrying large artificial pink and red flowers. These plastic, pom-pom like azaleas are used for waving in the ritualised adulation of their leader for which they are now so busy rehearsing. Some sit in large groups waiting for instructions, others walk purposefully to or from the parade ground, chatting or laughing together along the streets of a capital city that is still largely devoid of traffic. Antiquated army trucks with open tops trundle into town, in convoys dozens long, each packed with soldiers in uniform. There's a relaxed, holiday feel: the female conscripts, separated in their own trucks, smiling and waving at passers-by, the male troops singing merrily in unison. It gives this city the air of a giant film set for a war-time period costume drama. But in the world's last truly totalitarian state, this is the reality. State media released pictures this week showing North Korean leader Kim Jong-un inspecting troops Mass mobilisation is the defining essence of social and political life and there is no more important occasion for the expression of absolute fealty to the leader than The Day of the Sun. Saturday marks the 105th anniversary of the birth of North Korea's long-dead founding president Kim Il-sung, although according to the country's constitution he remains formally in office. The celebrations this year have taken on an added sense of symbolic meaning as they take place amid one of the periodic peaks in the tension that has so often defined the country's relationship with the outside world. This video can not be played People on the Pyongyang subway reveal how they feel about the country's nuclear tests This isolated regime has shown a skilful knack of posting itself into the priority inbox of every US president who has come to office in recent years. This time is no different, with an underground nuclear test shortly before the election, followed by a flurry of ballistic missile tests during the first few weeks of Mr Trump's presidency. North Korea launched a missile into the Sea of Japan last week, according to South Korean reports And like other presidents before him, Mr Trump appears to be exploring whether - instead of the failed diplomacy, debate and delay - a more direct, dramatic option might be available. Whether he will, like others, finish his term having eventually decided that there is no realistic alternative remains to be seen. But the fact that no US administration has yet been able to find a way to rein in North Korea's nuclear ambitions is a measure of the remarkable success of its game of brinkmanship with the outside world. It is a classic study in military deterrence. The regime's most powerful weapon has long been its conventional artillery. Placed close to the border, it could cause significant damage and large loss of life in the South Korean capital within a matter of minutes. How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? North Korea country profile Fanfare in Pyongyang over new business development For the government in Seoul it makes not just any offensive military option unthinkable, but complicates even defensive calculation. In 2010, following an audacious and unprovoked torpedo attack on the South Korean warship the Cheonan - claiming the lives of 46 sailors and widely believed by the international community to have been carried out by the North - the South sat on its hands. A few months later there was also no retaliation when North Korea shelled a South Korean island, hitting both military and civilian targets. It is proof that the North has calculated all too well the costs of military engagement for its democratic, populous and economically vibrant neighbour. The attack on the South Korean naval vessel Cheonan killed 46 South Korean sailors Employing exactly the same logic, Pyongyang has been edging ever closer to possessing a deliverable nuclear arsenal with the aim of forcing its foes further afield into the same strategic bind. The one thing that keeps the North Korean leadership awake at night is the thought of the B52 bombers stationed on the Pacific island of Guam. And they have learned a very particular lesson from the US-led efforts to bring about regime change elsewhere in the world. Iraq didn't have nuclear weapons and Libya had given its up. Unless North Korea can be given the kind of guarantees that would make it feel secure enough - which seems unlikely in the short term - then any effort to negotiate away its nuclear programme is bound to fail. So for now, the world is left with two stark choices. Women dressed in traditional outfits attended the opening ceremony of a housing development on Thursday Accept North Korea as a member of the nuclear-armed club, or try to force it to disarm, either through ever tougher sanctions or the incalculably risky option of military action. As President Trump weighs these options, North Koreans are preparing to march, dance and sing to the glory of the country's ruling family this weekend. And there is speculation that another nuclear test could be a matter of just days away. Kim Jong-un opens new street.

How many bombs has the UK dropped in 2017?,"The UK has been bombing so-called Islamic State targets in Iraq since 2014 and in Syria since the year after. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) does not release statistics on the number of bombs dropped, but does release weeklyupdates,externalof operations in the region. BBC analysis shows UK forces have dropped bombs on 69 of the 99 days of 2017 to 9 April. In that time, at least 216 bombs and missiles have been dropped by the Royal Air Force. The total number is likely to be higher as MoD updates sometimes do not specify the number of bombs or missiles used in a strike. Where the number was not known, the BBC presumed one bomb was dropped. The most commonly used weapon is the Paveway IV precision guided bomb. At least 129 have been used against IS targets by the RAF this year. Through Operation Shader, the RAF is supporting Iraqi ground forces as part of a US-led international coalition. The current focus of the battle against IS, which the MoD calls Daesh, has been for control of Mosul. It has been held by IS militants since 2014 and is the jihadist group's last major urban stronghold in Iraq. An MoD update from 6 April details a strike against a ""Daesh motor team"" in north-western Mosul, where a Brimstone missile was used to destroy the target. Islamic State and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Iraqi security forces hold defensive line in Mosul The RAF flight then tracked a truck ""carrying a terrorist team who had been planting booby traps"" before scoring another ""direct hit"" on the moving vehicle. Meanwhile in Syria, RAF Typhoons have been supporting the Syrian Democratic Forces. This video can not be played The building was destroyed by a direct hit from a Paveway IV The Ministry of Defence published footage on 18 March of RAF Tornados destroying a building in Syria. At the time, the MoD said: ""A Daesh headquarters was identified at a small building five miles east of Raqqa, this was destroyed by a direct hit from a Paveway IV released by a Tornado flight."" This strike came shortly after theUS sent 400 Marines to Syriato support allied local forces in their assault on the IS stronghold of Raqqa. A brimstone missile on a Royal Air Force Tornado GR4 The Paveway IV is a precision laser-guided bomb known for its accuracy and relatively low cost, with each costing Â£22,000 Dual-mode Brimstone missiles - which cost more than Â£100,000 - are 1.8m long and are rocket-propelled. They are often used against moving vehicles and multiple targets The Hellfire is an air-to-ground missile carried by unmanned aircraft and used in precision strikes Exact numbers of casualties from the conflict with IS are not available. The RAF says it takes all steps to minimise civilian casualties. The UK parliamentbacked British participationin air strikes against IS in Iraq back in September 2014. Just over a year later in 2015, MPsauthorised air strikesagainst IS in Syria. The UK has conducted more than 1,200 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria since it became involved - more than any other coalition country bar the United States. In 2016 alone, the US dropped 12,192 bombs in Syria and 12,095 in Iraq, according to the American think tank Council on Foreign Relations. The UK is part of the Global Coalition, a body of 68 partners from across Europe, the Middle East, Asia, Africa and the Americas which has committed to defeating IS using military action among other tactics.

What does all this bombing tell us about Trump?,"The mountains targeted are found in the Achin district of Nangarhar province Donald Trump has not only normalised American foreign policy, he has arguably made it more effective. With two high-profile, signal-sending bombing raids and a series of breathtaking policy reversals, President Trump has brought US foreign policy back in line with conventional thinking. But he has added to the equation a measure of force that gives Washington new clout. When policy shifts so dramatically and with such little explanation, it can obviously shift again. So we don't know how long the new positions will last. Nato could be back out of favour, Putin back in, simply with a couple of 140-character tweets. But Donald Trump is a voracious consumer of cable television and the hunch is he will like the near-universal praise he's been getting on US talk shows this week. There are clearly glaring inconsistencies in his new foreign policies - he bombs a Syrian air base because of the suffering of Syrian babies, but bans Syrian refugees from entering America. There are pitfalls too. His switch on China appears largely based on a good rapport with Xi Jinping in Mar-a-Lago, but China still has interests which are not in sync with America's - its expansion in the South China Seas is just one. But, as one Republican put it to me this week, Mr Trump has begun to know what he doesn't know. That's important. He has begun to understand that the world is more complicated than he thought. You can laugh all you like at the sight of Mr Trump getting so publicly tutored on China, North Korea, the Export-Import bank and currency manipulation. Of course it was foolish to promise simple solutions to complex problems. But it's better to learn now how difficult those things are than never to learn at all. One dizzying day of Trump U-turns His recent praise of Nato and rejection of Moscow immediately put this White House more in sync with European allies. Europe has long believed that the real threat to global security comes from Russia, not China. That's not what millions of Mr Trump's voters believe. He will have to keep them in mind as he backs away from calling China a currency manipulator and slapping it with tariffs, as he had promised he would do in the campaign. But the shifts do bring America back into the foreign policy mainstream. This video can not be played It felt like the sky was coming down, villagers told journalist Bilal Sarwary The use of force, in Syria and Afghanistan, meanwhile, sends the message to America's adversaries that Mr Trump is not as war-averse as his predecessor. The White House was delighted that Xi Jinping got to hear the news, over dessert in Mar-a-Lago, that the US had bombed Syria. They wanted him to get the message that there's a new sheriff in town - and ideally to pass that message on to their contacts in Pyongyang. Those Tomahawks launched against the Shayrat air base didn't really do much to limit Syria's military capability, but they did send several effective signals to Syria and its friends. First, using chemical weapons against civilians will have consequences. Second, this is a president who is prepared to use force fast and with no warning - Trump isn't paralysed by analysis which was the criticism of Barack Obama. Third, and perhaps more critical, it gave Secretary of State Rex Tillerson a large stick to pack in his luggage for his trip to Moscow. Syrian American responds to Trump and Assad What is Trump's plan in Syria? How North Korea is testing the US Mr Obama's secretary of state, John Kerry, negotiated over Syria for years with no leverage because the Russians knew his boss wouldn't sanction the use of force - not so anymore. There was similar messaging printed on that massive bomb dropped on suspected Islamic State militants in Afghanistan this week. Dropping a big bomb is one thing, but you get a lot more attention when that bomb is rather gruesomely nicknamed ""the mother of all bombs"". It wasn't just a bomb, it was the biggest conventional weapon ever used in combat. It was positively Trumpian. That MOAB also sent signals. Mr Trump told his supporters during the campaign that his number one foreign policy priority was defeating so-called Islamic State. Some of those voters were not thrilled then that his first military intervention was in response to the suffering of Syrian children. They are suspicious of America getting dragged into more Middle East conflicts that don't help US interests. Bombing IS was a reminder that Mr Trump is focused on what he calls America's number one national security challenge. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson met Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow Ahead of the Easter weekend, with North Korea rumbling about a nuclear test, the Afghan strike may also have served as another reminder to Pyongyang that Mr Trump has big, bunker-busting weapons and will use them. So, in two short weeks, and with a new and more professional team in the White House, Mr Trump has stabilised foreign policy. Allies will wait to see if the change lasts and who really speaks for the president. But for the moment there is a collective sigh of relief that American leadership may be back in more conventional hands. Very soon, the focus will shift back to domestic policy and there Mr Trump has more of a challenge. He needs a legislative win fast. When Congress returns in a week, he will tackle health care, again, tax reform and he faces a government shutdown over America's debt limit. Failure on those will quickly shift the tone of the TV commentators. A 300m (328yds) long network of tunnels and caves was destroyed President Trump has no domestic equivalent of the confident, competent General H R McMaster, his new national security adviser. The Republican party is divided and the conservative wing has already shown it is prepared to say no to the president. Democrats, having been berated on Twitter and on TV by Mr Trump, are now in no mood to abandon their angry liberal base and work with him. Mr Trump has had a good couple of weeks. He has shown a capacity to learn and adapt as a result. He has begun to understand what he doesn't know and he has marginalised the more populist members of his team. He wants successes. It is easier for him to get them on the world stage than at home - it would be ironic if America's isolationist president now decided to become a foreign policy president because that's where the wins are.
