More than 500 migrants rescued off Italian island,"Hundreds of migrants crammed onto a decrepit fishing boat were rescued off the island of Lampedusa, Italy Italian coastguard vessels have rescued 539 migrants from a fishing boat drifting off the island of Lampedusa. The rescue on Saturday delivered one of the largest numbers of migrants to the Italian island in a single day. Women and children were among those on board. Some of the migrants - who had been travelling across the Mediterranean Sea from Libya - reportedly displayed signs of violence. Italian prosecutors have opened an inquiry into what may have happened. A doctor from the humanitarian group MSF (Doctors Without Borders), Alida Serrachieri, said a number of the migrants appeared to have been physically assaulted in Libya while waiting for a boat to transport them to Europe. Investigators are looking at the possibility that the migrants may have been falsely imprisoned in Libya, local media report. Two coastguard vessels and a customs boat from Italy's financial crimes police, the Guardia di Finanza, helped transport the migrants to Lampedusa. The island's Mayor Toto Martello described the rescue as ""one of the biggest landings in recent times"". Cold welcome for migrant influx at gateway to Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts Lampedusa is one of the main arrival ports for people wanting to reach Europe. In May, more than 1,000 migrants landed on the Italian island in the space of a few hours. The island has a migrant camp that was originally designed to hold fewer than 300 people. It now has more than five times that number, with many more held outside on the dusty road. Most arrive from countries that do not qualify for asylum.

Report finds big rises in garden furniture prices,"Retailers have blamed rising shipping, freight and raw material costs for big increases in the prices of garden furniture over the past two years. Consumer group Which? found some items were about twice as expensive as they were in 2019. In one case it found the price of a shed sold by a leading DIY retailer was 155% dearer in 2021. Retailers pointed to availability issues and said they were working with suppliers to keep prices down. The ""eye-watering"" rises tended to occur at times when delays at UK ports were particularly severe, Which? said. Customers were also facing items being out of stock and delivery days for multiple months. Timber shortage due to unprecedented demand DIY and building projects hit by materials shortage Garden furniture shortage no picnic for retailers Which? analysed 2,000 items across six major retailers - Homebase, Toolstation, B&Q, Amazon, Wickes and Screwfix - finding that on average prices had risen by 2% from July 2019 to June 2020 and by 9% from July 2020 to June 2021. Sheds saw particularly large price increases, with one sold by Screwfix rising from Â£319.99 in July 2019 to Â£814.99 by July 2021, Which? said. Wickes saw the largest average increase, with outdoor goods costing 13% more this year than they did in 2020. Screwfix and Toolstation also saw rises of over 10% across their garden products. The other retailers checked were Homebase (8%), B&Q (7%) and Amazon (2%). When asked by Which? what was behind the increase, B&Q and Homebase mentioned shipping costs, while a lack of raw materials - in particular timber - was also considered a factor. Toolstation told the consumer group there had beena timber shortagedue to ""unprecedented demand in the US"". Wickes pointed to ""availability constraints and inflationary pressures"", while Amazon said some of its prices were set by third-party retailers. Screwfix did not respond to Which?. Ele Clark, Which? retail editor, said: ""Many people have looked to spruce up their gardens with new outdoor furniture during the pandemic, but our analysis shows consumers have been hit with eye-watering price hikes for popular items."" She said consumers should consider shopping around for the best prices and exploring the second-hand market as well as planning ahead due to large or custom items taking ""several weeks longer than usual to arrive"".

Scottish Greens back historic government deal,"Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater are set to become Scottish government ministers Members of the Scottish Greens have backed a deal that will see its leaders in government for the first time. With some proxy votes still to be counted, 83% of members who took part in an extraordinary general meeting were in favour. The deal, which required a two-thirds majority of the party's National Council, was then formally ratified. Co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater said it promoted ""a sustainable Scotland that works for everyone"". The deal is done - so what lies ahead? What could the SNP-Greens deal mean for Scotland? SNP-Greens deal pledges indyref2 within five years The pair will become government ministers under the power-sharing deal, with the Greens required to back the Scottish government in confidence votes and annual budgets as they work on a raft of agreed policy areas, including tackling the climate emergency, Scottish independence and rent controls. Public disagreement between the parties will only be allowed on a set of agreed topics. These include aviation policy, green ports, direct financial support to businesses involved in the aerospace, defence and security sectors, field sports and the economic principles related to concepts of sustainable growth and inclusive growth. However, speaking during the EGM, Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer insisted that the list of subjects could be changed if further agreements or disagreements emerge. Before this vote, Green leaders were anxious not to take membership support for granted - there are, after all, some radical elements in the party and there is more than a hint of anarchism too. In the end, the lure of power proved highly persuasive. The co-operation agreement was emphatically endorsed by ordinary Greens and by the party's National Council, as it was in a separate ballot of SNP members. That means that Nicola Sturgeon can now formally appoint Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater as ministers in the Scottish government and seek Holyrood's approval when MSPs return from their summer break next week. The outcome of that and most other parliamentary votes is now a foregone conclusion because one of the key features of an SNP-Green government is that it will have a built-in majority for what they've agreed, including an indyref2 bill. There are of course a range of policies including the desirability of economic growth, aviation, field sports and private schools that sit outside their agreement. These topics and the compromises reached over road building and oil and gas extraction could be the source of future tension between the power-sharing partners. The co-leaders insisted the agreement will be good for Scotland, the country's efforts to tackle the climate crisis and contains ""transformational"" policies such as implementing rent controls. Lorna Slater became an MSP in May's Scottish election Ms Slater, the newly-elected Lothian MSP, said the members' overwhelming support would give the party ""the tools we need to tackle the climate crisis and implement transformative politics in Scotland"". She told BBC Scotland: ""With the Scottish Greens at the heart of government, we will see some real changes. Things like rent controls will be transformative for people in Scotland. ""We can also accelerate the development of our renewable energy industry, which will create thousands of jobs as well as tackle the climate crisis."" Green activists James Puchowski, Chas Booth and Rosie Smith James Puchowski, co-convener of the Green Nation Council, believes  the deal offers the chance to have a real influence on government policy. ""They're weighing up some things that I don't think three or four years ago we'd ever had a chance of getting - which is basically getting ministers inside Scottish government and maintaining opposition in the background."" Party member Rosie Smith backs the deal, but is worried it could backfire for the Greens. ""When I first saw it, especially the rent control section, it kind of felt a little bit like Christmas. What worries me about it is just hesitancy to enter coalitions having seen how badly it can go elsewhere in the UK."" Chas Booth, a Green councillor in Edinburgh, voted against the deal. He wasn't against a deal in principle, but felt this agreement didn't do enough to protect local services after years of cuts. ""I didn't see enough in this deal that would protect local councils and local services like leisure services, parks and stuff like - and that's why I voted against it. ""I accept there's an awful lot of stuff in here that is really good policy  - on active travel, on equal rights, on energy efficiency in our hands - but I felt that gap on local authorities and local services is something that Greens shouldn't support."" Ms Slater cited oil and gas extraction policies as an area of disagreement between the Scottish Greens and SNP, but added: ""I am very hopeful and optimistic about the change of travel that we've seen. ""When the first minister wrote to Boris Johnson the other week andasked him to reconsider the Cambo oil field, that was a significant change of direction for the Scottish government whose previous position was maximum economic extraction. ""Having Greens around has even turned the dial of that far, and I know that, by having Greens in government, we can continue to push that dial around and really tackle the climate crisis."" Patrick Harvie said it was the right time for the Greens to be in government Mr Harvie, who has spent 18 years in opposition at Holyrood, said it felt ""incredibly exciting"" to be on the brink of government. He said: ""I am delighted that our party members have given their support to this historic co-operation agreement that will see Greens enter government for the first time in Scotland, or indeed anywhere in the UK. ""With Greens in government we will be able to deliver positive change for the people of Scotland."" TheSNP's ruling body endorsed the power-sharing agreementlast weekend. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""delighted"" that members of both parties had agreed to work together. She said: ""This historic agreement will provide a strong platform for the transformative programme we want to deliver. ""We will work collaboratively to support a fair recovery from Covid, address with urgency the impacts of the climate emergency, and give the people of Scotland a vote on independence."" Scottish Conservative chief whip, Stephen Kerr, said the SNP/Green deal would be ""devastating for workers and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The SNP and Greens will put their obsession with a divisive referendum ahead of what is best for Scotland. ""Nicola Sturgeon failed to win a majority in May's election and now has had to cut a deal with a radical anti-jobs party, solely to ramp up her campaign for independence."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the deal proved the Green party was ""in many ways a branch office of the SNP"". He said: ""The Green party over the course of the last parliament voted through big cuts to local government budgets and voted against a pay rise for care workers. ""This is a deal that is not about the environment, it's about the independence agenda. ""It's not about building transparency and accountability of the government. It's about control for Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP so that they can largely ignore parliament. And I think that is really unfortunate for our democracy.""

Manchester City thrash 10-man Arsenal,"Arsenal went down to 10 men in the first half after Xhaka was dismissed for a tackle on Joao Cancelo Ten-man Arsenal were completely outplayed by Manchester City as they slumped to the bottom of the Premier League. It is the first time since 1954 that the Gunners have lost their three opening games of the league season and this match was effectively over by half-time. City captain Ilkay Gundogan and striker Ferran Torres scored in the first 12 minutes and any hope Arsenal had of an unlikely comeback was ended when midfielder Granit Xhaka was sent off for lunging into a challenge on Joao Cancelo. A trademark teasing run from Â£100m man Jack Grealish set up Gabriel Jesus for an easy third just before the break, then Rodri guided home a fourth from 20 yards just after it. Such was his side's total control that City manager Pep Guardiola had used all three substitutes within 16 minutes of the second half starting. It turned into an extended keep-ball session for the hosts, who finished off the rout with Torres' second six minutes from time. This video can not be played Match of the Day analysis: How 'shambolic' Arsenal were beaten by Manchester City Guardiola's counterpart and former assistant Mikel Arteta looked shell-shocked in the other technical area as Raheem Sterling - twice - Aymeric Laporte and Riyad Mahrez wasted opportunities to increase the margin of victory still further. By the end, Arsenal had managed a single shot - off target - and 19% possession. They are still to score in the Premier League this season and immediately after the international break play Norwich, the team they replaced at the foot of the tablebefore the Canaries went back to the bottom after a 2-1 defeat by Leicester City. This video can not be played 'We can do better' - Guardiola despite Arsenal thrashing After being forced to abandon their hopes of prising Harry Kane out of Tottenham and opting not to pursue a deal for Manchester United-bound Cristiano Ronaldo, it appears Guardiola will attack the new season without an orthodox number nine. If his side continue to meet opponents as accommodating as Arsenal, there will be no problem. The Gunners defence was so flimsy, it scarcely did justice to their status as a Premier League outfit. City's opener looked good on the eye. But there was no challenge on Bernardo Silva as he strode through the visitors' midfield, no effective closing down of Jesus as he lined up his cross and barely a challenge on Gundogan - hardly the greatest physical threat - as he rose at the far post. Add in Bernd Leno's weak attempt to keep the ball out of his goal and it summed up everything that is wrong about the visitors. At one point, Ederson stood for fully 10 seconds, not moving, as he decided where to aim his clearance. Eventually Emile Smith-Rowe closed the Brazilian down and forced him to do something. Perhaps he was a little bored. Earlier, he had delayed for so long an intended pass from his own goal-line that Smith-Rowe almost nicked the ball but could only watch as it ricocheted off him and narrowly wide of the far post. That was as close as Arsenal came to scoring. In his programme notes Guardiola proclaimed this would be a 'tough game' for his team. By the end, it was City's biggest ever win against the Gunners and their third successive 5-0 home win in the league. This video can not be played City result 'tough one to take' - Arteta Arsenal's performance dispelled any notion that a6-0 Carabao Cup triumphover a team of West Brom youngsters in midweek might shunt Arteta's under-firing group into life. The return of skipper Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and new signing Martin Odegaard made no noticeable difference to two previously tepid performances against Brentford and Chelsea. The Gunners' hapless state was exemplified by Xhaka. An experienced international, needed to guide the youngsters around him, Xhaka's response to his team going two goals down so early in a key game was to launch himself at Cancelo in a manner that made referee Martin Atkinson's decision to brandish a red card automatic. Arteta offered some sympathy to the Swiss as he made his way down the tunnel and spoke to the fourth official in a manner that indicated he felt the decision was wrong. He may have a different opinion when he reviews the incident - but there is far more for Arteta to find criticism of from this.

"'I went from a Â£150 loan to owing Â£6,000 in months'","Tom was able to get into about Â£6,000 of debt through payday loan apps on his mobile phone When Tom needed some extra cash at a festival, he applied for a payday loan on his phone while sitting in his tent. Within minutes, Â£150 landed in his bank account, leading him on a spiral of debt that left the 18-year-old owing Â£6,000 to 10 online lenders. ""I was young and dumb,"" said Tom, who said his mental health was affected. Tom's story comes as Credit Unions of Wales warned young people were particularly vulnerable to getting into a ""spiral of debt"" during the pandemic. When he ran out of funds at the festival, Tom, not his real name, turned to payday loans after seeing adverts on TV. This video can not be played 'Payday lenders are robbing the vulnerable' 'Ticking time bomb' for young jobless Households face 'debt time-bomb' Loan shark fears as fewer investigations begin ""I was sat in my tent... obviously got a bit short on my money, so I opened up my phone, easily went onto the app and got a loan,"" said Tom, from Denbighshire. ""It was the easiest thing in the world. They gave me options of Â£50, Â£100, Â£150 or Â£200 - I clicked the Â£150 one and it was in my bank within minutes. ""All I was bothered about was getting the money. I was young and dumb."" The following month, Tom paid off the loan. But it left him short, so he borrowed from another lender, then another. Although it all seemed easy and convenient at the beginning, he eventually got into so much debt that it affected his mental health. ""I got really anxious and stuff about it,"" he said. ""I was an emotional wreck, I'd always be panicking, anxious."" Tom warned other young people not to be fooled by the ease of online loans Most days, lenders would text and email him, demanding he repay them at high rates of interest. But Tom could not bring himself to tell his family. ""I didn't want to tell anyone about it because of the embarrassment, so I would just take more,"" he said. ""I would get regular texts saying 'you've just been accepted for a Â£200 loan'. You click the link, sign up, get the money and I think they'd sell your information then to other people. It was just a rabbit hole. ""For Â£200 I'd have to pay back Â£500 on one of them because my credit was so bad it made the interest very high. I felt I had no other place to go."" The turning point came when Tom ended up in hospital, following a serious car crash. When his mother Joanne picked up his mobile phone and saw all the messages from payday lenders, he told her everything. Joanne - not her real name - said she was ""absolutely horrified"" at the amount of debt her son had accumulated so easily. Tom only told his mother Joanne about his debt problems after a serious car accident ""To be able to go and press an app and get the money and keep it secret from you is really scary,"" she said. ""I think it's too young to be able to allow them to access that amount of money so easily at such a young age and not have the provision in place to manage it and restrict it. ""The fact that he could be at a festival, maybe a bit drunk, and just to be able to press a button and get that money... that's wrong."" Even when Tom was recovering from the near-fatal car crash, the lenders were ""hounding him to pay back the money"". Young people going online for help with debt risk abuse, said investigators ""I spoke to some of these people explaining he'd been in this accident and that mentally he wasn't in a good place because of what happened and they didn't care,"" said Joanne. She called for tighter regulations in the lending industry, particularly regarding young borrowers, and more education around personal finance. ""It can destroy their lives,"" she said. ""They've preyed on a young lad who had a fear of missing out and there's probably a lot more of them out there. It needs to be more regulated."" ""I think in the last year of secondary school they should look around educating kids about this high interest debt, they don't understand if they miss a payment how it escalates. How you could borrow Â£200 and end up owing Â£500."" Tom thinks the age limit for online borrowing should be raised to 21. ""You don't know what you're getting yourself into,"" he said. Inequality driving 'deaths of despair' Nine million forced to borrow to cope with virus 'Poorer households see debts rise' during lockdown ""They are robbing the vulnerable because they know with the higher interest they're going to get the desperate people."" Although Â£4,000 of his debt remains unpaid, Tom said he will never again borrow from a payday lender again. Claire Savage of Credit Unions Wales said young borrowers risked being caught up in a ""spiral of debt"" Claire Savage, policy officer at Credit Unions of Wales said young people borrowing online risked falling prey to loan sharks. ""We know that the financial impact of the pandemic has impacted young people and there is a real risk that they will fall for high-cost lenders or loan sharks, which can lead to a spiral of debt or worse,"" she said. Research from the Wales Illegal Money Lending Unit (WIMLU) found that rising numbers of young people under the age of 30 were borrowing from unlicensed lenders through social media. Their report found that while most online loan requests were for a small amount, they were to cover basic costs such as food and rent - and were mostly by students or people on benefits. A third of lenders on one social media platform either had no track record of lending or has been banned for account violations, WIMLU said. Investigators are concerned unregulated lending could leave young people like Tom open to abuse. ""We are worried that this type of lending is completely unregulated and open to abuse,"" said WIMLU manager Sarah Smith. ""We have seen loan requests from Welsh borrowers for as little as Â£7. People who are struggling to make ends meet can easily fall prey to loan sharks and scammers.""

Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"".

Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

Evacuations of Afghan civilians winding downThe US is still airlifting civilians from Kabul airport but the UK has now ended evacuation flights.,"These evacuees made it on the last flight to Italy Another attack on Kabul airport is highly likely, US President Joe Biden has warned, saying commanders have told him it could come as early as Sunday. The state department has urged all US citizens to leave the area,externalnear the airport because of a ""specific, credible threat"". The US is continuing evacuations but the final UK troops, diplomats and officials have now left Kabul. A suicide bombing near the airport on Thursday resulted in some 170 deaths. A local branch of the Islamic State group - Islamic State in Khorasan Province (IS-K) - claimed the attack. In retaliation, the US carried out a drone strike on eastern Afghanistan late on Friday, saying it had killed two ""high-profile"" IS-K members. The two are described as a planner and a facilitator. It is unclear whether they were directly involved in planning the Kabul airport attack. ""This strike was not the last. We will continue to hunt down any person involved in that heinous attack and make them pay,"" Mr Biden said in a statement released on Saturday. IS-K is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan and has major differences with the Taliban, who now control most of the country. It accuses them of abandoning the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement with the Americans. The Taliban condemned the air strike, saying the Americans should have consulted them first, a spokesman told Reuters news agency. This video can not be played âI helped the US, now my family is at riskâ The next few days of the US evacuation operation are likely to be the most dangerous since it began, White House officials say. US troops have begun their withdrawal from the airport - their numbers are now down to 4,000, from a peak of 5,800 in the past week. One Western security official told Reuters that US forces were in the final phase, although a time for the end of the operation had yet to be decided. Just over 1,000 civilians remain to be airlifted, the official said. A Taliban official told Reuters their technical experts and engineers were ready to take over the airport when they were given the ""final nod from the Americans"". The Taliban have set up further layers of checkpoints around the airport and are not allowing most Afghans through, the Associated Press adds. In all, more than 110,000 people - both Afghans and foreign nationals - have been evacuated from Kabul airport since the airlift began two weeks ago. US Marine Sgt Nicole Gee, 23, was one of 13 US service personnel killed On Saturday, Italy's final flight from Afghanistan arrived in Rome. Italy said it had evacuated almost 5,000 Afghan citizens from Kabul - the highest number of any EU country. France said it had flown out more than 2,800 since 17 August, while Germany said it had taken about 4,000 Afghans. The head of the UK's armed forces, General Sir Nick Carter, said it was ""heartbreaking"" that they had not been able to rescue everyone. Final UK troops leave Afghanistan Saturday's events as they unfolded Where will all the Afghan refugees go? France and Britain will urge the UN to create a ""safe zone"" in Kabul to help evacuation efforts, French President Emmanuel Macron said. He said it would allow the international community to carry out humanitarian work and ""maintain pressure on the Taliban"". Crowds have gathered outside banks as people try to withdraw cash Since the Taliban took Kabul on 15 August, the Afghan economy has been in freefall as aid donors freeze funds and panicked depositors seek to withdraw their money from banks. On Saturday crowds of protesters gathered outside banks in the Afghan capital. ""If the situation continues and employees of the government don't get their salaries and a businessman cannot get his money from the bank for trading, the result of this is very horrible, and there will be poverty in the society as well, and no-one can solve that issue,"" one man told Reuters.

"Hire Britons to drive HGVs, minister tells firms","Businesses have been told to prioritise hiring UK-based workers rather than relying on labour from abroad to fix a shortage of lorry drivers. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng rejected calls from firms to loosen immigration rules, saying it would be a ""short-term temporary solution"". But Logistics UK says it can take nine months for new drivers to qualify and there is a backlog of driving tests. A growing number of firms have said the issue is causing product shortages. Last weekend trade bodies the British Retail Consortium and Logistics UK, which represents the freight sector wrote to the government warningthe shortfall of drivers was ""placing increasingly unsustainable pressure on retailers and their supply chains"". A combination of Covid, post-Brexit immigration rules, tax changes and other factors has meant there are not enough drivers to meet demand, with the shortages affecting well-known brands such asNando'sandMcDonald's, as well as supermarkets. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Morrisons calls for action on lorry driver dearth Food firm in 'drastic' action amid driver shortage How many people are now on furlough? Responding to the groups, Mr Kwarteng said HGV drivers would not be eligible for a skilled worker visa or be added to the shortage occupation list to allow firms to recruit them from abroad. While this would help in the short term, he said businesses should instead be ""utilising the strength of our domestic workforce"" and looking to employ those facing an ""uncertain future"" when the furlough scheme ended next month. Mr Kwarteng said the government was offering Â£7,000 per apprenticeship for people training to be lorry drivers, as well as grants to train military service leavers, ex-offenders and the long-term unemployed to move into jobs where there were labour shortages. Logisitics UK said it was ""frustrated"" with Mr Kwarteng's response and it estimated the backlog of HGV driver tests could take until early 2022 to clear. ""The industry needs drivers now, and we have been urging the government to replicate its temporary visa scheme, introduced for agricultural workers, for logistics to keep trucks and vans moving in the short term,"" a statement said. As well not being included in the visa scheme,reforms to the IR35 tax ruleshave also made it less attractive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. The government said the UK had a ""highly resilient food supply chain and well-established ways of working with the food sector to address supply chain disruptions. A spokeswoman said it had announced measures to help tackle the HGV driver shortage, including plans to streamline the process for new drivers to gain their licence and to increase the number of tests able to be conducted, but said most solutions were likely to be driven by industry. The UK'sskilled worker visa,externalallows a person to stay in the UK to do an eligible job with an approved employer. Workers must meet criteria, including having a ""certificate of sponsorship"" from a UK employer approved by the Home Office. There is alsoa shortage occupations list,external, which includes jobs in healthcare, education, science and engineering. HGV drivers are not on this list, which means they are excluded from the visa. The Road Haulage Association has estimated there is a shortage of more than 100,000 drivers in the UK, which had around 600,000 before the pandemic. On Friday supermarket chain Morrisons became the latest company to join the growing chorus of calls for drivers to be eligible forSkilled Worker visas,externalto allow them to work in the UK. Aldi has saidit has increased its wages for lorry drivers amid the shortage. The supermarket chain pays between Â£14.15 and Â£15.34 per hour for day shifts, and Â£16.98 and Â£18.41 per hour for night shifts according to its careers website. Tescohas offered a Â£1,000 bonusfor drivers who join before 30 September. Dairy giant Arla has been among the firms affected by driver shortages Worker shortages are not just affecting the transport of goods, with pig producers warning a shortage of labour at abattoirs iscausing a surplus of pigs to be stuck at farms. The National Pig Association told the BBC any suggestion that people coming off furlough could solve a shortage of meat processors was not realistic. A report by a group of 12 trade bodies in the food, drink and hospitality sectors,externalhas said ""chronic labour shortages"" span the whole of the supply chain, from agricultural workers through to waiting staff. Tim O'Malley, managing director at food firm Nationwide Produce, said the industry needed to make its jobs more attractive to UK workers. He said: ""If we are going to increase pay and working conditions to attract British workers then we are going to have to pay more for our food, we are going to see food price inflation."" Business groups in logistics and the food sector have repeatedly said they do want to grow more of a UK-based workforce - something the government keeps saying must happen. But firms insist that will take time and they can't wait. They say a shortage of HGV drivers, that's been steadily building in the background due to a cocktail of factors including an ageing pool of labour, has been sharply exacerbated by both the pandemic and post-Brexit immigration rules. In other areas where there are job vacancies, such as meat processing, it's proving extremely hard to attract domestic workers who are prepared to do the job, or have the right skills. That's why we're hearing increasingly loud calls for short-term solutions. The government has so far rejected any changes which involve making it easier for EU migrant workers to fill the gaps. Businesses say they have spent money on bumping up wages to compete for staff. But the continuation of that will mean higher prices.

Lifeguard cover cut after positive Covid caseIngoldmells and Sutton-on-Sea have no lifeguards but there is now cover at Mablethorpe and Skegness.,"Ingoldmells and Sutton-on-Sea beaches have no lifeguards but Skegness and Mablethorpe have cover Lifeguards have been withdrawn from two Lincolnshire beaches after one staff member tested positive for coronavirus, the RNLI said. The charity said it had to temporarily withdraw the lifeguard service from Ingoldmells and Sutton-on-Sea beaches. It said it had made the ""difficult decision"" due to staff shortages. Earlier the RNLI said lifeguards would also be withdrawn from Skegness and Mablethorpe beaches but they have now been reintroduced. Daniel Cooper, of the RNLI, warned only ""very competent"" swimmers should enter the water at unguarded beaches. The RNLI temporarily withdrew the lifeguard service from all four beaches due to a positive test and other members of the team having to self-isolate. Skegness and Mablethorpe lifeboat stations remain able to respond to calls from the Coastguard, the charity said. More stories from the region Lifeguards are trained in lifesaving and casualty care and cover about 240 UK beaches at the summer peak The charity said it would ""return to a full service as soon as possible"". Mr Cooper urged people to stay out of the water while there were no lifeguards available. He added: ""If you are going into the water you need to make sure you are with somebody else and you've got somebody watching you to call 999 and ask for the coastguard if needed.""

The people helping refugees,"Lucie Dennis's doorbell has hardly stopped ringing. ""About 50 Amazon boxes have just turned up,"" she says. ""It's been completely overwhelming."" The parcels aren't the result of a lavish spending spree. Instead, they contain just some of the donations paid for by members of the public who have been moved to help after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul - prompting thousands of people to flee the country. Lucie, who runs a campaign group called Help to Make Tummies Full that helps feed children in her part of the UK - and who has three children herself - decided to take action after seeing images of Afghanistan on the news this month. More than Â£2,000 worth of goods have been delivered to her doorstep in Walsall so far - enough to create 48 jam-packed rucksacks for Afghan children due to be resettled in the local area. Lucie Dennis has created rucksacks for 48 Afghan children due to be resettled in Walsall With a list of ages and genders in hand, Lucie set about tailor-making each bag - all of which include new socks, underwear, and things like colouring books, pencils, toiletries, shower gel and toothpaste. ""Every bag is different,"" she says. An appeal on Facebook supercharged the operation. ""Some people have been making up their own backpacks, others have buying things in bulk for us, and others are on the Amazon wish list. Every time I check the list it's all been bought."" Lucie's rucksacks come with donations of toys from Olivia's Closet, a local project that helps vulnerable people Fahim Zazai, who is also organising donations in Walsall, is ecstatic with the response to his appeal for help. ""It's been really good. It's been really positive. Lots of people have responded really quickly and really positively,"" he says. Fahim runs the Afghan Community and Welfare Centre in the West Midlands town. He arrived in the UK from Afghanistan more than 20 years ago having fled the Taliban - completely on his own and not speaking a word of English. Now the 42-year-old is helping others make the same journey. ""I came here with nothing. I know how hard it is to come here not knowing the language, having no friends, having no support,"" he says. ""I'm stepping up to support these newly arrived families."" Now married with four children, Fahim is appealing for donations of things like clothing, household items such as cutlery and plates, and toys. ""What they receive is not enough,"" he explains. ""We're asking for certain items because often they only come with their own clothes."" Fahim Zazai runs an Afghan community centre that has been inundated with offers of support in recent days Jayne Moorby, 44, has been volunteering with Furness Refugee Support, a volunteer group in Cumbria, for some time. As the Taliban gained ground in Afghanistan, she was moved to donate to another organisation, Care4Calais, which is collecting items for refugees who have recently arrived in Manchester. She shared a picture of her donations - including felt tip pens, soap and toothpaste - on Twitter, writing: ""No-one chooses to be a refugee, if any of us were in that position I hope we would get kindness and support in building a new life.""

The marketing manager tells the BBC she believes first impressions matter and that the UK should put out a ""message of welcome"". ""It's been really nice actually, on social media - and since I tweeted that picture - how many people have said they want to donate clothes, or donate money,"" she says. ""I just want to let refugees know there are people here to welcome them and support them."" Jayne Moorby says the response on social media has been positive with many offers of further donations Retired social worker Annie Mellor has been renting out a room in the Plymouth home she shares with her husband Pete on Airbnb for a while. As events in Afghanistan unfolded, she began exploring ways she could use it to help. The 65-year-old initially looked into letting out the room to an Afghan student at the local university, but, after finding out there were no Afghans in need there, she changed tack. Airbnb has offeredto pay for accommodationfor 20,000 Afghan refugees, with applications now open worldwide to anyone with a spare room. She explains her motivation: ""My son worked for an [non-governmental organisation] in Afghanistan - working to empower women there. I watched while he worked there and had bombs going off outside his house and I realised what a terrible time Afghan women were having."" ""We've got an Airbnb that is in our house - so they would eat and share with us - but they would have their own entrance, and en suite,"" she says. ""If we don't get someone from Afghanistan we have to start looking at other places - Syria is in the same situation."" Annie, husband Pete and dogs Jimi and Bowie are hoping to open their home to a refugee Louisa Whitehead works for the Charity Aid Recycling Enterprise - or Care UK - in the North West, assisting refugees and asylum seekers housed in temporary accommodation. Those arriving from Afghanistan at the moment are often part of a formal resettlement scheme. ""For them, work and housing will be found almost immediately,"" the 53-year-old says, adding that whole families have been arriving together. Louisa has just got back from visiting Afghans who arrived here last week. She was joined by a volunteer - a local man who fled the Taliban more than 20 years ago - who speaks fluent Farsi. ""He was so insistent about going, and it was because he wanted to tell them: 'It's OK you don't have to fear them anymore'. To see the look on their faces when he started speaking their language,"" she says. She says the Afghans she met are all keen to work, learn and contribute. ""The women are saying they want to learn to drive, one woman wants to work in a nursery because that is what she was trained to do,"" she adds. Louisa assists refugees and asylum seekers in temporary accommodation across the North West Nora Carlin, Care UK's chief executive, says ""everyone leaps forward"" when a crisis occurs, and Afghanistan is no different. She says the charity has been ""bombarded in the last few days with offers of aid, help, money"". ""The British people are stepping up again - and it's moments like this I'm proud to be British,"" she adds. Lisa Doyle, the director of advocacy at the Refugee Council, says the response from the public in recent days has been ""amazing"". ""Communities up and down the country are coming together to support people who have lost everything,"" she says. ""It shows we are a caring nation who can reach out to those in need.""

"Scottish Greens back historic government dealWith proxy votes still to be counted, members voted by 88.5% to support an agreement that will give them ministerial roles.Scotland politics","Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater are set to become Scottish government ministers Members of the Scottish Greens have backed a deal that will see its leaders in government for the first time. With some proxy votes still to be counted, 83% of members who took part in an extraordinary general meeting were in favour. The deal, which required a two-thirds majority of the party's National Council, was then formally ratified. Co-leaders Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater said it promoted ""a sustainable Scotland that works for everyone"". The deal is done - so what lies ahead? What could the SNP-Greens deal mean for Scotland? SNP-Greens deal pledges indyref2 within five years The pair will become government ministers under the power-sharing deal, with the Greens required to back the Scottish government in confidence votes and annual budgets as they work on a raft of agreed policy areas, including tackling the climate emergency, Scottish independence and rent controls. Public disagreement between the parties will only be allowed on a set of agreed topics. These include aviation policy, green ports, direct financial support to businesses involved in the aerospace, defence and security sectors, field sports and the economic principles related to concepts of sustainable growth and inclusive growth. However, speaking during the EGM, Scottish Green MSP Ross Greer insisted that the list of subjects could be changed if further agreements or disagreements emerge. Before this vote, Green leaders were anxious not to take membership support for granted - there are, after all, some radical elements in the party and there is more than a hint of anarchism too. In the end, the lure of power proved highly persuasive. The co-operation agreement was emphatically endorsed by ordinary Greens and by the party's National Council, as it was in a separate ballot of SNP members. That means that Nicola Sturgeon can now formally appoint Patrick Harvie and Lorna Slater as ministers in the Scottish government and seek Holyrood's approval when MSPs return from their summer break next week. The outcome of that and most other parliamentary votes is now a foregone conclusion because one of the key features of an SNP-Green government is that it will have a built-in majority for what they've agreed, including an indyref2 bill. There are of course a range of policies including the desirability of economic growth, aviation, field sports and private schools that sit outside their agreement. These topics and the compromises reached over road building and oil and gas extraction could be the source of future tension between the power-sharing partners. The co-leaders insisted the agreement will be good for Scotland, the country's efforts to tackle the climate crisis and contains ""transformational"" policies such as implementing rent controls. Lorna Slater became an MSP in May's Scottish election Ms Slater, the newly-elected Lothian MSP, said the members' overwhelming support would give the party ""the tools we need to tackle the climate crisis and implement transformative politics in Scotland"". She told BBC Scotland: ""With the Scottish Greens at the heart of government, we will see some real changes. Things like rent controls will be transformative for people in Scotland. ""We can also accelerate the development of our renewable energy industry, which will create thousands of jobs as well as tackle the climate crisis."" Green activists James Puchowski, Chas Booth and Rosie Smith James Puchowski, co-convener of the Green Nation Council, believes  the deal offers the chance to have a real influence on government policy. ""They're weighing up some things that I don't think three or four years ago we'd ever had a chance of getting - which is basically getting ministers inside Scottish government and maintaining opposition in the background."" Party member Rosie Smith backs the deal, but is worried it could backfire for the Greens. ""When I first saw it, especially the rent control section, it kind of felt a little bit like Christmas. What worries me about it is just hesitancy to enter coalitions having seen how badly it can go elsewhere in the UK."" Chas Booth, a Green councillor in Edinburgh, voted against the deal. He wasn't against a deal in principle, but felt this agreement didn't do enough to protect local services after years of cuts. ""I didn't see enough in this deal that would protect local councils and local services like leisure services, parks and stuff like - and that's why I voted against it. ""I accept there's an awful lot of stuff in here that is really good policy  - on active travel, on equal rights, on energy efficiency in our hands - but I felt that gap on local authorities and local services is something that Greens shouldn't support."" Ms Slater cited oil and gas extraction policies as an area of disagreement between the Scottish Greens and SNP, but added: ""I am very hopeful and optimistic about the change of travel that we've seen. ""When the first minister wrote to Boris Johnson the other week andasked him to reconsider the Cambo oil field, that was a significant change of direction for the Scottish government whose previous position was maximum economic extraction. ""Having Greens around has even turned the dial of that far, and I know that, by having Greens in government, we can continue to push that dial around and really tackle the climate crisis."" Patrick Harvie said it was the right time for the Greens to be in government Mr Harvie, who has spent 18 years in opposition at Holyrood, said it felt ""incredibly exciting"" to be on the brink of government. He said: ""I am delighted that our party members have given their support to this historic co-operation agreement that will see Greens enter government for the first time in Scotland, or indeed anywhere in the UK. ""With Greens in government we will be able to deliver positive change for the people of Scotland."" TheSNP's ruling body endorsed the power-sharing agreementlast weekend. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was ""delighted"" that members of both parties had agreed to work together. She said: ""This historic agreement will provide a strong platform for the transformative programme we want to deliver. ""We will work collaboratively to support a fair recovery from Covid, address with urgency the impacts of the climate emergency, and give the people of Scotland a vote on independence."" Scottish Conservative chief whip, Stephen Kerr, said the SNP/Green deal would be ""devastating for workers and our economic recovery"". He said: ""The SNP and Greens will put their obsession with a divisive referendum ahead of what is best for Scotland. ""Nicola Sturgeon failed to win a majority in May's election and now has had to cut a deal with a radical anti-jobs party, solely to ramp up her campaign for independence."" Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the deal proved the Green party was ""in many ways a branch office of the SNP"". He said: ""The Green party over the course of the last parliament voted through big cuts to local government budgets and voted against a pay rise for care workers. ""This is a deal that is not about the environment, it's about the independence agenda. ""It's not about building transparency and accountability of the government. It's about control for Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP so that they can largely ignore parliament. And I think that is really unfortunate for our democracy.""

Who are the IS-K?,"A local branch of the Islamic State group in Afghanistan has vowed to continue attacks now that Taliban militants are in control. So who are these IS militants? IS-K - Islamic State Khorasan Province - is the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group. It is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. IS-K was set up in January 2015 at the height of IS's power in Iraq and Syria, before its self-declared caliphate was defeated and dismantled by a US-led coalition. It recruits both Afghan and Pakistani jihadists, especially defecting members of the Afghan Taliban who don't see their own organisation as extreme enough. ""Khorasan"" refers to a historical region covering parts of modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group initially included Pakistan until a separate Pakistan section was declared in May 2019. At its height the group numbered about 3,000 fighters. However, it has suffered significant casualties in clashes with both the US and Afghan security forces, and also with the Taliban. IS-K has targeted Afghan security forces, Afghan politicians and ministries, the Taliban, religious minorities, including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations. IS-K have been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in recent years, targeting girls' schools, hospitals and even a maternity ward, where they reportedly shot dead pregnant women and nurses. IS-K claimed responsibility for the deadly attack outside Kabul airport on 26 August Unlike the Taliban, whose interest is confined to Afghanistan, IS-K are part of the global IS network that seeks to carry out attacks on Western, international and humanitarian targets wherever they can reach them. IS-K are based in the eastern province of Nangarhar, close to drug and people-smuggling routes in and out of Pakistan. While most of its activities have been in Nangahar and Kabul, it has also claimed attacks in the provinces of Kunar, Jowzjan, Paktia, Kunduz and Herat. Peripherally yes, via a third party, the Haqqani network. According to researchers, there are strong links between IS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban. The man now in charge of security in Kabul is Khalil Haqqani who has had a $5m (Â£3.6m) bounty on his head. Dr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation has been monitoring the militant networks in Afghanistan for years. He says ""several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between IS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani network and other terror groups based in Pakistan"". When the Taliban took over in Kabul on 15 August, the group released large numbers of prisoners from Pul-e-Charki jail, reportedly including IS and al-Qaeda militants. These people are now at large. But IS-K have major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in ""posh hotels"" in Doha, Qatar. IS-K considers Taliban militants ""apostates"", making their killing lawful under their interpretation of Islamic law. IS militants now represent a major security challenge for the incoming Taliban government, something the Taliban leadership shares in common with Western intelligence agencies. Who are the Taliban?

Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

The people helping Afghan refugees in the UK,"Lucie Dennis's doorbell has hardly stopped ringing. ""About 50 Amazon boxes have just turned up,"" she says. ""It's been completely overwhelming."" The parcels aren't the result of a lavish spending spree. Instead, they contain just some of the donations paid for by members of the public who have been moved to help after the Taliban seized control of Afghanistan's capital, Kabul - prompting thousands of people to flee the country. Lucie, who runs a campaign group called Help to Make Tummies Full that helps feed children in her part of the UK - and who has three children herself - decided to take action after seeing images of Afghanistan on the news this month. More than Â£2,000 worth of goods have been delivered to her doorstep in Walsall so far - enough to create 48 jam-packed rucksacks for Afghan children due to be resettled in the local area. Lucie Dennis has created rucksacks for 48 Afghan children due to be resettled in Walsall With a list of ages and genders in hand, Lucie set about tailor-making each bag - all of which include new socks, underwear, and things like colouring books, pencils, toiletries, shower gel and toothpaste. ""Every bag is different,"" she says. An appeal on Facebook supercharged the operation. ""Some people have been making up their own backpacks, others have buying things in bulk for us, and others are on the Amazon wish list. Every time I check the list it's all been bought."" Lucie's rucksacks come with donations of toys from Olivia's Closet, a local project that helps vulnerable people Fahim Zazai, who is also organising donations in Walsall, is ecstatic with the response to his appeal for help. ""It's been really good. It's been really positive. Lots of people have responded really quickly and really positively,"" he says. Fahim runs the Afghan Community and Welfare Centre in the West Midlands town. He arrived in the UK from Afghanistan more than 20 years ago having fled the Taliban - completely on his own and not speaking a word of English. Now the 42-year-old is helping others make the same journey. ""I came here with nothing. I know how hard it is to come here not knowing the language, having no friends, having no support,"" he says. ""I'm stepping up to support these newly arrived families."" Now married with four children, Fahim is appealing for donations of things like clothing, household items such as cutlery and plates, and toys. ""What they receive is not enough,"" he explains. ""We're asking for certain items because often they only come with their own clothes."" Fahim Zazai runs an Afghan community centre that has been inundated with offers of support in recent days Jayne Moorby, 44, has been volunteering with Furness Refugee Support, a volunteer group in Cumbria, for some time. As the Taliban gained ground in Afghanistan, she was moved to donate to another organisation, Care4Calais, which is collecting items for refugees who have recently arrived in Manchester. She shared a picture of her donations - including felt tip pens, soap and toothpaste - on Twitter, writing: ""No-one chooses to be a refugee, if any of us were in that position I hope we would get kindness and support in building a new life.""

The marketing manager tells the BBC she believes first impressions matter and that the UK should put out a ""message of welcome"". ""It's been really nice actually, on social media - and since I tweeted that picture - how many people have said they want to donate clothes, or donate money,"" she says. ""I just want to let refugees know there are people here to welcome them and support them."" Jayne Moorby says the response on social media has been positive with many offers of further donations Retired social worker Annie Mellor has been renting out a room in the Plymouth home she shares with her husband Pete on Airbnb for a while. As events in Afghanistan unfolded, she began exploring ways she could use it to help. The 65-year-old initially looked into letting out the room to an Afghan student at the local university, but, after finding out there were no Afghans in need there, she changed tack. Airbnb has offeredto pay for accommodationfor 20,000 Afghan refugees, with applications now open worldwide to anyone with a spare room. She explains her motivation: ""My son worked for an [non-governmental organisation] in Afghanistan - working to empower women there. I watched while he worked there and had bombs going off outside his house and I realised what a terrible time Afghan women were having."" ""We've got an Airbnb that is in our house - so they would eat and share with us - but they would have their own entrance, and en suite,"" she says. ""If we don't get someone from Afghanistan we have to start looking at other places - Syria is in the same situation."" Annie, husband Pete and dogs Jimi and Bowie are hoping to open their home to a refugee Louisa Whitehead works for the Charity Aid Recycling Enterprise - or Care UK - in the North West, assisting refugees and asylum seekers housed in temporary accommodation. Those arriving from Afghanistan at the moment are often part of a formal resettlement scheme. ""For them, work and housing will be found almost immediately,"" the 53-year-old says, adding that whole families have been arriving together. Louisa has just got back from visiting Afghans who arrived here last week. She was joined by a volunteer - a local man who fled the Taliban more than 20 years ago - who speaks fluent Farsi. ""He was so insistent about going, and it was because he wanted to tell them: 'It's OK you don't have to fear them anymore'. To see the look on their faces when he started speaking their language,"" she says. She says the Afghans she met are all keen to work, learn and contribute. ""The women are saying they want to learn to drive, one woman wants to work in a nursery because that is what she was trained to do,"" she adds. Louisa assists refugees and asylum seekers in temporary accommodation across the North West Nora Carlin, Care UK's chief executive, says ""everyone leaps forward"" when a crisis occurs, and Afghanistan is no different. She says the charity has been ""bombarded in the last few days with offers of aid, help, money"". ""The British people are stepping up again - and it's moments like this I'm proud to be British,"" she adds. Lisa Doyle, the director of advocacy at the Refugee Council, says the response from the public in recent days has been ""amazing"". ""Communities up and down the country are coming together to support people who have lost everything,"" she says. ""It shows we are a caring nation who can reach out to those in need.""

Lifeguard cover cut after positive Covid case,"Ingoldmells and Sutton-on-Sea beaches have no lifeguards but Skegness and Mablethorpe have cover Lifeguards have been withdrawn from two Lincolnshire beaches after one staff member tested positive for coronavirus, the RNLI said. The charity said it had to temporarily withdraw the lifeguard service from Ingoldmells and Sutton-on-Sea beaches. It said it had made the ""difficult decision"" due to staff shortages. Earlier the RNLI said lifeguards would also be withdrawn from Skegness and Mablethorpe beaches but they have now been reintroduced. Daniel Cooper, of the RNLI, warned only ""very competent"" swimmers should enter the water at unguarded beaches. The RNLI temporarily withdrew the lifeguard service from all four beaches due to a positive test and other members of the team having to self-isolate. Skegness and Mablethorpe lifeboat stations remain able to respond to calls from the Coastguard, the charity said. More stories from the region Lifeguards are trained in lifesaving and casualty care and cover about 240 UK beaches at the summer peak The charity said it would ""return to a full service as soon as possible"". Mr Cooper urged people to stay out of the water while there were no lifeguards available. He added: ""If you are going into the water you need to make sure you are with somebody else and you've got somebody watching you to call 999 and ask for the coastguard if needed.""

The group claiming the airport attack,"A local branch of the Islamic State group in Afghanistan has vowed to continue attacks now that Taliban militants are in control. So who are these IS militants? IS-K - Islamic State Khorasan Province - is the regional affiliate of the Islamic State group. It is the most extreme and violent of all the jihadist militant groups in Afghanistan. IS-K was set up in January 2015 at the height of IS's power in Iraq and Syria, before its self-declared caliphate was defeated and dismantled by a US-led coalition. It recruits both Afghan and Pakistani jihadists, especially defecting members of the Afghan Taliban who don't see their own organisation as extreme enough. ""Khorasan"" refers to a historical region covering parts of modern-day Afghanistan and Pakistan. The group initially included Pakistan until a separate Pakistan section was declared in May 2019. At its height the group numbered about 3,000 fighters. However, it has suffered significant casualties in clashes with both the US and Afghan security forces, and also with the Taliban. IS-K has targeted Afghan security forces, Afghan politicians and ministries, the Taliban, religious minorities, including Shia Muslims and Sikhs, US and Nato forces, and international agencies, including aid organisations. IS-K have been blamed for some of the worst atrocities in recent years, targeting girls' schools, hospitals and even a maternity ward, where they reportedly shot dead pregnant women and nurses. IS-K claimed responsibility for the deadly attack outside Kabul airport on 26 August Unlike the Taliban, whose interest is confined to Afghanistan, IS-K are part of the global IS network that seeks to carry out attacks on Western, international and humanitarian targets wherever they can reach them. IS-K are based in the eastern province of Nangarhar, close to drug and people-smuggling routes in and out of Pakistan. While most of its activities have been in Nangahar and Kabul, it has also claimed attacks in the provinces of Kunar, Jowzjan, Paktia, Kunduz and Herat. Peripherally yes, via a third party, the Haqqani network. According to researchers, there are strong links between IS-K and the Haqqani network, which in turn is closely linked to the Taliban. The man now in charge of security in Kabul is Khalil Haqqani who has had a $5m (Â£3.6m) bounty on his head. Dr Sajjan Gohel from the Asia Pacific Foundation has been monitoring the militant networks in Afghanistan for years. He says ""several major attacks between 2019 and 2021 involved collaboration between IS-K, the Taliban's Haqqani network and other terror groups based in Pakistan"". When the Taliban took over in Kabul on 15 August, the group released large numbers of prisoners from Pul-e-Charki jail, reportedly including IS and al-Qaeda militants. These people are now at large. But IS-K have major differences with the Taliban, accusing them of abandoning Jihad and the battlefield in favour of a negotiated peace settlement hammered out in ""posh hotels"" in Doha, Qatar. IS-K considers Taliban militants ""apostates"", making their killing lawful under their interpretation of Islamic law. IS militants now represent a major security challenge for the incoming Taliban government, something the Taliban leadership shares in common with Western intelligence agencies. Who are the Taliban?
