"Breaking|Breaking newsCold War novelist John le CarrÃ© dies aged 89The Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy author died following a short illness, his agent says.Entertainment & Arts","British espionage writer John le CarrÃ© has died aged 89, following a short illness, his literary agent has said. The author of The Spy Who Came In From The Cold and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy died from pneumonia on Saturday. Fellow authors paid tribute, with Stephen King calling him ""a literary giant and a humanitarian spirit"". Historical fiction writer Robert Harris said le CarrÃ©, who chronicled the world of Cold War spies, was ""one of the great post-war British novelists"". Booker Prize winner Margaret Atwood tweeted that his novels featuring spymaster George Smiley - described by le CarrÃ© as an ""antidote"" to James Bond - were the ""key to understanding the mid-20th Century"". Historian and novelist Simon Sebag Montefiore described le CarrÃ© as ""the titan of English literature"" and said he was ""heartbroken"". Tributes to 'brilliant, captivating' author Obituary: The spy who turned into a novelist John le CarrÃ© on why 'politicians love chaos' Jonny Geller, the author's agent, said he was an ""undisputed giant of English literature"" who ""defined the Cold War era and fearlessly spoke truth to power"". ""We will not see his like again,"" he said in a statement. Mr Geller said he represented the novelist, whose real name was David Cornwell, for almost 15 years and ""his loss will be felt by every book lover, everyone interested in the human condition"". ""We have lost a great figure of English literature, a man of great wit, kindness, humour and intelligence. I have lost a friend, a mentor and an inspiration."" Le CarrÃ©'s novels drew on his experience working for the British intelligence services The Night Manager was a major BBC series A statement shared on behalf of the author's family said: ""It is with great sadness that we must confirm that David Cornwell - John le CarrÃ© - passed away from pneumonia last Saturday night after a short battle with the illness. ""David is survived by his beloved wife of almost 50 years, Jane, and his sons Nicholas, Timothy, Stephen and Simon. ""We all grieve deeply his passing. Our thanks go to the wonderful NHS team at the Royal Cornwall Hospital in Truro for the care and compassion that he was shown throughout his stay. We know they share our sadness."" The statement said his death was not Covid-19 related. The decades after the end of World War Two in 1945 were dominated by political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union, along with their respective allies in the Western bloc and the Eastern bloc. Both sides were armed with nuclear weapons, discouraging direct warfare because of the risk that both would be totally destroyed. So until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the hostility played out in support for regional conflicts known as proxy wars, propaganda campaigns, psychological warfare and espionage - creating the inspiration for a generation of spy novels and films. Several of le CarrÃ©'s 25 works were turned into films including The Constant Gardener, The Tailor of Panama and Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, while the Night Manager became a successfulBBC television series. Smiley, his most famous character who first appeared in Call for the Dead, has been played by actors including Rupert Davies, Alec Guinness and Gary Oldman. Oldman, who appeared in the 2011 film of Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, said le CarrÃ© was ""a very great author, the true 'owner' of the serious, adult, complicated, spy novel"" and was ""always a true gentleman"". This video can not be played In an interview last year, John le CarrÃ© talked about the conflict between personal and state obligation Born as David Cornwell in Poole, Dorset, in 1931, he wrote under the pseudonym of John le CarrÃ©. He studied at the university of Bern, in Switzerland, and then Oxford, before entering a career in undercover intelligence. After teaching at Eton for two years he joined the Foreign Office, and was initially based at the British Embassy in Bonn. During his time there he worked in the intelligence records department, giving him access to files with insights into the workings of the secret service. He also wrote his first novel, Call For The Dead, which was published in 1961. This meant the need for a pen name as Foreign Office officials were not allowed to publish books under their own name. In 1963, his third novel, The Spy Who Came In From The Cold, brought him worldwide acclaim and allowed him to take up writing full time. Le CarrÃ© said his manuscript was approved by the secret service because they ""rightly if reluctantly"" concluded it was ""sheer fiction from start to finish"" but he said the world's press took a different view, deciding the book was ""not merely authentic but some kind of revelatory Message From The Other Side"". His career as a spy came to an end in 1964 after his name was one of many given to the Soviet Union by a double agent, an incident which inspired a plot line in Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy. Two things stand out about this prolific and hugely successful author. Firstly, his novels were the very antithesis of the glamorous, racy world of James Bond as depicted by fellow author Ian Fleming. Whether it was the grim reality of waiting hours for an agent to cross back into West Berlin in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold, or the drab, grey world of Cold War MI6 that he describes in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, le CarrÃ© stripped away the glitz to reveal a world of fallible, flawed characters. Secondly, there is his extraordinary longevity. Le CarrÃ©, who spent a relatively brief period with MI6, published his first novel in the same year that the Berlin Wall went up: 1961. Yet long after the Cold War ended, decades later, he went on to diversify into writing about the arms trade, Big Pharma and the so-called War on Terror. On the few occasions I met him he seemed genuinely surprised at his own extraordinary success. Le CarrÃ© turned down literary honours and a knighthood, saying in a 2017 US interview that he was ""so suspicious of the literary world that I don't want its accolades"". ""And least of all do I want to be called Commander of the British Empire or any other thing of the British Empire,"" he added, saying it was ""emetic"" or vomit-inducing. He told CBS News' 60 Minutes: ""I don't want to posture as someone who's been honoured by the state and must therefore somehow conform with the state, and I don't want to wear the armour."" Le CarrÃ© described himself as ""English to the core"" but deplored what he saw as the aggressive nationalistic sentiment behind Brexit. ""My England would be the one that recognises its place in the EU. The jingoistic England that is trying to march us out of the EU, that is an England I don't want to know,"" he said.

Nigeria gunmen who seized children 'surrounded',"This video can not be played Bint'a Ismail: ""I have a child and younger brother who've been taken"" Nigerian government troops have surrounded the area where gunmen are believed to be holding schoolchildren hostage in north-western Katsina state. It is not clear how many students were abducted, and how many ran away during the attack and have not yet been found. About 800 pupils were enrolled at the all-boys school and about half remain unaccounted for. The attackers are thought to be seeking ransom, an aide to President Muhammadu Buhari has said. The government has blamed the attack on bandits, a loose term for gangs operating in the area. Amnesty International says more than 1,100 people were killed by bandits in northern Nigeria in the first six months of this year, with the government failing to bring the attackers to justice. The motorcycle bandits terrorising northern Nigeria BBC Nigeria correspondent Mayeni Jones says there is growing concern about insecurity across Nigeria. The north-west was affected by kidnappings for ransom, the north-east by an insurgency by militant Islamists, and the south by attacks on oil facilities by groups demanding a greater share of oil revenue for the region, she adds. Parents are anxiously waiting at the school for news about about their children Parents have gathered at the school in the Kankara area, pleading with the authorities to help find their children, Reuters news agency reported. Abubakar Lawal was quoted as saying that two of his three sons at the school, known as the Government Science Secondary School, were missing. More than 300 children are reportedly still missing, according to an official from the state. Osama Aminu Maale, a student who escaped the abductors and returned to his parents, told the AFP news agency that hundreds of students had been taken. ""After they took us away we stopped inside the bus where they made the older students take a headcount. We counted 520,"" the 18-year-old student said. The hostages were then split into groups before Mr Maale and four others escaped. ""One of the gunmen hit me repeatedly when I failed to keep up with the rest of the group due to my failing health before he let me trail behind, giving me the chance to escape,"" he said. On Saturday, the military said it had located the gunmen's hideout in a forest and had exchanged gunfire with them. In a BBC interview, Garba Shehu, the president's spokesman, said there was a ""massive deployment"" of troops to rescue the abducted children. ""Military commanders on the ground have the coordinates of where they believe the bandits are, and whoever they are holding. They have surrounded all of that area,"" he added. Security at the school has been strengthened following the attack President Buhari comes from the state, and is currently there on a private visit. He was being briefed hourly on efforts to rescue the children, Mr Shehu said. ""The criminal elements, bandits, will be crushed. They will be eliminated,"" he added. School authorities are speaking to parents to establish how many students have returned home and how many others could still be scattered across a large area after fleeing the attack. The school is in a remote area in north-western Nigeria Residents living near the school told the BBC they heard gunfire at about 23:00 (22:00 GMT) on Friday, and that the attack lasted for more than an hour. Security personnel at the school managed to repel some of the attackers before police reinforcements arrived, officials said. Police said that during an exchange of fire, some of the gunmen were forced to retreat. Students were able to scale the fence of the school and run to safety, they said. Nduka Orjinmo, BBC News, Lagos In Nigeria's north-west, ""bandits"" is a catch-all phrase covering Fulani herdsmen, armed vigilante groups and even Islamist insurgents fleeing the insurgency in the north-east. Some of the leaders of these bandit groups, who engage in kidnapping and attacking farming communities, have openly met governors and other state authorities during failed negotiations for truce. But this is the first time bandits have abducted hundreds of students from a school - a tactic that has been used in the past by groups like Boko Haram and Iswap, raising fears that these criminal groups in Nigeria's north-west are copying the Islamist militants. Most of the kidnappings by ""bandits"" are done for ransom so many are hoping that this will be resolved soon - if security operatives fail to rescue the students, with money changing hands, unlike the case of the Chibok girls where some are still being held in captivity. Many Nigerians have criticised President Muhammadu Buhari, who was in his home town of Daura less than 200km (125 miles) away, for not going to the scene of the incident. That the bandits could dare to stage, and successfully carry out, such an operation with the president and his vast security paraphernalia in the area has shocked many. Several local residents joined the police in searching for the students, while many parents said they had withdrawn their children from the school. ""The school is deserted, all the students have vacated,"" one witness, Nura Abdullahi, told AFP news agency. The governor of Katsina, Aminu Bello Massari, ordered the immediate closure of all boarding schools in the state.

Nagorno-Karabakh conflict flares despite ceasefireThe tension comes after a six-week war killed thousands over the disputed territory in the Caucasus.,"This video can not be played This family is one of many still waiting for news about a missing relative Four soldiers from Azerbaijan have been killed in clashes in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, Azerbaijan's defence ministry says. The reports come only weeks after a six-week war over the territory which ended when Azerbaijan and Armenia signed a ceasefire. Armenia meanwhile said six of its own troops were wounded in what it called an Azerbaijani military offensive. Nagorno-Karabakh has long been a trigger for violence between the two. The region is recognised as part of Azerbaijan but has been run by ethnic Armenians since 1994 after the two countries fought a war over the territory which left thousands dead. A Russian-brokered truce failed to bring about lasting peace and the area, claimed by both sides, has been prone to intermittent clashes. This video can not be played Nagorno-Karabakh: The families burning down their own homes Signed on 9 November, it locked in the territorial gains Azerbaijan made during the war, including the region's second-largest city Shusha Armenia promised to withdraw troops from three areas 2,000 Russian peacekeepers deployed to the region Azerbaijan also gained a overland route to Turkey, its ally, by gaining access to a road link to an Azeri conflict on the Iran-Turkey border called Nakhchivan The BBC's Orla Guerin said that, overall, the deal was regarded as avictory for Azerbaijan and a defeat for Armenia The latest conflict began at the end of September,killing around 5,000 soldiers on both sides. At least 143 civilians died and thousands were displaced when their homes were damaged or soldiers entered their communities. Why did Armenia and Azerbaijan go to war? Russian influence under threat in its own backyard Both countries have accused the other of violating the terms of the November peace deal and the latest hostilities flout the ceasefire.

Pro-Trump rallies see scuffles in US cities,"Thousands gathered to hear speeches in Washington DC Thousands of Donald Trump supporters alleging electoral fraud converged on several US cities and towns on Saturday and there were isolated scuffles with counter-demonstrators. In Washington DC, more than 20 people were arrested and four people were stabbed, police said. Mr Trump lost the 3 November election to Joe Biden but is yet to concede. The Electoral College, the system which elects US presidents, is due to endorse Mr Biden's victory on Monday. Mr Biden won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the Electoral College, and gained over seven million more votes than his Republican rival in the popular vote. In the nation's capital, police sought to keep the two sides apart, a strategy that included sealing off Black Lives Matter Plaza where counter-demonstrators had gathered. Pro-Trump demonstrators, rallying under the banner of ""Stop the Steal"", were joined by members of the far-right Proud Boys, dressed in yellow and black, many wearing bullet-proof vests. Mr Trump caused controversy by saying the group should ""stand back and stand by"" during a September presidential debate, though he later condemned ""all white supremacists"". Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Can Trump overturn the election result? As night fell, Proud Boys and Antifa counter-demonstrators, mostly separated by police lines, yelled insults at each other. But sporadic violence broke out. The stabbings took place near the downtown Harry's Bar, butit was not clear which group those injured belonged to, according to the Washington Post.,external Eight people were taken to hospitals, including two police officers,according to CNN.,external Make America Great Again (MAGA) protesters, who support Mr Trump, were captured on video tearing down a Black Lives Matter sign from a church, pouring petrol on it and setting it alight. On Sunday the Ashbury church pastor compared the actions to cross burnings. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Seeing this act on video made me both indignant and determined to fight the evil that has reared its ugly head,"" Rev Ianther Mills said in a statement. Counter-demonstrators were kept at a distance from Trump supporters by Washington DC police Far-right Proud Boys made gestures symbolising white supremacy as they gathered near the Washington Monument Rallies also took place in Olympia, the capital of Washington state, Atlanta and St Paul, Minnesota. Police in Olympia said one person had been shot and three arrested as rival groups clashed. The Washington DC rally attracted several thousand Trump-supporters but it was smaller than a similar event on 14 November. Few participants wore masks despite Covid-19 restrictions. There were speeches by Mr Trump's now pardoned former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, and Sebastian Gorka, another former White House official. Mr Trump's pardoned former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, was among those making speeches Mr Gorka urged the president not to give up his legal campaign - based on debunked allegations of electoral fraud - to reverse the election result. The president's latest legal defeat came on Friday whenthe Supreme Court rejected an unprecedented attempt to throw out results in four battleground stateswhich Mr Biden won. Mr Trump has now lost more than 50 cases linked to the election. Cheers erupted as the presidential helicopter, Marine One, flew over the Washington rally carrying Mr Trump to the Army-Navy football game at West Point, New York. The president had earlier tweeted his support. General Flynn likened the protesters to soldiers and priests breaching the walls of Jericho, echoing the rally organisers' call for ""Jericho Marches"" to overturn the election result. That refers toa story in the biblewhere an army peacefully conquer the city of Jericho, which God has promised them, after marching around its walls for six days. It is considered symbolic of a test of faith. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Health board's 'alarming' rise in Covid patientsFirst Minister Mark Drakeford warns the NHS risks becoming the ""national coronavirus service"".Wales","Aneurin Bevan Health Board said its hospitals faced ""significant pressure"" Coronavirus cases in one part of Wales are increasing at an ""alarming rate"", a health board has said. Aneurin Bevan health board said its hospitals were under ""significant"" pressure due to Covid patient numbers. It had already announced it would behalting outpatient appointments and non-urgent planned surgeryfrom Monday. The stark warning comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales' NHS was in danger of becoming the ""national coronavirus service"". On Saturday,the day the number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales, the family of Ted Edwards, 73, from Monmouthshire, said they were ""really concerned"" after hespent more than 19 hours in an ambulanceoutside the Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran. The Welsh Ambulance Service said it was ""facing high demand"" across the country ""with acute pressure"" around the hospital leading to ""some long delays with patients on our ambulances"". Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet Did Wales' firebreak lockdown work? Thousands have had Covid vaccine in Wales The health board said: ""The number of Covid positive patients in our communities is increasing at an alarming rate and we need everyone to play their part to ensure our services are available for when our sickest patients need them."" Weekly infection rates across the five south Wales counties the health board covers averaged about 550 cases for every 100,000 people. Meanwhile, Swansea Bay University Health Board tweeted that it now hasnearly 240 Covid-19 patients,externalin its hospitals, with a warning infection rates in its communities were ""exceptionally high"". Speaking about the threat faced by the NHS, Mr Drakeford said unless ""we take all the action we can [not just] as a government, but as a population"", even more restrictions would be ""unavoidable"". ""The huge danger here is that we transform our National Health Service into a national coronavirus service. ""If the numbers continue to go up as they are, then we will end up diverting our staff resources away from all the things that we expect and need them to do, simply to take care of an ever-rising number of people who are so ill with this dreadful disease that they have to be looked after in hospital.

Covid mass testing a 'massive waste of resources',"Test centres in the Lower Cynon Valley in Rhondda Cynon Taf will run until 20 December Continuing mass testing in Wales could be a ""massive-scale of waste of resources"", a leading public health expert has said. Figures show less than 1.5% of people were testing positive as part ofpilots in Merthyr Tydfiland thelower Cynon Valley. Dr Angela Raffle said there was little evidence to suggest it helped cut transmission. First Minister Mark Drakeford said mass testing ""has a part to play"". Dr Raffle, a senior lecturer in population sciences at Bristol University, said mass testing was ""incredibly resource intensive"". ""We simply don't know whether you'll find enough cases who would have transmitted a lot, and who don't [transmit Covid-19] simply because you found them,"" she said. ""And we don't know whether telling lots of people they're negative could actually undermine any potential benefit. ""It could be the most massive scale of waste of resources."" Second mass testing phase to tackle Covid hotspot Hundreds queue as mass testing begins in Wales Dr Raffle said there were also concerns around the accuracy of thelateral flow tests, which are being used within mass testing schemes and produce results in as little as 20 minutes. Nearly 1,000 people were tested in the first day the scheme was held in Merthyr Tydfil in November In labs, lateral flow tests were found to be about 70% effective at detecting positive cases, but Dr Raffle said pilots,such as one in Liverpool, found them to be much lower. ""The UK government said, initially, that the test had been extensively evaluated,"" she toldPolitics Wales. ""What we know from Liverpool is that the test centres there only picked up half of the positives."" Under-pressure health board halts non-urgent care Post-Christmas lockdown warning for Wales However, executive director of public health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, said the pilots in Wales had been a success so far ""We've been delighted at the amount of engagement we've had,"" he said. ""In our pilot we found about 70% sensitivity, which means that if you have 10 people who are actually infected, the test will pick up seven of them."" Dr Nnoaham added there was ""a risk around false negatives"" which affected the health board's messaging around the tests. In Liverpool, theintroduction of mass testingwas cited by both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock as being behind a sharp drop in case rates. Merthyr Tydfil has seen some of the highest rates of Covid-19 in the UK In Merthyr Tydfil, the number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 peoplehas risen from 245.3, when mass testing was introduced, to 808.9. Dr Raffle said if mass testing was ""really breaking the chain"" then, in theory, cases should start to fall. But Dr Nnoaham said the increase in cases was reflective of rises across the whole of Wales and the impact of mass testing would not be evident ""for another few weeks"". Mr Drakeford said: ""We are sure that mass testing has a part to play. We will evaluate what we have done in Merthyr, we will learn from what is going on in the Cynon Valley, we will see how best to use it. ""But the idea that it is not a useful tool in the armoury is one that simply doesn't bear examination. ""I hope that we will be able to take the positive learning from Merthyr. Merthyr has been a fantastic effort by the local council, by the local health board, by the local population. Lisa Mytton, deputy leader of Merthyr Council, said mass testing was ""definitely working"" and would be extended by a week to 19 December. She said any rise in Covid figures was concerning but the numbers were ""positive in some lights as it shows people have come to the testing and shown they were asymptomatic but were actually carrying the virus around"". ""It is still vitally important to keep the message going"" in regards to social distancing as ""this virus knows no regulations and it knows no boundaries,"" she added. ""We will learn a lot about how to do it elsewhere and to use those lateral flow devices in the most effective way."" Plaid Cymru's spokesman on health, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said mass testing should be expanded across Wales. He said Slovakia was the ""best example"", where he said they tested 97% of the population aged 10-65 years old and reduced infection rates by 60%. ""We would like to see Welsh Government looking at what the practicalities would be of running that kind of system in Wales,"" he said. Andrew RT Davies, Conservative spokesman on health in the Senedd, said mass testing was ""an important tool"" to suppress the virus, but not ""the only solution"". ""The battle with the testing regime is being won,"" he added. ""What we've got to do is complement it with the vaccine regime and make sure that the resources don't get put into the wrong places.""

Britons told not to stockpile food ahead of January,"Households have been warned not to stockpile food and toilet roll ahead of 1 January when the UK stops trading under EU rules. On Sunday, the UK and the EU agreed to extend a deadline aimed at reaching a deal on post-Brexit trade. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) said ongoing uncertainty made it harder for firms to prepare for the New Year. But it said shops had plenty of supplies and shoppers must not buy more food than usual. ""Retailers are doing everything they can to prepare for all eventualities on 1 January - increasing the stock of tins, toilet rolls and other longer life products so there will be sufficient supply of essential products,"" said BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson. ""While no amount of preparation by retailers can entirely prevent disruption there is no need for the public to buy more food than usual as the main impact will be on imported fresh produce, such as fresh fruit and vegetables, which cannot be stored for long periods by either retailers or consumers."" Supermarkets are now used to dealing with anxious shoppers. Supermarkets had to impose limits on some goods during coronavirus lockdowns this year During the first lockdown earlier this year to stop the spread of the coronavirus, grocers introduced limits on goods such as toilet roll, dried pasta and UHT milk after panic buying by Britons. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? There are fears shoppers might think disruption at ports after 31 December could lead to shortages in shops as the UK transitions to new trading rules with the EU. The UK and the EU have agreed to carry on trade talks past Sunday's deadline. Could Brexit make my food more expensive? What does a no-deal 'Australia-style' Brexit mean? Brexit trade deal: What are the sticking points? In a joint statement, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said it was ""responsible at this point to go the extra mile"". But Mr Johnson told the BBC the two sides are ""still very far part on some key things"", and said the ""most likely"" course isan Australian-style trade deal with the EU. He admitted that this type of deal ""it is not where we wanted to get to but if we have to end up with that solution the UK is more than prepared"". However, Ms Dickinson warned: ""Without a deal, the British public will face over Â£3bn in food tariffs and retailers would have no choice but to pass on some of these additional costs to their customers who would see higher prices filter though during 2021."" Other business groups welcomed the extension to trade talks but also cautioned that it was imperative that the UK avoid a no deal Brexit with the EU. ""The news that talks will continue gives hope,"" said Tony Danker, director-general of the CBI business lobby group. ""A deal is both essential and possible."" This torture is better than no deal. The fact that talks are ongoing is a good thing. Business groups are unanimous in their view that if a deal is at all possible, it should be pursued with every last effort. However, the problem with this uncertainty is two-fold. First, political and business timetables are getting increasingly misaligned by the day. Businesses need to know whether tariffs are coming or not as it effects pricing of products and services for next year. How can firms place or take an order if they don't know what that price needs to be? Second, there is a danger that businesses who watch this process being dragged out will take their eye off the ball while waiting for some rabbit to appear out of the hat. No deal is very bad but a deal still leaves an awful lot of work to do in preparing for new procedures, for example customs, that will change in any event. But the fact remains that while this may be torture, it could be worse. No deal would not put UK business out of its misery - it could put some sectors out of business. While Mr Danker said that ""ongoing delays are frustrating and cost businesses,"" he urged the government to ""make use of the time"". ""Government must move with even more determination to avoid the looming cliff edge of 1 January."" British Chambers of Commerce director general Adam Marshall said it is a ""very frustrating time for business"". But he added: ""If a few more hours or days makes the difference, keep going and get an agreement that delivers clarity and certainty to businesses and trade on both sides. Businesses will need time and support to adjust in a New Year like no other - whatever the eventual outcome."" Mike Hawes, head of the motor industry's trade body, the SMMT, said that although it was good the two sides will continue to talk, they must now ""finish the job"". A no-deal ""would be nothing less than catastrophic for the automotive sector, its workers and their families and represent a stunning failure of statecraft. Quite simply, it has to be ruled out,"" he said. And Make UK, the manufacturers' trade body, said that after more than four years of uncertainty ""UK manufacturers are now facing the most challenging start to the New Year, dealing with a pandemic and the risk of having no trading arrangement with our largest market"". News that talks will continue pushed sterling higher against the euro and dollar, although trading on Sunday would have been limited. Against the dollar, the pound rose 1.1% to $1.3360, compared with Friday's close. Against the euro, it strengthened 1% to 90.58 pence. Sterling fell to a one-month low last week on fears Britain would leave the EU without a deal. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

âI was in prison at 20 - and a music executive by 28â,"As he faced a long jail sentence, the life Niyah Smith had once dreamed of looked impossible. But the chance to turn his fortunes around came sooner than he expected. On a warm London afternoon, a black Audi A3 cruised slowly along a ring road. Four young men were inside, and they'd all just travelled to Birmingham and back. From his back seat, a 20-year-old named Niyah Smith looked up at the rear-view mirror and noticed a police car approaching. The friend sitting directly in front of Niyah had spotted it too. ""Everyone just relax,"" he told the other passengers. The date was 19 June 2012. Apart from a few minor driving offences, Niyah had never been in trouble with the law. He had grown up in a tower block in Homerton, east London, at a time when the area had a reputation for violent crime and gangs, but his mother had always had higher aspirations for Niyah. At school he'd done her proud, earning good grades. He loved music and was a skilled pianist. He was at college now, working as a tennis coach to fund his studies. The police car overtook and flashed its lights, a signal to pull over. Niyah realised all the traffic ahead had stopped too. Then, as the Audi came to a halt, he saw more police cars surrounding it and armed officers emerging from them. They trained their guns at the Audi and ordered everyone inside to put their hands up. As Niyah remembers it, the passenger in front of him tried to open the door, as if to escape. But officers opened the other front door and fired a Taser at him before dragging him out to the ground. After seeing this, Niyah did as he was told. He left the car with his hands raised and was quickly handcuffed. From a grass verge, he watched as police searched the car. Soon, underneath the passenger seat, directly in front of where Niyah had been sitting, they found what they were looking for. When Niyah first arrived at HM Prison Feltham, the young offenders' institution in west London where he would spend his time on remand, he hadn't yet processed the shock of his arrest. Inside Feltham, his disorientation would only grow more acute. With its byzantine rules and systems, its sprawling corridors and landings, it felt as though he'd entered another world. Before he was led on to the reception wing, a prison officer ran through a list of prison regulations. Everything was new to Niyah - concepts like daily association, earning privileges. He hadn't shared a room since he was eight, when his eldest brother had moved out, but now he was told he'd have a cellmate. Niyah wondered if they'd get along, whether the other guy would snore. He kept checking his pocket for a mobile phone that wasn't there. He wondered whether he was going to survive this. Now he'd have plenty time to reflect on how he'd ended up in Feltham. He thought about his mother, who'd worked two jobs to support the family single-handedly, and how this had been the last thing she'd wanted for him. It hadn't just been his academic and musical talents she'd encouraged. She'd also ensured he made the most of his gift for tennis. Until the age of 13, most of his free time was devoted to the game - honing his technique, keeping fit, travelling to tournaments across England. At his peak he was ranked in the top 100 for his age in the country. It had kept him off the streets and out of trouble. Niyah aged nine And then one day, during an illicit game of football - aspiring young tennis stars weren't meant to take risks like this - a stray tackle left him with a broken leg. This didn't just end his hopes of a tennis career, it made it impossible for him to get across the city on crutches to school every day. He never stopped studying - he'd stay in the tower block with his books, and a tutor would come to visit - but as the fracture healed over 18 months, he gradually lost touch with his school classmates, who, like him, were generally of an academic disposition. Now he would spend more time with another group of friends, the ones he'd grown up alongside on the streets of Homerton. While Niyah had hardly had a privileged upbringing, these boys had had it tougher. Some had lost both parents and ended up in foster care, others had dyslexia that had never been treated and had never been encouraged to study. ""Back then, it wasn't the best place to live,"" he says. ""Every other day, someone's getting stabbed, someone's getting shot."" Niyah says he and his friends in Homerton never saw themselves as a gang, exactly. They'd hang out together in a group, go on bike rides, have rap battles in the street. They might have looked like a gang to the police patrol cars that would cruise past them, however. And as time went on, they stayed together for protection as well as company. London's notorious postcode wars meant it wasn't a good idea to wander around on your own in case a group of kids from another area spotted you. And if they did and you got beaten up, the unwritten code dictated that you couldn't go to the police about it, you had to get your own back. Fights grew from one-on-ones to five against five, and then the brawls would get bigger still. Some of Niyah's friends were arrested for carrying baseball bats and knives. He knew that some of them were caught up in more serious criminal activity too. But Niyah himself had mostly stayed out of trouble. He'd won a place on a music business course at a nearby college - he'd grown up in a home where the sounds of reggae and R&B were all around, and he hoped he might make a career in the industry somehow. Then one day one of his friends suggested a group of them drive to Birmingham and back. ""Why not?"" thought Niyah. He didn't have anything else on that day. Niyah was getting used to life in Feltham. The rules were starting to make sense and he kept out of trouble. To his relief, his cellmate had turned out to be a good guy - he was a first-time inmate too, and the two of them bonded over what was a new experience for both of them. To make the most of his time inside, Niyah signed up to a series of courses: painting and decorating, carpentry, auto mechanics. There was another course he was desperate to get a place on - a music course. Here in Feltham, incredibly, there was a state-of-the-art studio which inmates could learn how to operate. But all the places were taken. Every night, as he played table tennis or watched EastEnders, Niyah thought about how great it would be to get on it. At least it was a distraction from his looming court appearance. That wasn't looking good for Niyah. When they'd first met, his solicitor had turned up with a huge bundle of files. It was the case that had been assembled against him. It turned out one of his friends in the car - the one sitting in front of him - had been under police surveillance for two years. The Audi had been tailed all the way to the Midlands and back. After the car had been pulled over, the police had found a pair of latex gloves and a bandana wrapped around a Baikal handgun loaded with seven rounds of ammunition. The charge was possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life, and the maximum sentence was 14 years. Niyah told the solicitor he hadn't known about the gun. The solicitor explained that as it applied at the time, the controversial law of ""joint enterprise"" didn't help his case. Prosecutors said they had forensic evidence linking him to the gun, which Niyah says didn't make any sense to him - he told his lawyer he hadn't touched or even seen it. Niyah's solicitor told him there was a possible way out - he might have a chance of being acquitted if he pinned the blame on his friend. Was he willing to do that? His family urged him to take the lawyer's advice. But Niyah felt deeply uneasy. ""I said I'm not going to, because these are people that I've known forever."" As Autumn 2012 wore on and the trial grew closer, he thought about what to do. If he went to trial, pleaded not guilty and lost, the solicitor told him he was looking at a minimum of 10 years. If he pleaded guilty, he was looking at between seven and nine. It would be the hardest decision of his life. And then with barely six weeks to go before the trial, Niyah received one rare glimmer of good news. He'd been accepted on to Feltham's music course. The night before it began, Niyah barely slept. For once he was thinking not about the trial, and the next decade of his life behind bars, but about all the techniques he could master, the sounds he could create. On the first morning of the course, Niyah noticed that some of the other prisoners saw the studio as a place to sit around and chill out, but he was there to learn. The tutor was David Smart, an experienced sound engineer who had run his own studio in Hackney before joining the prison service. He'd taught hundreds of young inmates, but Niyah wasn't like the others. ""There was something different about him,"" recalls Smart. ""He was just fascinated by what could be done. 'Why do you use that effect? How does that effect work?' His inquisitive nature really stood out."" The course was divided into two - sound engineering and song-writing. Niyah began learning how to record, mix and make a track sound good on the radio. He experimented with making his own beats in the studio, and recorded other inmates rapping over the top of them. There were guitars and a drum kit that he could play for the first time. When he left he could take away a CD of the music he had created. It would be proof that he could master a professional studio. ""I just wanted to learn everything,"" he says. ""I didn't feel like I was in prison - I was waking up and going to a recording studio every day."" Then it was time to go to Wood Green Crown Court. As he sat in the dock, Niyah's hands felt as though they were burning. Since his arrest, his hair had grown long and unkempt. His mother, his cousin and his sister were in the room too, but Niyah tried not to look at them. Niyah had decided to plead guilty. ""I have to accept that I put myself in that situation,"" he says. He felt he had to take responsibility for getting in the car with his friends, knowing the lifestyle they were leading. The punishment felt harsh, but he accepted he was culpable. ""It was my choice not to cut them off. It was my choice to still be around them. So I have to accept my consequences."" He recalls the judge telling him how puzzled he was to see Niyah in front of him for those offences, with no previous convictions of any significance. Then the sentence was handed down: eight-and-a-half years. It sounded like a lifetime to Niyah. With good behaviour, he might be out in four-and-a-quarter. But that felt like forever. He didn't think his girlfriend would wait all that time for him. He had to work out how to make the most of his time inside. But he still had unfinished business in Feltham. Niyah was on his way back to his cell. Now he'd been given his sentence, he'd been told that within days he'd be taken away to another prison. It would give him just enough time to finish off the CD he was making of other prisoners rapping over the beats he'd programmed. But when he arrived, a prison officer told him there had been a change of plan. He would be moved to another young offenders' institution, HMP Littlehey in Cambridgeshire, the next day. Niyah pleaded with Smart to give him an hour in the studio to finish everything off. ""I needed to take what I'd created with me,"" he says. ""I was willing to go to any length to get it."" But Smart had a class to teach. Early on his final day in Feltham, with his bags packed for the move, Niyah managed to complete his final mix. But there wasn't time for him to burn the CD - Smart would have to do it for him while Niyah was being checked out of the prison. Worn down by Niyah's pleas, Smart found another tutor to take charge of his class. ""I'll be real with you - I wouldn't do this for many people but I had to do it for Niyah,"" says Smart. An officer led Niyah to reception. As the final paperwork was completed, he looked around: he still couldn't see Smart. As he was about to be taken to the van that would drive him away from Feltham forever, there was still no sign. And then suddenly the tutor appeared. ""I've got it, I've got it here,"" he said. As the van drove him to Littlehey, Niyah couldn't stop smiling. ""I know I was going away, I know I was doing the sentence - but I was happy, because I'd left with something good,"" he says. When Niyah arrived, he looked around the cell he would have to himself - there was no sharing at Littlehey. It was just before Christmas 2012. He knew how tough it would be spending it without his family. Because he'd been convicted of such a serious charge - possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life - Niyah was classed as being at a high risk of reoffending. He was determined to prove this assessment wrong. The music he'd created had given him an impetus: he knew he could do more with his life than spend it in prison. He signed up to every course he could - English, maths, business studies, plumbing, software. One day in the gym, he challenged a member of staff to a game of tennis. When the staff member saw how good Niyah was, he offered him a job as a gym orderly - one of the most coveted positions an inmate could hold. By January 2014, Niyah was 21 years and 10 months old. It was time to move him to an adult prison. He spent six months at Highpoint in Suffolk and then was transferred to nearby Warren Hill, where he worked as a wing cleaner and kept his head down. By September that year he had spent two years inside. He had stayed out of trouble, hadn't got into any fights. He would now be a category D prisoner, eligible for open conditions. When he arrived at HMP Hollesley Bay, Niyah realised how institutionalised he'd become. He wasn't used to being in a place where the doors were never locked. He'd grown accustomed to his cell door being shut behind him at 7pm each evening and a key being turned. Now he had the freedom to come and go, as long as he was back between 11pm and 7am. ""Open prison took me a while to get my head around,"" he says. Some other prisoners hadn't adapted well to their new-found freedom. They'd break the rules by smuggling in a phone or ordering in food: ""I stayed away from all that,"" he says. He didn't want to throw away the progress he'd made. But he also knew this was a foretaste of what awaited him outside prison - how easy it would be to get drawn back into a criminal environment. He studied for a Heavy Goods Vehicle licence in the hope it would offer a steady job. It was a decision that paid off. Two weeks after he was released in 2016, he secured a job as a delivery driver with a catering company. He took night shifts so he could devote his days to breaking into the music business. One of the first calls he made was to David Smart, his old music tutor from Feltham. When Smart answered the phone, he was delighted to hear from Niyah - he'd he hadn't forgotten the young inmate who'd come to his studio, who'd looked overjoyed when he appeared with the CD on his last day. Smart had stopped working in Feltham, and now he was doing studio work on the outside as well as mentoring ex-prisoners. He offered Niyah regular sessions as an engineer, which he accepted with alacrity. But Niyah had ambitions beyond the mixing desk. He realised his drive and focus might serve him better as a manager than as a producer. He immersed himself in east London's music scene - grime, R&B, pop, jazz. Niyah with the rapper SNE backstage at the Camden Roundhouse in January 2017 Whenever he had time between shifts he'd attend gigs, or trawl YouTube and Soundcloud looking for unsigned acts. If he thought they had potential, he'd offer them his services. One of the artists he was in touch with around this time was a young singer, songwriter and rapper called Stephanie Victoria Allen, who performed as Stefflon Don. She and Niyah went back a long way together - she was the ex-partner of one of Niyah's best friends, and Niyah and her ex-partner helped her out, booking studios, arranging photo shoots and so on. Niyah with Stefflon Don at the recording of her video for Real Ting Remix featuring Giggs When it became apparent she was going to become a big star, and would sign a deal with a major record company, she moved on to a more established team: ""We could only take her so far because we were fresh in the game,"" says Niyah. But she didn't forget what he'd done for her. When she signed her contract with Universal Records, part of the deal was that she was given her own subsidiary label to which she could sign her own acts, 54 London. She asked Niyah to find new artists for her to consider signing. This was an opportunity Niyah was determined not to pass up. He'd recently become a father for the first time - this was no longer just about realising his own ambitions, but providing the best possible life for his daughter. Stefflon Don with Niyah Smith at the club night in Ilford He organised a club night in Ilford, east London, with Steff and two other artists on the bill. He took charge of every detail - the promotion, the line-up, even the security. The venue sold out, and Niyah had passed his audition - in November 2018, she offered him a role as an artist and repertoire executive, responsible for finding and developing new talent. For many 28-year-olds, securing a role like this would be a dream come true - for one who spent over four years in prison it was even more remarkable. ""I'll never get back the four years and nine months I was away - for me, it's about not wasting any more time,"" Niyah says. He knew he couldn't change his past, but hoped others might find inspiration from the way that he transcended it: ""To others who are in the position I was - there is always hope.""

"Any deal better than no deal, first minister says","Mark Drakeford: ""If they strike a deal they will be able to go back and build on it"" A no-deal exit from the European Union would be ""catastrophic for Wales"", First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen haveagreed to extend Brexit trade talks past Sunday's deadline. ""Any deal is better than no deal,"" said Mr Drakeford. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said""political will""was needed for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade deal. Parliament's Welsh Affairs Committee said this week that there was a""significant risk""neither Holyhead nor Fishguard ports would have facilities ready for new customs checks needed from 1 January. LIVE: UK and EU to 'go extra mile' in post-Brexit talks What are Wales' preparations for no-deal Brexit? Mr Drakeford toldBBC Politics Wales: ""If they strike a deal they will be able to go back and build on it because they will find that the things that are not resolved will continue to be profoundly important to the United Kingdom and to the people who live here in Wales."" The former leader of the Vote Leave campaign in Wales, David Jones, has said the negotiators should ""by all means negotiate, if necessary, until the stroke of 11 o'clock on New Year's Eve"". Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, the Conservative MP for Clwyd West added: ""[Boris Johnson] must keep faith with the British people and resist any temptation to accept a sub-optimal deal that would cheat them of the sovereignty for which they voted. ""If the EU still refuses a deal that fully respects our hard-won independence, he should leave the table in the knowledge that he has the full support of his countrymen and women."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government would ""stand up ouremergency co-ordination centrein Wales over the next few days"". ""I signed off a rota on Friday where there will be a minister on duty day and night throughout the month of January,"" he added. ""We are working very hard on our responsibilities for traffic around the ports here in Wales. ""We will make sure that we have the best advice we can give businesses and others, but this is a disaster that is made in London, made by the Conservative Party."" The main sticking point in the talks is how close the UK should stick to EU economic rules in the future. The EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets - not paying taxes on goods being bought and sold - while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. Fishing rights is another major area of disagreement, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. Mr Raab said that, at this stage of negotiations, ""what really matters is the political will"". He told the BBC'sAndrew Marr programme: ""The bar is quite high for us to be able to keep talking. We would need at a political level a commitment to move on those two key issues. ""Never say never because EU negotiations can often drag and drift. But actually we do need finality and therefore we need at the political level of Ursula von der Leyen that there is clarity the EU will move on those two key issues. ""If we get that then there are still talks to be processed."" Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts accused the prime minister of ""playing fast and loose with people's jobs, and seems insensible to the harm his brinkmanship is causing"". She added: ""There is still time to offer some mature compromise ahead next week. Our farmers, manufacturers, our ports and others depend on him to show leadership.""

Automatic switching plan for fairer energy tariffsConsumers could be automatically switched to cheaper deals when their contracts end.,"Consumers could be automatically switched to better value energy tariffs under a plan to make the system fairer. The government says it wants to stop suppliers putting loyal customers on to the worst deals when their current contracts come to an end. It will be part of a wider plan to create a greener energy system, due to be unveiled next week. But one switching site warned the tariff proposals risked ""lulling people into a false sense of security"". According to some estimates, millions of households are currently stuck on their energy supplier's standard variable tariff, likely paying hundreds of pounds more than they should be. The government says it wants to crack down on this so-called ""loyalty penalty"" through two possible routes it plans to test: Opt-in switching - where consumers are offered a simple method of switching to a cheaper tariff if their initial contract has ended Or opt-out switching - where, unless they choose not to be, consumers are automatically switched to a competitive new contract if their initial contract has ended ""We do not believe that energy companies should be able to roll over contracts indefinitely or punish long standing, loyal customers,"" a Whitehall source said. ""That's why we're going to make it even easier for people to switch to cheaper tariffs and drive down bills so they can keep more money in their back pocket."" Households face Â£21 rise in energy bills in 2021 Switching website comparethemarket.com said the plans could offer a ""radical shake-up"" of the energy system which ""could be hugely beneficial"" for many households. But Peter Earl, head of energy at the site, said he was sceptical about an opt in/opt out system for switching tariffs with the same supplier. ""It might detract people from shopping around for a better deal with alternative and more competitive suppliers,"" he said. ""If these changes are not implemented properly they risk lulling people into a false sense of security that they are on the cheapest tariff, despite better offers being available elsewhere."" The government will also offer further protections for vulnerable energy customers, with the Warm Home Discount Scheme set to be extended to 2026 to cover an extra 750,000 households. It means nearly three million households would be eligible for the discount which cuts the electricity bills of eligible pensioners and low-income households by Â£140. The proposals are part of a new plan to make Britain's energy system greener as the country tries to become carbon neutral by 2050. It is expected to see major investment in offshore wind, clean hydrogen, carbon capture and storage and advanced nuclear. A Whitehall source said this would support up to 220,000 high-skilled jobs in the UK's ""industrial heartlands"".

Health board's 'alarming' rise in Covid patients,"Aneurin Bevan Health Board said its hospitals faced ""significant pressure"" Coronavirus cases in one part of Wales are increasing at an ""alarming rate"", a health board has said. Aneurin Bevan health board said its hospitals were under ""significant"" pressure due to Covid patient numbers. It had already announced it would behalting outpatient appointments and non-urgent planned surgeryfrom Monday. The stark warning comes as First Minister Mark Drakeford said Wales' NHS was in danger of becoming the ""national coronavirus service"". On Saturday,the day the number of positive Covid-19 tests passed 100,000 in Wales, the family of Ted Edwards, 73, from Monmouthshire, said they were ""really concerned"" after hespent more than 19 hours in an ambulanceoutside the Grange University Hospital in Cwmbran. The Welsh Ambulance Service said it was ""facing high demand"" across the country ""with acute pressure"" around the hospital leading to ""some long delays with patients on our ambulances"". Covid patients in hospitals at highest levels yet Did Wales' firebreak lockdown work? Thousands have had Covid vaccine in Wales The health board said: ""The number of Covid positive patients in our communities is increasing at an alarming rate and we need everyone to play their part to ensure our services are available for when our sickest patients need them."" Weekly infection rates across the five south Wales counties the health board covers averaged about 550 cases for every 100,000 people. Meanwhile, Swansea Bay University Health Board tweeted that it now hasnearly 240 Covid-19 patients,externalin its hospitals, with a warning infection rates in its communities were ""exceptionally high"". Speaking about the threat faced by the NHS, Mr Drakeford said unless ""we take all the action we can [not just] as a government, but as a population"", even more restrictions would be ""unavoidable"". ""The huge danger here is that we transform our National Health Service into a national coronavirus service. ""If the numbers continue to go up as they are, then we will end up diverting our staff resources away from all the things that we expect and need them to do, simply to take care of an ever-rising number of people who are so ill with this dreadful disease that they have to be looked after in hospital. ""We need our health service to be able to respond to all those other things that happen in people's lives in Wales. ""If the numbers continue to escalate in the way they are then, even more restrictions straight after Christmas seem to me to be unavoidable,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Sunday Supplement. This video can not be played This map shows how cases per 100,000 people across the 22 council areas in Wales have changed by day over the last two months He has previously said the coronavirus situation was""very difficult"" but not out of control. Last month, a senior doctor said in an email, seen by BBC Wales, that she had""huge concerns""about patient safety ahead of the Grange hospital opening four months ahead of schedule. But Mr Drakeford toldBBC Politics Wales""it was the right thing to open a hospital that was ready to open"". ""Imagine what it would be like in Aneurin Bevan [health board area] if we didn't have all the beds that are available today in the Grange hospital in addition to what is available,"" he added.

Christmas lockdown for Germany as virus spikes,"Christmas shopping has been blamed for the recent rise in cases Germany is to go into a hard lockdown over the Christmas period as the number of deaths and infections from the coronavirus reaches record levels. Non-essential shops will close across the country from Wednesday, as will schools, with children to be cared for at home wherever possible. Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed Christmas shopping for a ""considerable"" rise in social contacts. The latest figures showed 20,200 more infections and a further 321 deaths. The new lockdown will run from 16 December to 10 January. Announcing the move after meeting leaders of the country's 16 states, Mrs Merkel said there was ""an urgent need to take action"". A maximum of five people from no more than two households are allowed to gather in a home. But this will be relaxed from 24 to 26 December when one household will be able to invite a maximum of four close family members from other households. What are the Christmas rules around Europe? The mask-wearing city that bucked the trend Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have already been closed since November, and some areas of the country had imposed their own lockdowns. Under the national lockdown, essential shops, such as those selling food, will stay open, as can banks. Outlets selling Christmas trees can also continue trading. Hair salons are among the businesses which must close. Companies are being urged to allow employees to work from home. This video can not be played Many markets in Germany have been cancelled due to the pandemic Care homes will be authorised to carry out coronavirus tests. New Year events and the sale of fireworks will be banned. Drinking of alcohol in public places, such as popular mulled wine stalls, is also forbidden. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said affected businesses would receive up to 500,000 euros (Â£457,000, $605,000) in government support per month. Bavaria is extending a night curfew from areas with high infection rates to the whole state - the second most populous in Germany. Chancellor Merkel said it was the government's job to ""prevent an overload of our health systems and that's why there is an urgent need to take action"". The latest official figures on Sunday showed 20,200 more infections, bringing Germany's total to date to more than 1.3 million. The death toll has risen by 321 to 21,787, the Robert Koch Institute says. This video can not be played Have we become bored of following Covid rules? Germany had been seen as relatively successful in controlling the pandemic compared with European neighbours, thanks in part to testing and tracing. But there is a growing recognition among political leaders that what was dubbed ""lockdown lite"" has not achieved enough. ""If we're not careful, Germany could quickly become Europe's problem child,"" Bavaria's Prime Minister Markus SÃ¶der warned. ""For that reason, we had to and we must act."" He did not rule out Germany extending lockdown beyond 10 January. The government had to take action, Chancellor Merkel said A vaccination campaign inItalywill aim to use flower-shaped gazebos set up in parks, sports fields and city squares to begin inoculating the public by mid-January, the country's special commissioner for the Covid emergency, Domenico Arcuri, said on Sunday. The architect behind the gazebos' design, Stefano Boeri, said the flower was the sign of the beginning of spring, ""a symbol of serenity and rebirth"". Italy is now the European nation with the highest coronavirus death toll, according to the latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It has recorded 64,036 confirmed Covid-related deaths, overtaking the UK, which has recorded 64,026. People across theUKhave been asked to think ""really carefully"" aboutthe risk of more social contact over Christmasas restrictions are eased between 23 and 27 December. Three households will be permitted to form a ""bubble"" and mix indoors and stay overnight during the five-day period. People have been urged to avoid shopping in the city centre at weekends in The Hague Meanwhile in theNetherlands, which recorded nearly 10,000 new Covid infections over the latest 24-hour period, officials are urging Christmas shoppers to avoid city centres - such as Amsterdam and The Hague - at weekends. ""Come alone, don't linger too long, keep your distance and shop at quiet times,"" authorities said in a statement. The country has been in partial lockdown since 13 October. The Dutch government has been discussing additional measures to curb the spread of the virus. InSwitzerland, five hospitals have sent a letter to health minister Alain Berset expressing ""great concern about the current situation"" relating to Covid-19 patients, local media report. Hospitals in Geneva, Bern, Zurich, Basel, and Lausanne said intensive care units (ICU) were reaching full capacity and nurses were under extreme pressure. No curfew or limit to alcohol sales will be imposed in Moscow during the New Year holiday, despite a rise in Covid infections in theRussiancapital, the mayor is quoted by Interfax news agency as saying on Sunday. From Monday, schools across the Stockholm region ofSwedenhave been asked to switch to distance learning for 13 to 15-year-olds for the first time. Students over the age of 16 returned to digital lessons nationwide on 7 December. Among other measures for the Christmas period, Swedes are also advised to meet a maximum of eight people, gather outdoors if possible and avoid travelling by train or bus.

"Pro-Trump rallies see scuffles in US cities""Stop the Steal"" marchers gathered to back President Trump's push to reverse his election defeat.US Election 2020","Thousands gathered to hear speeches in Washington DC Thousands of Donald Trump supporters alleging electoral fraud converged on several US cities and towns on Saturday and there were isolated scuffles with counter-demonstrators. In Washington DC, more than 20 people were arrested and four people were stabbed, police said. Mr Trump lost the 3 November election to Joe Biden but is yet to concede. The Electoral College, the system which elects US presidents, is due to endorse Mr Biden's victory on Monday. Mr Biden won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the Electoral College, and gained over seven million more votes than his Republican rival in the popular vote. In the nation's capital, police sought to keep the two sides apart, a strategy that included sealing off Black Lives Matter Plaza where counter-demonstrators had gathered. Pro-Trump demonstrators, rallying under the banner of ""Stop the Steal"", were joined by members of the far-right Proud Boys, dressed in yellow and black, many wearing bullet-proof vests. Mr Trump caused controversy by saying the group should ""stand back and stand by"" during a September presidential debate, though he later condemned ""all white supremacists"". Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Can Trump overturn the election result? As night fell, Proud Boys and Antifa counter-demonstrators, mostly separated by police lines, yelled insults at each other. But sporadic violence broke out. The stabbings took place near the downtown Harry's Bar, butit was not clear which group those injured belonged to, according to the Washington Post.,external Eight people were taken to hospitals, including two police officers,according to CNN.,external Make America Great Again (MAGA) protesters, who support Mr Trump, were captured on video tearing down a Black Lives Matter sign from a church, pouring petrol on it and setting it alight. On Sunday the Ashbury church pastor compared the actions to cross burnings. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Seeing this act on video made me both indignant and determined to fight the evil that has reared its ugly head,"" Rev Ianther Mills said in a statement. Counter-demonstrators were kept at a distance from Trump supporters by Washington DC police Far-right Proud Boys made gestures symbolising white supremacy as they gathered near the Washington Monument Rallies also took place in Olympia, the capital of Washington state, Atlanta and St Paul, Minnesota. Police in Olympia said one person had been shot and three arrested as rival groups clashed. The Washington DC rally attracted several thousand Trump-supporters but it was smaller than a similar event on 14 November. Few participants wore masks despite Covid-19 restrictions. There were speeches by Mr Trump's now pardoned former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, and Sebastian Gorka, another former White House official. Mr Trump's pardoned former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, was among those making speeches Mr Gorka urged the president not to give up his legal campaign - based on debunked allegations of electoral fraud - to reverse the election result. The president's latest legal defeat came on Friday whenthe Supreme Court rejected an unprecedented attempt to throw out results in four battleground stateswhich Mr Biden won. Mr Trump has now lost more than 50 cases linked to the election. Cheers erupted as the presidential helicopter, Marine One, flew over the Washington rally carrying Mr Trump to the Army-Navy football game at West Point, New York. The president had earlier tweeted his support. General Flynn likened the protesters to soldiers and priests breaching the walls of Jericho, echoing the rally organisers' call for ""Jericho Marches"" to overturn the election result. That refers toa story in the biblewhere an army peacefully conquer the city of Jericho, which God has promised them, after marching around its walls for six days. It is considered symbolic of a test of faith. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

The government says it wants to crack down on this so-called ""loyalty penalty"" through two possible routes it plans to test: Opt-in switching - where consumers are offered a simple method of switching to a cheaper tariff if their initial contract has ended Or opt-out switching - where, unless they choose not to be, consumers are automatically switched to a competitive new contract if their initial contract has ended ""We do not believe that energy companies should be able to roll over contracts indefinitely or punish long standing, loyal customers,"" a Whitehall source said.

""It might detract people from shopping around for a better deal with alternative and more competitive suppliers,"" he said. ""If these changes are not implemented properly they risk lulling people into a false sense of security that they are on the cheapest tariff, despite better offers being available elsewhere.""

Another - Crystal Chandeliers - is still popular in Northern Ireland thanks to concerts he staged there when touring was difficult due the conflict in the 1970s.

Automatic switching plan for fairer energy tariffs,"Consumers could be automatically switched to better value energy tariffs under a plan to make the system fairer. The government says it wants to stop suppliers putting loyal customers on to the worst deals when their current contracts come to an end.

But one switching site warned the tariff proposals risked ""lulling people into a false sense of security"".

LiveLivePM: UK and EU 'still very far apart on key issues'10 minutes ago,"PM Boris Johnson says the UK and EU are ""still very far apart"" on key issues relating to a post-Brexit deal, and the UK must be ready to trade on WTO terms Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to continue trade talks beyond Sunday's deadline In a joint statement, the leaders said it was ""responsible at this point to go the extra mile"" The pair discussed ""major unresolved topics"" during a phone call, which Mrs von der Leyen called ""constructive and useful"" But three ""critical issues"" remain: fishing rights, government support for industry and how a deal is enforced Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the talks on Brexit trade remained ""finely balanced"" French fishing fleets would have ""zero assured access"" to UK waters in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year Edited by Julian Joyce and George Bowden We're bringing our live coverage of today's events to a close, but here is a quick catch-up on developments:  Our writers and editors today were: Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner, Gavin Stamp, Justin Parkinson, George Bowden and Julian Joyce. Thanks for reading. The Scottish government has called for an end to the ""crippling uncertainty"" over the future trading relationship with the EU. It comes after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson today agreed that post-Brexit trade deal talks will continue this week. The Scottish government's Cabinet Secretary for Europe and External Affairs, Michael Russell, said:
""It is now time for the crippling uncertainty over the future of our trading relationship with the European Union to come to an end. ""Whatever the outcome of these protracted talks, we know there will be very significant damage to Scotland's economy and society because of the UK government's decision to leave the transition period on 31 December in the middle of a pandemic and a recession. ""But we also know that the worst outcome of all would be the disastrous impact of a no-deal Brexit - which would lead to significant tariffs - and the UK government must rule this out immediately."" The CBI, the UK's business lobby group, says that news the UK and the EU will continue Brexit talks gives it hope. But it says: ""Ongoing
delays are frustrating and cost businesses."" The CBI says the UK government must, firstly, provide detailed guidance to businesses this week on issues such border checks. Secondly, companies must be given a grace period to allow them to adjust to a deal or no deal. ""And
third, prepare support for firms who will face the greatest challenges in
the short run. Those in sectors and supply chains that are badly hit
will face extinction through tariffs, red tape and extra costs."" As talks about how the UK and EU could live and work together after Brexit near a mutual deadline, let's take a look at some of the language being used. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - from transition period to WTO. Here is whatsome of the key ones mean. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor When is a deadline not a deadline? When it's anything to do with Brexit, perhaps. Both sides in this long, long process, have agreed to go on, rather than pull the plug today. A joint statement emerged just before noon with a much more positive tone than anything that's come out of late, and did not feature the usual kind of warning of big gaps between the two sides. The froideur from Thursday and Friday seems to be thawing a little. It's worth noting no new time limit was put on the talks, although of course there is one hard deadline of 31 December, when the status quo runs out. It's also worth noting that the prime minister was loathe to show much sign of optimism when he appeared in front of a camera shortly after the joint statement emerged. It's far from certain that the talks will end in agreement, but the chances of resolution are once again on the rise. Read more from Laura here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor This torture is better than no deal. The fact that talks are ongoing is a good thing. Business
groups are unanimous in their view that if a deal is at all possible, it should
be pursued with every last effort. However, the problem with this uncertainty torture is
two-fold. First, political and business timetables are getting
increasingly misaligned by the day. Businesses need to know whether tariffs are
coming or not as it effects pricing of products and services for next year. How
can I place or take an order if I donât know what that price needs to be? Second, there is a danger that businesses who watch this
process being dragged out will wait for some rabbit to appear out of the hat and take their focus away from preparing for a deal. No deal is very bad - a
deal still leaves an awful lot of work to do in preparing for new procedures, for example customs, that will change whether we get a deal or not. But the fact remains that while this may be torture, it
could be worse. No deal would not put UK business out of its misery â it could
put some sectors out of business. A few moments ago, Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave an update on the post-Brexit trade deal discussions between the UK and the EU after both sides agreed to continue talking. He cautioned that the two sides were ""very far apart on key things"", adding that the most likely outcome was no deal. This video can not be played Johnson: 'Whatever happens, the UK will do very, very well' We've been telling you about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. He later briefed members of the Cabinet from his office at 10 Downing Street - and now a picture of the PM giving that briefing has been released. It was taken by his photographer Andrew Parsons. A continuation of Brexit talks is not all good news - uncertainty means that businesses such as retailers are finding it extremely difficult to prepare for 1 January. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) says that, without a deal, UK shops face Â£3bn in tariffs and those extra charges could be passed onto customers. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson, said: ""Both sides must double down and do what is
necessary to agree a zero-tariff agreement, or else it will be the public that
pay the price of this failure. ""With many peopleâs finances already strained by
the economic impact of coronavirus, households can ill-afford a significant
rise in food prices. ""For the sake of customers and businesses around the UK, we
need a deal in the next three weeks.â Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was still a deal to be done ""if our partners want to do it - but we remain very apart on these key issues"". He said: ""The UK canât be locked into the EUâs regulatory orbit and weâve obviously got to take back control of our fisheries, so those are the points - I think itâs very clear what the UK is talking about.""       Mr Johnson said the UK ""certainly wonât be walking away from the talks"", reiterating what Ursula von der Leyen said, that ""people would expect us to go the extra mile"". He said he repeated his offer to talk to ""other capitals"" but said the Commission was ""very determined"" to keep the negotiations between the UK and Commission. Mr Johnson said the UK had made ""huge preparations"" to leave without a deal. ""Weâve now been at this for four and a half years, itâs a long time. Perhaps more intensively in the last couple of years than previously.Weâve got ready and anybody who needs to know what to do, get on togov.uk/transition,external, see what needs to be done and get ready for 1 January.Either way, whatever happens the UK will do very very well."" In his statement earlier Boris Johnson warned the UK had to ""get ready for WTO terms, Australia terms"", if the current talks with the EU do not succeed. To be clear, an Australian-style Brexit would mean no trade deal with the EU and would see the UK trading instead under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). But what does that mean?Read more here. ""Get ready with confidence for 1 January - trading on WTO terms if we have to,"" Johnson says in his statement. ""Get ready to trade on WTO terms - and there is a clarity and a simplicity in that approach which has its own advantages,"" he says, adding: ""It's not where we wanted to get to."" ""We're going to try with all our hearts,"" he says of the ongoing negotiations for a trade deal. Speaking to broadcasters, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""we're still very far apart on key things"" as post-Brexit trade talks continue in Brussels. He says he is ""very happy"" to speak with other European capitals, and he repeats: ""The most likely thing now is that we have to get ready to WTO terms - Australia terms."" Earlier, the PM held a cabinet call following talks this morning with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Following those talks, the EU and UK issued a joint statement confirming negotiations to reach a post-Brexit trade deal would continue. The Timesâ political editor, Steven Swinford, has justtweeted,externala read-out from the cabinet call, saying the PM sounded ""downbeat"" about the chances of reaching a deal.

Labour has urged the UK government to seal a trade deal with the EU after the two sides agreed to carry on negotiating. A party spokesman said: ""The Conservatives promised the British people that they had an oven-ready deal and that they would get Brexit done. ""The government needs to deliver on that promise, get us the deal and allow us to move on as a country."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has also warned people not to start stockpiling goods ahead of 1 January. âRetailers are doing everything they can to prepare for all eventualities on 1 January - increasing the stock of tins, toilet rolls and other longer life products so there will be sufficient supply of essential products,"" says BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson . ""While no amount of preparation by retailers can entirely prevent
disruption there is no need for the public to buy more food than
usual as the main impact will be on imported fresh produce, such as fresh fruit
and vegetables, which cannot be stored for long periods by either retailers or
consumers."" Charles Michel, the president of
the European Council, has said the European Union would not lose its
cool as make-or-break talks with Britain over a post-Brexit trade
deal approach their climax. Michel, who chairs EU summits, told France Inter Radio that
the EU wanted a good deal that respected the
integrity of its single market, the Reuters news agency reports. This video can not be played Von der Leyen: 'It is responsible to go the extra mile and continue talks' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has confirmed that talks for a post-Brexit trade deal will continue between the UK and EU. She said ""despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations"", it was ""responsible to go the extra mile"". Kevin ConnollyEurope correspondent, Brussels Ursula von der Leyen described her call with Boris Johnson as ""constructive"" and ""useful"". She used Imperial measurements when she talked about ""going the extra mile"", perhaps a nod to the British side. And there is no apparent deadline now - I think they may have felt that that created the wrong impression of what would happen today. As long as both sides are talking then a deal is certainly not impossible and it would have been impossible had they pulled the plug today. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Pro-Trump rallies see scuffles in US cities""Stop the Steal"" marchers gathered to back President Trump's push to reverse his election defeat.","Thousands gathered to hear speeches in Washington DC Thousands of Donald Trump supporters alleging electoral fraud converged on several US cities and towns on Saturday and there were isolated scuffles with counter-demonstrators. In Washington DC, more than 20 people were arrested and four people were stabbed, police said. Mr Trump lost the 3 November election to Joe Biden but is yet to concede. The Electoral College, the system which elects US presidents, is due to endorse Mr Biden's victory on Monday. Mr Biden won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the Electoral College, and gained over seven million more votes than his Republican rival in the popular vote. In the nation's capital, police sought to keep the two sides apart, a strategy that included sealing off Black Lives Matter Plaza where counter-demonstrators had gathered. Pro-Trump demonstrators, rallying under the banner of ""Stop the Steal"", were joined by members of the far-right Proud Boys, dressed in yellow and black, many wearing bullet-proof vests. Mr Trump caused controversy by saying the group should ""stand back and stand by"" during a September presidential debate, though he later condemned ""all white supremacists"". Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? 'Overvoting' and other US fraud claims fact-checked Can Trump overturn the election result? As night fell, Proud Boys and Antifa counter-demonstrators, mostly separated by police lines, yelled insults at each other. But sporadic violence broke out. The stabbings took place near the downtown Harry's Bar, butit was not clear which group those injured belonged to, according to the Washington Post.,external Eight people were taken to hospitals, including two police officers,according to CNN.,external Make America Great Again (MAGA) protesters, who support Mr Trump, were captured on video tearing down a Black Lives Matter sign from a church, pouring petrol on it and setting it alight. On Sunday the Ashbury church pastor compared the actions to cross burnings. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Seeing this act on video made me both indignant and determined to fight the evil that has reared its ugly head,"" Rev Ianther Mills said in a statement. Counter-demonstrators were kept at a distance from Trump supporters by Washington DC police Far-right Proud Boys made gestures symbolising white supremacy as they gathered near the Washington Monument Rallies also took place in Olympia, the capital of Washington state, Atlanta and St Paul, Minnesota. Police in Olympia said one person had been shot and three arrested as rival groups clashed. The Washington DC rally attracted several thousand Trump-supporters but it was smaller than a similar event on 14 November. Few participants wore masks despite Covid-19 restrictions. There were speeches by Mr Trump's now pardoned former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, and Sebastian Gorka, another former White House official. Mr Trump's pardoned former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn, was among those making speeches Mr Gorka urged the president not to give up his legal campaign - based on debunked allegations of electoral fraud - to reverse the election result. The president's latest legal defeat came on Friday whenthe Supreme Court rejected an unprecedented attempt to throw out results in four battleground stateswhich Mr Biden won. Mr Trump has now lost more than 50 cases linked to the election. Cheers erupted as the presidential helicopter, Marine One, flew over the Washington rally carrying Mr Trump to the Army-Navy football game at West Point, New York. The president had earlier tweeted his support. General Flynn likened the protesters to soldiers and priests breaching the walls of Jericho, echoing the rally organisers' call for ""Jericho Marches"" to overturn the election result. That refers toa story in the biblewhere an army peacefully conquer the city of Jericho, which God has promised them, after marching around its walls for six days. It is considered symbolic of a test of faith. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson, said: ""Both sides must double down and do what is
necessary to agree a zero-tariff agreement, or else it will be the public that
pay the price of this failure. ""With many peopleâs finances already strained by
the economic impact of coronavirus, households can ill-afford a significant
rise in food prices. ""For the sake of customers and businesses around the UK, we
need a deal in the next three weeks.â Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was still a deal to be done ""if our partners want to do it - but we remain very apart on these key issues"". He said: ""The UK canât be locked into the EUâs regulatory orbit and weâve obviously got to take back control of our fisheries, so those are the points - I think itâs very clear what the UK is talking about.""       Mr Johnson said the UK ""certainly wonât be walking away from the talks"", reiterating what Ursula von der Leyen said, that ""people would expect us to go the extra mile"". He said he repeated his offer to talk to ""other capitals"" but said the Commission was ""very determined"" to keep the negotiations between the UK and Commission. Mr Johnson said the UK had made ""huge preparations"" to leave without a deal. ""Weâve now been at this for four and a half years, itâs a long time. Perhaps more intensively in the last couple of years than previously.Weâve got ready and anybody who needs to know what to do, get on togov.uk/transition,external, see what needs to be done and get ready for 1 January.Either way, whatever happens the UK will do very very well."" In his statement earlier Boris Johnson warned the UK had to ""get ready for WTO terms, Australia terms"", if the current talks with the EU do not succeed. To be clear, an Australian-style Brexit would mean no trade deal with the EU and would see the UK trading instead under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). But what does that mean?Read more here. ""Get ready with confidence for 1 January - trading on WTO terms if we have to,"" Johnson says in his statement. ""Get ready to trade on WTO terms - and there is a clarity and a simplicity in that approach which has its own advantages,"" he says, adding: ""It's not where we wanted to get to."" ""We're going to try with all our hearts,"" he says of the ongoing negotiations for a trade deal. Speaking to broadcasters, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""we're still very far apart on key things"" as post-Brexit trade talks continue in Brussels. He says he is ""very happy"" to speak with other European capitals, and he repeats: ""The most likely thing now is that we have to get ready to WTO terms - Australia terms."" Earlier, the PM held a cabinet call following talks this morning with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Following those talks, the EU and UK issued a joint statement confirming negotiations to reach a post-Brexit trade deal would continue. The Timesâ political editor, Steven Swinford, has justtweeted,externala read-out from the cabinet call, saying the PM sounded ""downbeat"" about the chances of reaching a deal.

Labour has urged the UK government to seal a trade deal with the EU after the two sides agreed to carry on negotiating. A party spokesman said: ""The Conservatives promised the British people that they had an oven-ready deal and that they would get Brexit done. ""The government needs to deliver on that promise, get us the deal and allow us to move on as a country."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has also warned people not to start stockpiling goods ahead of 1 January. âRetailers are doing everything they can to prepare for all eventualities on 1 January - increasing the stock of tins, toilet rolls and other longer life products so there will be sufficient supply of essential products,"" says BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson . ""While no amount of preparation by retailers can entirely prevent
disruption there is no need for the public to buy more food than
usual as the main impact will be on imported fresh produce, such as fresh fruit
and vegetables, which cannot be stored for long periods by either retailers or
consumers."" Charles Michel, the president of
the European Council, has said the European Union would not lose its
cool as make-or-break talks with Britain over a post-Brexit trade
deal approach their climax. Michel, who chairs EU summits, told France Inter Radio that
the EU wanted a good deal that respected the
integrity of its single market, the Reuters news agency reports. This video can not be played Von der Leyen: 'It is responsible to go the extra mile and continue talks' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has confirmed that talks for a post-Brexit trade deal will continue between the UK and EU. She said ""despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations"", it was ""responsible to go the extra mile"". Kevin ConnollyEurope correspondent, Brussels Ursula von der Leyen described her call with Boris Johnson as ""constructive"" and ""useful"". She used Imperial measurements when she talked about ""going the extra mile"", perhaps a nod to the British side. And there is no apparent deadline now - I think they may have felt that that created the wrong impression of what would happen today. As long as both sides are talking then a deal is certainly not impossible and it would have been impossible had they pulled the plug today. Â© 2025 BBC.

Christmas lockdown for Germany as virus spikesThe authorities have been struggling to control a growing number of infections and deaths.Europe,"Christmas shopping has been blamed for the recent rise in cases Germany is to go into a hard lockdown over the Christmas period as the number of deaths and infections from the coronavirus reaches record levels. Non-essential shops will close across the country from Wednesday, as will schools, with children to be cared for at home wherever possible. Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed Christmas shopping for a ""considerable"" rise in social contacts. The latest figures showed 20,200 more infections and a further 321 deaths. The new lockdown will run from 16 December to 10 January. Announcing the move after meeting leaders of the country's 16 states, Mrs Merkel said there was ""an urgent need to take action"". A maximum of five people from no more than two households are allowed to gather in a home. But this will be relaxed from 24 to 26 December when one household will be able to invite a maximum of four close family members from other households. What are the Christmas rules around Europe? The mask-wearing city that bucked the trend Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have already been closed since November, and some areas of the country had imposed their own lockdowns. Under the national lockdown, essential shops, such as those selling food, will stay open, as can banks. Outlets selling Christmas trees can also continue trading. Hair salons are among the businesses which must close. Companies are being urged to allow employees to work from home. This video can not be played Many markets in Germany have been cancelled due to the pandemic Care homes will be authorised to carry out coronavirus tests. New Year events and the sale of fireworks will be banned. Drinking of alcohol in public places, such as popular mulled wine stalls, is also forbidden. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said affected businesses would receive up to 500,000 euros (Â£457,000, $605,000) in government support per month. Bavaria is extending a night curfew from areas with high infection rates to the whole state - the second most populous in Germany. Chancellor Merkel said it was the government's job to ""prevent an overload of our health systems and that's why there is an urgent need to take action"". The latest official figures on Sunday showed 20,200 more infections, bringing Germany's total to date to more than 1.3 million. The death toll has risen by 321 to 21,787, the Robert Koch Institute says. This video can not be played Have we become bored of following Covid rules? Germany had been seen as relatively successful in controlling the pandemic compared with European neighbours, thanks in part to testing and tracing. But there is a growing recognition among political leaders that what was dubbed ""lockdown lite"" has not achieved enough. ""If we're not careful, Germany could quickly become Europe's problem child,"" Bavaria's Prime Minister Markus SÃ¶der warned. ""For that reason, we had to and we must act."" He did not rule out Germany extending lockdown beyond 10 January. The government had to take action, Chancellor Merkel said A vaccination campaign inItalywill aim to use flower-shaped gazebos set up in parks, sports fields and city squares to begin inoculating the public by mid-January, the country's special commissioner for the Covid emergency, Domenico Arcuri, said on Sunday. The architect behind the gazebos' design, Stefano Boeri, said the flower was the sign of the beginning of spring, ""a symbol of serenity and rebirth"". Italy is now the European nation with the highest coronavirus death toll, according to the latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It has recorded 64,036 confirmed Covid-related deaths, overtaking the UK, which has recorded 64,026. People across theUKhave been asked to think ""really carefully"" aboutthe risk of more social contact over Christmasas restrictions are eased between 23 and 27 December. Three households will be permitted to form a ""bubble"" and mix indoors and stay overnight during the five-day period. People have been urged to avoid shopping in the city centre at weekends in The Hague Meanwhile in theNetherlands, which recorded nearly 10,000 new Covid infections over the latest 24-hour period, officials are urging Christmas shoppers to avoid city centres - such as Amsterdam and The Hague - at weekends. ""Come alone, don't linger too long, keep your distance and shop at quiet times,"" authorities said in a statement. The country has been in partial lockdown since 13 October. The Dutch government has been discussing additional measures to curb the spread of the virus. InSwitzerland, five hospitals have sent a letter to health minister Alain Berset expressing ""great concern about the current situation"" relating to Covid-19 patients, local media report. Hospitals in Geneva, Bern, Zurich, Basel, and Lausanne said intensive care units (ICU) were reaching full capacity and nurses were under extreme pressure. No curfew or limit to alcohol sales will be imposed in Moscow during the New Year holiday, despite a rise in Covid infections in theRussiancapital, the mayor is quoted by Interfax news agency as saying on Sunday. From Monday, schools across the Stockholm region ofSwedenhave been asked to switch to distance learning for 13 to 15-year-olds for the first time. Students over the age of 16 returned to digital lessons nationwide on 7 December. Among other measures for the Christmas period, Swedes are also advised to meet a maximum of eight people, gather outdoors if possible and avoid travelling by train or bus.

"Public 'must think carefully' about Christmas riskNHS bosses say they are worried about January, after the US saw a spike in cases after Thanksgiving.HealthComments","People must think ""really carefully"" about the risk of more social contact over Christmas, NHS bosses have warned. ""I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas,"" said Chris Hopson, the head of NHS Providers. But he pointed out that the US saw ""record numbers"" of cases and deaths after the Thanksgiving holiday - and said the NHS was worried about January. The government's Dominic Raab said people needed the five-day relaxation of Covid rules on ""an emotional level"". Meanwhile, the chances of the Oxford University vaccine being rolled out by the end of the year are ""pretty high"", the vaccine's architect Prof Sarah Gilbert has told the BBC. A further 18,447 cases were recorded across the UK on Sunday, along with another 144 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The number of deaths recorded tends to be lower over the weekend because of reporting delays. UK coronavirus cases up by 21,502 on Saturday Find out the rules where you live Between 23 and 27 December, coronavirus restrictions are being relaxed across the UK, allowing three householdsto form a ""bubble""and mix indoors and stay overnight. But NHS Providers - which represents hospital trusts in England - has written to the PM urging him to ""personally lead a better public debate about the risks inherent in the guidance"" - although it stopped short of calling for a review of the rules over Christmas. ""There seems to be a sense at the moment that, 'hey because the government's put these rules down, there's no risk to people having more social contact over Christmas',"" Mr Hopson told BBC Breakfast. ""Of course, part of it is about sticking to the rules but any kind of extra social contact over Christmas - particularly with those who are vulnerable to the virus - actually is very risky."" This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus ""I don't want to be the Grinch who stole Christmas, I really don't, but I think everybody needs to think really, really carefully what are they going to do over Christmas,"" he said. ""It's not, 'is what we're going to be doing sticking within the rules?' It's 'how much risk are we going to cause to the people we interact with?'"" The rise in infections in the US after the Thanksgiving holiday was also highlighted by NHS Providers. The NHS is worried about the potential pressure on hospital beds, and its ability to treat all the patients it needs to in December, January and February, Mr Hopson said. ""At the same time you've got rising infections in places like London, Essex, parts of Kent, parts of Lincolnshire,"" he added. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab ruled out any possibility that the government would review the Christmas relaxation of rules. Speaking to Sky News's Sophy Ridge programme on Sunday, he said: ""I think people do need that five-day window over Christmas to spend a bit of time with their loved ones and I think at a mental health level, an emotional level, people do need it."" It comes afterpublic health expert Prof Linda Bauld saidloosening Covid restrictions over Christmas was ""a mistake"". Wales' health minister Vaughan Gething said the rules around Christmas could be changed - but it could affect trust in the government. NHS Providers also warned that relaxing Covid rules when they are reviewed in England could trigger a third wave of the virus during the busiest time of year for hospitals. England'sthree-tier systemis due to be reviewed on Wednesday 16 December. It urged the PM against moving any area to a lower tier and said areas should be moved into tier three - the highest level of restrictions -  ""as soon as this is needed, without any delay"". Earlier this week,some health experts called for London to be placed in tier three ""now""after official figures showed Outer London had a higher infection rate than some areas already in the top tier. The government said it ""will not hesitate to take necessary actions to protect local communities"". Decisions on tiers are made by ministers, based on the latest available data and advice from public health experts, a spokesperson added. ""We have introduced strengthened local restrictions to protect the progress gained during national restrictions, reduce pressure on the NHS and ultimately save lives,"" they said. ""On top of our record NHS investment, this winter we are providing an extra Â£3bn to maintain independent sector and Nightingale hospital surge capacity and a further Â£450m to upgrade and expand A&Es."" THREE TIERS:How does the system work? SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Meanwhile, Prof Sarah Gilbert, lead researcher on the Oxford University/AstraZeneca vaccine, was upbeat when asked about the possibility of people receiving the Oxford jab by the end of the year. The vaccine has not yet been approved by the UK's regulator, buta study this week showedit was safe and effective. ""I think the chances are pretty high,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""But we do need multiple vaccines, all countries need multiple vaccines, the world needs multiple vaccines and we need vaccines made using different technologies, if that's possible.""

Ikea sorry after port disruption delays ordersCustomers have been venting their anger after congestion at ports has led to stock shortages.Business,"Ikea has apologised to customers after facing stock shortages due to the current congestion at UK ports. Angry shoppers complained they faced delays to orders and could not get through on the retailer's helpline. Ports have been hit by surging demand for imports caused by countries reopening after lockdown, Brexit stockpiling and the Christmas rush. Ikea said it made orders for its flat-pack furniture harder to fulfil at a time of ""unprecedented demand"". On Twitter, one angry customer said: ""My order is over a week late and @IKEAUKSupport will not reply to anything or update me on the status of the delivery."" Another said: ""@IKEAUKSupport Still waiting for a response for something broken when I opened my delivery... Been trying to sort this for 16 days and no response at all."" Sales at the Swedish retailer have boomed in lockdown as people spend more on doing up their homes. But a spokeswoman said its supply chain - including the ports where its products are received - had been hit by the effects of Covid-19 and product availability had been impacted. ""These continue to be extraordinary times and we apologise unreservedly forâ¯the inconvenience caused to our customers,"" she added. ""Weâ¯fully understand their frustration and want to assure them that we are working intensively to resolve these challengesâ¯as soon as possible."" 'Price rises likely' due to UK shipping problems Honda pauses production after UK port woes Imports ranging from building materials to toys and fresh food have been held up due to the issues at ports, causing headaches for businesses. Carmaker Honda even had to pause production last week due to a shortage of components. On Saturday, the British Ports Association said the issues were now ""cascading"", with long queues of traffic outside lorry ports becoming increasingly common. Its boss Richard Ballantyne blamed a ""perfect storm"" of surging global container movements, the busy pre-Christmas period and people moving more goods before the UK's Brexit transition ends. ""This is putting pressure on the logistics and storage sectors both in the UK and abroad,"" he said. Some have warned price rises are likely due to the problems. Ryan Clark, director of the Essex-based freight forwarder Westbound Logistics Services, told the BBC last week: ""The increase in freight is either creating more expensive prices for the consumer, or unsustainability for businesses that will be forced to close where the onward price cannot be increased.""

Coronavirus: Daily updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday.UK,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic on Sunday. We'll have another update for you on Monday morning. Easing England's Covid restrictions could lead to a third wave of the virus at the busiest time of the year for hospitals, according to NHS bosses. In a letter to the prime minister, NHS Providers, which represents hospital trusts in England, hasurged ""extreme caution"" in moving any area to a lower tier. A review of the tiers is due to take place on Wednesday. The letter highlighted some parts of the country where there was a ""worrying increase in infection rates across a wide range of areas"", including Essex, Kent, London and parts of Lincolnshire. It comes ahead of the festive season when people will be allowedto form a ""bubble""between 23 and 27 December, with the letter urging Boris Johnson to lead a ""better public debate about the risks inherent in the guidance"". This video can not be played How you and your family can celebrate Christmas and minimise the spread of coronavirus Mass testing programmes, like the one trialled in Liverpool, are to berolled out in 67 tier three areas of England, with the first launching on Monday. The government has said more than 1.6 million lateral flow tests, which give a result within 30 minutes, will be delivered for community testing this month. It is hoped the testing initiative, along with existing measures, could help lead to an easing of restrictions in tier three areas. A separatemass testing scheme for secondary school-aged pupilsin London, Essex and Kent was announced earlier this week. But in Wales, public health expert Dr Angela Raffle has saidcontinuing mass testing could be a ""massive-scale waste of resources"", with less than 1.5% of people testing positive as part of pilots in Merthyr Tydfil and the lower Cynon Valley. Staff and residents in care homes in Scotland will begin to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine from Monday, the Scottish government has said. There had been fears that homes would not be able to receive the first batch of doses due to logistical challenges. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman saidolder care home residents had been prioritised to receive the jab along with care staff. But she warned the pace of the vaccination programme remained dependent on the supply of the vaccine, which is manufactured in Belgium.

Nagorno-Karabakh conflict flares despite ceasefire,"This video can not be played This family is one of many still waiting for news about a missing relative Four soldiers from Azerbaijan have been killed in clashes in the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region, Azerbaijan's defence ministry says. The reports come only weeks after a six-week war over the territory which ended when Azerbaijan and Armenia signed a ceasefire. Armenia meanwhile said six of its own troops were wounded in what it called an Azerbaijani military offensive. Nagorno-Karabakh has long been a trigger for violence between the two. The region is recognised as part of Azerbaijan but has been run by ethnic Armenians since 1994 after the two countries fought a war over the territory which left thousands dead. A Russian-brokered truce failed to bring about lasting peace and the area, claimed by both sides, has been prone to intermittent clashes. This video can not be played Nagorno-Karabakh: The families burning down their own homes Signed on 9 November, it locked in the territorial gains Azerbaijan made during the war, including the region's second-largest city Shusha Armenia promised to withdraw troops from three areas 2,000 Russian peacekeepers deployed to the region Azerbaijan also gained a overland route to Turkey, its ally, by gaining access to a road link to an Azeri conflict on the Iran-Turkey border called Nakhchivan The BBC's Orla Guerin said that, overall, the deal was regarded as avictory for Azerbaijan and a defeat for Armenia The latest conflict began at the end of September,killing around 5,000 soldiers on both sides. At least 143 civilians died and thousands were displaced when their homes were damaged or soldiers entered their communities. Why did Armenia and Azerbaijan go to war? Russian influence under threat in its own backyard Both countries have accused the other of violating the terms of the November peace deal and the latest hostilities flout the ceasefire.

Joshua outclasses Pulev in knockout win,"Joshua finally saw off the game Pulev with a hard right hand in round nine Unified world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua mixed power and patience as he knocked out Kubrat Pulev to raise hopes that a historic fight against Tyson Fury could soon be a reality. The Briton smashed home a hard right hand in round three that forced his mandatory challenger to face a count and then sent him to the canvas with an uppercut seconds later. Joshua, perhaps fatigued by the chaos, stepped off the gas and allowed Pulev to at least offer some mild threat, but a barrage of uppercuts in the ninth dropped the Bulgarian and a straight right hand wiped him out. Moments after this fine blend of poise and heavy punching, the 1,000 fans granted access to Wembley Arena roared at the prospect of the IBF, WBA and WBO champion facing WBC title-holder Fury next. ""Whoever has the belts I want to compete with. If that is Tyson Fury, let it be Tyson Fury,"" said Joshua, 31. Fellow Briton Fury quickly went on social media and posted: ""I want the fight. I want the fight next. I will knock him out inside three rounds. I can't wait to knock him out."" Joshua v Fury - what obstacles stand in the way? 'At last I can get him in the ring' - Joshua responds to Fury knockout taunt Impressive AJ, fans return, Fury responds & Mayweather's surprise appearance Joshua v Pulev: All the action as it happened 'Joshua sets up superfight' - 5 Live Boxing reacts Listen to BBC Radio 5 Live commentary highlights of the fight This video can not be played Anthony Joshua beats Kubrat Pulev and looks ahead to Tyson Fury fight Joshua, in a white sleeveless hoodie for his ring walk, was smart from start to finish on a night when the widespread anticipation of a fight with Fury - in which all four world heavyweight titles could be contested for the first time - dominated the narrative. In his past two outings, Joshua has stood up to immense pressure. A second defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr in December would have left his career in tatters. He was punch perfect on that night. A loss on Saturday would have made him the instant fall guy amid public demand for the Fury bout. Once again he was emphatic. He found his range early on with flicked jabs as 39-year-old Pulev boxed cautiously and struggled to throw anything fast or crisp. When the challenger did throw a jab in the third, a counter right landed on his jaw and stunned him. Pulev briefly tried to smile and roar in the face of adversity but eventually turned his back while under attack and faced a count. In a frenzied spell, an uppercut then sent him to the canvas before the round was out. The pair punched one another after the bell, exchanged glares before the fifth and, while Pulev gained at least a footing in the following rounds, he was never able to land anything that would allow him to dictate. Some will ask why Joshua was unable to end things more quickly, but after a year out of the ring, he controlled a fight against a man who had just one loss - to Wladimir Klitschko - on his record. He could not miss with the right uppercut all night and the shot dropped the game Pulev in the ninth, before a jolting straight right to the chin left him unable to answer the count as the champion swaggered away, aware his night's work was over. It is testament to Joshua that he continues to rise to such mental challenges. Fury will move better than Pulev, punch with far greater variety, believe in himself more and set far more traps in the ring. He will also inevitably bring a whole new level of mental warfare to any build-up should the fight happen. Hope has never been higher that it will. After being caught heavily by Joshua in round three Pulev roared and smiled defiantly No sooner had Pulev regained his footing, Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn said efforts to make the Fury fight would start ""tomorrow"", adding: ""It's the only fight to be made in boxing. It is the biggest fight in British boxing history."" Fury's co-promoter Bob Arum - one of several key power brokers involved - said he would work from Monday to make the ""biggest fight since Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier in 1971"". That such integral figures seem so positive, coupled with the fact an agreement over a financial split is said to already be in place, offers real hope the two could appear in what Fury's UK promoter Frank Warren repeatedly says will be the ""biggest UK sporting event since the 1966 World Cup final"". There are many issues to resolve before a date is in place - complex television broadcast deals and a venue among them. The sight of 1,000 fans singing Sweet Caroline before Joshua's ring walk showed a return to packed out arenas - which will be a necessity for this event - is closer. In the ring, the pair are both showing signs of improvement. Fury moved from elusive fighter to front-foot aggressor in beating Deontay Wilder last time out. Joshua - on Saturday and in beating Ruiz - has shown he too can do more than just wield knockout punches. This was defence number one of his second reign as champion. A small cluster of men - Ali, Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson among them - have had the chance to take the heavyweight world champion journey a second time. Fury is in the select bunch too. The plot lines are endless. It is time to make the fight of a generation. Moments after his win Joshua threw another punch, this time at a poster featuring Pulev BBC Radio 5 Live analyst Steve Bunce:Tyson Fury will be seeing that and saying if he fights like that against me I will walk right through him. Joshua kept flipping between styles and tactics. British heavyweight Dillian Whyte on BBC Radio 5 Live:Joshua did what he had to do, which was worry about winning today, not worry about what he will do tomorrow. He looked good. He boxed well, he moved well, he punched well. Obviously, Pulev was not much of a threat, but Joshua showed he is a champion. BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello on BBC Radio 5 Live:In the end a devastating performance. Destructive hitting from Anthony Joshua.

Home of Italy's Paolo Rossi burgled during funeral,"Paolo Rossi, who led Italy to their 1982 World Cup title, died on Thursday at the age of 64 The home of Italy's 1982 World Cup hero Paolo Rossi was burgled during his funeral service on Saturday, local reports say. The footballer's funeral was held in the north-eastern city of Vicenza after he died on Thursday at the age of 64. Italy's Ansa news agency said Rossi's wife, Federica Cappelletti, returned home from the ceremony to find their home in Tuscany had been broken into. A watch belonging to Rossi and cash were among the items reported stolen. The break-in has been reported to the police and an investigation is under way. Rossi and his family lived in a farmhouse in Poggio Cennina, a resort overlooking the Val d'Ambra southeast of Florence, where Rossi ran an organic farming company. Italian reports say Rossi's wife Federica Cappelletti discovered the burglary after returning home from the funeral His death triggered an outpouring of grief in Italy, where he is widely regarded to be one the country's best attacking players of all time. He scored 20 goals in 48 appearances for the Italian national side, including six during the team's World Cup triumph in 1982. At club level he was a prolific scorer for Vicenza and Juventus, with whom he won two Serie A league titles. This video can not be played UK users only: World Cup moments: Rossi's hat-trick Vicenza was where thousands of mourners gathered to say their last goodbyes to Rossi on Saturday. His coffin was carried to the Santa Maria Annunciata cathedral by his teammates from the 1982 World Cup-winning side, including Marco Tardelli, Giancarlo Antognoni, Antonio Cabrini and Fulvio Collovati. Italy's 1982 World Cup hero dies aged 64 ""I have not only lost a team mate, but also a friend and a brother,"" said Cabrini during the service. ""Together we fought, we won and we sometimes lost, always picking ourselves up even in the face of disappointment. We were part of a group, that group, our group. I didn't think he would leave so soon."" Fans of Rossi gathered outside the cathedral to pay their respects Players gathered for a minute of silence to commemorate the death of Rossi Before the funeral, Rossi's coffin was placed at the Stadio Romeo Menti in Vicenza, where supporters could lay flowers and pay their respects. Meanwhile, football players wore black armbands in memory of Rossi for Saturday's fixtures in Italy.

Kuenssberg: Chances of deal rising?,"This video can not be played Johnson: 'Whatever happens, the UK will do very, very well' When is a deadline not a deadline? When it's anything to do with Brexit, perhaps. Both sides in this long, long process, have agreed to go on rather than pull the plug today. A joint statement emerged just before noon with a much more positive tone than anything that's come out of late, and did not feature the usual kind of warning of big gaps between the two sides. The froideur from Thursday and Friday seems to be thawing a little. It's also worth noting no new time limit was put on the talks, although of course there is one hard deadline of 31 December, when the status quo runs out. It's also worth noting that the prime minister was loath to show much sign of optimism when he appeared in front of a camera shortly after the joint statement emerged. PM and EU chief agree to extend Brexit trade talks Live: Reaction to talks continuing Stripping away the spin on both sides, there is little question that the prospects of a deal felt slim at the end of the week. The prime minister moved repeatedly to start warning the public and business that leaving without an agreement felt increasingly likely, unless there was some shift in the EU position. This video can not be played Ursula von der Leyen says Brexit negotiations will continue Remember it's not that long ago that a deal had seemed within reach, before some countries started pushing for a more robust approach. It seems now that in the last couple of days the negotiators have taken some small steps back towards that position with suggestions that Brussels has softened its position on how the two sides sort out disputes over common rules in the years to come. There are whispers that they have pulled back from trying to include the ""ratchet clause"",a major UK gripe explained by my colleague Faisal Islam. This was the problem described by Mr Johnson on Thursday using a rather bizarre metaphor about twins. However you describe it, it was clear the UK just wasn't willing to accept that the EU could take punitive action on its own, so the negotiators have been trying to sort out how to fix it together. Indeed one diplomatic source suggested that the ""ratchet clause"" approach had been abandoned some time ago, and the political narratives on both sides have been running behind what's been happening in the negotiating room. The circle around the talks is extremely tight so it is very hard to know precisely what is going on. It is possible that both sides are dangling concessions. One Cabinet minister on the call with the prime minister said even they weren't told about the details of where any movement has been going on. But there is the sense now that the ground has shifted enough to make the chance of a deal worth pursuing. As the Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC this morning, there is always the possibility of ""creative contours in the drafting"". In other words - the political imperatives to make this happen are so strong that even tricky issues at this late stage can still potentially be fudged. It's far from certain that the talks will end in agreement, but the chances of resolution are once again on the rise.

What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal?,"The UK has been in a transition period with the EU since last January, during which rules and trade have stayed the same. But all of this will come to an end on 1 January 2021. With just a few weeks left for the UK and the EU to negotiate a trade agreement, both sides are now talking about the prospect of a no-deal outcome. If there's no trade agreement in place, they will have to adjust quickly to doing things very differently. So how are both sides preparing? For the first six months from 1 January, the British government will bring in only minimal checks on goods coming in to the UK, but the EU will have full border checks on goods coming into the EU from the UK straight away. The UK government haswarned thata reasonable worst-case scenario could see queues of 7,000 trucks clogging up the roads around Dover and the Channel Tunnel. The UK government has two contingency plans for this: Operation Brock and Operation Fennel. Operation Brock is a traffic management plan, which it is hoped will prevent more than 10,000 lorries a day from clogging up roads in Kent. Under the scheme, drivers of very large lorries will need to get a special permit - a Kent Access Permit - before they enter the county, and permits will only be issued if they have completed the correct paperwork for exporting goods. Other traffic will be kept flowing around them, in what is known as a contraflow system. Highways England istrialling the moveable road barrier,external, which makes the contraflow system possible, on the M20 over four nights from 11 December. If there are more than 2,000 lorries queued up, the government has made plans for several temporary lorry parks - it bought a 27-acre site in Ashford in Kent. There is also a plan called Operation Fennel in which as many as 7,000 heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) could be diverted to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate. This is part of the government's plans for building facilities away from ports. If further capacity is needed, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. The UK government has also set up the Border Operations Centre to co-ordinate the response to any further disruption. Queuing at ports is not the only problem for lorry drivers. If no further steps are taken, UK lorry drivers would need to apply for documents called ECMT permits to be allowed to enter EU countries.The European Commission has warned that,externalthere are not enough of these permits available, which would mean not enough UK lorries being able to travel to the EU to pick up goods to bring back to the UK. The European Commission said this could result in serious disruptions, ""potentially even threatening public order"". To prevent this, it proposed allowing UK lorries and buses into the EU for six months without special permits, as long as EU drivers are also allowed into the UK. The proposals would also allow regular bus services that pick up and drop off passengers on either side of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland to continue to do so. The UK has not been clear yet on whether it plans to continue to allow EU operators to enter the country. A similar proposal is on the table for aviation. In the event of no deal, the UK would no longer be a member of the European Common Aviation Area, which allows British airlines to fly to destinations in the EU, and vice versa. The European Commission is proposing a six month regulation to allow flights to continue until a new agreement is in place, but it would require the UK government to offer the same to operators from EU countries. The UK has not yet responded to the proposal. The UK government has told pharmaceutical companies to stockpile and plan alternative supply routes in case of border problems. It has also arranged extra freight capacity for pharmaceutical companies should they need it. Ina memo, seen by the BBCin June, pharmaceutical companies warned the government that some stockpiles of medicines have been ""used up entirely"" by the coronavirus pandemic and said these could not be replenished in time for the UK's exit from the EU. The head of the Association of  the British Pharmaceutical Industrywarned,externalthat not having any sort of deal would cause ""increased complexity, duplication and cost"" in the middle of a pandemic. The government insisted, however, that ""robust contingency plans are in place"". For the coronavirus vaccine, the government says there are contingency plans for making sure the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine made in Belgium can be shipped to the UK if border problems arise. These include alternative sea routes and the use of freight oreven military aircraft. The European Commission has also proposed extending the deadline to reach an agreement on fishing until the end of December 2021. This would allow European fishing vessels to continue fishing in British waters and vice-versa for another year, or until an agreement is reached. But a Downing Street spokesman said the UK ""would never accept arrangements and access to UK fishing waters which are incompatible with our status as an independent coastal state"". The Ministry of Defence has saidit will make four patrol boats availableto monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place"". As things stand, if nothing is agreed then non-UK boats will not be allowed to fish in UK waters from January. But without a deal, the UK fishing industry would find its extensive exports to EU countries being hit by tariffs (import taxes) and regulatory hurdles. Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? The French government has said it would hand out compensation to trawlers if they were not able to fish in UK waters.

LiveLivePM and EU chief speak amid Brexit deadlock7 minutes ago,"PM Boris Johnson says the UK and EU are ""still very far apart"" on key issues relating to a post-Brexit deal, and the UK must be ready to trade on WTO terms Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to continue trade talks beyond Sunday's deadline In a joint statement, the leaders said it was ""responsible at this point to go the extra mile"" The pair discussed ""major unresolved topics"" during a phone call, which Mrs von der Leyen called ""constructive and useful"" But three ""critical issues"" remain: fishing rights, government support for industry and how a deal is enforced Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the talks on Brexit trade remained ""finely balanced"" French fishing fleets would have ""zero assured access"" to UK waters in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year Edited by Julian Joyce and George Bowden We're bringing our live coverage of today's events to a close, but here is a quick catch-up on developments:  Our writers and editors today were: Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner, Gavin Stamp, Justin Parkinson, George Bowden and Julian Joyce. Thanks for reading. The Scottish government has called for an end to the ""crippling uncertainty"" over the future trading relationship with the EU. It comes after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson today agreed that post-Brexit trade deal talks will continue this week. The Scottish government's Cabinet Secretary for Europe and External Affairs, Michael Russell, said:
""It is now time for the crippling uncertainty over the future of our trading relationship with the European Union to come to an end. ""Whatever the outcome of these protracted talks, we know there will be very significant damage to Scotland's economy and society because of the UK government's decision to leave the transition period on 31 December in the middle of a pandemic and a recession. ""But we also know that the worst outcome of all would be the disastrous impact of a no-deal Brexit - which would lead to significant tariffs - and the UK government must rule this out immediately."" The CBI, the UK's business lobby group, says that news the UK and the EU will continue Brexit talks gives it hope. But it says: ""Ongoing
delays are frustrating and cost businesses."" The CBI says the UK government must, firstly, provide detailed guidance to businesses this week on issues such border checks. Secondly, companies must be given a grace period to allow them to adjust to a deal or no deal. ""And
third, prepare support for firms who will face the greatest challenges in
the short run. Those in sectors and supply chains that are badly hit
will face extinction through tariffs, red tape and extra costs."" As talks about how the UK and EU could live and work together after Brexit near a mutual deadline, let's take a look at some of the language being used. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - from transition period to WTO. Here is whatsome of the key ones mean. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor When is a deadline not a deadline? When it's anything to do with Brexit, perhaps. Both sides in this long, long process, have agreed to go on, rather than pull the plug today.

Simon JackBBC Business Editor This torture is better than no deal. The fact that talks are ongoing is a good thing. Business
groups are unanimous in their view that if a deal is at all possible, it should
be pursued with every last effort. However, the problem with this uncertainty torture is
two-fold. First, political and business timetables are getting
increasingly misaligned by the day. Businesses need to know whether tariffs are
coming or not as it effects pricing of products and services for next year. How
can I place or take an order if I donât know what that price needs to be? Second, there is a danger that businesses who watch this
process being dragged out will wait for some rabbit to appear out of the hat and take their focus away from preparing for a deal. No deal is very bad - a
deal still leaves an awful lot of work to do in preparing for new procedures, for example customs, that will change whether we get a deal or not. But the fact remains that while this may be torture, it
could be worse. No deal would not put UK business out of its misery â it could
put some sectors out of business. A few moments ago, Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave an update on the post-Brexit trade deal discussions between the UK and the EU after both sides agreed to continue talking. He cautioned that the two sides were ""very far apart on key things"", adding that the most likely outcome was no deal. This video can not be played Johnson: 'Whatever happens, the UK will do very, very well' We've been telling you about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. He later briefed members of the Cabinet from his office at 10 Downing Street - and now a picture of the PM giving that briefing has been released. It was taken by his photographer Andrew Parsons. A continuation of Brexit talks is not all good news - uncertainty means that businesses such as retailers are finding it extremely difficult to prepare for 1 January. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) says that, without a deal, UK shops face Â£3bn in tariffs and those extra charges could be passed onto customers. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson, said: ""Both sides must double down and do what is
necessary to agree a zero-tariff agreement, or else it will be the public that
pay the price of this failure. ""With many peopleâs finances already strained by
the economic impact of coronavirus, households can ill-afford a significant
rise in food prices. ""For the sake of customers and businesses around the UK, we
need a deal in the next three weeks.â Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was still a deal to be done ""if our partners want to do it - but we remain very apart on these key issues"". He said: ""The UK canât be locked into the EUâs regulatory orbit and weâve obviously got to take back control of our fisheries, so those are the points - I think itâs very clear what the UK is talking about.""       Mr Johnson said the UK ""certainly wonât be walking away from the talks"", reiterating what Ursula von der Leyen said, that ""people would expect us to go the extra mile"". He said he repeated his offer to talk to ""other capitals"" but said the Commission was ""very determined"" to keep the negotiations between the UK and Commission. Mr Johnson said the UK had made ""huge preparations"" to leave without a deal. ""Weâve now been at this for four and a half years, itâs a long time. Perhaps more intensively in the last couple of years than previously.Weâve got ready and anybody who needs to know what to do, get on togov.uk/transition,external, see what needs to be done and get ready for 1 January.Either way, whatever happens the UK will do very very well."" In his statement earlier Boris Johnson warned the UK had to ""get ready for WTO terms, Australia terms"", if the current talks with the EU do not succeed. To be clear, an Australian-style Brexit would mean no trade deal with the EU and would see the UK trading instead under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). But what does that mean?Read more here. ""Get ready with confidence for 1 January - trading on WTO terms if we have to,"" Johnson says in his statement. ""Get ready to trade on WTO terms - and there is a clarity and a simplicity in that approach which has its own advantages,"" he says, adding: ""It's not where we wanted to get to."" ""We're going to try with all our hearts,"" he says of the ongoing negotiations for a trade deal. Speaking to broadcasters, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""we're still very far apart on key things"" as post-Brexit trade talks continue in Brussels. He says he is ""very happy"" to speak with other European capitals, and he repeats: ""The most likely thing now is that we have to get ready to WTO terms - Australia terms."" Earlier, the PM held a cabinet call following talks this morning with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Following those talks, the EU and UK issued a joint statement confirming negotiations to reach a post-Brexit trade deal would continue. The Timesâ political editor, Steven Swinford, has justtweeted,externala read-out from the cabinet call, saying the PM sounded ""downbeat"" about the chances of reaching a deal.

Labour has urged the UK government to seal a trade deal with the EU after the two sides agreed to carry on negotiating. A party spokesman said: ""The Conservatives promised the British people that they had an oven-ready deal and that they would get Brexit done. ""The government needs to deliver on that promise, get us the deal and allow us to move on as a country."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has also warned people not to start stockpiling goods ahead of 1 January. âRetailers are doing everything they can to prepare for all eventualities on 1 January - increasing the stock of tins, toilet rolls and other longer life products so there will be sufficient supply of essential products,"" says BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson . ""While no amount of preparation by retailers can entirely prevent
disruption there is no need for the public to buy more food than
usual as the main impact will be on imported fresh produce, such as fresh fruit
and vegetables, which cannot be stored for long periods by either retailers or
consumers."" Charles Michel, the president of
the European Council, has said the European Union would not lose its
cool as make-or-break talks with Britain over a post-Brexit trade
deal approach their climax. Michel, who chairs EU summits, told France Inter Radio that
the EU wanted a good deal that respected the
integrity of its single market, the Reuters news agency reports. This video can not be played Von der Leyen: 'It is responsible to go the extra mile and continue talks' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has confirmed that talks for a post-Brexit trade deal will continue between the UK and EU. She said ""despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations"", it was ""responsible to go the extra mile"". Kevin ConnollyEurope correspondent, Brussels Ursula von der Leyen described her call with Boris Johnson as ""constructive"" and ""useful"". She used Imperial measurements when she talked about ""going the extra mile"", perhaps a nod to the British side. And there is no apparent deadline now - I think they may have felt that that created the wrong impression of what would happen today.

âPolitical willâ needed for Brexit trade dealBoris Johnson and his EU counterpart are due to make a decision on the future of talks shortly.,"This video can not be played Raab: The conversation between Ursula von der Leyen and Boris Johnson is really important ""Political will"" is needed for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, says Dominic Raab. The foreign secretary said the situation was ""finely balanced"" after negotiations between the two sides carried on through the night. But he said the EU would need to change its position for progress to be made. Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen have been speaking on the phone to decide if a deal can be done. The PM is now holding a call with his cabinet to discuss the outcome, and a statement is expected shortly. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen set a deadline of Sunday to decide whether to abandon negotiations or keep them going. But both sides have warned they are unlikely to reach an agreement. Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he believed a no-deal scenario ""would be very bad news for all of us"" and ""an appalling failure of statecraft"" on both sides. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal? What happens if there's no trade deal? The main sticking point in the talks is how close the UK should stick to EU economic rules in the future. The EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets - not paying taxes on goods being bought and sold - while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. Fishing rights is another major area of disagreement, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. Mr Raab said that at this stage of negotiations, ""what really matters is the political will"". He told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""The bar is quite high for us to be able to keep talking. We would need at a political level a commitment to move on those two key issues. ""Never say never because EU negotiations can often drag and drift. But actually we do need finality and therefore we need at the political level of Ursula von der Leyen that there is clarity the EU will move on those two key issues. ""If we get that then there are still talks to be processed."" But Labour's Ed Miliband accused the government of being ""ideological"" over its position in the talks, and warned leaving without a trade deal would be ""disastrous for the country"". He told Andrew Marr: ""[The prime minister] has been cavalier with our national interests and is playing Russian roulette with jobs and livelihoods of people up and down the land."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Philip Rycroft, who was a civil service head at the UK Department for Exiting the European Union between 2017 and 2019, told BBC Breakfast things were ""looking a bit grim"" for a trade deal. ""Frankly, the energy seems to be draining out of this,"" he said. ""I think if we were heading for a deal you'd be seeing a lot more diplomatic activity - there would be signs of a lot more conversations going on."" But Irish PM Mr Martin told Andrew Marr the fact talks had gone overnight gave him ""hope"" there would be agreement. He called for the teams ""with any bit of energy we have left [to] focus on negotiating a deal"". This video can not be played Labour's Ed Miliband clashed with Andrew Marr on fishing rights Meanwhile, the National Farmers' Union have warned there will be ""significant disruption"" to the sector if the UK fails to reach a trade deal with the EU. The EU is the largest trading partner for British farmers - but without a deal by the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, farmers could lose free access to the bloc ""overnight"", the union said. Elsewhere, Labour warned that staffing levels in the government's tax and customs agency had barely been scaled up since the Brexit vote, despite widespread customs changes expected even if the UK is able to secure a deal. The party said its analysis suggested the number of UK customs officials had been boosted by just 16, despite a pledge from ministers in 2018 to recruit between 3,000 and 5,000 extra officials.

Scotland care home vaccinations begin on MondayBoth staff and older residents will begin receiving the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine from the start of this week.,"There were concerns about administering the vaccine in care homes because it must be stored at ultra low temperatures Covid-19 vaccinations will begin in care homes on Monday, the Scottish government has said. Staff and older residents will be next to receive the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine after more than 5,000 NHS staff and vaccinators got the jab last week. There had been fears that homes would not be able to receive the first batch of doses due to logistical challenges. It comes as the Conservatives called for vaccination plans to be published for each health board in Scotland. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said older care home residents had been prioritised to receive the vaccine along with care staff. However she also warned that the pace of the vaccination programme remained dependent on the supply of the vaccine, which is manufactured in Belgium. Covid vaccinations begin at sites across Scotland What are the safety checks for vaccines? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Thefirst consignment of the vaccine arrived in the UK last weekand was distributed to vaccination centres across the four nations. They were initially stored in packs of 997 doses in specialist freezers because the Pfizer vaccine must be kept at a temperature of at least -70C. The Scottish government said it had received confirmation the vaccine could be ""packed down"" by health boards into smaller sizes, which meant the programme could be rolled out to care homes. The go-ahead was given by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The vaccine will be taken directly to care homes or to nearby vaccination centres in 195 five-dose vials, which Ms Freeman said would result in ""minimal wastage"". These vials will need to be diluted before use. They can also be transported in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours and can be stored undiluted for up to five days, the Scottish health secretary said. Ms Freeman said: ""We are providing the vaccine to people in care homes according to the order of priority set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and we will work through that order of priority as quickly as vaccine supply allows."" She said that ministers were hopeful that ""subject to further stringent approvals"", other vaccines, such as those being developed by AstraZeneca and Moderna, would be available soon. It follows comments to BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme by Westminster Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier this week that the speed of the vaccination programme over the coming weeks would be determined by how quickly the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine could be manufactured in Belgium. He said: ""We've got a broad schedule and there'll be several millions for the UK as a whole and so several hundred thousand for Scotland over the remainder of this month. ""We've got that as a broad delivery schedule, but obviously the manufacturing process itself is complicated so we've got to get the stuff in the country."" The Scottish Conservatives have called for each individual health board in Scotland to publish its vaccination plans to prevent what they described as a ""postcode lottery"" from developing. The party's health spokesman Donald Cameron, said: ""Opposition MSPs seeking to scrutinise plans and get answers for their constituents are struggling to get information from the SNP and health boards. ""The answers we do get are frequently sluggish and incomplete. ""The public needs to know every detail has been covered. Secrecy will not benefit anyone."" The Scottish government said talk of a lottery was ""irresponsible"" and said Jeane Freeman had offered to meet with opposition parties to discuss details of how the vaccine was being delivered.

Germany to go into coronavirus lockdown,"Christmas shopping has been blamed for the recent rise in cases Germany is to go into a hard lockdown over the Christmas period as the number of deaths and infections from the coronavirus reaches record levels. Non-essential shops will close across the country from Wednesday, as will schools, with children to be cared for at home wherever possible. Chancellor Angela Merkel blamed Christmas shopping for a ""considerable"" rise in social contacts. The latest figures showed 20,200 more infections and a further 321 deaths. The new lockdown will run from 16 December to 10 January. Announcing the move after meeting leaders of the country's 16 states, Mrs Merkel said there was ""an urgent need to take action"". A maximum of five people from no more than two households are allowed to gather in a home. But this will be relaxed from 24 to 26 December when one household will be able to invite a maximum of four close family members from other households. What are the Christmas rules around Europe? The mask-wearing city that bucked the trend Restaurants, bars and leisure centres have already been closed since November, and some areas of the country had imposed their own lockdowns. Under the national lockdown, essential shops, such as those selling food, will stay open, as can banks. Outlets selling Christmas trees can also continue trading. Hair salons are among the businesses which must close. Companies are being urged to allow employees to work from home. This video can not be played Many markets in Germany have been cancelled due to the pandemic Care homes will be authorised to carry out coronavirus tests. New Year events and the sale of fireworks will be banned. Drinking of alcohol in public places, such as popular mulled wine stalls, is also forbidden. Finance Minister Olaf Scholz said affected businesses would receive up to 500,000 euros (Â£457,000, $605,000) in government support per month. Bavaria is extending a night curfew from areas with high infection rates to the whole state - the second most populous in Germany. Chancellor Merkel said it was the government's job to ""prevent an overload of our health systems and that's why there is an urgent need to take action"". The latest official figures on Sunday showed 20,200 more infections, bringing Germany's total to date to more than 1.3 million. The death toll has risen by 321 to 21,787, the Robert Koch Institute says. This video can not be played Have we become bored of following Covid rules? Germany had been seen as relatively successful in controlling the pandemic compared with European neighbours, thanks in part to testing and tracing. But there is a growing recognition among political leaders that what was dubbed ""lockdown lite"" has not achieved enough. ""If we're not careful, Germany could quickly become Europe's problem child,"" Bavaria's Prime Minister Markus SÃ¶der warned. ""For that reason, we had to and we must act."" He did not rule out Germany extending lockdown beyond 10 January. The government had to take action, Chancellor Merkel said A vaccination campaign inItalywill aim to use flower-shaped gazebos set up in parks, sports fields and city squares to begin inoculating the public by mid-January, the country's special commissioner for the Covid emergency, Domenico Arcuri, said on Sunday. The architect behind the gazebos' design, Stefano Boeri, said the flower was the sign of the beginning of spring, ""a symbol of serenity and rebirth"". Italy is now the European nation with the highest coronavirus death toll, according to the latest figures from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control. It has recorded 64,036 confirmed Covid-related deaths, overtaking the UK, which has recorded 64,026. People across theUKhave been asked to think ""really carefully"" aboutthe risk of more social contact over Christmasas restrictions are eased between 23 and 27 December. Three households will be permitted to form a ""bubble"" and mix indoors and stay overnight during the five-day period. People have been urged to avoid shopping in the city centre at weekends in The Hague Meanwhile in theNetherlands, which recorded nearly 10,000 new Covid infections over the latest 24-hour period, officials are urging Christmas shoppers to avoid city centres - such as Amsterdam and The Hague - at weekends. ""Come alone, don't linger too long, keep your distance and shop at quiet times,"" authorities said in a statement. The country has been in partial lockdown since 13 October. The Dutch government has been discussing additional measures to curb the spread of the virus. InSwitzerland, five hospitals have sent a letter to health minister Alain Berset expressing ""great concern about the current situation"" relating to Covid-19 patients, local media report. Hospitals in Geneva, Bern, Zurich, Basel, and Lausanne said intensive care units (ICU) were reaching full capacity and nurses were under extreme pressure. No curfew or limit to alcohol sales will be imposed in Moscow during the New Year holiday, despite a rise in Covid infections in theRussiancapital, the mayor is quoted by Interfax news agency as saying on Sunday. From Monday, schools across the Stockholm region ofSwedenhave been asked to switch to distance learning for 13 to 15-year-olds for the first time. Students over the age of 16 returned to digital lessons nationwide on 7 December. Among other measures for the Christmas period, Swedes are also advised to meet a maximum of eight people, gather outdoors if possible and avoid travelling by train or bus.

EU offer 'unacceptable' as Brexit talks continue,"Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen met in Brussels on Wednesday Post-Brexit trade talks have gone through the night as the UK and EU enter a critical day - with leaders set to decide whether a deal can be done. Both sides have warned they are unlikely to reach an agreement. The terms offered by the European Union continue to be ""unacceptable"" to the UK, according to a government source. Boris Johnson is expected to speak with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen at lunchtime after agreeing the Sunday deadline this week. If the two sides have not come to an agreement, Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen will decide whether to abandon negotiations or continue them beyond the deadline. What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What are the UK and EU doing to prepare for no deal? What happens if there's no trade deal? Speaking to Sky's Sophy Ridge programme, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the ability of getting a deal rests with the leaders, saying: ""What ultimately is required at this 11th hour is moving the political logjam."" He said the UK ""can't close the door"" on future talks after Sunday, but there is now a ""very high bar"" to continue, adding: ""We are not there yet"". Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin said he believed a no-deal scenario ""would be very bad news for all of us"" and ""an appalling failure of statecraft"" on both sides. He told the BBC's Andrew Marr the fact talks had gone overnight gave him ""hope"" there would be agreement, and called for the teams ""with any bit of energy we have left [to] focus on negotiating a deal"". And speaking to the same programme, Labour's former leader Ed Miliband said no deal ""would be disastrous for the country"", adding that it would be a ""disgrace"" for the PM not to agree one. He said: ""[Mr Johnson] has been cavalier with our national interests and is playing Russian roulette with jobs and livelihoods of people up and down the land."" The main sticking point in the talks is how close the UK should stick to EU economic rules in the future. The EU is determined to prevent the UK from gaining what it sees as an unfair advantage of having tariff-free access to its markets - not paying taxes on goods being bought and sold - while setting its own standards on products, employment rights and business subsidies. Fishing rights is another major area of disagreement, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for EU fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters, and its wider business rules, should be under its control as a sovereign country. The UK's chief negotiator, Lord David Frost, pictured in Brussels on Sunday as talks continued The government confirmed on Saturday thatno-deal preparations had seen Royal Navy vessels prepared to tackle ""threats of illegal fishing""in UK waters. Outlining the steps taken to prepare for all Brexit eventualities, a UK government spokesman said: ""We've run live exercises moving fresh produce and fish across the border, and scrambled naval vessels to respond to threats of illegal fishing in our soon-to-be sovereign waters."" The two sides also disagree on whether the European Court of Justice should settle future UK-EU trade disputes. It is not clear how any decision to abandon the talks will be made public and there is a chance political leaders will decide to continue negotiations beyond Sunday, BBC Europe correspondent Kevin Connolly said. A government source said: ""The prime minister will leave no stone unturned in this process, but he is absolutely clear: any agreement must be fair and respect the fundamental position that the UK will be a sovereign nation in three weeks' time."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Foreign Secretary Mr Raab said the UK ""wants to be treated like any other independent and self respecting democracy"", but claimed the EU was ""concerned the UK might do very well when it leaves.... and is worried about the competitive advantage."" Philip Rycroft, who was a civil service head at the UK Department for Exiting the European Union between 2017 and 2019, told BBC Breakfast things were ""looking a bit grim"" for a trade deal. ""Frankly, the energy seems to be draining out of this,"" he said. ""I think if we were heading for a deal you'd be seeing a lot more diplomatic activity - there would be signs of a lot more conversations going on."" Meanwhile, the National Farmers' Union have warned there will be ""significant disruption"" to the sector if the UK fails to reach a trade deal with the EU. The EU is the largest trading partner for British farmers - but without a deal by the end of the Brexit transition period on 31 December, farmers could lose free access to the bloc ""overnight"", the union said. Elsewhere, Labour warned that staffing levels in the government's tax and customs agency had barely been scaled up since the Brexit vote, despite widespread customs changes expected even if the UK is able to secure a deal. The party said its analysis suggested the number of UK customs officials had been boosted by just 16, despite a pledge from ministers in 2018 to recruit between 3,000 and 5,000 extra officials. This video can not be played Boris Johnson said on Friday that a no-deal Brexit was ""very, very likely"" This weekend's deadline was set by Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen following a meeting in Brussels on Wednesday, after months of talks failed to achieve an agreement. Mr Johnson said the EU needed to make a ""big change"" over the main sticking points on fishing rights and business competition rules, while Mrs von der Leyen said no deal was the most probable end to ""difficult"" talks. The EU has rejected Mr Johnson's request to bypass the European Commission and speak directly to French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel about the unresolved issues. According to EU officials, he was told discussions could only take place through the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier. Speaking on Friday, the PM said a no-deal Brexit was now ""very, very likely"" and that planning for that outcome was ramping up. Mrs von der Leyen told reporters that the two sides were still ""apart on fundamental issues"". SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

âPolitical willâ needed for Brexit trade deal,"This video can not be played Raab: The conversation between Ursula von der Leyen and Boris Johnson is really important ""Political will"" is needed for the UK and EU to agree a post-Brexit trade deal, says Dominic Raab. The foreign secretary said the situation was ""finely balanced"" after negotiations between the two sides carried on through the night. But he said the EU would need to change its position for progress to be made. Boris Johnson and European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen have been speaking on the phone to decide if a deal can be done. The PM is now holding a call with his cabinet to discuss the outcome, and a statement is expected shortly. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson and Mrs von der Leyen set a deadline of Sunday to decide whether to abandon negotiations or keep them going.

Covid mass testing a 'massive waste of resources'A public health expert says there is little evidence to suggest it helps cut transmission rates.Wales,"Test centres in the Lower Cynon Valley in Rhondda Cynon Taf will run until 20 December Continuing mass testing in Wales could be a ""massive-scale of waste of resources"", a leading public health expert has said. Figures show less than 1.5% of people were testing positive as part ofpilots in Merthyr Tydfiland thelower Cynon Valley. Dr Angela Raffle said there was little evidence to suggest it helped cut transmission. First Minister Mark Drakeford said mass testing ""has a part to play"". Dr Raffle, a senior lecturer in population sciences at Bristol University, said mass testing was ""incredibly resource intensive"". ""We simply don't know whether you'll find enough cases who would have transmitted a lot, and who don't [transmit Covid-19] simply because you found them,"" she said. ""And we don't know whether telling lots of people they're negative could actually undermine any potential benefit. ""It could be the most massive scale of waste of resources."" Second mass testing phase to tackle Covid hotspot Hundreds queue as mass testing begins in Wales Dr Raffle said there were also concerns around the accuracy of thelateral flow tests, which are being used within mass testing schemes and produce results in as little as 20 minutes. Nearly 1,000 people were tested in the first day the scheme was held in Merthyr Tydfil in November In labs, lateral flow tests were found to be about 70% effective at detecting positive cases, but Dr Raffle said pilots,such as one in Liverpool, found them to be much lower. ""The UK government said, initially, that the test had been extensively evaluated,"" she toldPolitics Wales. ""What we know from Liverpool is that the test centres there only picked up half of the positives."" Under-pressure health board halts non-urgent care Post-Christmas lockdown warning for Wales However, executive director of public health at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, Dr Kelechi Nnoaham, said the pilots in Wales had been a success so far ""We've been delighted at the amount of engagement we've had,"" he said. ""In our pilot we found about 70% sensitivity, which means that if you have 10 people who are actually infected, the test will pick up seven of them."" Dr Nnoaham added there was ""a risk around false negatives"" which affected the health board's messaging around the tests. In Liverpool, theintroduction of mass testingwas cited by both Prime Minister Boris Johnson and UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock as being behind a sharp drop in case rates. Merthyr Tydfil has seen some of the highest rates of Covid-19 in the UK In Merthyr Tydfil, the number of coronavirus cases per 100,000 peoplehas risen from 245.3, when mass testing was introduced, to 808.9. Dr Raffle said if mass testing was ""really breaking the chain"" then, in theory, cases should start to fall. But Dr Nnoaham said the increase in cases was reflective of rises across the whole of Wales and the impact of mass testing would not be evident ""for another few weeks"". Mr Drakeford said: ""We are sure that mass testing has a part to play. We will evaluate what we have done in Merthyr, we will learn from what is going on in the Cynon Valley, we will see how best to use it. ""But the idea that it is not a useful tool in the armoury is one that simply doesn't bear examination. ""I hope that we will be able to take the positive learning from Merthyr. Merthyr has been a fantastic effort by the local council, by the local health board, by the local population. Lisa Mytton, deputy leader of Merthyr Council, said mass testing was ""definitely working"" and would be extended by a week to 19 December. She said any rise in Covid figures was concerning but the numbers were ""positive in some lights as it shows people have come to the testing and shown they were asymptomatic but were actually carrying the virus around"". ""It is still vitally important to keep the message going"" in regards to social distancing as ""this virus knows no regulations and it knows no boundaries,"" she added. ""We will learn a lot about how to do it elsewhere and to use those lateral flow devices in the most effective way."" Plaid Cymru's spokesman on health, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said mass testing should be expanded across Wales. He said Slovakia was the ""best example"", where he said they tested 97% of the population aged 10-65 years old and reduced infection rates by 60%. ""We would like to see Welsh Government looking at what the practicalities would be of running that kind of system in Wales,"" he said. Andrew RT Davies, Conservative spokesman on health in the Senedd, said mass testing was ""an important tool"" to suppress the virus, but not ""the only solution"". ""The battle with the testing regime is being won,"" he added. ""What we've got to do is complement it with the vaccine regime and make sure that the resources don't get put into the wrong places.""

More tier 3 areas to get mass testing from MondaySome 67 local authorities in England are taking part in the community testing schemes.,"The rapid tests have already been used by universities before students head home for Christmas Mass testing programmes like the one trialled in Liverpool are to be rolled out in 67 tier three areas of England, with the first starting on Monday. More than 1.6 million of the rapid lateral flow tests will be delivered for community testing this month, the government said. The programme will last six weeks. But concerns have previously been raised about the lateral flow tests, with experts warning they can give false negative results. More areas will be involved in the rollout of testing in the new year. Those involved in this first wave will receive government support for at least six weeks, the Department for Health and Social Care said. It is hoped the testing initiative, along with existing measures, could help lead to an easing of restrictions in tier three areas. The community testing is in addition to schemes run by local directors of public health. They have been able to request a set number of lateral flow tests to be used in their area, regardless of tier, since early November. Can mass testing save us from another lockdown? NHS rapid test use defended amid accuracy concerns Health Secretary Matt Hancock said theenhanced testing programmesfollow the mass testing pilot in Liverpool and were a ""vital additional tool"" in finding asymptomatic cases. It is thought as many as one in three cases of coronavirus could be in people who have no symptoms. However, preliminary data released on Friday by the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) suggested the rapid coronavirus tests rolled out in Liverpool missed about 51% of all Covid-19 cases. Aseparate mass testing schemefor secondary school-aged pupils in London, Essex and Kent was announced earlier this week. Liverpool has taken part in a mass testing programme Earlier this month, Dr Susan Hopkins, senior medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, said the tests were a ""game changer"" and had helped find Covid-19 infections in people that would otherwise have been missed, because they had no symptoms. An evaluation by Oxford University and Public Health England workers at Porton Down previously concluded the test has an overall sensitivity of 76.8%. It detects almost all cases where patients have a high viral load, however. Among the 67 areas taking part in the testing programme isOldham, Greater Manchester, where the increased access to testing will initially focus on schools and colleges, along with those in higher-risk supported living accommodation, and health and social care staff. InKirklees, West Yorkshire, high-risk workplaces will be among those focused on first. And inLancashire, large manufacturing sites and workplaces with staff of more than 200 will be prioritised. Local authorities inKent- said to be seeing a ""worrying"" rise in cases - are also in the first wave of areas taking part in the testing. A full list of the areas involved in this first rollout can be foundhere,external. Mr Hancock said: ""Community testing will be very important in helping the areas where levels of the virus are highest to drive down infection rates and, ultimately, will help areas ease tougher restrictions. ""This is just the start, and we are working quickly to roll out community testing more widely as soon as more local teams are ready. I urge all those living in areas where community testing is offered to come forward and get tested.""

'Not enough' climate ambition shown by leadersUK minister Alok Sharma says world leaders are failing to show the necessary level of ambition.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Mr Sharma said progress had been made, but it was not enough yet to avoid dangerous warming this century The UK minister tasked with leading UN climate talks says world leaders are failing to show the necessary level of ambition. Alok Sharma was speaking at the conclusion of a virtual climate summit organised by the UK, UN and France. He said ""real progress"" had been made and 45 countries had put forward new climate plans for 2030. But these were not enough to prevent dangerous warming this century, Mr Sharma explained. Taking place on the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, the summit heard the UN Secretary General warn that every country needed to declare a climate emergency. Around 70 heads of state and government took part in the meeting, which was organised by the UK, UN and France. They outlined new pledges and commitments to curb carbon. China's contribution was eagerly awaited, not just because it is the world's biggest emitter, but because it has recently promised to reach net zero emissions by 2060. Achieving net zero means that emissions have been cut as much as possible and any remaining releases are balanced by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere, What is climate change? EU leaders raise target for emissions cut to 55% Covid drives record emissions drop in 2020 Have countries kept their climate change promises? But while President Xi Jinping outlined a range of new targets for 2030, many analysts felt these did not go far enough. India brought little in the way of new commitments but Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country was on track to achieve its goals under the Paris agreement and promised a major uptick in wind and solar energy. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world According to the UK, some 24 countries had outlined net zero commitments and 20 had now set out plans to adapt and become more resilient to rising temperatures and their impacts. But despite these commitments, Mr Sharma said not enough had been achieved. ""Have we made any real progress at this summit? And the answer to that is: yes,"" he said. ""But they will also ask, have we done enough to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5C, and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change? To make the Paris Agreement a reality. ""Friends, we must be honest with ourselves, the answer to that, is currently: no. As encouraging as all this ambition is. It is not enough."" Mr Sharma re-stated a commitment made last year to double the UK's international climate finance spend. This will bring it to at least Â£11.6bn over the next five years. Earlier on Saturday, UK Prime Minister Mr Johnson said advances in renewable energy technologies would ""save our planet and create millions of high-skilled jobs"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson outlines a 10-point plan for a ""green industrial revolution"" He added: ""Together we can use scientific advances to protect our entire planet - our biosphere - against a challenge far worse, far more destructive even than the coronavirus. And by the promethean power of our invention, we can begin to defend the Earth against the disaster of global warming."" Meanwhile, UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres criticised rich countries for spending 50% more of their pandemic recovery cash on fossil fuels compared to low-carbon energy. Mr Guterres said that 38 countries had already declared a climate emergency and he called on leaders worldwide to now do the same. On Covid recovery spending, he said that this is money being borrowed from future generations. ""We cannot use these resources to lock in policies that burden future generations with a mountain of debt on a broken planet,"" he said. The meeting is taking place after the pandemic caused the postponement of the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) meeting, which had been due to take place in Glasgow this year. The UK has announced an end to support for overseas fossil fuel projects, and has today deposited a new climate plan with the UN. It's the first time that Britain has had to do this, as it was previously covered by the European Union's climate commitments. The UK pointed to its new commitment on overseas fossil fuel projects as well as a new carbon cutting target of 68% by 2030, announced last week by the prime minister. The EU presented a new 2030 target of a 55% cut in emissions, agreed after all-night negotiations this week. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said: ""It is the go-ahead for scaling up climate action across our economy and society."" China's President Xi Jinping announced that the country would reduce its carbon emissions per unit of gross domestic product (GDP) by over 65% compared with 2005 levels. China will also increase the share of non-fossil fuels in primary energy consumption by about 25%. And President Xi pledged to increase forest cover and boost wind and solar capacity. Hurricane Iota was one of a record number of storms to wreak havoc on the Americas this year But Manish Bapna, managing director of the World Resources Institute (WRI) said: ""The strengthened renewable energy, carbon intensity, and forest targets are steps in the right direction, but recent WRI analysis shows that China would benefit more economically and socially if it aims higher, including by peaking emissions as early as possible."" Although President Donald Trump pulled the US out of the Paris pact, the summit saw statements from the Republican governor of Massachusetts, Charlie Baker, and the Democrat governor of Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, who said the US was ""all-in"" on tackling climate change. Pope Francis said the Vatican had committed to reaching net zero emissions, similar to carbon neutrality, before 2050. ""The time has come to change course. Let us not rob future generations of the hope for a better future,"" he said. A number of big emitters, including Australia, Saudi Arabia, Russia and Mexico, did not take part, as their climate actions were not deemed ambitious enough. Some observers believe this hard line on some countries is justified. ""From a kind of symbolic procedural point of view, it's good to have everybody on board,"" said Prof Heike Schroeder from the University of East Anglia. ""But from a proactive, creating some kind of sense of urgency approach, it also makes sense to say we only get to hear from you if you have something new to say."" The five years since the Paris agreement was adopted have been the warmest on record, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), and emissions have continued to accrue in the atmosphere. But many countries and businesses have started the process of decarbonisation in that time. The progress they've made now needs to be acknowledged and encouraged, says former UN climate chief Christiana Figueres. ""That progress that's been seen in the real economy has to be reflected and incentivised further by those additional commitments,"" she said. One area that yielded little progress at this meeting was the question of finance. Rich countries had promised to mobilise $100bn a year from 2020 under the Paris agreement - but the commitments on cash are not forthcoming. Follow Matton Twitter.,external What is climate change?

Scotland care home vaccinations begin on Monday,"There were concerns about administering the vaccine in care homes because it must be stored at ultra low temperatures Covid-19 vaccinations will begin in care homes on Monday, the Scottish government has said. Staff and older residents will be next to receive the Pfizer/ BioNTech vaccine after more than 5,000 NHS staff and vaccinators got the jab last week. There had been fears that homes would not be able to receive the first batch of doses due to logistical challenges. It comes as the Conservatives called for vaccination plans to be published for each health board in Scotland. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said older care home residents had been prioritised to receive the vaccine along with care staff. However she also warned that the pace of the vaccination programme remained dependent on the supply of the vaccine, which is manufactured in Belgium. Covid vaccinations begin at sites across Scotland What are the safety checks for vaccines? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? Thefirst consignment of the vaccine arrived in the UK last weekand was distributed to vaccination centres across the four nations. They were initially stored in packs of 997 doses in specialist freezers because the Pfizer vaccine must be kept at a temperature of at least -70C. The Scottish government said it had received confirmation the vaccine could be ""packed down"" by health boards into smaller sizes, which meant the programme could be rolled out to care homes. The go-ahead was given by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency. The vaccine will be taken directly to care homes or to nearby vaccination centres in 195 five-dose vials, which Ms Freeman said would result in ""minimal wastage"". These vials will need to be diluted before use. They can also be transported in an unfrozen state for up to 12 hours and can be stored undiluted for up to five days, the Scottish health secretary said. Ms Freeman said: ""We are providing the vaccine to people in care homes according to the order of priority set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation and we will work through that order of priority as quickly as vaccine supply allows."" She said that ministers were hopeful that ""subject to further stringent approvals"", other vaccines, such as those being developed by AstraZeneca and Moderna, would be available soon. It follows comments to BBC radio's Good Morning Scotland programme by Westminster Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier this week that the speed of the vaccination programme over the coming weeks would be determined by how quickly the Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine could be manufactured in Belgium. He said: ""We've got a broad schedule and there'll be several millions for the UK as a whole and so several hundred thousand for Scotland over the remainder of this month. ""We've got that as a broad delivery schedule, but obviously the manufacturing process itself is complicated so we've got to get the stuff in the country."" The Scottish Conservatives have called for each individual health board in Scotland to publish its vaccination plans to prevent what they described as a ""postcode lottery"" from developing. The party's health spokesman Donald Cameron, said: ""Opposition MSPs seeking to scrutinise plans and get answers for their constituents are struggling to get information from the SNP and health boards. ""The answers we do get are frequently sluggish and incomplete. ""The public needs to know every detail has been covered. Secrecy will not benefit anyone."" The Scottish government said talk of a lottery was ""irresponsible"" and said Jeane Freeman had offered to meet with opposition parties to discuss details of how the vaccine was being delivered.

'Not enough' climate ambition shown by leaders,"Mr Sharma said progress had been made, but it was not enough yet to avoid dangerous warming this century The UK minister tasked with leading UN climate talks says world leaders are failing to show the necessary level of ambition. Alok Sharma was speaking at the conclusion of a virtual climate summit organised by the UK, UN and France. He said ""real progress"" had been made and 45 countries had put forward new climate plans for 2030. But these were not enough to prevent dangerous warming this century, Mr Sharma explained. Taking place on the fifth anniversary of the Paris climate agreement, the summit heard the UN Secretary General warn that every country needed to declare a climate emergency. Around 70 heads of state and government took part in the meeting, which was organised by the UK, UN and France. They outlined new pledges and commitments to curb carbon. China's contribution was eagerly awaited, not just because it is the world's biggest emitter, but because it has recently promised to reach net zero emissions by 2060. Achieving net zero means that emissions have been cut as much as possible and any remaining releases are balanced by removing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere, What is climate change? EU leaders raise target for emissions cut to 55% Covid drives record emissions drop in 2020 Have countries kept their climate change promises? But while President Xi Jinping outlined a range of new targets for 2030, many analysts felt these did not go far enough. India brought little in the way of new commitments but Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his country was on track to achieve its goals under the Paris agreement and promised a major uptick in wind and solar energy. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world According to the UK, some 24 countries had outlined net zero commitments and 20 had now set out plans to adapt and become more resilient to rising temperatures and their impacts. But despite these commitments, Mr Sharma said not enough had been achieved. ""Have we made any real progress at this summit? And the answer to that is: yes,"" he said. ""But they will also ask, have we done enough to put the world on track to limit warming to 1.5C, and protect people and nature from the effects of climate change? To make the Paris Agreement a reality. ""Friends, we must be honest with ourselves, the answer to that, is currently: no. As encouraging as all this ambition is. It is not enough."" Mr Sharma re-stated a commitment made last year to double the UK's international climate finance spend. This will bring it to at least Â£11.6bn over the next five years.

Joshua outclasses Pulev in knockout winUnified world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua floors Kubrat Pulev four times on his way to a knockout win.BBC Sport,"Joshua finally saw off the game Pulev with a hard right hand in round nine Unified world heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua mixed power and patience as he knocked out Kubrat Pulev to raise hopes that a historic fight against Tyson Fury could soon be a reality. The Briton smashed home a hard right hand in round three that forced his mandatory challenger to face a count and then sent him to the canvas with an uppercut seconds later. Joshua, perhaps fatigued by the chaos, stepped off the gas and allowed Pulev to at least offer some mild threat, but a barrage of uppercuts in the ninth dropped the Bulgarian and a straight right hand wiped him out. Moments after this fine blend of poise and heavy punching, the 1,000 fans granted access to Wembley Arena roared at the prospect of the IBF, WBA and WBO champion facing WBC title-holder Fury next. ""Whoever has the belts I want to compete with. If that is Tyson Fury, let it be Tyson Fury,"" said Joshua, 31. Fellow Briton Fury quickly went on social media and posted: ""I want the fight. I want the fight next. I will knock him out inside three rounds. I can't wait to knock him out."" Joshua v Fury - what obstacles stand in the way? 'At last I can get him in the ring' - Joshua responds to Fury knockout taunt Impressive AJ, fans return, Fury responds & Mayweather's surprise appearance Joshua v Pulev: All the action as it happened 'Joshua sets up superfight' - 5 Live Boxing reacts Listen to BBC Radio 5 Live commentary highlights of the fight This video can not be played Anthony Joshua beats Kubrat Pulev and looks ahead to Tyson Fury fight Joshua, in a white sleeveless hoodie for his ring walk, was smart from start to finish on a night when the widespread anticipation of a fight with Fury - in which all four world heavyweight titles could be contested for the first time - dominated the narrative. In his past two outings, Joshua has stood up to immense pressure. A second defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr in December would have left his career in tatters. He was punch perfect on that night. A loss on Saturday would have made him the instant fall guy amid public demand for the Fury bout. Once again he was emphatic. He found his range early on with flicked jabs as 39-year-old Pulev boxed cautiously and struggled to throw anything fast or crisp. When the challenger did throw a jab in the third, a counter right landed on his jaw and stunned him. Pulev briefly tried to smile and roar in the face of adversity but eventually turned his back while under attack and faced a count. In a frenzied spell, an uppercut then sent him to the canvas before the round was out. The pair punched one another after the bell, exchanged glares before the fifth and, while Pulev gained at least a footing in the following rounds, he was never able to land anything that would allow him to dictate. Some will ask why Joshua was unable to end things more quickly, but after a year out of the ring, he controlled a fight against a man who had just one loss - to Wladimir Klitschko - on his record. He could not miss with the right uppercut all night and the shot dropped the game Pulev in the ninth, before a jolting straight right to the chin left him unable to answer the count as the champion swaggered away, aware his night's work was over. It is testament to Joshua that he continues to rise to such mental challenges. Fury will move better than Pulev, punch with far greater variety, believe in himself more and set far more traps in the ring. He will also inevitably bring a whole new level of mental warfare to any build-up should the fight happen. Hope has never been higher that it will. After being caught heavily by Joshua in round three Pulev roared and smiled defiantly No sooner had Pulev regained his footing, Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn said efforts to make the Fury fight would start ""tomorrow"", adding: ""It's the only fight to be made in boxing. It is the biggest fight in British boxing history."" Fury's co-promoter Bob Arum - one of several key power brokers involved - said he would work from Monday to make the ""biggest fight since Muhammad Ali v Joe Frazier in 1971"". That such integral figures seem so positive, coupled with the fact an agreement over a financial split is said to already be in place, offers real hope the two could appear in what Fury's UK promoter Frank Warren repeatedly says will be the ""biggest UK sporting event since the 1966 World Cup final"". There are many issues to resolve before a date is in place - complex television broadcast deals and a venue among them. The sight of 1,000 fans singing Sweet Caroline before Joshua's ring walk showed a return to packed out arenas - which will be a necessity for this event - is closer. In the ring, the pair are both showing signs of improvement. Fury moved from elusive fighter to front-foot aggressor in beating Deontay Wilder last time out. Joshua - on Saturday and in beating Ruiz - has shown he too can do more than just wield knockout punches. This was defence number one of his second reign as champion. A small cluster of men - Ali, Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson among them - have had the chance to take the heavyweight world champion journey a second time. Fury is in the select bunch too. The plot lines are endless. It is time to make the fight of a generation. Moments after his win Joshua threw another punch, this time at a poster featuring Pulev BBC Radio 5 Live analyst Steve Bunce:Tyson Fury will be seeing that and saying if he fights like that against me I will walk right through him. Joshua kept flipping between styles and tactics. British heavyweight Dillian Whyte on BBC Radio 5 Live:Joshua did what he had to do, which was worry about winning today, not worry about what he will do tomorrow. He looked good. He boxed well, he moved well, he punched well. Obviously, Pulev was not much of a threat, but Joshua showed he is a champion. BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello on BBC Radio 5 Live:In the end a devastating performance. Destructive hitting from Anthony Joshua.

LiveLivePost-Brexit trade talks enter final day5 minutes ago5 minutes ago What the Sunday papers sayWhat the Sunday papers say19 minutes ago What would no deal mean?What would no deal mean?30 minutes ago What's the latest?What's the latest?Live Post-Brexit trade talks enter final day  5 minutes ago,"PM Boris Johnson says the UK and EU are ""still very far apart"" on key issues relating to a post-Brexit deal, and the UK must be ready to trade on WTO terms Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen agreed to continue trade talks beyond Sunday's deadline In a joint statement, the leaders said it was ""responsible at this point to go the extra mile"" The pair discussed ""major unresolved topics"" during a phone call, which Mrs von der Leyen called ""constructive and useful"" But three ""critical issues"" remain: fishing rights, government support for industry and how a deal is enforced Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the talks on Brexit trade remained ""finely balanced"" French fishing fleets would have ""zero assured access"" to UK waters in the event of no deal, Mr Raab said The UK left the EU on 31 January, but remains under its trading rules until the end of the year Edited by Julian Joyce and George Bowden We're bringing our live coverage of today's events to a close, but here is a quick catch-up on developments:  Our writers and editors today were: Alex Therrien, Lauren Turner, Gavin Stamp, Justin Parkinson, George Bowden and Julian Joyce. Thanks for reading. The Scottish government has called for an end to the ""crippling uncertainty"" over the future trading relationship with the EU. It comes after European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson today agreed that post-Brexit trade deal talks will continue this week. The Scottish government's Cabinet Secretary for Europe and External Affairs, Michael Russell, said:
""It is now time for the crippling uncertainty over the future of our trading relationship with the European Union to come to an end. ""Whatever the outcome of these protracted talks, we know there will be very significant damage to Scotland's economy and society because of the UK government's decision to leave the transition period on 31 December in the middle of a pandemic and a recession. ""But we also know that the worst outcome of all would be the disastrous impact of a no-deal Brexit - which would lead to significant tariffs - and the UK government must rule this out immediately."" The CBI, the UK's business lobby group, says that news the UK and the EU will continue Brexit talks gives it hope. But it says: ""Ongoing
delays are frustrating and cost businesses."" The CBI says the UK government must, firstly, provide detailed guidance to businesses this week on issues such border checks. Secondly, companies must be given a grace period to allow them to adjust to a deal or no deal. ""And
third, prepare support for firms who will face the greatest challenges in
the short run. Those in sectors and supply chains that are badly hit
will face extinction through tariffs, red tape and extra costs."" As talks about how the UK and EU could live and work together after Brexit near a mutual deadline, let's take a look at some of the language being used. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - from transition period to WTO. Here is whatsome of the key ones mean. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor When is a deadline not a deadline? When it's anything to do with Brexit, perhaps. Both sides in this long, long process, have agreed to go on, rather than pull the plug today. A joint statement emerged just before noon with a much more positive tone than anything that's come out of late, and did not feature the usual kind of warning of big gaps between the two sides. The froideur from Thursday and Friday seems to be thawing a little. It's worth noting no new time limit was put on the talks, although of course there is one hard deadline of 31 December, when the status quo runs out. It's also worth noting that the prime minister was loathe to show much sign of optimism when he appeared in front of a camera shortly after the joint statement emerged. It's far from certain that the talks will end in agreement, but the chances of resolution are once again on the rise. Read more from Laura here. Simon JackBBC Business Editor This torture is better than no deal. The fact that talks are ongoing is a good thing. Business
groups are unanimous in their view that if a deal is at all possible, it should
be pursued with every last effort. However, the problem with this uncertainty torture is
two-fold. First, political and business timetables are getting
increasingly misaligned by the day. Businesses need to know whether tariffs are
coming or not as it effects pricing of products and services for next year. How
can I place or take an order if I donât know what that price needs to be? Second, there is a danger that businesses who watch this
process being dragged out will wait for some rabbit to appear out of the hat and take their focus away from preparing for a deal. No deal is very bad - a
deal still leaves an awful lot of work to do in preparing for new procedures, for example customs, that will change whether we get a deal or not. But the fact remains that while this may be torture, it
could be worse. No deal would not put UK business out of its misery â it could
put some sectors out of business. A few moments ago, Prime Minister Boris Johnson gave an update on the post-Brexit trade deal discussions between the UK and the EU after both sides agreed to continue talking. He cautioned that the two sides were ""very far apart on key things"", adding that the most likely outcome was no deal. This video can not be played Johnson: 'Whatever happens, the UK will do very, very well' We've been telling you about Prime Minister Boris Johnson's call with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. He later briefed members of the Cabinet from his office at 10 Downing Street - and now a picture of the PM giving that briefing has been released. It was taken by his photographer Andrew Parsons. A continuation of Brexit talks is not all good news - uncertainty means that businesses such as retailers are finding it extremely difficult to prepare for 1 January. The British Retail Consortium (BRC) says that, without a deal, UK shops face Â£3bn in tariffs and those extra charges could be passed onto customers. BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson, said: ""Both sides must double down and do what is
necessary to agree a zero-tariff agreement, or else it will be the public that
pay the price of this failure. ""With many peopleâs finances already strained by
the economic impact of coronavirus, households can ill-afford a significant
rise in food prices. ""For the sake of customers and businesses around the UK, we
need a deal in the next three weeks.â Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was still a deal to be done ""if our partners want to do it - but we remain very apart on these key issues"". He said: ""The UK canât be locked into the EUâs regulatory orbit and weâve obviously got to take back control of our fisheries, so those are the points - I think itâs very clear what the UK is talking about.""       Mr Johnson said the UK ""certainly wonât be walking away from the talks"", reiterating what Ursula von der Leyen said, that ""people would expect us to go the extra mile"". He said he repeated his offer to talk to ""other capitals"" but said the Commission was ""very determined"" to keep the negotiations between the UK and Commission. Mr Johnson said the UK had made ""huge preparations"" to leave without a deal. ""Weâve now been at this for four and a half years, itâs a long time. Perhaps more intensively in the last couple of years than previously.Weâve got ready and anybody who needs to know what to do, get on togov.uk/transition,external, see what needs to be done and get ready for 1 January.Either way, whatever happens the UK will do very very well."" In his statement earlier Boris Johnson warned the UK had to ""get ready for WTO terms, Australia terms"", if the current talks with the EU do not succeed. To be clear, an Australian-style Brexit would mean no trade deal with the EU and would see the UK trading instead under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO). But what does that mean?Read more here. ""Get ready with confidence for 1 January - trading on WTO terms if we have to,"" Johnson says in his statement. ""Get ready to trade on WTO terms - and there is a clarity and a simplicity in that approach which has its own advantages,"" he says, adding: ""It's not where we wanted to get to."" ""We're going to try with all our hearts,"" he says of the ongoing negotiations for a trade deal. Speaking to broadcasters, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says ""we're still very far apart on key things"" as post-Brexit trade talks continue in Brussels. He says he is ""very happy"" to speak with other European capitals, and he repeats: ""The most likely thing now is that we have to get ready to WTO terms - Australia terms."" Earlier, the PM held a cabinet call following talks this morning with EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Following those talks, the EU and UK issued a joint statement confirming negotiations to reach a post-Brexit trade deal would continue. The Timesâ political editor, Steven Swinford, has justtweeted,externala read-out from the cabinet call, saying the PM sounded ""downbeat"" about the chances of reaching a deal.

Labour has urged the UK government to seal a trade deal with the EU after the two sides agreed to carry on negotiating. A party spokesman said: ""The Conservatives promised the British people that they had an oven-ready deal and that they would get Brexit done. ""The government needs to deliver on that promise, get us the deal and allow us to move on as a country."" The British Retail Consortium (BRC) has also warned people not to start stockpiling goods ahead of 1 January. âRetailers are doing everything they can to prepare for all eventualities on 1 January - increasing the stock of tins, toilet rolls and other longer life products so there will be sufficient supply of essential products,"" says BRC chief executive Helen Dickinson . ""While no amount of preparation by retailers can entirely prevent
disruption there is no need for the public to buy more food than
usual as the main impact will be on imported fresh produce, such as fresh fruit
and vegetables, which cannot be stored for long periods by either retailers or
consumers."" Charles Michel, the president of
the European Council, has said the European Union would not lose its
cool as make-or-break talks with Britain over a post-Brexit trade
deal approach their climax. Michel, who chairs EU summits, told France Inter Radio that
the EU wanted a good deal that respected the
integrity of its single market, the Reuters news agency reports. This video can not be played Von der Leyen: 'It is responsible to go the extra mile and continue talks' European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has confirmed that talks for a post-Brexit trade deal will continue between the UK and EU. She said ""despite the exhaustion after almost a year of negotiations"", it was ""responsible to go the extra mile"". Kevin ConnollyEurope correspondent, Brussels Ursula von der Leyen described her call with Boris Johnson as ""constructive"" and ""useful"". She used Imperial measurements when she talked about ""going the extra mile"", perhaps a nod to the British side. And there is no apparent deadline now - I think they may have felt that that created the wrong impression of what would happen today. As long as both sides are talking then a deal is certainly not impossible and it would have been impossible had they pulled the plug today. Â© 2025 BBC.

Teen completes first solo flight on 14th birthdayAlex Westgate completed the flight in Leicestershire after he started training in March.Leicester,"Alex Westgate said he spent most of the flight coaching himself along A teenager has become one of the youngest people to fly a glider plane solo on his 14th birthday. Alex Westgate took to the air on his own on Wednesday at Husbands Bosworth airfield in Leicestershire. The young pilot, who began training during the first lockdown, said he felt ""very calm"" behind the wheel and coached himself along. ""It really felt amazing flying the glider and being up in the air all by myself,"" he said. ""I was talking to myself a lot because I was the only one there and I wanted to get everything perfect and land safely."" Alex, from Storrington, West Sussex, began learning to fly gliders in his spare time in March.

No-deal navy threat 'irresponsible' - Tory MP,"Deploying Royal Navy gunboats to protect UK fishing waters under a no-deal Brexit would be ""undignified"", a former Conservative minister has said. Tory MP Tobias Ellwood described the threat as ""irresponsible"" after the Ministry of Defence said four ships were ready for ""robust enforcement"" when the transition period ends. UK-EU trade talks are continuing ahead of a mutual deadline on Sunday. The MoD said it was prepared for a ""range of scenarios"" after 31 December. Navy vessels are already deployed to enforce UK and European fishing laws for large parts of the year. A major sticking point in negotiations has been access to UK fishing waters, with the EU warning that without access to UK waters for its fleets, UK fishermen will no longer get special access to EU markets to sell their goods. A UK government source said talks were continuing overnight ""but as things stand the offer on the table from the EU remains unacceptable"". What happens if there's no trade deal? Ex-Australia PM warns over 'Australia-style' trade What is an 'Australia-style deal'? Mr Ellwood, who chairs the Commons Defence Committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that headlines highlighting the threat to deploy the navy risked distracting from the ongoing talks and were ""absolutely irresponsible"". ""This isn't Elizabethan times anymore, this is global Britain - we need to be raising the bar much higher than this,"" he said. ""Being ready for the worst-case scenario and using this final 48 hours to actually get a deal, they are two very different things,"" he added. He said the focus should be on what is ""already in the bag"" and that outstanding issues like access to fishing waters could be sorted once a trade deal is signed. Tobias Ellwood is a former defence minister Former Tory party chairman Lord Patten accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of being on a ""runaway train of English exceptionalism"". Humza Yousaf, the Scottish government justice minister, told the BBC: ""This UK government gunboat diplomacy is not welcome in Scottish waters. ""We will protect our fisheries where necessary. Police Scotland and Marine Scotland have primacy to do that. But we won't do that by threatening our allies, our Nato allies in fact, by threatening to sink their vessels."" But Admiral Lord West, a former chief of naval staff, defended the threat of using the Royal Navy to protect UK waters from foreign fishing vessels if asked to do so in a no-deal Brexit scenario. ""It is absolutely appropriate for the navy to do as it is told by the government,"" he said, adding that additional powers would allow Naval officers to deal with ""stormy"" altercations with foreign fishermen. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? The MoD has said it has conducted ""extensive planning and preparation"" to ensure it is ready for a range of scenarios at the end of the transition period, including having 14,000 personnel on standby to support the government over the winter with the EU transition. It said four offshore patrol boats will be available to monitor UK waters and added that it would have ""robust enforcement measures in place to protect the UK's rights as an independent coastal state"". An expansion of powers for the Royal Navy Police, enabling officers to potentially board foreign boats and arrest those breaking the law, is one proposal in the MoD's no-deal contingency planning, a spokesman confirmed. Accordingto the MoD's website,external, three River Class patrol ships with a crew of 45 sailors already work ""at least 275 days a year at sea enforcing British and European fisheries law"". This video can not be played Johnson: No-deal Brexit now ""very, very likely"" The Sunday deadline was set by Mr Johnson and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen after the pair met in Brussels on Wednesday, after months of talks failed to achieve an agreement. Mr Johnson said the EU needed to make a ""big change"" over the main sticking points on fishing rights and business competition rules, while Mrs von der Leyen said no deal was the most probable end to ""difficult"" talks. The EU has rejected Mr Johnson's request to bypass the European Commission and speak directly to French President Emmanuel Macron and Germany's Angela Merkel about the unresolved issues. According to EU officials, he was told discussions could only take place through the bloc's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, who is meeting with his UK equivalent in Brussels. Speaking on Friday, the PM said a no-deal Brexit was now ""very, very likely"" and that planning for that outcome was ramping up. Mrs von der Leyen told reporters that the two sides were still ""apart on fundamental issues"". Meanwhile,tests of a motorway barrier system designed to deal with potential traffic disruption in Kentonce the transition period ends on New Year's Eve have been carried out. The EU hasset out contingency measuresto ensure UK and EU air and road connections still run after 31 December. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?
