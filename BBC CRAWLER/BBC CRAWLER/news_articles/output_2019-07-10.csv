"Iran nuclear deal breaches are extortion, says US","This video can not be played Iran's representative to the UN: Europeans ""are not honouring their commitments"" on nuclear deal The US has accused Iran of a ""crude and transparent attempt to extort payments from the international community"" by violating the 2015 nuclear deal. The US ambassador to the International Atomic Energy Agency said there was no credible reason for Iran to breach two key commitments on uranium enrichment. Iran has said the steps were a response to the sanctions the US reinstated when it abandoned the deal last year. It has vowed to reverse them if it is given compensation for economic losses. European powers still party to the deal have set up a mechanism for facilitating legitimate trade without direct financial transactions that they hope will circumvent the US sanctions. However, Iran has said it does not meet its needs. Iran's representative to the UN in New York told the BBC that the Europeans could do more, and that if they did not Iran would take further steps. Is the Iran nuclear deal finally dead? Why do the limits on uranium enrichment matter? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words ""If nothing happens in the next 60 days we will have to go to the third phase. The elements of the third phase are not known yet, but when it comes to that we will announce what we are going to do,"" Majid Takht-Ravanchi warned. Iran's president told a French envoy ""the path of diplomacy and talks"" was ""completely open"" At Wednesday's special meeting of the IAEA board of governors in Vienna, diplomats were reportedly told that the global watchdog's inspectors had verified Iran was enriching uranium to 4.5% concentration - above the 3.67% limit set by the nuclear deal. The country announced the step three days ago, saying it wanted to be able to produce fuel for the Bushehr nuclear power plant. The IAEA was also said to have verified that Iran's stockpile of low-enriched uranium had grown since the 300kg (660lb) limit was exceeded on 1 July. Low-enriched uranium, which typically has a 3-5% concentration, can be used to produce fuel for commercial nuclear power plants. Weapons-grade uranium is 90% enriched or more. Experts have said the breach of the stockpile limit does not pose a near-term proliferation risk, but that enriching uranium to a higher concentration would begin to shorten Iran's so-called ""break-out time"" - the time required for it to produce enough fissile material for a bomb. Iran insists it has never sought to develop a nuclear weapon. But the international community does not believe Iran, and negotiated a nuclear deal to prevent it from doing so. US President Donald Trump said the deal did not go far enough to restrict Iran's nuclear programme and unilaterally withdrew from the accord in May 2018. He wants to replace it with one that would also curb Iran's ballistic missile programme and its involvement in regional conflicts. But Iran has so far refused. US ambassador Jackie Wolcott said it was imperative that Iran's ""misbehaviour"" not be rewarded At the IAEA meeting,US ambassador Jackie Wolcott said Iran's recent actions and statements were deeply concerning,external, and affected security and stability. ""Iran's current nuclear posture is clearly aimed at escalating tensions rather than defusing them, and underscores the serious challenges Iran continues to pose to international peace and security,"" she said. ""Such brinkmanship and extortion tactics will neither resolve the current impasse nor bring Iran sanctions relief. The path the regime is now on will only deepen its international isolation and raise the dangers it faces."" Ms Wolcott said it was imperative that Iran's ""misbehaviour"" not be rewarded. ""For if it is, Iran's demands and provocations will only escalate - as has happened all too often in the past,"" she warned. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The ambassador called on Iran to reverse its nuclear steps and halt any plans for further advancements in the future. ""The United States has made clear that we are open to negotiation without preconditions, and that we are offering Iran the possibility of a full normalisation of relations,"" she added. Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif saidIran's actions were ""lawful"" under the deal,external, which allows one party to ""cease performing its commitmentsâ¦ in whole or in part"" in the event of ""significant non-performance"" by other parties. Iran nuclear deal - all you need to know How reinstated sanctions have hit Iranians US-Iran relations: A brief history President Trump later alleged in a tweet that Iran had been ""secretly 'enriching' uranium in total violation"" of the deal made by his predecessor, Barack Obama, and promised that sanctions would ""soon be increased, substantially"". Mr Trump did not give any further details. But the IAEA had repeatedly verified Iran's compliance with the deal until this month and Iran's ambassador to the agency, Kazim Gharib Abadi, said it had ""nothing to hide."" Meanwhile, the top diplomatic adviser to French President Emmanuel Macron held talks in Tehran with Iranian officials to try to avoid further escalation. Emmanuel Bonne was told by Iranian President Hassan Rouhani that Iran had ""kept the path of diplomacy and talks completely open"" and that it hoped other parties to the nuclear deal would be able to ""use this opportunity properly"".

Five things we learned from the UK ambassador spat,"Mr Trump had said we would ""no longer deal with"" Sir Kim Darroch With Sir Kim Darroch heading for the exit, the US portion of the leaked cable controversy draws to a close. While the British government will continue to deal with political fallout for weeks, if not months, to come, it's not too early to provide assessment from the US side of the Atlantic. Here are five things we learned. As Forrest Gump might say, power is as power does. Donald Trump as president has made a habit of stripping away norms and traditions - the veneer that cloaks the exercise of political power - and operating according to his own set of rules. There have been howls of protest from the president's political opponents and the occasional tut-tutting from members of his own party, but he has operated largely unchecked. This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to Sir Kim Darroch's service Now the president's norm-breaking has crossed the Atlantic. After standing by Sir Kim for roughly 48 hours, the British government acceded to his decision to fall on his own sword - and the leading candidate to become the next prime minister essentially held his tongue throughout. UK ambassador to US resigns in Trump leaks row Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Ambassadors come and go. Sometimes they are ushered from their position because of disputes with the host country. Outside of war or documented espionage, however, the drama doesn't spill into public view. Welcome to the age of undiplomatic diplomacy - and the realisation that the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK isn't necessarily that special. ""America is respected again"". It's a common refrain from the president in speeches, tweets and off-the-cuff remarks. Mr Trump insisted during his 2016 campaign that then President Barack Obama had degraded American standing in the world, and pretty much since his inauguration he has boasted that he has restored the nation's tarnished reputation. The president frequently likes to recount how other world leaders have (privately) praised him for the job he's doing and expressed envy of American strength and prosperity. Call it his ""Make America Great Again"" promise, projected on the world stage. The trouble for the president is that Sir Kim's blunt assessment of White House dysfunction, chaos and incompetence dramatically undercut this rosy picture. Here was the representative of a close ally in confidential memos to British leaders essentially saying the emperor has no clothes. Sir Kim Darroch speaks at an event in Washington DC in October 2017 It doesn't take much imagination to picture Mr Trump's Democratic opponent throwing Sir Kim's words in the president's face during the 2020 campaign, either in advertisements or on the debate stage. And so the ambassador had to be taken out and his reputation shredded, as quickly and aggressively as possible. In the UK, the one-sided feud between Mr Trump and Sir Kim was all-day, headline-grabbing news. It roiled the British government, spilled over into the Conservative leadership contest and consumed political conversation. In the US, on the other hand, it was but a blip on the radar - just the latest instance of the president feuding with a critic, whether it's a celebrity, a political opponent or even a member of his own administration. The president wrote 21 tweets in the two-day period the Darroch conflagration burned - he took swipes at India, the federal judiciary, Democrats and the ""radical left"". He boasted about the economy and shared video clips from Fox News. The original series of attack tweets targeting Theresa May and Sir Kim merited US coverage, but the second round on day two received only an occasional mention on US cable news and nary a word on the main page of the New York Times website. Tory leadership candidate Boris Johnson pictured with Sir Kim Darroch in 2017 Sir Kim's resignation reignited interest, but only as a coda on the controversy - the inevitable denouement before the national attention moves on for good. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the president's staunchest supporters in Congress, lamented the ambassador's departure and tweeted that he ""got a raw deal from the press"". By afternoon, attention was already turning to embattled Labour Secretary Alex Acosta and his involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal. And the beat goes on. The British government just got a taste of Mr Trump's personnel management skills. Despite making a name for himself on reality television as the man who dramatically fires people, that's not his style - and it hasn't been for much of his professional career. Why doesn't Trump fire people to their face? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr Trump doesn't fire people. He simply makes life so uncomfortable for them that they eventually leave of their own accord. If Mr Trump wanted Sir Kim out, he could have ordered him designated a ""persona non grata"" under Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The UK would have been legally obligated to remove him quickly from his post. He didn't do that. Instead, the president lobbed off a series of derisive tweets, disinviting the ambassador from White House events and - whether by direction or implication - cutting off staff interaction with the man. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" While we haven't seen this kind of process play out on the international stage, it's a recurring theme of his presidency. Mr Trump has publicly bashed and belittled members of his own administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and, most notably, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He iced out former chiefs of Staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly. All eventually resigned, with their presidential pariah status obvious to anyone with a pulse. Sir Kim's decline and fall was simply more abrupt. It's no secret that there have been icy relations between the White House and the Department of State since the early days of the Trump administration. The president may view the department, which his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton headed from 2009 to 2013, as rife with critics and ideological opponents - and he may not be entirely wrong. The president's foreign policy style certainly is a jarring contrast to the way American diplomacy has traditionally conducted. President Trump wrote 21 tweets in the two-day period the Darroch conflagration burned That contrast was on full display on Tuesday, when department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus held a public press conference - her first in more than three weeks. Under repeated questioning by reporters, Ms Ortagus insisted that relationship between the US and the UK was ""bigger than any individual; bigger than any government"". She said she couldn't speak for the president or explain his tweets, however. Those questions would have to go to the White House. Sir Kim Darroch resigns: Letter in full Will Darroch row affect the Tory leadership race? ""We will continue to deal with all accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president, which we will, of course, abide by the president's direction,"" she added. Presidential tweets, it seems, weren't guidance enough to change course - and beyond that, there was no guidance whatsoever. Handling an unscripted president who makes announcements without consulting or even sometimes informing staff has been a challenge for many members of the administration, in the State Department and elsewhere. They're often left wondering whether the president, either in comments or tweets, is officially changing policy or simply letting off steam. That's often led to confused or inconsistent responses on topics like immigration enforcement, a transgender ban in the military, legal strategies and US troop deployment. There's a word for that.

New Zealand shock India to reach final,"This video can not be played Highlights: New Zealand book their place in final with win over India ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, Old Trafford New Zealand 239-8 (50 overs):Taylor 74, Williamson 67, B Kumar 3-43 India 221 all out (49.3 overs):Jadeja 77, Henry 3-37, Santner 2-34 Scorecard New Zealand reached the World Cup final as they produced the bowling performance of the tournament to edge out a crestfallen India by 18 runs in a sensational match at Old Trafford. India, chasing 240 to win, were reduced to 24-4 and 92-6 before Ravindra Jadeja and MS Dhoni produced a 116-run partnership to drag the 2011 winners back in contention. Jadeja in particular was superb but, with 37 runs needed from the final 18 balls, Jadeja hit Trent Boult high into the air and to Black Caps captain Kane Williamson to fall for 77. Dhoni struck a six off the first ball of the 48th over but was then superbly run out by Martin Guptill to realistically end India's slim chances. The final wicket - last man Yuzvendra Chahal edging behind - was greeted with shock by an India heavy crowd, as New Zealand gathered into a huddle. Make no mistake, this was a stunning, surprising, unexpected win by New Zealand, with India heavily tipped from the start to win the tournament. Defeat broke our hearts - Kohli Listen: TMS podcast - New Zealand stun India India exit World Cup but memories of Kohli, Rohit & fans live on With play going into the reserve day afterrain ended play on Tuesday,the bowlers were superb up front, defending what seemed to be meagre target. Boult swung the ball, Matt Henry and Lockie Ferguson bowled with pace and Guptill and Jimmy Neesham produced two outstanding bits of fielding to put New Zealand into the final. They will play either England or Australia in Sunday's final, with those two sides set to meet at Edgbaston on Thursday. This video can not be played 'Absolute mayhem!' Watch India's nightmare start as trio dismissed Going into a reserve day, this match could have been played out in front of an empty stadium - but that was not the case, with Old Trafford full of vibrant, noisy India fans. With New Zealand adding 28 runs off 23 balls to reach 239-8 in their rain-affected 50 overs on Wednesday morning, India looked to be in the ascendency, but a brilliant start by the Kiwi bowlers soon put paid to that. Boult and Henry were all over the batsmen; Rohit Sharma, the tournament's leading run-scorer, edged Henry behind before talismanic captain Virat Kohli was trapped lbw by Boult. Kohli was visibly unhappy at the decision and reviewed it but the ball was shown to be hitting and Kohli stood, aghast, on the pitch before walking off. India were in further trouble when KL Rahul nicked Henry through to wicketkeeper Tom Latham to leave them 5-3. As is so often the case, when things are going one side's way, everything seems to stick in the hands. Neesham pulled off a superb, one-handed take at backward point to dismiss Dinesh Karthik and leave India reeling. It is a credit to New Zealand that they kept their nerve in the final overs when Jadeja and Dhoni, one of the best finishers in the game, had the target down to a manageable total. However, Williamson's superb catch to a steepling offering off Jadeja was the inspiration New Zealand needed. Guptill's run out a handful of deliveries later just showed what a sharp side this Black Caps team are. And the idea of this bowling attack, at Lord's, with a slope to help the ball swing, will worry both England and Australia. This video can not be played 'It's the most emotional I've seen him' as Dhoni run out by Guptill Jadeja has not been a regular feature in this India side but his fielding to run out Ross Taylor and catch Tom Latham on the boundary edge brought New Zealand's reply to a halt. And with the bat he came so close to putting India into the final. His name was chanted at every opportunity by the fans and his fitness, allowing him to take quick runs, was crucial for India's chase. He targeted New Zealand's change bowlers; Neesham was crunched over long-on for six while a superb pull off a Henry slower ball put him within touching distance of his 50. He celebrated his half-century, brought up from 39 balls, with a trademark, Zorro-like swish of the bat and a fist pump towards the dressing room - a retort to criticism that he is a ""bits and pieces cricketer"". While he and Dhoni were there, the crowd believed. New Zealand's bowlers were wary and their fielding stuttered. But Williamson's catch ended that superb partnership and, ultimately, India's hope of reaching the final. This video can not be played 'Miraculous catch!' Karthik caught by Neesham India captain Virat Kohli:""I'm very disappointed. We played outstanding cricket throughout this tournament. ""To go out on 45 minutes of bad cricket is saddening. It breaks our heart because you work so hard to build momentum, finish number one in the table, then a spell of bad cricket and you're out of the tournament, but you have to accept it. ""We will come out better cricketers because of this setback."" New Zealand captain Kane Williamson:""It's a different feeling to last time (2015). We've had to skin it over the round-robin, so it's been quite different. ""A lot of heart has been shown by the guys so far but we're keeping our feet on the ground. ""It was a great semi-final and we're happy to be on the right side of it."" New Zealand bowler Matt Henry:""We talked about just making sure we did the best we can and just taking it to them at the top of the innings. We wanted to create as much pressure as we could. ""We pride ourselves on always giving ourselves a chance. They have world-class finishers and they were very dangerous, we knew we'd have to bowl them out to win today. ""It's special to be going to Lord's on Sunday. Thank you to the fans today, the support has been brilliant.""

Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter I suspect President Trump will certainly comment on Sir Kim Darroch's resignation at some
point - usually he likes to celebrate the exercise of his power at moments
like this. And it's all very familiar. Donald Trump doesn't fire people, even in his own administration. What he does is make it so uncomfortable for them that they eventually resign of their own volition. We've seen it time and time again, and that's what happened here. The whole row is getting some coverage in the US, but the reality is that
this is viewed as just the latest in a long line of Trump social media spats. And the nation at large, now that this has basically resolved itself as far as they're concerned,
will move on. Select CommitteeParliament Theresa May's de facto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, has told a Commons committee he is ""enraged"" by the Sir Kim Darroch row. He said morale among the senior ranks of the civil service had taken a ""very heavy blow"" and the quality of government suffered if officials felt inhibited from giving frank advice to ministers. Mr Lidington said: ""Ultimately it's my decision whether I drive the car off a cliff, but if my civil servants see me heading towards Beachy Head, I do actually want them to come and tell me. ""Their job is to give me the frankest, the most honest advice possible, whether it's something that I would welcome hearing or not."" BBC News Channel Foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat earlier questioned the head of the diplomatic service on the whole row. Now he tells the BBC: ""The real problem from this is other embassies around the world feel that what they write can be used against them.""

Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA civil service union, says Sir Kim Darroch was ""placed in an impossible situation"". ""Firstly, by the leaking of confidential communiques and then by the failure of Boris Johnson and his supporters to provide unequivocal support,"" he says. ""As a loyal public servant, he has, as he always did, put his country first. Can we honestly say that about those who took to the airways and equivocated?"" He says a ""disturbing pattern"" was emerging - ""here the brightest and best civil servants are being forced out of their jobs due to relentless attacks from politicians and some sections of the media."" He says it is the job of ministers and of the prime minister ""to defend their civil servants from this kind of abuse"". ""But time and time again, they are choosing to stay silent and as a result they have created an environment where the targeting of individuals or undermining of the service as a whole has become routine.""

Labour figures 'interfered' in anti-Semitism cases,"Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby have been accused of interfering in the disciplinary process Senior Labour figures have interfered in the disciplinary process of dealing with accusations of anti-Semitism, ex-party officials have told the BBC's Panorama. Seumas Milne, one of Jeremy Corbyn's closest aides, told officials the party was ""muddling up political disputes with racism"" and must review processes. And General Secretary Jennie Formby attempted to interfere in who sat on a panel examining a high-profile case. Labour said there was no interference. Instead, it said the former staff making the claims were ""disaffected"". But the party's deputy leader Tom Watson said he was ""shocked, chilled and appalled"" by the allegations and the party had ""serious questions"" to answer. And other MPs commended the courage of those who had spoken out, Ruth Smeeth describing their testimony as ""heartbreaking"". Labour's disputes team is supposed to operate independently from the party's political structures, including the leader's office. But Sam Matthews, the party's former head of disputes, said he interpreted an email sent by Mr Milne - the Labour leader's communications chief - in March 2018, calling for a review into how complaints were handled, as ""an instruction"". Mr Matthews is one of eight former Labour officials - seven of whom worked in the party's Complaints and Disputes Department - who have spoken to Panorama about their experiences of dealing with anti-Semitism cases. They claim: The leader's office was ""angry and obstructive"" when it came to the issue Officials brought in by Ms Formby ""overruled"" disciplinary decisions and ""downgraded"" punishments to a ""slap on the wrist"" Mr Milne laughed when advised by a long-serving party official about what Mr Corbyn should do to tackle anti-Semitism in the party On one occasion, Jeremy Corbyn's office ordered batches of anti-Semitism complaints to be brought to his Commons office for processing by his aides Four chose to talk publicly despite having signed non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) with Labour not to discuss any aspects of their work for the party. Louise Withers Green, a former disputes officer, left the Labour Party after being signed off with depression and anxiety. She had signed an NDA so she did not have to work her notice period, but despite that spoke to the programme, saying she wouldn't ""be able to live with myself unless I speak up about the horrendous things that I know have been happening"". A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Starmer: Labour has 'duty' to tackle anti-Semitism Watchdog launches Labour anti-Semitism probe The party has been engulfed by a long-running dispute over anti-Semitism within its ranks, which has led nine MPs and three peers to leave the party. The leadership has been accused of failing to get to grips with the problem, with allegations of hundreds of complaints against members remaining unresolved. BBC Panorama spoke to more than 20 former officials as part of its investigation -Is Labour Anti-Semitic? - which will be broadcast at 21.00 BST on Wednesday. They allege that they had to deal with a huge increase in anti-Semitism complaints since Mr Corbyn became leader in 2015. Panorama discovered there was backlog of 1,000 anti-Semitism allegations this spring, with only 15 people having been expelled. Asked about that relatively small number, Andrew Gwynne, shadow communities secretary, said there were ""lots of cases that are ongoing as well"" and some people, when faced with an investigation, had chosen to leave of their own accord. ""We are serious about getting shot of this problem,"" he insisted. A Labour spokesman told the BBC the 1,000 figure was ""categorically untrue"". The testimony Panorama reveals tonight - and the leaked emails they have obtained - will paint a picture that contrasts with the leadership's claims that they are doing as much as they can. And they will cause deep alarm in many parts of the Labour movement. For their part, Mr Corbyn's allies totally reject the testimony that's been put forward - instead claiming those who have come forward are ""disaffected"". But this is a real challenge to Mr Corbyn's handing of anti-Semitism. Read more from Laura Mike Creighton, Labour's former head of the disputes team, told BBC Panorama he was approached by Mr Milne for advice in spring 2016. He said he had suggested the party dealt with some of the top level anti-Semitic cases ""much more swiftly and much more robustly"", and that Mr Corbyn make a speech on the Middle East, ""particularly saying that Israel had a right to exist"". But Mr Creighton claimed Mr Milne's response was to laugh at him. ""I thought he actually wanted to know how we tackle anti-Semitism within the Labour Party,"" he added. ""I think what he actually meant to say was, how do we deal with the bad publicity we're getting?"" When Panorama put this allegation to the Labour Party, they said: ""The Labour Party dispute this conversation ever took placeâ¦ this allegation is false and malicious. ""Jeremy Corbyn has repeatedly expressed his support for Israel's right to exist and for a two state solution... so there is no reason whatsoever to laugh at any such suggestion.""

""I think going forward we need to review where and how we're drawing the line."" Mr Matthews, who left his role after two years in 2018, said he interpreted the email as ""the leader's office requesting to be involved directly in the disciplinary process"". He added: ""This is not a helpful suggestion. It is an instruction."" Officials also told the programme Mr Corbyn's office had on one occasion ordered batches of anti-Semitism complaints to be brought to them to assess. But Labour said this was a ""staff resourcing matter"", and it was not unusual for people to be seconded into the party's governance and legal unit - so separation was maintained. The party said in a statement: ""The Leader's Office did not intervene. These former disaffected employees sought the view of staff in the Leader's Office, which was compiled with in good faith.

Labour Party members have been protesting over its handling of anti-Semitism allegations When it came to Ms Formby, a leaked email chain appears to show an attempt to influence the selection of the disciplinary panel for the case of Jackie Walker - the former vice chair of the Left-wing Labour campaign group Momentum, who was expelled in March over allegations of anti-Semitism. An email written by Ms Formby on 5 May 2018, said: ""The National Constitutional Committee cannot be allowed to continue in the way that they are at the moment and I will also be challenging the panel for the Jackie Walker case."" Later in the chain, Ms Formby wrote that she had ""deleted all trace of the email"", adding: ""Too many eyes still on my Labour [email] address."" The email chain was copied to Mr Milne, Karie Murphy - Mr Corbyn's chief of staff - and Mr Corbyn's personal email address. Ms Formby's predecessor as general secretary, Lord McNicol, said the emails should set ""alarm bells ringing across the party"". ""The NCC was created in a specific way to remove itself from politics and from political interference. So to try to interfere politically within the NCC is just wrong."" The Labour Party told Panorama that Ms Formby temporarily stopped using her party email because of concerns a political opponent had access to it. They said that ""the emailsâ¦ are simply about ensuring the NCC is held accountable for the length of time they take to hear cases, and about protecting the party against any successful legal challenge on the basis of perceived bias if the same panel is used in high profile cases"". A spokesman added: ""Labour is taking decisive action against anti-Semitism, doubling the number of staff dedicated to dealing with complaints and cases. And since Jennie Formby became general secretary, the rate at which anti-Semitism cases have been dealt with has increased four-fold."" Kat Buckingham, who was the former chief investigator on the disputes team, told Panorama she had a breakdown and decided to leave the party as a result. ""I was stuck betweenâ¦an angry and obstructive Leader's Office and an arcane disciplinary system,"" she said. ""I couldn't hold the tide and I felt so powerless and I felt guilty and I felt like I failed."" Former Labour cabinet minister Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's PM the allegations were ""hair-raising"" and showed the party was ""still in denial"" over the issue. Ex-foreign secretary Jack Straw said the fact people with ""vile views"" had been allowed to remain in the party showed the extent of Mr Corbyn's ""complacency"".

Dr Tisha Rowe said the incident happened on 30 June on a flight to Miami from a family holiday in Jamaica. The 37-year-old said online she felt body-shamed and humiliated after being told to cover her ""assets"". A tweet she shared of the playsuit she was wearing has been shared thousands of times since. Dr Rowe was flying from Kingston with her eight-year-old son when the incident occurred. She alleged a flight attendant first asked her to step off the plane,external, then described her outfit as ""inappropriate"" to fly and asked if she had a jacket to ""cover up"" with.

In the Commons, Theresa May said UK ambassador Sir Kim Darroch's departure was ""a matter of deep regret"" after the ambassador said it was ""impossible"" for him to continue. Mrs May said Sir Kim had had the full backing of the cabinet and he was owed an ""enormous debt of gratitude"" for his ""lifetime of service"" to the UK. Later, the leak was described as ""malicious"" by head of the diplomatic service Sir Simon McDonald. He told the Commons' Foreign Affairs Committee it was the first time in his career that a head of state had refused to work with a British ambassador. An inquiry finds that ""unacceptable behaviour"" by ""known offenders"" has been tolerated. Head of the diplomatic service tweets... Allow Twitter content?

Could a new prime minister shut down Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit?Find out more. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter I suspect President Trump will certainly comment on Sir Kim Darroch's resignation at some
point - usually he likes to celebrate the exercise of his power at moments
like this. And it's all very familiar. Donald Trump doesn't fire people, even in his own administration. What he does is make it so uncomfortable for them that they eventually resign of their own volition. We've seen it time and time again, and that's what happened here. The whole row is getting some coverage in the US, but the reality is that
this is viewed as just the latest in a long line of Trump social media spats. And the nation at large, now that this has basically resolved itself as far as they're concerned,
will move on. Select CommitteeParliament Theresa May's de facto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, has told a Commons committee he is ""enraged"" by the Sir Kim Darroch row. He said morale among the senior ranks of the civil service had taken a ""very heavy blow"" and the quality of government suffered if officials felt inhibited from giving frank advice to ministers. Mr Lidington said: ""Ultimately it's my decision whether I drive the car off a cliff, but if my civil servants see me heading towards Beachy Head, I do actually want them to come and tell me. ""Their job is to give me the frankest, the most honest advice possible, whether it's something that I would welcome hearing or not."" BBC News Channel Foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat earlier questioned the head of the diplomatic service on the whole row. Now he tells the BBC: ""The real problem from this is other embassies around the world feel that what they write can be used against them."" Sir Kim Darroch's private cables to the British government were leaked, remember. Mr Tugendhat says the ambassador had done the ""right thing"" in his communications and ""should be supported"". An inquiry finds that ""unacceptable behaviour"" by ""known offenders"" has been tolerated.Read more. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA civil service union, says Sir Kim Darroch was ""placed in an impossible situation"". ""Firstly, by the leaking of confidential communiques and then by the failure of Boris Johnson and his supporters to provide unequivocal support,"" he says. ""As a loyal public servant, he has, as he always did, put his country first. Can we honestly say that about those who took to the airways and equivocated?"" He says a ""disturbing pattern"" was emerging - ""here the brightest and best civil servants are being forced out of their jobs due to relentless attacks from politicians and some sections of the media."" He says it is the job of ministers and of the prime minister ""to defend their civil servants from this kind of abuse"". ""But time and time again, they are choosing to stay silent and as a result they have created an environment where the targeting of individuals or undermining of the service as a whole has become routine.""

""The person responsible is the person who leaked this,"" he says. ""Boris Johnson supports all our diplomats around the world - he did that as foreign secretary, he does that today.""

"Labour figures 'interfered' in anti-Semitism casesEx-party officials told BBC Panorama the accusations should set ""alarm bells ringing across the party"".","Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby have been accused of interfering in the disciplinary process Senior Labour figures have interfered in the disciplinary process of dealing with accusations of anti-Semitism, ex-party officials have told the BBC's Panorama. Seumas Milne, one of Jeremy Corbyn's closest aides, told officials the party was ""muddling up political disputes with racism"" and must review processes. And General Secretary Jennie Formby attempted to interfere in who sat on a panel examining a high-profile case. Labour said there was no interference. Instead, it said the former staff making the claims were ""disaffected"". But the party's deputy leader Tom Watson said he was ""shocked, chilled and appalled"" by the allegations and the party had ""serious questions"" to answer. And other MPs commended the courage of those who had spoken out, Ruth Smeeth describing their testimony as ""heartbreaking"". Labour's disputes team is supposed to operate independently from the party's political structures, including the leader's office. But Sam Matthews, the party's former head of disputes, said he interpreted an email sent by Mr Milne - the Labour leader's communications chief - in March 2018, calling for a review into how complaints were handled, as ""an instruction"".

However, they were discovered in a camp south of the capital Tripoli, used by forces loyal to General Khalifa Haftar. Gen Haftar's forces are currently fighting for control of the city. The battle for Tripoli - home of the internationally recognised government - began when Gen Haftar's forces launched an attack in April, with hundreds killed in the months since. Africa Live: Update on this and other stories Khalifa Haftar: The Libyan general with big ambitions Libya at the start of a 'long and bloody war' Why is Libya so lawless? The four missiles were discovered in June when forces loyal to the UN-backed government overran the camp, prompting an investigation in Washington. France admitted the weapons - which can be used against tanks and other vehicles - belonged to them in a statement on Wednesday. ""These weapons were for the protection of forces undertaking intelligence and counter-terror missions,"" the defence ministry statement said. It added the missiles were ""damaged and unusable"" and ""being temporarily stocked at a depot ahead of their destruction"". France has always denied arming Gen Haftar's forces, but has offered diplomatic support. Libya has been torn by violence and division since long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi was deposed and killed in 2011. This video can not be played Libya crisis: The fight for Tripoli explained from the frontline No authority has full control over Libya and the country is extremely unstable, torn between several political and military factions, the two most important of which are the UN-backed Government of National Accord (GNA), led by Prime Minister Fayez Mustafa al-Sarraj, and Gen Haftar's Libyan National Army (LNA), based in the eastern cities of Benghazi and Tobruk. The general has been active in Libyan politics for more than four decades and was one of Gadaffi's close allies until a dispute in the late 1980s forced him to live in exile in the US. Both the LNA and GNA have international backers. Gen Haftar's LNA has long had the support of Egypt and the UAE, but now also counts Russia and Saudi Arabia among his backers. At one point - when it looked like he would take Tripoli with ease - US President Donald Trump called and offered his congratulations. However, this relationship seems to have cooled in the months since. Meanwhile, the GNA has its own supporters, including Turkey and Qatar. Most Western nations back the unity government. Since the offensive on Tripoli, the UN, the US and the EU have all called for an immediate halt to the fighting and for talks. France has technically taken a mediation role in the conflict. However, there are suspicions they back Gen Haftar. General Khalifa Haftar leads the Libyan National Army (LNA) President Emmanuel Macron was the first Western leader to invite him to Europe for peace talks, and France launched air strikes in support of Gen Haftar's forces in February. They targeted Chadian opposition forces fighting against the LNA in the south. Analysts suggest France's backing for Gen Haftar is related to fighting militants who threaten the wider region, potentially further boosted by an interest in oil.

Airline sorry for 'telling woman to cover outfit',"Dr Tisha Rowe said she felt ""policed for being black"" and curvaceous American Airlines has apologised after allegedly telling a female passenger to wrap herself in a blanket to hide her outfit. Dr Tisha Rowe said the incident happened on 30 June on a flight to Miami from a family holiday in Jamaica. The 37-year-old said online she felt body-shamed and humiliated after being told to cover her ""assets"". A tweet she shared of the playsuit she was wearing has been shared thousands of times since. Dr Rowe was flying from Kingston with her eight-year-old son when the incident occurred. She alleged a flight attendant first asked her to step off the plane,external, then described her outfit as ""inappropriate"" to fly and asked if she had a jacket to ""cover up"" with.

Prison boss defends ASAP Rocky jail conditions,"The Swedish prisonwhere ASAP Rocky is being heldis in ""good condition"", its governor has told Radio 1 Newsbeat. Fredrik Wallin was responding to claims on website TMZ, reportedly from a US Embassy official, that walking into Kronoberg prison is like ""walking into a toilet"". The website had claimed the rapper is being held in a ""disease-ridden"" prison where the food is ""inedible"". ASAP Rocky wasarrested last weekon suspicion of assault. He's being held while Swedish authorities investigate a fight he's alleged to have been involved in. Mr Wallin told Newsbeat he's not able to comment on individual prisoners. ""However, I am able to talk about the general conditions in the remand prison which apply to all prisoners,"" he said in a statement. Kronoberg remand prison, where ASAP Rocky is being held awaiting trial TMZ's report,externalmentioned Rocky being held in a cell next to someone with ""severe mental issues who slams his head against the concrete wall and hurls faeces every which way... faeces that are not cleaned up"". A source reportedly told them he was being made to sleep on a yoga mat with no blanket, drink water that was not clean, and had only been given an apple to eat each day during his first five days at the prison. Separately, ASAP Mob member ASAP Ferg claims Rocky is being held in solitary confinement. The claims have led to concern among ASAP Rocky's friends and fans, as well as a petition to free him. But Mr Wallin says prisoners at Kronoberg normally live in cells that contain a desk, a bed with a mattress, and a TV. He says the prison was renovated in the last few years, with all the prison cells being reconstructed, leaving the prison in ""good condition"". Kronoberg authorities say this is representative of its prison cells ""I have no knowledge on any current diseases in the remand prison,"" Mr Wallin told Newsbeat. The governor says that all prisoners in Swedish remand prison - where people stay while awaiting trial - receive three meals each day, and that a professional cleaning company ""immediately sanitises"" and cleans an area following food spillages or accidents that result in blood. ""This is done for the sake of the prisoners as well as for our staff, for them to have decent working conditions."" Swedish remand prisons do contain some solitary cells - but the Swedish Prison and Probation Service says they're not commonly used and can only be reserved for violent prisoners, after a formal written decision has been made. A corridor in Kronoberg prison ASAP Rocky is being held in prison while Swedish prosecutors investigate a fight he was allegedly involved in. The American had been in Stockholm to perform at a festival, but was arrested afterwards. Video posted to his Instagram account showed Rocky and his crew asking two men to stop following them. One of the men accused the 30-year-old's team of breaking his headphones. In the caption for the first video ASAP Rocky wrote: ""We don't know these guys and we didn't want trouble. They followed us for four blocks."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the second, he accuses the man of hitting his security guard ""in the face with headphones"". A separate video published by TMZ following his arrest reportedly showed Rocky punching someone. On Friday, following a hearing, Swedish authorities decided to keep Rocky in custody for an extra two weeks while the investigation is ongoing. It meant the rapper couldn't attend Wireless festival in London, where he was headlining. He'd already missed scheduled slots at Longitude in Dublin and Open'er Festival in Poland. That reportedly represents a more than $1 million loss in earnings for the rapper. Swedish authorities have the option of detaining Rocky for a further two weeks - after another hearing - if the investigation isn't completed during the time they initially requested. The situation has led to friends of ASAP like Tyler, The Creator, ScHoolboy Q and Lil Yachty saying they are boycotting the country. Allow Twitter content?

UK returns to growth but slowdown fears persist,"The UK economy returned to growth in May after shrinking in April, but the news failed to allay fears of a future slowdown. The economy grew 0.3% from the month before, after declining 0.4% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Growth for the three months to May was 0.3%, with all sectors showing growth. But economists say that June's growth figures will have to be strong to avoid contraction in the second quarter. A partial recovery in car production, which had fallen sharply in April, was the main reason for the economy's upturn in May, said Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS. Factory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a March Brexit had slashed UK car production in April by nearly half. However, despite this rebound, the levels of output in the car industry are below those seen in the months leading up to April 2019, the ONS said. ""GDP grew moderately in the latest three months, with IT, communications and retail showing strength. Despite this, there has been a longer-term slowdown in the often-dominant services sector since summer 2018,"" Mr Kent-Smith added. In May, growth in services was flat, following growth of 0.1% in April. Faisal Islam, economics editor A return to work in car factories that shut down in preparation for a no-deal Brexit drove a return to growth in the economy in May of 0.3%. But that rise did not make up for all the fall in the previous month. Monthly figures are volatile and should be taken with a pinch of salt. However, against a backdrop of a marked softening in a slew of surveys of manufacturing, services and retail, there is an indication of an economy stalling and possibly contracting in the second quarter that has just ended, between April and June. In the three months till May, however, growth was higher than expected because of a better March than had been previously calculated. The impact of stockpiling, though, can clearly be seen in the big economic figures. Sterling has fallen more than 5% in recent weeks against the world's three major currencies, on expectation of lower interest rates for longer, political uncertainty and rising expectations of a no-deal Brexit. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the latest figures suggested the economy grew overall in the second quarter, although probably at a much slower rate than the 0.5% recorded in the January-to-March period. Those second-quarter figures, covering April to June, are due to be released on 9 August. ""Storm clouds look to be gathering over the UK economy, as consumers and business remain hamstrung by Brexit uncertainty,"" he added. Last month,the Bank of England said it expected economic growth to be flatin the second quarter of the year. Does GDP tell the whole economic story?

like this. And it's all very familiar. Donald Trump doesn't fire people, even in his own administration. What he does is make it so uncomfortable for them that they eventually resign of their own volition. We've seen it time and time again, and that's what happened here. The whole row is getting some coverage in the US, but the reality is that
this is viewed as just the latest in a long line of Trump social media spats. And the nation at large, now that this has basically resolved itself as far as they're concerned,
will move on. Select CommitteeParliament Theresa May's de facto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, has told a Commons committee he is ""enraged"" by the Sir Kim Darroch row. He said morale among the senior ranks of the civil service had taken a ""very heavy blow"" and the quality of government suffered if officials felt inhibited from giving frank advice to ministers. Mr Lidington said: ""Ultimately it's my decision whether I drive the car off a cliff, but if my civil servants see me heading towards Beachy Head, I do actually want them to come and tell me. ""Their job is to give me the frankest, the most honest advice possible, whether it's something that I would welcome hearing or not."" BBC News Channel Foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat earlier questioned the head of the diplomatic service on the whole row. Now he tells the BBC: ""The real problem from this is other embassies around the world feel that what they write can be used against them."" Sir Kim Darroch's private cables to the British government were leaked, remember. Mr Tugendhat says the ambassador had done the ""right thing"" in his communications and ""should be supported"". An inquiry finds that ""unacceptable behaviour"" by ""known offenders"" has been tolerated.Read more. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA civil service union, says Sir Kim Darroch was ""placed in an impossible situation"". ""Firstly, by the leaking of confidential communiques and then by the failure of Boris Johnson and his supporters to provide unequivocal support,"" he says. ""As a loyal public servant, he has, as he always did, put his country first. Can we honestly say that about those who took to the airways and equivocated?"" He says a ""disturbing pattern"" was emerging - ""here the brightest and best civil servants are being forced out of their jobs due to relentless attacks from politicians and some sections of the media."" He says it is the job of ministers and of the prime minister ""to defend their civil servants from this kind of abuse"".

âI was horrified to have to wait that longâ,"This video can not be played 'I couldn't believe it was 166 weeks' A County Antrim woman who was told she would have to wait 166 weeks to see an orthopaedic consultant has said she is shocked and distressed. Sandra Condon, who is a nurse, said she is in chronic pain. Mrs Condon said she could not believe that she would have to wait more than three years to be seen ""and then potentially three to four years after that for surgery"". ""I honestly had to ask the girl to repeat that,"" she said. Increase in hospital waiting list times Rise in patients waiting more than a year NHS Tracker: Check key targets in your area Her comments come after a report from the Nuffield Trust, an independent think tank, said that Northern Ireland's political deadlock and a ""top-down approach"" are frustrating efforts to help sick people. A patient in Northern Ireland is nearly 50 times as likely to be waiting over a year for care than one in Wales, the next worst performer, according to the report. The worsening waiting list situation is further underlined in South Eastern Health Trust figures, seen by BBC News NI. They show that children who may have a life-threatening allergy are being expected to wait 232 weeks to see a consultant. Meanwhile, the BMA in NI said it was are concerned that doctors are starting to refuse to work beyond their contracted hours. It is because of unexpected tax bills following new pension rules in 2016. Dr Alan Stout, the chairman of the BMA's GP Committee, said: ""In Northern Ireland we are very reliant - particularly with the waiting lists as they are - on consultants doing extra shifts and trying to clear the back-log, also across the health service on GPs doing out of hours shifts. ""So something that stops people doing that is going to have an inevitable consequence on those waiting times."" A Department of Health spokesperson said they were closely monitoring the situation. ""Concerns about potential impacts on service provision have been raised with us by trusts and the BMA. ""Taxation - including pension taxation - is a reserved matter and decisions on tax relief on pension contributions are taken by the Treasury. ""Department of Health officials are in close contact with counterparts in England and Wales on this issue. "" The Department of Health in England said it wanted to make NHS pensions more flexible for senior clinicians.  229 weeksGastroenterology 155 weeksDermatology 127 weeksEar, nose and throat 108 weeksGynaecology The spokesperson also said important progress had been made in transforming health and social care services in spite of political and budgetary uncertainty. The hard-hitting Nuffield Trust report included information from clinicians and health service leaders from both inside and outside Northern Ireland. On leadership, it highlights a culture of ""tight command and control at the heart of the system"", with contributors suggesting a top-down approach does not allow for change. It said the ""political deadlock and culture of centralisation"" are ""impending reform"". It's been three years sincethe Bengoa review, which outlined how to improve Northern Ireland's health service. Pace of change has been slow despite all political parties at Stormont signing up to the transformation of how services are delivered. The Department of Health insisted much work was going on behind the scenes and that ""significant investment"" is required to address the waiting list backlog. ""The department cannot spend money it does not have,"" it said. The report's co-author and Nuffield Trust policy analyst Mark Dayan said officials are committed to change but ""to keep on pushing from the top risks making things worse"". Prof Deirdre Heenan, the report's co-author, said the waiting lists were a ""national scandal"" Mr Dayan said that without elected leaders ""things grind to a halt because officials don't have the legitimacy to make tough calls"". Co-author Prof Deirdre Heenan said the ""spiralling waiting lists in Northern Ireland represent a major breach of public trust in the NHS"". She told the BBC that the waiting list figures are a ""national scandal"". People like Mrs Condon say they are forgotten about. ""We don't have Stormont sitting at the moment so who is taking this forward? Who is fighting for the people who need to be seen?"" she asked. Commenting on Mrs Condon's treatment, the Belfast Health Trust said that in most cases patients are seen in chronological order in terms of urgency but that if a specialist deems a referral ""clinically urgent"", then patients will be seen within 10 weeks. It said ""demand to see a shoulder surgeon greatly outweighs"" the trust's capacity but that it had hired a specialist physiotherapist to run ""clinics with shoulder surgeons"" to increase capacity. ""We would like to take this opportunity to apologise again to the significant and growing numbers of patients who remain on the current waiting lists,"" it added. Grainne Doran, from the Royal College of GPs, said people are becoming accustomed to lengthy lists. ""We now need to step back and say we need to urgently get rid of the long lists and work out how we can stop them happening again,"" she added. Long waits are causing more people to go private, with demand so high that it has pushed two of Northern Ireland's private hospitals into the top 20 busiest in the UK for dealing with joint surgery. Kingsbridge Private Hospital is 9th while the Ulster Independent Clinic is 16th, in the National Joint Registry's list of over 200 private hospitals.

Dyson buys Singapore's 'biggest penthouse flat',"The penthouse flat has views across Singapore Sir James Dyson has bought what is thought to be Singapore's biggest and most expensive penthouse flat. The purchase comes after his company, best known for its vacuum cleaners, moved its HQ from the UK to Singapore. Sir James, a prominent advocate for Brexit who has said leaving the EU with no deal would ""make no difference"", was accused of hypocrisy after the move. The property is at the heart of the city's business district and spans three floors and has five bedrooms. Official records show Sir James and his wife Lady Deirdre Dyson are joint tenants of the apartment at the prestigious Wallich Residence. ""Given the decision to locate the headquarters in Singapore and the growing focus of the company's business in the region, of course James Dyson has bought a property there,"" a Dyson spokesperson said in a statement. Dyson to move head office to Singapore Dyson to build electric car in Singapore Sir James took ownership of the property in June, the records show. The view from the terrace of the Wallich Residence According to marketing documents,external, the property is the largest ""non-landed residence"" in Singapore and has its own swimming pool, jacuzzi room and bar facilities. Singapore's Business Times reports Sir James paid $73.8m Singapore dollars ($54m, Â£43m) for the ""super penthouse"", which has views of the city's Marina Bay Sands and the financial district. The price tag is likely to make it Singapore's most expensive flat. The company has said moving its headquarters to Singapore was for commercial reasons, and had nothing to do with Brexit. ""It's to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities,"" chief executive Jim Rowan said at the time. Dyson has been building its presence in Singapore, announcing last yearit would build a new electric car plantthere. As well as vacuum cleaners, Dyson is also known for making air purifiers and hair care products like hair dryers. Most of Dyson's products are designed in the UK, but manufactured in Asia.

Official records show Sir James and his wife Lady Deirdre Dyson are joint tenants of the apartment at the prestigious Wallich Residence. ""Given the decision to locate the headquarters in Singapore and the growing focus of the company's business in the region, of course James Dyson has bought a property there,"" a Dyson spokesperson said in a statement. Dyson to move head office to Singapore Dyson to build electric car in Singapore Sir James took ownership of the property in June, the records show. The view from the terrace of the Wallich Residence According to marketing documents,external, the property is the largest ""non-landed residence"" in Singapore and has its own swimming pool, jacuzzi room and bar facilities. Singapore's Business Times reports Sir James paid $73.8m Singapore dollars ($54m, Â£43m) for the ""super penthouse"", which has views of the city's Marina Bay Sands and the financial district. The price tag is likely to make it Singapore's most expensive flat. The company has said moving its headquarters to Singapore was for commercial reasons, and had nothing to do with Brexit. ""It's to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities,"" chief executive Jim Rowan said at the time. Dyson has been building its presence in Singapore, announcing last yearit would build a new electric car plantthere. As well as vacuum cleaners, Dyson is also known for making air purifiers and hair care products like hair dryers. Most of Dyson's products are designed in the UK, but manufactured in Asia.

MPs back abortion and same-sex marriage moves,"Conor McGinn's proposal says if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, the government should legislate for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland MPs have backed amendments which require the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland if devolution is not restored. It was part of a Commons debate aimed at keeping NI running in the absence of devolved government. Its main purpose was to extend the government's legal power todelay a fresh Stormont election. MPs had tabled a series of other amendments. What does vote on Northern Ireland bill mean? Why there's more to the Northern Ireland bill Stormont election delay bill debated by MPs 10 ways in which gay rights have changed They argued those issues should not be stalled due to the lack of devolution, which collapsed in January 2017. MPs backed the same-sex marriage amendment by 383 votes to 73, while the abortion amendment was backed 332 to 99. Neither amendment automatically changes the law in Northern Ireland, where same-sex marriage is not legal and abortion is only allowed in very limited circumstances. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate Labour's Conor McGinn, originally from County Armagh, put forward a proposal to the NI Executive Formation Bill that if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, then the government should legislate for same-sex marriage - on the condition that a future assembly could overturn or amend the law. The abortion amendment, put forward by his Labour colleague Stella Creasy, is subject to the same condition. The two contenders vying to become the next prime minister were asked about Tuesday's vote during a leadership debate on ITV. Jeremy Hunt said he would support the move, while Boris Johnson said it should remain a devolved issue. ""I think it's a matter for the people of Northern Ireland and one of the most important reasons for getting the Stormont government back up and running,"" Mr Johnson said. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Campaigners for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland say this is a watershed moment. Others may see it as the biggest step yet by Westminster towards enacting direct rule. But it does not automatically change the law - the caveat is that it can only happen if Stormont hasn't been restored by 21 October. The Northern Ireland Office minister, John Penrose, also said even if we get to that stage, time constraints mean they may be unlikely to be able to implement the law change right away. The DUP was angry that Parliament was voting on issues it deems devolved matters, saying the bill had been ""hijacked"". But the MP behind the amendment - Conor McGinn - said the DUP should see it as an ""incentive"" to get Stormont restored so it never has to come into effect. ""My priority, and what I want to see, is an assembly up and running and functioning in Stormont, so it is my strong view that the way that this amendment is crafted doesn't impinge on the devolved settlement because it explicitly recognises that this is a devolved power,"" Mr McGinn said. ""At the minute, the assembly and executive exists in the ether or as a concept, not in reality."" Read more from Jaynehere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If the Stormont assembly has not been restored by 21 October, the government must bring regulations to Parliament to amend the law in Northern Ireland on same-sex marriage. There would not have to be a further vote on the matter, as it would come in the form of secondary legislation - statutory instruments - which would not be put to a vote on the Commons floor. The bill still has to go to the House of Lords for approval, but it is very unlikely it will be overturned there. Former Number 10 Director of Legislative Affairs Nikki Da Costa told BBC News NI MPs could ask for a resolution to overturn it - but given the majority in favour of the amendment, that seemed unlikely to happen too. This video can not be played The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained The DUP voted against both amendments, but two of its MPs, Gavin Robinson and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, were tellers, meaning they did not vote. Independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed the same-sex marriage amendment, as did Northern Ireland Office Minister John Penrose. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and the prime minister abstained. Another hour of debate on other amendments, with some tabled by the DUP looking at the implementation of the Military Covenant in NI, also took place. MPs also backed an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, which requires the government to submit regular progress reports to Parliament, giving updates on the talks process at Stormont. It passed by just one vote. The DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". The DUP reacted angrily to the decision to allow the abortion and same-sex marriage amendments to be debated in Parliament. Speaking before the same-sex marriage amendment was approved, the party's Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said if approved by MPs, the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". During the debate, he said there were many issues - such as the health service, education, infrastructure investment, jobs -  that were having ""massive detrimental effects by not having progress made through legislation and executive decisions. ""Yet nobody is addressing that point today, instead we're picking out certain issues, which I think is a fundamentally wrong approach especially when talks are under way currently."" Party colleague Gavin Robinson said that if the assembly was restored tomorrow, the issue of same-sex marriage could be legislated on as the DUP does not have the numbers to stop it. He said the party stopping this happening was Sinn FÃ©in. However, Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said: ""It was inevitable that the British government's failure to defend basic rights available everywhere else on these islands would be confronted. ""This was the message coming out of Westminster today."" John O'Doherty of the Rainbow Project, said: ""Parliament has always had the power to legislate for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and we are glad the House of Commons has seen sense and voted to give people in Northern Ireland the same freedoms enjoyed by everyone else in these islands."" Conservative MPs and Labour MPs were given free vote on the issue. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has traditionally abstained on devolved matters in other nations, said on Tuesday morning that its MPs would be given a free vote on the issue and 25 of its MPs backed it. England and Wales legalised same-sex marriage in July 2013and came into force inMarch 2014 Scotland legislated for same-sex marriage inFebruary 2014which came into effect inDecemberthat year The Republic of Ireland legalised same-sex marriage in areferendum in May 2015- becoming the only country in the world to do so by popular vote.Ireland's first same-sex marriage took place in November 2015. Northern Ireland has been without a government for more than two and a half years, after a bitter row over a financial scandal split the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The Northern Ireland secretary has twice pushed back her obligation to call an election at Stormont, with it due to end on 25 August. This new legislation would delay another poll until 21 October, with another possible extension to 13 January 2020. It also provides greater clarity about decision-making to civil servants at Stormont, in the absence of functioning ministers.

Could a new prime minister shut down Parliament to force a no-deal Brexit?Find out more. Anthony ZurcherBBC North America reporter I suspect President Trump will certainly comment on Sir Kim Darroch's resignation at some
point - usually he likes to celebrate the exercise of his power at moments
like this. And it's all very familiar. Donald Trump doesn't fire people, even in his own administration. What he does is make it so uncomfortable for them that they eventually resign of their own volition. We've seen it time and time again, and that's what happened here. The whole row is getting some coverage in the US, but the reality is that
this is viewed as just the latest in a long line of Trump social media spats. And the nation at large, now that this has basically resolved itself as far as they're concerned,
will move on. Select CommitteeParliament Theresa May's de facto deputy, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, has told a Commons committee he is ""enraged"" by the Sir Kim Darroch row. He said morale among the senior ranks of the civil service had taken a ""very heavy blow"" and the quality of government suffered if officials felt inhibited from giving frank advice to ministers. Mr Lidington said: ""Ultimately it's my decision whether I drive the car off a cliff, but if my civil servants see me heading towards Beachy Head, I do actually want them to come and tell me. ""Their job is to give me the frankest, the most honest advice possible, whether it's something that I would welcome hearing or not."" BBC News Channel Foreign affairs committee chairman Tom Tugendhat earlier questioned the head of the diplomatic service on the whole row. Now he tells the BBC: ""The real problem from this is other embassies around the world feel that what they write can be used against them."" Sir Kim Darroch's private cables to the British government were leaked, remember. Mr Tugendhat says the ambassador had done the ""right thing"" in his communications and ""should be supported"". An inquiry finds that ""unacceptable behaviour"" by ""known offenders"" has been tolerated.Read more. Dave Penman, general secretary of the FDA civil service union, says Sir Kim Darroch was ""placed in an impossible situation"". ""Firstly, by the leaking of confidential communiques and then by the failure of Boris Johnson and his supporters to provide unequivocal support,"" he says. ""As a loyal public servant, he has, as he always did, put his country first. Can we honestly say that about those who took to the airways and equivocated?"" He says a ""disturbing pattern"" was emerging - ""here the brightest and best civil servants are being forced out of their jobs due to relentless attacks from politicians and some sections of the media."" He says it is the job of ministers and of the prime minister ""to defend their civil servants from this kind of abuse"". ""But time and time again, they are choosing to stay silent and as a result they have created an environment where the targeting of individuals or undermining of the service as a whole has become routine.""

UK returns to growth but slowdown fears persistA recovery in car production helped the economy grow 0.3% in May after declining 0.4% in April.BusinessComments,"The UK economy returned to growth in May after shrinking in April, but the news failed to allay fears of a future slowdown. The economy grew 0.3% from the month before, after declining 0.4% in April, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Growth for the three months to May was 0.3%, with all sectors showing growth. But economists say that June's growth figures will have to be strong to avoid contraction in the second quarter. A partial recovery in car production, which had fallen sharply in April, was the main reason for the economy's upturn in May, said Rob Kent-Smith, head of GDP at the ONS. Factory shutdowns designed to cope with disruption from a March Brexit had slashed UK car production in April by nearly half. However, despite this rebound, the levels of output in the car industry are below those seen in the months leading up to April 2019, the ONS said. ""GDP grew moderately in the latest three months, with IT, communications and retail showing strength. Despite this, there has been a longer-term slowdown in the often-dominant services sector since summer 2018,"" Mr Kent-Smith added. In May, growth in services was flat, following growth of 0.1% in April. Faisal Islam, economics editor A return to work in car factories that shut down in preparation for a no-deal Brexit drove a return to growth in the economy in May of 0.3%. But that rise did not make up for all the fall in the previous month. Monthly figures are volatile and should be taken with a pinch of salt. However, against a backdrop of a marked softening in a slew of surveys of manufacturing, services and retail, there is an indication of an economy stalling and possibly contracting in the second quarter that has just ended, between April and June. In the three months till May, however, growth was higher than expected because of a better March than had been previously calculated. The impact of stockpiling, though, can clearly be seen in the big economic figures. Sterling has fallen more than 5% in recent weeks against the world's three major currencies, on expectation of lower interest rates for longer, political uncertainty and rising expectations of a no-deal Brexit. Ben Brettell, senior economist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the latest figures suggested the economy grew overall in the second quarter, although probably at a much slower rate than the 0.5% recorded in the January-to-March period. Those second-quarter figures, covering April to June, are due to be released on 9 August. ""Storm clouds look to be gathering over the UK economy, as consumers and business remain hamstrung by Brexit uncertainty,"" he added. Last month,the Bank of England said it expected economic growth to be flatin the second quarter of the year. Does GDP tell the whole economic story?

Breaking|Breaking newsSir Kim Darroch resigns as UK ambassador to USSir Kim Darroch resigns as UK ambassador to US amid row over leaked emails critical of Trump administration,"This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to Sir Kim Darroch's service Sir Kim Darroch has resigned as UK ambassador to the US, as a row over leaked emails critical of President Trump's administration escalates. Theresa May said Sir Kim's departure was ""a matter of deep regret"" after the ambassador said it was ""impossible"" for him to continue. Tory leadership candidate Boris Johnson has faced strong criticism for failing to fully support him. President Trump said on Monday that the US would not deal with Sir Kim. The US president had branded him""a very stupid guy""after confidential emails emerged where the ambassador had called his administration ""clumsy and inept"". In a letter to the Foreign Office, Sir Kim said he wanted to end speculation about his position: ""The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like."" Five things we learned from the UK ambassador spat Will Darroch row affect the Tory leadership race? Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Sir Kim Darroch resigns: Letter in full His resignation has prompted widespread support for Sir Kim as well as criticism of Tory frontrunner Boris Johnson. According to some Whitehall sources, Sir Kim decided to resign after Mr Johnson refused to support him during the Tory leadership debate on Tuesday night, said BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale. Mr Johnson was asked repeatedly by fellow leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt whether he would keep Sir Kim in post if he became prime minister, but refused to answer. It is understood Mr Johnson spoke to Sir Kim on the phone on Wednesday afternoon. Sources close to Mr Johnson said that he praised Sir Kim's dedication and hard work and claimed the conversation was warm and cordial. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US Following Sir Kim's resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""a superb diplomat"" and whoever was responsible for the leak ""has done a grave disservice to our civil servants"". Asked why he was not more supportive of Sir Kim, he said it was ""wrong to drag civil servants into the political arena"". Europe Minister Sir Alan Duncan - who backs Mr Hunt in the leadership contest - said it was ""contemptible negligence"" of Mr Johnson not to support Sir Kim. ""He's basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under a bus to serve his own personal interests,"" he said. However, Sir Michael Fallon - a supporter of Mr Johnson - told BBC Newsnight Sir Kim's position became untenable ""long before the debate on Tuesday night"" and he understands the ambassador did not watch it. The backlash against Mr Johnson was ""a shabby attempt to politicise"" the affair and the leadership contender had ""made it clear he supports all our diplomats"", he said. This video can not be played Sir Alan Duncan says Boris Johnson has ""thrown our top diplomat under a bus"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said,externalMr Johnson wanted a ""sweetheart trade deal"" with the US and his lack of support for Sir Kim ""shows he won't stand up to Donald Trump"". Tory MP and chairman of the Commons' foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhatsaid in a tweet,external: ""Leaders stand up for their men. They encourage them to try and defend them when they fail."" Fellow Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt told the BBC Sir Kim was ""doing his job"" and his resignation was ""a black day for British diplomacy"". Mrs May said Sir Kim had had the full backing of the cabinet and he was owed an ""enormous debt of gratitude"" for his ""lifetime of service"" to the UK. Public servants should be able to give ""full and frank advice"", she added. by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent So was it Boris Johnson what done it? Was the failure of the former foreign secretary to defend Sir Kim in last night's Tory leadership debate the crucial factor in the ambassador's decision to resign? Without Sir Kim speaking publicly on the subject, we are reliant on others to speak for him. And certainly, according to well-placed sources in Whitehall, Mr Johnson's decision to avoid criticising President Trump and his lack of support for Sir Kim was said to be the straw that broke the camel's back. If you are an embattled diplomat under fire from your host country, you need cover from London. And if that is lacking from the man tipped to be your next boss, you realise the writing is on the wall. Certainly, there is genuine anger across Westminster and Whitehall at Mr Johnson's refusal six times last night to come to the aid of our man in Washington. Mr Johnson's supporters have offered varying counter theories. Some have accused Mr Hunt's supporters of politicising the resignation. Others have insisted that the decision had been made before the debate, once Mr Trump declared he would no longer deal with Sir Kim. Realising they were on the receiving end of potentially damaging criticism, Mr Johnson's aides also let it be known that he called Sir Kim this afternoon and praised his dedication and hard work. The problem is that few in Westminster were giving much credence to these defences. In the House of Commons, Theresa May pointedly urged MPs to ""reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles, particularly when they are under pressure"". It was not hard to decipher what she was talking about. Head of the diplomatic service Sir Simon McDonald said it was the first time in his career that a head of state had refused to work with a British ambassador. He described the leak as ""malicious"" and told Sir Kim: ""You are the best of us."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham - a supporter of President Trump - said Sir Kim had done ""an outstanding job"" as ambassador and his resignation was ""a chilling moment"". ""Ambassadors need to be able to talk to their governments without fear of being compromised,"" he said. Mr Johnson pictured with Sir Kim in 2017 while he was in Washington DC as foreign secretary In a letter to Sir Kim, Cabinet Secretary and civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill said that while he understood his reasons for resigning it was ""a matter of enormous regret that you were put in this position after a shocking betrayal of trust"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said he was ""enraged"" by the situation and morale in the senior ranks of the civil service had taken ""a very heavy blow"". Former head of the civil service Lord O'Donnell told the BBC Sir Kim's successor could be chosen within two weeks - while Mrs May is still prime minister. President Trump could well wake up this morning thinking he has the power to veto who the UK has as its ambassador. It wasn't his more colourful remarks on Twitter that really ended Sir Kim's time, but Mr Trump's public announcement that he would no longer work with him. The effects of that were felt immediately. There was a banquet that Sir Kim was immediately dis-invited from. Next, he couldn't attend an event with minister Liam Fox. It was clear he was being frozen out and for an ambassador access is everything. Without it, it's impossible to do the job. More broadly, it's like this... There's never been parity in the special relationship between the UK and US - it's never been a relationship of equals but right now it seems particularly lopsided. The US knows that Britain is fairly isolated right now internationally and needs the US more than ever. Donald Trump has wielded that power mercilessly in this row. In theemails leaked to the Mail on Sunday,external, Sir Kim said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" The emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true. The government has opened an internal inquiry into the publication of the memos and police have beenurged to open a criminal investigation. Downing Street confirmed there had been some ""initial discussions"" with police regarding the leak and if there was concern about criminal activity they would become involved ""more formally"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said it was ""deeply worrying"" diplomatic cables had ended up in the public domain.

Government 'like Dad's Army' on climate change,"Renewables may be booming but the Committee on Climate Change says the government isn't moving fast enough The UK has been dealt a ""brutal reality check"" on its climate change ambitions, environmentalists have said. The government's official climate change advisers warn ministers are failing to cut emissions fast enough, and adapt to rising temperatures. Committee on Climate Change,externalchair John Gummer likened them to the hapless characters in 1970s comedy Dad's Army. The government said it would soon set out plans to tackle emissions from aviation, heat, energy and transport. Trees 'most effective solution' for climate change Attenborough: Climate risks Africa turmoil Water and green energy produced by a single device The prime minister recently announced that the UK would lead the world by cutting almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - so-callednet zero. Theresa May also aspired to the UK hosting a hugely importantglobal climate summit next year. But the CCC said that the UK was already stumbling over measures needed to achieve the previous target of an 80% emissions cut. Its report says new policies must be found to help people lead good lives without fuelling global warming.

And ministers must show how funds will be found to protect critical infrastructure - like ports - from rising sea levels. The committee said unless it delivered on these issues, the government would not have the credibility to host a global climate change summit of world leaders, likely to be held in the UK next year. Doug Parr from Greenpeace UK said: ""This is a truly brutal reality check on the government's current progress in tackling the climate emergency. ""It paints the government as a sleeper who's woken up, seen the house is on fire, raised the alarm and gone straight back to sleep"". The committee's deputy chairwoman Baroness Brown told BBC News: ""There's an increasing sense of frustration that the government knows what it has to do - but it's just not doing it."" The committee said the government's 2040 goal to eliminate emissions from cars and vans was too late. New ways must be found to nudge some drivers into walking, cycling and taking public transport, it believes. This video can not be played Climate change: Why are governments taking so long to take action? There's palpable annoyance from the committee that their recommendations are often ignored. In the list of actions needed to meet emission targets, such as improving insulation of buildings and increasing the market share of electric vehicles, the committee found only seven out of 24 goals were on track. Outside the power and industry sectors, only two indicators were on track. Committee chairman Lord Deben, the former agriculture minister John Gummer, said: ""The whole thing is really run by the government like a Dad's Army. We can't go on with this ramshackle system."" At current rates of global emissions cuts, the world may be heading for a temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of this century - but the report says England appears unprepared for even a 2C rise in global temperature. It warns that the UK is failing to insulate itself from the knock-on effects of climate change overseas, such as colonisations by new species, changes in the suitability of land for agriculture or forestry, and risks to health from changes in air quality driven by rising temperatures. The report says: ""Last June, we advised that 25 headline policy actions were needed for the year ahead. Twelve months later, only one has been delivered by the government in full."" It complains that in some ways the UK is going backwards. Green space in parks and gardens cools cities and helps reduce flood risks. But as more homes are crammed into cities, green spaces have shrunk from 63% of urban area in 2001 to 55% in 2018. Heat magnifies the production of pollutants, so more people are expected to suffer breathing problems. Meanwhile, the proportion of hard surfaces in towns has risen by 22% since 2001, even though they make floods worse. The report says the government's planning should consider the risks that the world may warm by as much as 4C by 2100. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It warns that the new net zero target requires an annual rate of emissions reduction that is 50% higher than under the UK's previous target. It is 30% higher than what's been achieved on average since 1990 - a period when the UK has benefited from a relatively simple switch from coal to gas for electricity. The report says: ""The need for action has rarely been clearer. Our message to government is simple: 'Now, do it.'"" As new homes have been built green spaces have shrunk in urban areas over the past 20 years A government spokesman said the UK had cut emissions faster than any other G7 country and set a strong example for other countries to follow. ""We know there is more to do - and legislating for net zero will help to drive further action, as well as further measures to protect the environment from extreme weather, including flood protection, tree planting and peat-land management,"" the spokesman added. Shadow business and energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the government efforts were lagging far behind what is required. She said the report was a ""remarkable, damning assessment"". Friends of the Earth's Mike Childs said: ""Theresa May keeps talking about the need for climate action, while giving the green light to fracking and more roads and runways. ""Reining in the rogue Department for Transport is crucial. Billions of pounds are being squandered on gas-guzzling developments, while trams, trains, buses and cycling are starved of investment."" Climate change policy is devolved. Scotland faces slightly tougher targets for emissions cuts than England, and Wales faces a slightly more lax target. Northern Ireland polices are not yet determined.

Breaking|Breaking newsSir Kim Darroch resigns as UK ambassador to US,"This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to Sir Kim Darroch's service Sir Kim Darroch has resigned as UK ambassador to the US, as a row over leaked emails critical of President Trump's administration escalates. Theresa May said Sir Kim's departure was ""a matter of deep regret"" after the ambassador said it was ""impossible"" for him to continue. Tory leadership candidate Boris Johnson has faced strong criticism for failing to fully support him. President Trump said on Monday that the US would not deal with Sir Kim. The US president had branded him""a very stupid guy""after confidential emails emerged where the ambassador had called his administration ""clumsy and inept"". In a letter to the Foreign Office, Sir Kim said he wanted to end speculation about his position: ""The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like."" Five things we learned from the UK ambassador spat Will Darroch row affect the Tory leadership race? Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Sir Kim Darroch resigns: Letter in full His resignation has prompted widespread support for Sir Kim as well as criticism of Tory frontrunner Boris Johnson. According to some Whitehall sources, Sir Kim decided to resign after Mr Johnson refused to support him during the Tory leadership debate on Tuesday night, said BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale. Mr Johnson was asked repeatedly by fellow leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt whether he would keep Sir Kim in post if he became prime minister, but refused to answer. It is understood Mr Johnson spoke to Sir Kim on the phone on Wednesday afternoon. Sources close to Mr Johnson said that he praised Sir Kim's dedication and hard work and claimed the conversation was warm and cordial. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US Following Sir Kim's resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""a superb diplomat"" and whoever was responsible for the leak ""has done a grave disservice to our civil servants"". Asked why he was not more supportive of Sir Kim, he said it was ""wrong to drag civil servants into the political arena"". Europe Minister Sir Alan Duncan - who backs Mr Hunt in the leadership contest - said it was ""contemptible negligence"" of Mr Johnson not to support Sir Kim. ""He's basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under a bus to serve his own personal interests,"" he said. However, Sir Michael Fallon - a supporter of Mr Johnson - told BBC Newsnight Sir Kim's position became untenable ""long before the debate on Tuesday night"" and he understands the ambassador did not watch it. The backlash against Mr Johnson was ""a shabby attempt to politicise"" the affair and the leadership contender had ""made it clear he supports all our diplomats"", he said. This video can not be played Sir Alan Duncan says Boris Johnson has ""thrown our top diplomat under a bus"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said,externalMr Johnson wanted a ""sweetheart trade deal"" with the US and his lack of support for Sir Kim ""shows he won't stand up to Donald Trump"". Tory MP and chairman of the Commons' foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhatsaid in a tweet,external: ""Leaders stand up for their men. They encourage them to try and defend them when they fail."" Fellow Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt told the BBC Sir Kim was ""doing his job"" and his resignation was ""a black day for British diplomacy"". Mrs May said Sir Kim had had the full backing of the cabinet and he was owed an ""enormous debt of gratitude"" for his ""lifetime of service"" to the UK. Public servants should be able to give ""full and frank advice"", she added. by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent So was it Boris Johnson what done it? Was the failure of the former foreign secretary to defend Sir Kim in last night's Tory leadership debate the crucial factor in the ambassador's decision to resign? Without Sir Kim speaking publicly on the subject, we are reliant on others to speak for him. And certainly, according to well-placed sources in Whitehall, Mr Johnson's decision to avoid criticising President Trump and his lack of support for Sir Kim was said to be the straw that broke the camel's back. If you are an embattled diplomat under fire from your host country, you need cover from London. And if that is lacking from the man tipped to be your next boss, you realise the writing is on the wall. Certainly, there is genuine anger across Westminster and Whitehall at Mr Johnson's refusal six times last night to come to the aid of our man in Washington. Mr Johnson's supporters have offered varying counter theories. Some have accused Mr Hunt's supporters of politicising the resignation. Others have insisted that the decision had been made before the debate, once Mr Trump declared he would no longer deal with Sir Kim. Realising they were on the receiving end of potentially damaging criticism, Mr Johnson's aides also let it be known that he called Sir Kim this afternoon and praised his dedication and hard work. The problem is that few in Westminster were giving much credence to these defences. In the House of Commons, Theresa May pointedly urged MPs to ""reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles, particularly when they are under pressure"". It was not hard to decipher what she was talking about. Head of the diplomatic service Sir Simon McDonald said it was the first time in his career that a head of state had refused to work with a British ambassador. He described the leak as ""malicious"" and told Sir Kim: ""You are the best of us."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham - a supporter of President Trump - said Sir Kim had done ""an outstanding job"" as ambassador and his resignation was ""a chilling moment"". ""Ambassadors need to be able to talk to their governments without fear of being compromised,"" he said. Mr Johnson pictured with Sir Kim in 2017 while he was in Washington DC as foreign secretary In a letter to Sir Kim, Cabinet Secretary and civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill said that while he understood his reasons for resigning it was ""a matter of enormous regret that you were put in this position after a shocking betrayal of trust"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said he was ""enraged"" by the situation and morale in the senior ranks of the civil service had taken ""a very heavy blow"". Former head of the civil service Lord O'Donnell told the BBC Sir Kim's successor could be chosen within two weeks - while Mrs May is still prime minister. President Trump could well wake up this morning thinking he has the power to veto who the UK has as its ambassador. It wasn't his more colourful remarks on Twitter that really ended Sir Kim's time, but Mr Trump's public announcement that he would no longer work with him. The effects of that were felt immediately. There was a banquet that Sir Kim was immediately dis-invited from. Next, he couldn't attend an event with minister Liam Fox. It was clear he was being frozen out and for an ambassador access is everything. Without it, it's impossible to do the job. More broadly, it's like this... There's never been parity in the special relationship between the UK and US - it's never been a relationship of equals but right now it seems particularly lopsided. The US knows that Britain is fairly isolated right now internationally and needs the US more than ever. Donald Trump has wielded that power mercilessly in this row. In theemails leaked to the Mail on Sunday,external, Sir Kim said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" The emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true. The government has opened an internal inquiry into the publication of the memos and police have beenurged to open a criminal investigation. Downing Street confirmed there had been some ""initial discussions"" with police regarding the leak and if there was concern about criminal activity they would become involved ""more formally"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said it was ""deeply worrying"" diplomatic cables had ended up in the public domain.

US to enlist military allies in Gulf waters,"Gen Dunford at a press conference with President Trump in April The US says it wants to create an multinational military coalition to safeguard waters around Iran and Yemen. Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he wanted to ""ensure freedom of navigation"" in the region, which provides essential trade routes. The US has blamed Iran for attacks on six oil tankers in May and June. Gen Dunford said the US was talking to a number of countries with the ""political will"" to support the plans. The US would provide ""command and control"" ships, leading surveillance efforts, he said. However, the aim would be for other countries to offer boats to establish patrols nearby, and escort commercial ships carrying their flags through the area. Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Trumplomacy: What's the US endgame in Iran? Gen Dunford said the US would ""work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities"" each country has to support the initiative. The straits of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab are strategically important locations, providing access from the Indian Ocean to the Gulf and the Red Sea respectively. About a fifth of oil that is consumed globally passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Indian Ocean with the Gulf, while oil tankers heading from the the Middle East to Europe via the Red Sea pass must through Bab al-Mandab. Gen Dunford said the size of the initiative depended on the number of countries which decided to take part. ""With a small number of contributors, we can have a small mission,"" he said. ""We'll expand that as the number of nations that are willing to participate identify themselves."" The US already has a substantial naval presence in the region and participates in several multinational naval taskforces carrying out maritime security, counter-terrorism, anti-piracy operations. The headquarters of the US Navy's 5th Fleet is in Bahrain, and it also has naval facilities in Djibouti and Kuwait. The UK, which also has a naval base in Bahrain, said it was ""continuously monitoring the security situation"" in the region and was ""committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law"". The Royal Navy Frigate HMS Montrose has been positioned to shadow an oil tanker sailing under an Isle of Man flag through the Strait of Hormuz. Meanwhile, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani accused the UK of being ""the initiator of insecurity at sea"" by seizing an Iranian oil tanker that was heading to Syria off Gibraltar last week. General Dunford's comments raise many questions. If the threat from Iran - as the Americans insist - is so pressing then why is it that any operation could still be weeks away? The US seems willing only to provide command and control, along with surveillance. The actual patrolling and escorting of merchant vessels would be done by others. What message of US leadership does this send? How many other countries are contributing? That's still not clear. General Dunford says the operation is ""scaleable""; its size will depend upon who participates. And what of its scope? The US sees this as a mission that will not only include the Gulf but also waters off Yemen. With tensions mounting in the region, many governments will be wary of getting involved but will have to balance this against the practical need to safeguard their vessels. Some may see this as a US effort to construct something that looks like a naval coalition ranged against Tehran. Last month, the US blamed Iranian forces for attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Strait of Hormuz - an allegation that Iran rejected. It followed an attack on four tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in May. Days after the June attacks, Iranian forces shot down a US surveillance drone they said had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The US insisted the drone was flying over international waters. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? US President Donald Trump called off strikes planned in responseafter being told that as many as 150 people might be killed. Iran's military has said it would close the Strait of Hormuz if, as President Trump hopes, it becomes unable to export oil due to the sanctions the US has reinstated since pulling out of a landmark nuclear deal with Iran. Europe 'must compensate' Iran Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iran nuclear deal: Key details However, speaking to the BBC,Iran's ambassador to the UN remained defiant. ""We have managed under different situations worse than we have today, and I am sure we can manage again,"" Majid Takht-Ravanchi said. This video can not be played Iran's representative to the UN: Europeans 'are not honouring their commitments' on nuclear deal In the past two weeks, Iran has breached two commitments on uranium enrichment in response to the sanctions. Mr Takht-Ravanchi warned that Iran was prepared to take further steps if Europe fails to compensate it for the economic losses it has suffered. Iran has also been accused of providing military support to Yemen's rebel Houthi movement, which has attacked vessels in the Red Sea belonging to a Saudi-led coalition backing the Yemeni government. On Monday, the coalition said it had foiled an attack on a commercial ship using an unmanned boat rigged with explosives in the southern Red Sea, and warned of the threat to international trade. The Houthis denied targeting commercial shipping. May 2018:US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect. 2 May 2019:Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. 5 May:The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. 8 May:Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. 12 May:Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation. 13 June:Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated. 17 June:Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales. 20 June:Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz. 4 July:Gibraltar, assisted by British Royal Marines, seizes Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 on suspicion of breaking EU sanctions on trade with Syria Europe 'must compensate' Iran to save nuclear deal Trump lashes out at 'ignorant and insulting' Iran Is it about to get more expensive to fill my car?

"Dyson buys Singapore's 'biggest penthouse flat'Sir James is reported to have paid $54m for the flat, following the move of his company's HQ to Singapore.","The penthouse flat has views across Singapore Sir James Dyson has bought what is thought to be Singapore's biggest and most expensive penthouse flat. The purchase comes after his company, best known for its vacuum cleaners, moved its HQ from the UK to Singapore. Sir James, a prominent advocate for Brexit who has said leaving the EU with no deal would ""make no difference"", was accused of hypocrisy after the move. The property is at the heart of the city's business district and spans three floors and has five bedrooms. Official records show Sir James and his wife Lady Deirdre Dyson are joint tenants of the apartment at the prestigious Wallich Residence. ""Given the decision to locate the headquarters in Singapore and the growing focus of the company's business in the region, of course James Dyson has bought a property there,"" a Dyson spokesperson said in a statement. Dyson to move head office to Singapore Dyson to build electric car in Singapore Sir James took ownership of the property in June, the records show. The view from the terrace of the Wallich Residence According to marketing documents,external, the property is the largest ""non-landed residence"" in Singapore and has its own swimming pool, jacuzzi room and bar facilities. Singapore's Business Times reports Sir James paid $73.8m Singapore dollars ($54m, Â£43m) for the ""super penthouse"", which has views of the city's Marina Bay Sands and the financial district. The price tag is likely to make it Singapore's most expensive flat. The company has said moving its headquarters to Singapore was for commercial reasons, and had nothing to do with Brexit. ""It's to make us future-proof for where we see the biggest opportunities,"" chief executive Jim Rowan said at the time. Dyson has been building its presence in Singapore, announcing last yearit would build a new electric car plantthere. As well as vacuum cleaners, Dyson is also known for making air purifiers and hair care products like hair dryers. Most of Dyson's products are designed in the UK, but manufactured in Asia.

Superdry founder promises revival after Â£85m loss,"Julian Dunkerton co-founded Superdry in 2003 Superdry founder Julian Dunkerton says he is trying to ""steady the ship"" after the fashion retailer reported an Â£85m annual loss. Mr Dunkerton returned to the firm in April, after a lengthy campaign against the previous management, who he said had a ""misguided"" strategy. As well as reporting a steep loss for last year, Superdry warned that sales could fall in the current financial year. In 2018 it reported profits of Â£65.3m. ""My first priority on returning to Superdry has been to steady the ship and get the culture of the business back to the one which drove its original success,"" Mr Dunkerton said. He said he planned to return the brand to its ""design-led roots"", paving the way for a return to profitability over the next three years. What went wrong at Superdry? Customers will be offered greater choice in stores and online, he said. There will be less discounting, a website redesign and a change in marketing strategy as part of the new strategy. The firm will aim to renegotiate better terms with landlords, as a large proportion of its leases come up for renewal over the next two years, he added.

Superdry, which started out as a market stall in Cheltenham 16 years ago, was set up by by Mr Dunkerton and James Holder, and went on to enjoy huge commercial success. But its shares have lost nearly 70% over the past year against a tough retail backdrop and in March the company announced it would cut up to 200 jobs. Mr Dunkerton is leading the company while it searches for a new permanent chief executive.

UK government 'like Dad's Army' on climate change,"Renewables may be booming but the Committee on Climate Change says the government isn't moving fast enough The UK has been dealt a ""brutal reality check"" on its climate change ambitions, environmentalists have said. The government's official climate change advisers warn ministers are failing to cut emissions fast enough, and adapt to rising temperatures. Committee on Climate Change,externalchair John Gummer likened them to the hapless characters in 1970s comedy Dad's Army. The government said it would soon set out plans to tackle emissions from aviation, heat, energy and transport. Trees 'most effective solution' for climate change Attenborough: Climate risks Africa turmoil Water and green energy produced by a single device The prime minister recently announced that the UK would lead the world by cutting almost all greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 - so-callednet zero. Theresa May also aspired to the UK hosting a hugely importantglobal climate summit next year. But the CCC said that the UK was already stumbling over measures needed to achieve the previous target of an 80% emissions cut. Its report says new policies must be found to help people lead good lives without fuelling global warming. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly Policies are needed to ensure that people living in care homes, hospitals and flats can stay cool in increasingly hot summers. And ministers must show how funds will be found to protect critical infrastructure - like ports - from rising sea levels. The committee said unless it delivered on these issues, the government would not have the credibility to host a global climate change summit of world leaders, likely to be held in the UK next year. Doug Parr from Greenpeace UK said: ""This is a truly brutal reality check on the government's current progress in tackling the climate emergency. ""It paints the government as a sleeper who's woken up, seen the house is on fire, raised the alarm and gone straight back to sleep"". The committee's deputy chairwoman Baroness Brown told BBC News: ""There's an increasing sense of frustration that the government knows what it has to do - but it's just not doing it."" The committee said the government's 2040 goal to eliminate emissions from cars and vans was too late. New ways must be found to nudge some drivers into walking, cycling and taking public transport, it believes. This video can not be played Climate change: Why are governments taking so long to take action? There's palpable annoyance from the committee that their recommendations are often ignored. In the list of actions needed to meet emission targets, such as improving insulation of buildings and increasing the market share of electric vehicles, the committee found only seven out of 24 goals were on track. Outside the power and industry sectors, only two indicators were on track. Committee chairman Lord Deben, the former agriculture minister John Gummer, said: ""The whole thing is really run by the government like a Dad's Army. We can't go on with this ramshackle system."" At current rates of global emissions cuts, the world may be heading for a temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of this century - but the report says England appears unprepared for even a 2C rise in global temperature. It warns that the UK is failing to insulate itself from the knock-on effects of climate change overseas, such as colonisations by new species, changes in the suitability of land for agriculture or forestry, and risks to health from changes in air quality driven by rising temperatures. The report says: ""Last June, we advised that 25 headline policy actions were needed for the year ahead. Twelve months later, only one has been delivered by the government in full."" It complains that in some ways the UK is going backwards. Green space in parks and gardens cools cities and helps reduce flood risks. But as more homes are crammed into cities, green spaces have shrunk from 63% of urban area in 2001 to 55% in 2018. Heat magnifies the production of pollutants, so more people are expected to suffer breathing problems. Meanwhile, the proportion of hard surfaces in towns has risen by 22% since 2001, even though they make floods worse. The report says the government's planning should consider the risks that the world may warm by as much as 4C by 2100. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It warns that the new net zero target requires an annual rate of emissions reduction that is 50% higher than under the UK's previous target. It is 30% higher than what's been achieved on average since 1990 - a period when the UK has benefited from a relatively simple switch from coal to gas for electricity. The report says: ""The need for action has rarely been clearer. Our message to government is simple: 'Now, do it.'"" As new homes have been built green spaces have shrunk in urban areas over the past 20 years A government spokesman said the UK had cut emissions faster than any other G7 country and set a strong example for other countries to follow. ""We know there is more to do - and legislating for net zero will help to drive further action, as well as further measures to protect the environment from extreme weather, including flood protection, tree planting and peat-land management,"" the spokesman added. Shadow business and energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the government efforts were lagging far behind what is required. She said the report was a ""remarkable, damning assessment"". Friends of the Earth's Mike Childs said: ""Theresa May keeps talking about the need for climate action, while giving the green light to fracking and more roads and runways. ""Reining in the rogue Department for Transport is crucial. Billions of pounds are being squandered on gas-guzzling developments, while trams, trains, buses and cycling are starved of investment."" Climate change policy is devolved. Scotland faces slightly tougher targets for emissions cuts than England, and Wales faces a slightly more lax target. Northern Ireland polices are not yet determined.

'Shock and distress' at 166-week doctor wait,"This video can not be played 'I couldn't believe it was 166 weeks' A County Antrim woman who was told she would have to wait 166 weeks to see an orthopaedic consultant has said she is shocked and distressed. Sandra Condon, who is a nurse, said she is in chronic pain. Mrs Condon said she could not believe that she would have to wait more than three years to be seen ""and then potentially three to four years after that for surgery"". ""I honestly had to ask the girl to repeat that,"" she said. Increase in hospital waiting list times Rise in patients waiting more than a year NHS Tracker: Check key targets in your area Her comments come after a report from the Nuffield Trust, an independent think tank, said that Northern Ireland's political deadlock and a ""top-down approach"" are frustrating efforts to help sick people. A patient in Northern Ireland is nearly 50 times as likely to be waiting over a year for care than one in Wales, the next worst performer, according to the report. The worsening waiting list situation is further underlined in South Eastern Health Trust figures, seen by BBC News NI. They show that children who may have a life-threatening allergy are being expected to wait 232 weeks to see a consultant. Meanwhile, the BMA in NI said it was are concerned that doctors are starting to refuse to work beyond their contracted hours. It is because of unexpected tax bills following new pension rules in 2016. Dr Alan Stout, the chairman of the BMA's GP Committee, said: ""In Northern Ireland we are very reliant - particularly with the waiting lists as they are - on consultants doing extra shifts and trying to clear the back-log, also across the health service on GPs doing out of hours shifts. ""So something that stops people doing that is going to have an inevitable consequence on those waiting times."" A Department of Health spokesperson said they were closely monitoring the situation. ""Concerns about potential impacts on service provision have been raised with us by trusts and the BMA. ""Taxation - including pension taxation - is a reserved matter and decisions on tax relief on pension contributions are taken by the Treasury. ""Department of Health officials are in close contact with counterparts in England and Wales on this issue. "" The Department of Health in England said it wanted to make NHS pensions more flexible for senior clinicians.  229 weeksGastroenterology 155 weeksDermatology 127 weeksEar, nose and throat 108 weeksGynaecology The spokesperson also said important progress had been made in transforming health and social care services in spite of political and budgetary uncertainty. The hard-hitting Nuffield Trust report included information from clinicians and health service leaders from both inside and outside Northern Ireland. On leadership, it highlights a culture of ""tight command and control at the heart of the system"", with contributors suggesting a top-down approach does not allow for change. It said the ""political deadlock and culture of centralisation"" are ""impending reform"". It's been three years sincethe Bengoa review, which outlined how to improve Northern Ireland's health service. Pace of change has been slow despite all political parties at Stormont signing up to the transformation of how services are delivered. The Department of Health insisted much work was going on behind the scenes and that ""significant investment"" is required to address the waiting list backlog. ""The department cannot spend money it does not have,"" it said. The report's co-author and Nuffield Trust policy analyst Mark Dayan said officials are committed to change but ""to keep on pushing from the top risks making things worse"". Prof Deirdre Heenan, the report's co-author, said the waiting lists were a ""national scandal"" Mr Dayan said that without elected leaders ""things grind to a halt because officials don't have the legitimacy to make tough calls"". Co-author Prof Deirdre Heenan said the ""spiralling waiting lists in Northern Ireland represent a major breach of public trust in the NHS"". She told the BBC that the waiting list figures are a ""national scandal"". People like Mrs Condon say they are forgotten about. ""We don't have Stormont sitting at the moment so who is taking this forward? Who is fighting for the people who need to be seen?"" she asked. Commenting on Mrs Condon's treatment, the Belfast Health Trust said that in most cases patients are seen in chronological order in terms of urgency but that if a specialist deems a referral ""clinically urgent"", then patients will be seen within 10 weeks. It said ""demand to see a shoulder surgeon greatly outweighs"" the trust's capacity but that it had hired a specialist physiotherapist to run ""clinics with shoulder surgeons"" to increase capacity. ""We would like to take this opportunity to apologise again to the significant and growing numbers of patients who remain on the current waiting lists,"" it added. Grainne Doran, from the Royal College of GPs, said people are becoming accustomed to lengthy lists. ""We now need to step back and say we need to urgently get rid of the long lists and work out how we can stop them happening again,"" she added. Long waits are causing more people to go private, with demand so high that it has pushed two of Northern Ireland's private hospitals into the top 20 busiest in the UK for dealing with joint surgery. Kingsbridge Private Hospital is 9th while the Ulster Independent Clinic is 16th, in the National Joint Registry's list of over 200 private hospitals.

Amazon Alexa offering NHS health advice,"People will be able to get expert health advice using Amazon Alexa devices, under a partnership with the NHS, the government has announced. From this week, the voice-assisted technology is automatically searching the official NHS website when UK users ask for health-related advice. The government in England said it could reduce demand on the NHS. Privacy campaigners have raised data protection concerns but Amazon say all information will be kept confidential. The partnership was first announced last year and now talks are under way with other companies, including Microsoft, to set up similar arrangements. Previously the device provided health information based on a variety of popular responses. The use of voice search is on the increase and is seen as particularly beneficial to vulnerable patients, such as elderly people and those with visual impairment, who may struggle to access the internet through more traditional means. Under the partnership, Amazon's algorithm uses information from the NHS website to provide answers to questions such as, ""How do I treat a migraine?"" and, ""What are the symptoms of chickenpox?"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was right for the NHS to ""embrace"" technology in this way, predicting it would reduce pressure on ""our hard-working GPs and pharmacists"". ""We want to empower every patient to take better control of their healthcare,"" he added. He said it was the latest step in a technological revolution in the NHS. The announcement drew criticism from civil liberty group Big Brother Watch. Director Silkie Carlo said: ""Any public money spent on this awful plan rather than frontline services would be a breathtaking waste. ""Healthcare is made inaccessible when trust and privacy is stripped away, and that's what this terrible plan would do."" ""It's a data protection disaster waiting to happen."" Amazon toldthe Times,externalthat it did not share information with third parties, nor does it build a profile on customers. A spokesman said: ""All data was encrypted and kept confidential. Customers are in control of their voice history and can review or delete recordings."" The government has set up a unit, NHSX, to boost the use of digital technologies in the health service. Among the measures already being pursued are an expansion of electronic prescribing and the use of artificial intelligence to analyse scans. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, of the Royal College of GPs, said the move had ""potential"", especially for minor ailments. But she said it was vital that independent research was done to make sure the advice being given was safe or it could ""prevent people seeking proper medical help and create even more pressure"". And she added it was important to remember that not everyone was comfortable using such technology, or could afford it.

"US to enlist military allies in Gulf watersUS Marine General Joseph Dunford wants to ""ensure freedom of navigation"" in the Gulf and off Yemen.US & Canada","Gen Dunford at a press conference with President Trump in April The US says it wants to create an multinational military coalition to safeguard waters around Iran and Yemen. Gen Joseph Dunford, chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staff, said he wanted to ""ensure freedom of navigation"" in the region, which provides essential trade routes. The US has blamed Iran for attacks on six oil tankers in May and June. Gen Dunford said the US was talking to a number of countries with the ""political will"" to support the plans. The US would provide ""command and control"" ships, leading surveillance efforts, he said. However, the aim would be for other countries to offer boats to establish patrols nearby, and escort commercial ships carrying their flags through the area. Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Trumplomacy: What's the US endgame in Iran? Gen Dunford said the US would ""work directly with the militaries to identify the specific capabilities"" each country has to support the initiative. The straits of Hormuz and Bab al-Mandab are strategically important locations, providing access from the Indian Ocean to the Gulf and the Red Sea respectively. About a fifth of oil that is consumed globally passes through the Strait of Hormuz, which connects the Indian Ocean with the Gulf, while oil tankers heading from the the Middle East to Europe via the Red Sea pass must through Bab al-Mandab. Gen Dunford said the size of the initiative depended on the number of countries which decided to take part. ""With a small number of contributors, we can have a small mission,"" he said. ""We'll expand that as the number of nations that are willing to participate identify themselves."" The US already has a substantial naval presence in the region and participates in several multinational naval taskforces carrying out maritime security, counter-terrorism, anti-piracy operations. The headquarters of the US Navy's 5th Fleet is in Bahrain, and it also has naval facilities in Djibouti and Kuwait. The UK, which also has a naval base in Bahrain, said it was ""continuously monitoring the security situation"" in the region and was ""committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law"". The Royal Navy Frigate HMS Montrose has been positioned to shadow an oil tanker sailing under an Isle of Man flag through the Strait of Hormuz. Meanwhile, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani accused the UK of being ""the initiator of insecurity at sea"" by seizing an Iranian oil tanker that was heading to Syria off Gibraltar last week. General Dunford's comments raise many questions. If the threat from Iran - as the Americans insist - is so pressing then why is it that any operation could still be weeks away? The US seems willing only to provide command and control, along with surveillance. The actual patrolling and escorting of merchant vessels would be done by others. What message of US leadership does this send? How many other countries are contributing? That's still not clear. General Dunford says the operation is ""scaleable""; its size will depend upon who participates. And what of its scope? The US sees this as a mission that will not only include the Gulf but also waters off Yemen. With tensions mounting in the region, many governments will be wary of getting involved but will have to balance this against the practical need to safeguard their vessels. Some may see this as a US effort to construct something that looks like a naval coalition ranged against Tehran. Last month, the US blamed Iranian forces for attacks on two tankers in the Gulf of Oman, just outside the Strait of Hormuz - an allegation that Iran rejected. It followed an attack on four tankers off the coast of the United Arab Emirates in May. Days after the June attacks, Iranian forces shot down a US surveillance drone they said had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The US insisted the drone was flying over international waters. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? US President Donald Trump called off strikes planned in responseafter being told that as many as 150 people might be killed. Iran's military has said it would close the Strait of Hormuz if, as President Trump hopes, it becomes unable to export oil due to the sanctions the US has reinstated since pulling out of a landmark nuclear deal with Iran. Europe 'must compensate' Iran Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iran nuclear deal: Key details However, speaking to the BBC,Iran's ambassador to the UN remained defiant. ""We have managed under different situations worse than we have today, and I am sure we can manage again,"" Majid Takht-Ravanchi said. This video can not be played Iran's representative to the UN: Europeans 'are not honouring their commitments' on nuclear deal In the past two weeks, Iran has breached two commitments on uranium enrichment in response to the sanctions. Mr Takht-Ravanchi warned that Iran was prepared to take further steps if Europe fails to compensate it for the economic losses it has suffered. Iran has also been accused of providing military support to Yemen's rebel Houthi movement, which has attacked vessels in the Red Sea belonging to a Saudi-led coalition backing the Yemeni government. On Monday, the coalition said it had foiled an attack on a commercial ship using an unmanned boat rigged with explosives in the southern Red Sea, and warned of the threat to international trade. The Houthis denied targeting commercial shipping. May 2018:US President Donald Trump withdraws unilaterally from the 2015 nuclear deal between Iran and six world powers, and begins reinstating sanctions to force Iran to renegotiate the accord. Iran's economy slumps as they take effect. 2 May 2019:Mr Trump steps up pressure on Tehran by ending exemptions from secondary sanctions for countries still buying Iranian oil. 5 May:The US sends an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the Gulf because of ""troubling and escalatory indications"" related to Iran. 8 May:Iranian President Hassan Rouhani says Iran will scale back its commitments under the nuclear deal in retaliation for the sanctions, including by allowing its stockpile of low-enriched uranium to increase. Enriched uranium is used to make reactor fuel and potentially nuclear weapons. 12 May:Four oil tankers are damaged by explosions off the UAE coast in the Gulf of Oman. The UAE says the blasts were caused by limpet mines planted by a ""state actor"". The US blames Iran, but it denies the allegation. 13 June:Explosions hit two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. The US again accuses Iran, releasing footage purportedly showing Iranian forces removing an unexploded limpet mine from a damaged vessel. Iran says the evidence is fabricated. 17 June:Iran says it will breach the limit on its stockpile of enriched uranium set under the nuclear deal on 27 June, unless Europe protects Iranian oil sales. 20 June:Iranian forces shoot down US military drone over the Strait of Hormuz. 4 July:Gibraltar, assisted by British Royal Marines, seizes Iranian oil tanker Grace 1 on suspicion of breaking EU sanctions on trade with Syria Europe 'must compensate' Iran to save nuclear deal Trump lashes out at 'ignorant and insulting' Iran Is it about to get more expensive to fill my car?

"Brexit ferry deal 'rushed and risky', MPs say","Brittany Ferries was one of three suppliers which had a contract to provide extra ferry services The government's Brexit ferry programme was ""rushed and risky"", according to a cross-party group of MPs, who confirmed the botched project had cost Â£85m. A procurement process to provide extra ferry services was held in anticipation of the UK leaving the EU on 29 March. But MPs said taxpayers had ""little to show"" for the cost after the UK failed to leave the EU on that date and had to cancel deals reached with three firms. The government defended the contracts, calling them an ""insurance policy"". UK seeks new no-deal Brexit freight plan UK government cancels Brexit ferry deals Seaborne Freight no-deal ferry contract scrapped The contracts had to be cancelled after the date for Britain to leave the EU was pushed back from 29 March to 31 October. The Public Accounts Committee report confirmed that cancelling the contracts with Seaborne Freight, DFDS and Brittany Ferries had cost the Department for Transport (DfT) Â£51.4m. The DfT also had to pay a Â£33m settlement with Eurotunnel after the group said it was excluded from the tendering process. The BBC discovered that Seaborne Freight, which was awarded a contract worth Â£13.8m, had never actually run a ferry service. In its report, the committee said: ""Prior to the previous planned departure date of 29 March, we had raised concerns with a number of departments about the rate of progress with the preparations. ""With little lead time left, the Department for Transport undertook a rushed and risky procurement of additional ferry capacity which opened it to a court challenge from Eurotunnel, which had been excluded from the procurement."" Attention has been focused on how to keep vital trade routes across the English Channel flowing as smoothly as possible. As part of the settlement, the DfT secured extra capacity with Eurotunnel to keep freight and customers moving between the UK and France after Brexit. It also ensures that essential medicines will reach the NHS in the event of a no-deal departure. Eurotunnel also agreed to make improvements to its terminal at Folkestone in Kent. But committee chairwoman Labour MP Meg Hillier said public benefits from the settlement ""amount to little more than window dressing"". ""The department needs to keep a close eye and ensure that Eurotunnel delivers what is promised,"" she said. By Joe Miller, business correspondent The Public Accounts Committee has grilled senior civil servants throughout the Brexit ferry procurement saga, and many of its members have betrayed a growing frustration with the DfT's stewardship of taxpayers' money. But key to this latest report is Ms Hillier's verdict on the DfT's rationale for the Â£33m Eurotunnel settlement, rebuffing the government's attempt to point to a silver lining. Presumably to avoid further blushes, the department has no plans to settle with P&O Ferries, which is now challenging the settlement with rival Eurotunnel - and will defend itself in court. The committee also issued another caution to the DfT. In order to ensure that any ferry operators have enough time to be operational for a 31 October Brexit, the procurement of additional capacity ""may need to be completed by the end of July"", it says, which puts no-deal planners in Whitehall on a very tight deadline. The committee's report said the DfT ""must learn from this episode and use its time well, should it be required to re-procure ferry capacity ahead of the new October deadline"". It added: ""We are, however, concerned that departments appear to be waiting for clear instructions on what they should now plan for on Brexit."" The DfT said: ""The freight capacity contracts were taken out as an insurance policy for the UK to ensure that key medical supplies could be guaranteed in the event of a no-deal Brexit. ""Two weeks ago the department outlined a new framework proposal to provide a list of operators capable of delivering this vital freight capacity without the government committing to any agreements at this stage, with market engagement already under way.""

UK 'not acting fast enough' on climate change,"Renewables may be booming but the Committee on Climate Change says the government isn't moving fast enough The UK has been dealt a ""brutal reality check"" on its climate change ambitions, environmentalists have said. The government's official climate change advisers warn ministers are failing to cut emissions fast enough, and adapt to rising temperatures. Committee on Climate Change,externalchair John Gummer likened them to the hapless characters in 1970s comedy Dad's Army. The government said it would soon set out plans to tackle emissions from aviation, heat, energy and transport.

Theresa May also aspired to the UK hosting a hugely importantglobal climate summit next year. But the CCC said that the UK was already stumbling over measures needed to achieve the previous target of an 80% emissions cut. Its report says new policies must be found to help people lead good lives without fuelling global warming.

And ministers must show how funds will be found to protect critical infrastructure - like ports - from rising sea levels. The committee said unless it delivered on these issues, the government would not have the credibility to host a global climate change summit of world leaders, likely to be held in the UK next year. Doug Parr from Greenpeace UK said: ""This is a truly brutal reality check on the government's current progress in tackling the climate emergency. ""It paints the government as a sleeper who's woken up, seen the house is on fire, raised the alarm and gone straight back to sleep"". The committee's deputy chairwoman Baroness Brown told BBC News: ""There's an increasing sense of frustration that the government knows what it has to do - but it's just not doing it."" The committee said the government's 2040 goal to eliminate emissions from cars and vans was too late. New ways must be found to nudge some drivers into walking, cycling and taking public transport, it believes.

In the list of actions needed to meet emission targets, such as improving insulation of buildings and increasing the market share of electric vehicles, the committee found only seven out of 24 goals were on track. Outside the power and industry sectors, only two indicators were on track. Committee chairman Lord Deben, the former agriculture minister John Gummer, said: ""The whole thing is really run by the government like a Dad's Army. We can't go on with this ramshackle system."" At current rates of global emissions cuts, the world may be heading for a temperature rise of more than 3C by the end of this century - but the report says England appears unprepared for even a 2C rise in global temperature. It warns that the UK is failing to insulate itself from the knock-on effects of climate change overseas, such as colonisations by new species, changes in the suitability of land for agriculture or forestry, and risks to health from changes in air quality driven by rising temperatures. The report says: ""Last June, we advised that 25 headline policy actions were needed for the year ahead. Twelve months later, only one has been delivered by the government in full."" It complains that in some ways the UK is going backwards. Green space in parks and gardens cools cities and helps reduce flood risks. But as more homes are crammed into cities, green spaces have shrunk from 63% of urban area in 2001 to 55% in 2018. Heat magnifies the production of pollutants, so more people are expected to suffer breathing problems. Meanwhile, the proportion of hard surfaces in towns has risen by 22% since 2001, even though they make floods worse. The report says the government's planning should consider the risks that the world may warm by as much as 4C by 2100. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world It warns that the new net zero target requires an annual rate of emissions reduction that is 50% higher than under the UK's previous target. It is 30% higher than what's been achieved on average since 1990 - a period when the UK has benefited from a relatively simple switch from coal to gas for electricity. The report says: ""The need for action has rarely been clearer. Our message to government is simple: 'Now, do it.'"" As new homes have been built green spaces have shrunk in urban areas over the past 20 years A government spokesman said the UK had cut emissions faster than any other G7 country and set a strong example for other countries to follow. ""We know there is more to do - and legislating for net zero will help to drive further action, as well as further measures to protect the environment from extreme weather, including flood protection, tree planting and peat-land management,"" the spokesman added. Shadow business and energy secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the government efforts were lagging far behind what is required. She said the report was a ""remarkable, damning assessment"". Friends of the Earth's Mike Childs said: ""Theresa May keeps talking about the need for climate action, while giving the green light to fracking and more roads and runways. ""Reining in the rogue Department for Transport is crucial. Billions of pounds are being squandered on gas-guzzling developments, while trams, trains, buses and cycling are starved of investment."" Climate change policy is devolved. Scotland faces slightly tougher targets for emissions cuts than England, and Wales faces a slightly more lax target. Northern Ireland polices are not yet determined.

"MPs back NI abortion and same-sex marriage movesNeither amendment automatically changes NI law, even though MPs overwhelmingly backed both of them.Northern Ireland","Conor McGinn's proposal says if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, the government should legislate for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland MPs have backed amendments which require the government to liberalise abortion and extend same-sex marriage to Northern Ireland if devolution is not restored. It was part of a Commons debate aimed at keeping NI running in the absence of devolved government. Its main purpose was to extend the government's legal power todelay a fresh Stormont election. MPs had tabled a series of other amendments. What does vote on Northern Ireland bill mean? Why there's more to the Northern Ireland bill Stormont election delay bill debated by MPs 10 ways in which gay rights have changed They argued those issues should not be stalled due to the lack of devolution, which collapsed in January 2017. MPs backed the same-sex marriage amendment by 383 votes to 73, while the abortion amendment was backed 332 to 99. Neither amendment automatically changes the law in Northern Ireland, where same-sex marriage is not legal and abortion is only allowed in very limited circumstances. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate Labour's Conor McGinn, originally from County Armagh, put forward a proposal to the NI Executive Formation Bill that if Stormont is not restored by 21 October, then the government should legislate for same-sex marriage - on the condition that a future assembly could overturn or amend the law. The abortion amendment, put forward by his Labour colleague Stella Creasy, is subject to the same condition. The two contenders vying to become the next prime minister were asked about Tuesday's vote during a leadership debate on ITV. Jeremy Hunt said he would support the move, while Boris Johnson said it should remain a devolved issue. ""I think it's a matter for the people of Northern Ireland and one of the most important reasons for getting the Stormont government back up and running,"" Mr Johnson said. By Jayne McCormack, BBC News NI Political Reporter Campaigners for same-sex marriage in Northern Ireland say this is a watershed moment. Others may see it as the biggest step yet by Westminster towards enacting direct rule. But it does not automatically change the law - the caveat is that it can only happen if Stormont hasn't been restored by 21 October. The Northern Ireland Office minister, John Penrose, also said even if we get to that stage, time constraints mean they may be unlikely to be able to implement the law change right away. The DUP was angry that Parliament was voting on issues it deems devolved matters, saying the bill had been ""hijacked"". But the MP behind the amendment - Conor McGinn - said the DUP should see it as an ""incentive"" to get Stormont restored so it never has to come into effect. ""My priority, and what I want to see, is an assembly up and running and functioning in Stormont, so it is my strong view that the way that this amendment is crafted doesn't impinge on the devolved settlement because it explicitly recognises that this is a devolved power,"" Mr McGinn said. ""At the minute, the assembly and executive exists in the ether or as a concept, not in reality."" Read more from Jaynehere. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If the Stormont assembly has not been restored by 21 October, the government must bring regulations to Parliament to amend the law in Northern Ireland on same-sex marriage. There would not have to be a further vote on the matter, as it would come in the form of secondary legislation - statutory instruments - which would not be put to a vote on the Commons floor. The bill still has to go to the House of Lords for approval, but it is very unlikely it will be overturned there. Former Number 10 Director of Legislative Affairs Nikki Da Costa told BBC News NI MPs could ask for a resolution to overturn it - but given the majority in favour of the amendment, that seemed unlikely to happen too. This video can not be played The law on abortion in Northern Ireland explained The DUP voted against both amendments, but two of its MPs, Gavin Robinson and Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, were tellers, meaning they did not vote. Independent unionist MP for North Down, Lady Hermon, backed the same-sex marriage amendment, as did Northern Ireland Office Minister John Penrose. Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley and the prime minister abstained. Another hour of debate on other amendments, with some tabled by the DUP looking at the implementation of the Military Covenant in NI, also took place. MPs also backed an amendment tabled by Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, which requires the government to submit regular progress reports to Parliament, giving updates on the talks process at Stormont. It passed by just one vote. The DUP's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds said the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". The DUP reacted angrily to the decision to allow the abortion and same-sex marriage amendments to be debated in Parliament. Speaking before the same-sex marriage amendment was approved, the party's Westminster leader, Nigel Dodds, said if approved by MPs, the amendment would ""drive a coach and horses through the principle of devolution"". During the debate, he said there were many issues - such as the health service, education, infrastructure investment, jobs -  that were having ""massive detrimental effects by not having progress made through legislation and executive decisions. ""Yet nobody is addressing that point today, instead we're picking out certain issues, which I think is a fundamentally wrong approach especially when talks are under way currently."" Party colleague Gavin Robinson said that if the assembly was restored tomorrow, the issue of same-sex marriage could be legislated on as the DUP does not have the numbers to stop it. He said the party stopping this happening was Sinn FÃ©in. However, Sinn FÃ©in MP Elisha McCallion said: ""It was inevitable that the British government's failure to defend basic rights available everywhere else on these islands would be confronted. ""This was the message coming out of Westminster today."" John O'Doherty of the Rainbow Project, said: ""Parliament has always had the power to legislate for marriage equality in Northern Ireland and we are glad the House of Commons has seen sense and voted to give people in Northern Ireland the same freedoms enjoyed by everyone else in these islands."" Conservative MPs and Labour MPs were given free vote on the issue. The Scottish National Party (SNP), which has traditionally abstained on devolved matters in other nations, said on Tuesday morning that its MPs would be given a free vote on the issue and 25 of its MPs backed it. England and Wales legalised same-sex marriage in July 2013and came into force inMarch 2014 Scotland legislated for same-sex marriage inFebruary 2014which came into effect inDecemberthat year The Republic of Ireland legalised same-sex marriage in areferendum in May 2015- becoming the only country in the world to do so by popular vote.Ireland's first same-sex marriage took place in November 2015. Northern Ireland has been without a government for more than two and a half years, after a bitter row over a financial scandal split the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in. The Northern Ireland secretary has twice pushed back her obligation to call an election at Stormont, with it due to end on 25 August. This new legislation would delay another poll until 21 October, with another possible extension to 13 January 2020. It also provides greater clarity about decision-making to civil servants at Stormont, in the absence of functioning ministers.
