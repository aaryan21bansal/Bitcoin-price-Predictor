Who is Rishi Sunak?,"Nineteen months after he first entered Downing Street as PM, Rishi Sunak faces the fight of his political life to hang on to the job. Four Conservative prime ministers had already come and gone when, at the age of 42, just seven years an MP, he was tasked with keeping the Tory show on the road. The MPs who put him there hoped he would steady the ship after turbulent times under Boris Johnson and Liz Truss, before mounting a comeback for the party trailing a long way behind Labour in the opinion polls. So farthat comeback has yet to materialise. With a general election having to be called by January 2025, the assumption was that Mr Sunak would play it long and go to the country in the autumn, in the hope his political fortunes would eventually pick up. His surprise calling of an election on 4 July has left some some Conservative MPs scratching their heads but his allies insist it was a smart move. The youngest occupant of No 10 in modern times, Mr Sunak is also the first British-Indian to be prime minister. A son of first generation immigrants, who worked hard to send him to one of the country's top fee-paying schools, Winchester College, where he was head boy. He spent time in California and worked at investment bank Goldman Sachs - and two multibillion dollar hedge funds - before entering politics. Akshata Murty: Who is Rishi Sunak's wife? A self-confessed ""huge Star Wars fan"" with a sizeable collection of lightsabers, he is sometimes portrayed as a ""geek"". He generally swears off alcohol in favour of Mexican Coca-Cola, which, he says, is made with ""cane sugar rather than high fructose corn syrup"". Colleagues describe him as a details man, who is always the best-briefed person in any meeting. He became prime minister in extraordinary circumstances after his predecessor Liz Truss - whom he lost to in a leadership contest after the collapse of Boris Johnson's premiership - quitafter just 45 days in the job. Age:44 Place of birth:Southampton, Hampshire Home:London and Yorkshire Education:Winchester College, Oxford University, Stanford University Family:Married to businesswoman Akshata Murty with two daughters Parliamentary constituency:Richmond (Yorkshire) This video can not be played Watch: Rishi Sunak says that when it comes to helping the most vulnerable ""that's what I did"". Mr Sunak's parents came to the UK from east Africa and are both of Indian origin. He was born in Southampton in 1980, where his father was a GP, and his mother ran her own pharmacy. ""In terms of cultural upbringing, I'd be at the temple at the weekend - I'm a Hindu - but I'd also be at [Southampton Football Club] the Saints game as well on a Saturday - you do everything, you do both."" In the interview he said he had been fortunate not to have endured a lot of racism growing up, but that there was one incident that had stayed with him. ""I was just out with my younger brother and younger sister, and I think, probably pretty young, I was probably a mid-teenager, and we were out at a fast food restaurant and I was just looking after them. There were people sitting nearby, it was the first time I'd experienced it, just saying some very unpleasant things. The 'P' word. ""And it stung. I still remember it. It seared in my memory. You can be insulted in many different ways."" However, he said he ""can't conceive of that happening today"" in the UK. He attended Winchester College and worked as a waiter at a Southampton curry house during his summer holidays. After finishing school he went on to Oxford to study philosophy, politics and economics, before studying for an MBA at Stanford University in California. There he met his wife, and the couple have two daughters. His rise to the top of British politics has been rapid - he only became an MP in 2015, in the rock solid Conservative seat of Richmond, in North Yorkshire. His political opponents have made much of his personal wealth, claiming he is out touch with the lives of most voters. Together, he and hiswife Akshata Murty- daughter of Indian billionaire Narayana Murthy, who co-founder of IT services giant Infosys - havean estimated worth of more than Â£650m. In 2022, Ms Murty announced she wouldstart paying UK tax on her incometo relieve political pressure on her husband. He was arguing for Britain's departure from the EU from his earliest days in politics and supported the Leave campaign in the 2016 Brexit referendum. But he first came to wider public attention during the coronavirus pandemic, when as the recently-appointed chancellor he spent eye-watering sums on the furlough scheme and other support measures, as well as launching the controversial Eat Out to Help Out scheme. His personal popularity soared but he also got caught up in the Partygate controversies that rocked Downing Street, being fined, in June 2020, for attending one of the now infamous gatherings. And he found himself increasingly at odds with his boss Boris Johnson over the economy - pushing for lower taxes and spending cuts. In July 2022, he resigned from the cabinet, a move that was instrumental in ousting Mr Johnson, which some of the former PM's allies have not forgotten. He was not elected leader by Conservative Party members. He was, in effect, crowned by Tory grandees desperate for some stability after the chaos presided over by Liz Truss and latterly by Boris Johnson. He inherited a financial crisis and a party in disarray but also a near 70-seat majority - which has since been significantly eroded by a series of by-election defeats featuring big swings against his party. At the start of 2023, Mr Sunak set out five promises to voters, he wanted to be judged by: Halving inflation Growing the economy Reducing debt Cutting NHS waiting times Stopping small boat crossings Progress on thesehas been slow. The overall number of patients waiting for treatment on the NHS is higher than when Mr Sunak came to office, but inflation has dropped sharply in recent months. The headline rate for the year to April was 2.3%, hailed by the prime minister as a ""major moment"" - and a clear sign that his economic plan is working. On small boats, the government passed legislation allowing it to send some asylum seekers to Rwanda - but this was declared unlawful by the Supreme Court. The government responded by signing a new treaty with Rwanda, declaring it a safe country. This became law in April and the prime minister argues it will deter migrants from crossing the English Channel in small boats. Critics have dismissed it as a hugely expensive gimmick. Mr Sunakhas now said no asylum seekers will be flown to Rwanda before the election - and will go there only if he is re-elected. He has delayed a ban on new petrol and diesel cars in a major change to the government's approach to achieving net zero by 2050. seeking to portray himself as the friend of the motorist and voters who are unhappy about the personal sacrifices required to reach the net zero target. He also scaled back the HS2 high speed rail link. Mr Sunak has pledged to create a ""smoke-free generation"" by phasing out the sale of tobacco products. The billcould fall by the wayside with Parliament shutting down on Fridaybut it is likely to be in the Conservative manifesto. The prime minister's personal ratings have suffered as series of resets has not had the desired effect on Tory fortunes, but he insists he can defy the odds and retain the keys to Downing Street on 4 July.

Who is Elon Musk?,"It seems like not a day goes by without billionaire Elon Musk making headlines. The boss of X (formerly Twitter), Tesla and SpaceX is the world's richest person and has used his platform to make his views known on a vast array of topics. He has also charged ahead withhuman brain chip trials at his firm Neuralink, played with turning X into a super app and tried to cement his presence in the fast-growing world of artificial intelligence, despite having warned itcould lead to humanity's extinction. And Mr Musk's status and wealth seems set to climb higher still following Donald Trump's victory in the 2024 US presidential election - in which the Tesla executive has played a key but controversial role. The president-elect has picked Mr Musk to lead a newly created Department of Government Efficiency (or Doge - like the dog-related meme) for his incoming administration. Trump said Doge would help the administration ""dismantle Government Bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure Federal Agencies"". It's something Mr Musk has experience of - he cut a huge number of jobs at Twitter, now X, after buying it. Trump picks Musk to advise on how to 'dismantle' bureaucracy Since bursting on to the Silicon Valley scene more than two decades ago, the 53-year-old serial entrepreneur has kept the public captivated with his business antics. Born in Pretoria, South Africa, Mr Musk showed his talents for entrepreneurship early, going door-to-door with his brother selling homemade chocolate Easter eggs and developing his first computer game at the age of 12. He has described his childhood as difficult, affected by his parents' divorce, bullying at school and his own difficulty picking up on social cues because of Asperger's Syndrome. At the earliest opportunity, he left home for college, moving to Canada and then the US, where he studied economics and physics at the University of Pennsylvania, an Ivy League college. In a 2010 essay for Marie Claire,external, his first wife, Justine Musk, a writer whom he met in college and married in 2000, wrote that even before making his millions Mr Musk was ""not a man who takes no for an answer"". ""The will to compete and dominate, that made him so successful in business, did not magically shut off when he came home,"" she recalled, adding that he told her while dancing at their wedding, ""I am the alpha in this relationship."" After being accepted to a physics graduate degree programme at Stanford University, Mr Musk quickly dropped out and founded two technology start-ups during the ""dotcom boom"" of the 1990s. These included a web software firm and an online banking company that eventually became PayPal, which was sold to eBay in 2002 for $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn). He ploughed his fortune into a new rocket company, SpaceX - which he aimed to make a cost-effective alternative to Nasa - and a new electric car company, Tesla, where he chaired the board until becoming chief executive in 2008. Elon Musk in 2004, soon after starting SpaceX The two firms are credited with upending their industries, even as they sometimes veered close to financial collapse. More recent business ventures include his takeover of social media platform Twitter in October 2022. Since then he has dramatically reduced the size of its workforce including, controversially, cuts to teams responsible for keeping the platform safe; rebranded the company as X; and introduced new premium subscriptions so that the business does not rely on advertising alone for income. Mr Musk's long-term ambition is for X to become an ""everything app"" offering a range of services. However, so far the value of the firm has plunged from the $44bn he originally paid to just $19bn, according to reports. How the world's richest person bought Twitter He also has ambitions in the AI sector, being an early investor in ChatGPT's parent company before parting ways in 2018, andsetting up his own company xAI""to understand the true nature of the universe"" in 2023. In February, hesued OpenAI and its boss Sam Altman, saying the firm he helped found had reneged on its non-profit, open source origins by hitching its wagon to Microsoft. ""I'm never hugely convinced that he knows what he wants to do tomorrow,"" says journalist Chris Stokel-Walker of Mr Musk's wide-ranging interests. ""He very much leads by instinct."" In a 2015 biography, author Ashlee Vance described Mr Musk as ""a confrontational know-it-all"" with an ""abundant ego"". But he also called him an awkward dancer and diffident public speaker. In the press, he's been dubbed both a mad genius and Twitter's biggest troll - known as much for his lofty ambitions as his petty fights, not to mention the more serious lawsuits he and his companies have faced from regulators, investors and others over issues such as racial discrimination and the trustworthiness of his claims. Divorced three times - twice from the same woman, British actress Talulah Riley - Mr Musk is frank about his faults. ""If you list my sins, I sound like the worst person on Earth,"" Mr Musksaid in a TED interview in 2022,external. ""But if you put those against the things I've done right, it makes much more sense."" All those contradictions appear to be part of Mr Musk's appeal - and it certainly hasn't stopped him amassing a fortune. According to Bloomberg'sindex,externaltracking the wealth of the world's billionaires, Mr Musk is the richest of them all. It estimates his current net worth to be around $350bn, with his fortune soaring alongside Tesla's share price following Trump's election victory. That's based largely on the value of his shares in Tesla, of which he owns more than 13%. The company's stock soared in value - some say unreasonably - in 2020 as the firm's output increased and it started to deliver regular profits. The shares plunged at the end of 2022, with some blaming the distraction of the Twitter takeover for the fall, though they have since recovered ground. And throughout 2024 Mr Musk has been locked in a legal battle over a $56bn pay package from Tesla with a Delaware judgerejecting his claim to it for a second time in December. Judge Kathaleen McCormick called the payout an ""unfathomable sum"", and argued Mr Musk had influenced the company's board and shareholders - with 75% of themvoting to back his pay deal in June. Is Elon Musk worth his Tesla pay package? Elon Musk and his son X Ã A-12 in 2021. Mr Musk, who has 12 children, has called ""population collapse"" a bigger risk than global warming Mr Musk also champions digital currencies and has a hand in several other smaller companies, including tunnel-maker the Boring Company and experimental brain-computer start-up Neuralink. Mr Musk, who wears the mantle of a workaholic proudly, has often said he's not in business simply to make money - claims he repeated recently with regard to his Twitter takeover. ""Elon only gets involved with things if he feels that they're critically important for some reason... for the sake of society or humanity,"" says friend and Tesla investor Ross Gerber. For a long time Mr Musk, who became a US citizen in 2002, resisted efforts to label his politics - calling himself ""half-Democrat, half-Republican"", ""politically moderate"" and ""independent"". He says he voted for Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton and - reluctantly - Joe Biden, all of them Democrats. But in recent years he's swung behind Donald Trump, who is a Republican. Mr Musk officially endorsed the former president for a second term in 2024after his attempted assassinationand became one of the campaign's foremost backers and influencers. He became critical of the Democrat party's stance on a number of issues, including the economy, immigration and gun control - decrying many of its policies as ""woke"". Mr Musk also repeatedly claimed that freedom of speech, enshrined in the first amendment of the US Constitution, would be under threat with another Democrat government. He appeared at several Republican rallies in the run-up to the election, raised millions to fund a political action committee to help re-elect Trump and frequently voiced his support for Trump in posts on X. Mr Musk's America Super PAC also ran acontroversial$1m giveaway to voters in battleground states in the last weeks of the campaign. Why tech bros are backing Trump It was far from his first political controversy. He has shared controversial takes on X about issues facing countries worldwide, such assuggesting the UK was on the cusp of ""civil war"" amid violent unrest in August. While Mr Musk provided his Starlink satellite internet service to Ukraine, he also attracted criticism for refusing an emergency request from Kyiv to activate Starlink in Sevastopol,home to a major Russian navy port. In the US, he moved to Texas, complaining of California's regulations and high taxes; has clashed with union organisers; and, in the spring of 2020, decried coronavirus lockdowns as ""fascist"". Elon Musk at the opening party for the Tesla gigafactory in Austin, Texas He has said that he sees his businesses as a form of philanthropy, because they are focused on solving major human issues, such as climate change in the case of Tesla. And despite his own interest in artificial intelligence, he has also been one of the most prominent figures worried about the supposed threat to humanity's future that super-intelligent AIs might pose. He has claimed that the rise of artificial intelligence, combined with a declining birth rate, could result in ""not enough people"" being in the world. Mr Musk has had 12 children - six with his first wife, three with Canadian singer Grimes, and three with Shivon Zilis. Following the birth of his twins with Ms Zilis, hetweeted,external: ""Doing my best to help the underpopulation crisis.""

Rishi Sunak launches bid to be Conservative leader,"Rishi Sunak has entered the race to be the next leader of the Conservative Party and prime minister. The former chancellor is the most high profile figure so far to announce his candidacy. His resignation from the cabinet on Tuesday helped trigger the mass walkout of ministers that forced Boris Johnson to stand down as Tory leader. Mr Johnson intends to stay on as prime minister until the Tory party chooses a successor. Senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat, Attorney General Suella Braverman and former Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch have announced their plans to stand. Why did Rishi Sunak resign? Follow the latest developments in Tory leadership contest Who is Rishi Sunak? Meanwhile, former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, and former Health Secretary Sajid Javid are said to be considering leadership bids. Former Brexit minister Steve Baker had signalled he was considering standing for the leadership buthas dropped his bid and is backing Attorney General Suella Braverman,external. A timetable for the Tory leadership race is due to be confirmed next week and the new prime minister is expected to be in position by September. Rishi Sunak's video is typically slick and glossy. His brand was well built already - as his profile rocketed during the Covid pandemic - with a strong team behind him, which is one challenge for his competitors to rival. One thing that knocked his 'brand' were reports about his wife's previous non-dom tax status, and his critics using his wealth to brand him 'out of touch' during a cost of living crisis. But like Sajid Javid, Steve Baker and Nadhim Zahawi - who are widely tipped to run - he has used the film to emphasise his more humble background. He describes his grandmother emigrating to Britain and his mother working hard to become a pharmacist so she and his NHS GP father could give their children opportunities. It's this tale of opportunity - and his experience running the economy - that will play a strong part in his campaign. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". He added: ""Someone has to grip this moment and make the right decisions."" ""Do we confront this moment with honesty seriousness and determination or do we tell ourselves comforting fairy tales that might make us feel better in the moment but will leave our children worse off tomorrow,"" he asked. He promised ""to lead this country in the right direction"" based on values of ""patriotism, fairness and hard work"". He said the country faced ""huge challenges"" and that decisions made now would determine whether the next generation got ""the chance of a better future"". Pointing to his credentials to be leader, Mr Sunak said he had run the ""toughest department in government during the toughest times when we faced the nightmare of Covid"". Several senior Tory MPs have endorsed Mr Sunak's candidacy, tweeting their support and promoting his campaign slogan ""Ready for Rishi"". Oliver Dowden -who resigned as party chairman last month- said: ""Rishi is the best person to lead our country and unquestionably the best person to beat Labour."" And Commons Leader Mark Spencerwrote,external: ""Rishi is the leader that can unite the Party, bring the whole country together and win us that fifth general election victory."" In his launch video, Mr Sunak told the story of his Indian mother, who emigrated from East Africa to the UK in the 1960s. The Tory MP explained how his mother went on to run her own pharmacy, and met his father, a GP, in Southampton. ""My family gave me opportunities they could only dream of,"" Mr Sunak said. Mr Sunak, 42, was an analyst for the investment bank, Goldman Sachs, and was later a partner in two hedge funds, before becoming an MP for the North Yorkshire constituency of Richmond in 2015. He was once seen as the leading contender to succeed Mr Johnson as Conservative Party leader and prime minister. Appointed chancellor in February 2020, Mr Sunak had to grapple with the consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic, spending huge amounts to keep the economy afloat. But his reputation was dented bya controversy over his wife's tax affairsand being fined for breaching lockdown rules during the pandemic. Mr Sunak was fined by the Metropolitan Police, along with Mr Johnson and his wife Carrie, for breaching Covid rules by attending a birthday party for the prime minister in June 2020. A backer of Brexit, Mr Sunak was loyal to Mr Johnson, despite tensions over economic policy and the prime minister's wish to cut taxes more quickly as living costs rise. But their relationship ultimately broke down when Mr Sunak dramatically resigned shortly after close ally and former cabinet colleague, Mr Javid. In his resignation letter, Mr Sunak said ""the public rightly expect government to be conducted properly, competently and seriously"". Mr Sunak also referenced tensions over the economy in his resignation letter, telling the PM their approaches had become ""fundamentally too different"". His resignation and that of Mr Javid triggered a mass exodus of ministers and precipitated the downfall of Mr Johnson's government.

Norrie loses as Djokovic reaches Wimbledon finalNovak Djokovic ends Cameron Norrie's bid to become the fourth Briton to reach the Wimbledon final.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch highlights of Novak Djokovic beating Cameron Norrie Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Britain's Cameron Norrie was unable to capitalise on a confident start as Novak Djokovic fought back to reach the Wimbledon men's singles final. Norrie, 26, was bidding to become only the fourth Briton to reach the final at the All England Club in the Open era. But after winning the first set, he lost 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 to the top seed. Serbia's Djokovic, going for a fourth consecutive title and a seventh overall, will face Australia's Nick Kyrgios in Sunday's final. Reaction to Norrie's defeat by Djokovic in Wimbledon semi-finals The 35-year-old will also bid for a 21st Grand Slam men's title, which would put him one behind Rafael Nadal's all-time record. Spain's Nadal, 36, was supposed to face Kyrgios in Friday's second semi-final but withdrew from the match on Thursday because of an abdominal injury. Now Djokovic has the chance to close the gap again on his enduring rival after ending the hopes of Norrie and a nation. Norrie, seeded ninth, was the first British player since Johanna Konta in 2017 to reach a Wimbledon singles semi-final and was given partisan backing on Centre Court. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Novak Djokovic wins point after trick-shot lob against Cameron Norrie The atmosphere became celebratory as Norrie broke three times to take the opening set, before coming increasingly stifled as Djokovic eventually found his level. Norrie received a rapturous round of applause as he left the Centre Court, including from Djokovic who stood back and applauded his exit ""Cameron didn't have much to lose, he was playing the tournament of his life,"" said Djokovic. ""He's a great player and I have a lot of respect for him. ""Cameron was dominating the play and I got lucky to break his serve in the second set. ""He gifted me a game and from then I think momentum shifted."" Wimbledon semis 'pretty sick' but Norrie wants more Kyrgios had 'shocking sleep' with SW19 excitement Cameron Norrie was bidding to become the second British man to reach a Wimbledon final in the Open era - after Andy Murray, who won the 2013 and 2016 titles Despite the obvious disappointment of being unable to maintain his fast start against Djokovic, Norrie will eventually look back on these two weeks with huge pride. The left-hander had never gone past the third round at a Grand Slam before, breaking that barrier and then going from strength to strength to reach the last four. The confidence which he has gained over the past couple of seasons, from rapidly rising up the rankings and winning ATP Tour titles with increasing prestige, was clear in a wonderful first set from the Briton. After earning two break points in the first game of the match, Norrie took the first by dragging Djokovic around the court and hitting a winner past the Serb as he dashed forward. Norrie, usually so mild-mannered, spun around in delight to further illustrate the magnitude of the occasion. After a nervy service game meant he could not consolidate the break, Norrie soon led again and that was helped by Djokovic's own edginess. Two more uncharacteristic errors from Djokovic, smacking two forehands from the baseline long, enabled Norrie to break again and move 3-2 ahead. This time Norrie did hold serve to consolidate the break, more errors from Djokovic's racquet culminating in a forehand into the net. Another break for 5-2 left Norrie serving for the set and, after two double faults including one on set point, he hammered down an ace to seal the opener. That created an jubilant atmosphere, perhaps also with a tinge of disbelief, among the optimistic home fans.

That proved to be true as the defending champion improved his level. Returning to the sun-filled court with a cap for the start of the second set, Djokovic served better and only dropped one point in his first four service games. More pressure began to build on Norrie's serve and as a result that drew more mistakes from the Briton, particularly on his forehand. Djokovic finally took his fourth break point of the set for a 5-3 lead when Norrie hit a forehand long, but the damage was done by missing a volley which he would expect to put away for 15-30. Norrie started the third set by winning a point which left Djokovic clapping his strings but the game quickly switched into the Serb's favour. Djokovic took a third break point to move ahead in the match for the first time and, after winning seven of the next nine games, it looked unlikely Norrie would be able to fight back to win. He served out victory to put himself into an eighth Wimbledon men's final, a tally only bettered by Roger Federer's 12 appearances there. This video can not be played Djokovic predicts 'fireworks' against Kyrgios It is also his 32nd Grand Slam final overall, moving him one clear of Federer as a men's record. ""Of course I've had many Grand Slam semi-finals but it is never easy walking out on court,"" said Djokovic. ""You have a lot of pressure and expectations, from yourself and others. ""I was a bit tighter at the beginning of the match. Cameron was dominating the play and I felt like I got lucky in the second set to break his serve. ""He kind of gifted me a game and since then the momentum shifted a bit. That's the significance of the semi-finals of a Grand Slam.""

Sir Mark Rowley named as Met Police commissioner,"Sir Mark Rowley will serve an initial five-year term, with an annual salary of just under Â£293,000 Sir Mark Rowley has been named as the new commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, taking over the role vacated by Dame Cressida Dick. Sir Mark, 57, served as head of the Met Police's counter-terrorism unit between 2014 and 2018, before leaving to take a role in private industry. Dame Cressidastood down as commissioner in Februaryfollowing a series of scandals. Sir Mark said he was ""deeply honoured"" to be appointed as commissioner. In a statement, he said: ""Our mission is to lead the renewal of policing by consent which has been so heavily dented in recent years, as trust and confidence have fallen. ""We will deliver more trust, less crime and high standards for London and beyond, and we will work with London's diverse communities as we together renew the uniquely British invention of 'policing by consent'."" Sir Mark will serve an initial five-year term, with an annual salary of just under Â£293,000. This video can not be played Sir Mark Rowley spoke to BBC Breakfast in April 2022 about the challenges facing police In 2018 he was knighted after leading the national police response to the Manchester Arena bombing, the Westminster Bridge attack and the London Bridge attack. Sir Mark began his police career as a constable in the West Midlands force in 1987, after graduating with a degree in mathematics from Cambridge University. Between 2008 and 2011, he was the chief constable of Surrey Police, before joining the Met to become the assistant commissioner for specialist crime and operations. Met needs root-and-branch reform, Sadiq Khan says Why is it so hard to fix the Metâs toxic culture? The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick Since leaving the Met Police, Sir Mark worked on security and policy projects includingcarrying out a review with the Commission for Countering Extremism,external. He first applied to be commissioner in 2017, losing out to Dame Cressida. Dame Cressida Dick resigned after Sadiq Khan criticised her handling of racist, misogynist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers The Met's first female commissioner resigned five months ago after Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he had lost confidence in her leadership. The final months of her tenure were marked by a series of scandals, including themurder of Sarah Everardby a serving policeman and Dame Cressida's handling of racist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers at Charing Cross police station. The challenges facing Sir Mark Rowley as the UK's top police officer are enormous. One element of the package, counter-terrorism, will be the easiest for him to return to, thanks to his years of work in that field. The harder job is rebuilding trust in the Metropolitan Police which has been rocked by a series of scandals. Like his  predecessor, Dame Cressida Dick, he is academically thoughtful about the challenges of modern policing - but one of the key differences between the two of them is that Sir Mark has regularly thought not just about how to police - but how to communicate policing in order to build and maintain trust. His first priority will be to come up with an action plan to get the forceout of a form of special measuresimposed by national inspectors of policing standards. That close oversight is known in the jargon as ""engage"". But to win the trust of Londoners, Sir Mark knows he will have to find new and more effective ways of engaging with them too. Home Secretary Priti Patel said of the new appointment: ""I look forward to working closely with Sir Mark. ""This will be a challenging period, but with a focus on tackling neighbourhood crime and delivering the basics of policing, Sir Mark is committed to tackling the significant challenges confronting the force and to making London's streets safer by driving down crime and bringing more criminals to justice."" His appointment was broadly welcomed byformer Met Det Supt Shabnam Chaudhri, who said Sir Mark had ""a mountain to climb"" to rebuild trust in the force, but added it was ""really good"" he had recently been working outside of the Met, which meant he was ""completely fresh and untarnished"". Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it was ""disappointing that Priti Patel and Sadiq Khan decided to bring back Mark Rowley from retirement"". The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MPsaid of Sir Mark,external: ""He spent much of his career in the Met. No evidence that he is a reformer. Missed opportunity.""

"Stopping terror getting harder, say FBI and MI5","Finding intelligence to stop terrorism is getting harder because attackers are increasingly lone actors, the head of the FBI has told a meeting in London. Christopher Wray said the US security services and MI5 are seeing more attacks carried out with crude weapons and little planning or training. At the end of joint meetings with MI5, Mr Wray said it was vital for security services to share intelligence quickly. MI5 head Ken McCallum said they faced a ""very difficult cocktail of risks"". The FBI director said there are ""very few dots out there"", referring to intelligence on planned attacks, adding there was less time to connect those dots. Working with MI5 in some cases was vital, he explained.. ""If we're not super lashed-up, we're going to miss the only picture that's out there - and it's got to happen really fast,"" he said. MI5: 31 late-stage terror plots foiled in four years New database launched to counter extremism UK terrorism threat level lowered to 'substantial' He said travel and technology had ""blurred the lines between foreign and domestic threats"" and that the encryption provided by technology companies was providing ""an entirely unfettered space"" for criminals and terrorists to operate. Mr McCallum said around one in five terrorism investigations in Great Britain were linked to neo-Nazi, racist ideology or other related extremism - a rate that had remained roughly steady. He said MI5 continued to see a growing role for juveniles and an obsessive interest in weaponry. The two men said that co-operation allowed their agencies to cover a broader range of threats. The FBI director said he had met British intelligence and security officials during his visit this week, which came as he marked 80 years of formal co-operation between the FBI and the UK. On Friday afternoon his visit included looking at case studies of Russian and Chinese intelligence operatives moving around the globe. FBI director Christopher Wray (right) visited his MI5 counterpart Ken McCallum as the agencies marked 80 years of co-operation Mr McCallum said the expulsion of Russian diplomats after the Salisbury poisonings in 2018 and continued refusal of visas had prevented Moscow rebuilding its presence and had constrained the threat in the UK. Cyber threats had also been high on the agenda for discussions, Mr Wray said. On Wednesday, the two security chiefs made an unprecedented joint public appearance to warn of an ""immense"" threat from China. They spoke to business and academic leaders inside MI5 headquarters at Thames House in central London.

Norrie loses as Djokovic reaches Wimbledon final,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Watch highlights of Novak Djokovic beating Cameron Norrie Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Britain's Cameron Norrie was unable to capitalise on a confident start as Novak Djokovic fought back to reach the Wimbledon men's singles final. Norrie, 26, was bidding to become only the fourth Briton to reach the final at the All England Club in the Open era. But after winning the first set, he lost 2-6 6-3 6-2 6-4 to the top seed. Serbia's Djokovic, going for a fourth consecutive title and a seventh overall, will face Australia's Nick Kyrgios in Sunday's final. Reaction to Norrie's defeat by Djokovic in Wimbledon semi-finals The 35-year-old will also bid for a 21st Grand Slam men's title, which would put him one behind Rafael Nadal's all-time record. Spain's Nadal, 36, was supposed to face Kyrgios in Friday's second semi-final but withdrew from the match on Thursday because of an abdominal injury. Now Djokovic has the chance to close the gap again on his enduring rival after ending the hopes of Norrie and a nation. Norrie, seeded ninth, was the first British player since Johanna Konta in 2017 to reach a Wimbledon singles semi-final and was given partisan backing on Centre Court. This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Novak Djokovic wins point after trick-shot lob against Cameron Norrie The atmosphere became celebratory as Norrie broke three times to take the opening set, before coming increasingly stifled as Djokovic eventually found his level. Norrie received a rapturous round of applause as he left the Centre Court, including from Djokovic who stood back and applauded his exit ""Cameron didn't have much to lose, he was playing the tournament of his life,"" said Djokovic. ""He's a great player and I have a lot of respect for him. ""Cameron was dominating the play and I got lucky to break his serve in the second set. ""He gifted me a game and from then I think momentum shifted."" Wimbledon semis 'pretty sick' but Norrie wants more Kyrgios had 'shocking sleep' with SW19 excitement Cameron Norrie was bidding to become the second British man to reach a Wimbledon final in the Open era - after Andy Murray, who won the 2013 and 2016 titles Despite the obvious disappointment of being unable to maintain his fast start against Djokovic, Norrie will eventually look back on these two weeks with huge pride. The left-hander had never gone past the third round at a Grand Slam before, breaking that barrier and then going from strength to strength to reach the last four. The confidence which he has gained over the past couple of seasons, from rapidly rising up the rankings and winning ATP Tour titles with increasing prestige, was clear in a wonderful first set from the Briton. After earning two break points in the first game of the match, Norrie took the first by dragging Djokovic around the court and hitting a winner past the Serb as he dashed forward. Norrie, usually so mild-mannered, spun around in delight to further illustrate the magnitude of the occasion. After a nervy service game meant he could not consolidate the break, Norrie soon led again and that was helped by Djokovic's own edginess. Two more uncharacteristic errors from Djokovic, smacking two forehands from the baseline long, enabled Norrie to break again and move 3-2 ahead. This time Norrie did hold serve to consolidate the break, more errors from Djokovic's racquet culminating in a forehand into the net. Another break for 5-2 left Norrie serving for the set and, after two double faults including one on set point, he hammered down an ace to seal the opener. That created an jubilant atmosphere, perhaps also with a tinge of disbelief, among the optimistic home fans. Hewett into Wimbledon final after superb fightback 'My family can't come to watch Wimbledon final' - Jabeur column This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Djokovic booed for blowing kiss at crowd after Norrie win Still, there was a feeling among the realists that Djokovic could not continue playing that badly and giving opportunities to his opponent. That proved to be true as the defending champion improved his level. Returning to the sun-filled court with a cap for the start of the second set, Djokovic served better and only dropped one point in his first four service games. More pressure began to build on Norrie's serve and as a result that drew more mistakes from the Briton, particularly on his forehand. Djokovic finally took his fourth break point of the set for a 5-3 lead when Norrie hit a forehand long, but the damage was done by missing a volley which he would expect to put away for 15-30. Norrie started the third set by winning a point which left Djokovic clapping his strings but the game quickly switched into the Serb's favour. Djokovic took a third break point to move ahead in the match for the first time and, after winning seven of the next nine games, it looked unlikely Norrie would be able to fight back to win. He served out victory to put himself into an eighth Wimbledon men's final, a tally only bettered by Roger Federer's 12 appearances there. This video can not be played Djokovic predicts 'fireworks' against Kyrgios It is also his 32nd Grand Slam final overall, moving him one clear of Federer as a men's record. ""Of course I've had many Grand Slam semi-finals but it is never easy walking out on court,"" said Djokovic. ""You have a lot of pressure and expectations, from yourself and others. ""I was a bit tighter at the beginning of the match. Cameron was dominating the play and I felt like I got lucky in the second set to break his serve. ""He kind of gifted me a game and since then the momentum shifted a bit. That's the significance of the semi-finals of a Grand Slam.""

"Energy bills forecast to hit Â£3,363 this winter","Typical domestic energy bills could hit more than Â£3,300 a year this winter, according to the latest forecasts. Consultancy Cornwall Insight said the typical gas and electricity bill in England, Wales and Scotland could reach Â£3,363 in the new year. The prediction comes as suppliers and consumer groups agreed a plan that could lead to a dedicated hotline and debt support for struggling households. A set of government payments to help with bills starts to be paid next week. However, there were calls for the government to do more to support families during the coming winter. When will households get the Â£400 energy grant? Cornwall Insight said that the typical domestic customer was likely to pay Â£3,244 a year from October, then Â£3,363 a year from January. The typical bill at present is about Â£2,000 a year. Dr Craig Lowrey, principal consultant, said: ""There is always some hope that the market will stabilise and retreat in time for the setting of the January [price] cap. ""However, with the announcement of the October cap only a month away, the high wholesale prices are already being baked in to the figure, with little hope of relief from the predicted high energy bills."" Earlier this week, a meeting was held between a host of energy companies - including British Gas, the UK's largest supplier - and consumer groups. They agreed to explore various proposals including: The introduction of a priority call line to ensure people receive all the help to which they are entitled Appeals to shift the burden of bills away from thestanding charge An agreement for a blueprint on how to deal with customers who cannot pay their bill A new universal tool to outline what assistance is available for people in certain circumstances The group also agreed to provide clear information about who should read their meter and when in the build up to bills rising in October. Last time bills for millions of people changed, there werewidespread problemsas suppliers' online tools were unable to cope with demand. Martin Lewis, founder of Money Saving Expert, who called the meeting, said: ""Far more is needed, and that must come from a functioning government. ""This winter will be catastrophic, the hideous spikes in wholesale energy will translate by October into [regulator] Ofgem setting a price cap for a typical bill of around Â£3,000 a year - close to four times what some paid just two years go. It will push millions into poverty."" Earlier this week, documents seen by the BBC showed how households were likely to pay at least Â£3,000 a year from October. The energy price cap, which applies in England, Wales and Scotland, sets a limit on the amount that can be paid for each unit of energy. While the official figure is due to be announced next month by Ofgem, the period over which it is assessed is now almost complete. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April, with a further squeeze on incomes from the rising cost of living, as inflation hit 9.1% -the highest in 40 years. Rising wholesale energy prices, paid by suppliers, have been driven by volumes of Russian gas exports going down, the closure of a key gas export facility in the USA, and a fall in the value of the pound.

We're ending our live coverage now, thanks for joining us today in the wake of a frantic week in UK politics. You can keep up with the latest developments on the Conservative Party leadership contesthere. We'll be ending our coverage of the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader (and prime minister) shortly. Here is a recap of what's been happening today: After today's news that early bookies' favourite Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the running, it's worth reminding you where things currently stand. Rishi Sunak,Tom
Tugendhat,Suella BravermanandKemi Badenochhave confirmed they will stand, whileSajid Javid,Grant ShappsandJeremy Huntsay they
are considering running. Steve Baker, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, James Cleverly and Matt Hancock have
all ruled themselves out. Other possible candidates includePenny Mordauntand Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss. So who are the bookmakers' favourites? Oddschecker collates the odds from a number of  bookies - here's the latest. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent It's recently looked like Ben Wallace was in a particularly strong
position. The defence secretary is popular with grassroots Conservatives. He's been topping
surveys that the website Conservative Home runs of party members. Given they're the electorate that will ultimately choose the
next prime minister, he seemed like a candidate who could get all the way to
No 10 if he wanted to. But he's decided it's not for him. He gave it consideration, but
ultimately says he wants to focus on his current job. The big question now, is who he will endorse? Any candidate
getting him on board would likely get a big boost. I suspect he'll be fielding a few phone calls
from other leadership hopefuls this afternoon. Andrea Jenkyns raised her middle finger as she went through the gates of Downing Street to hear Boris Johnson's resignation speech New education minister Andrea Jenkyns has said she "" should have shown more composure"" as she appeared to make a rude gesture while entering Downing Street. In a widely-shared video she is seen showing the crowd her middle finger while on her way to No 10. On Saturday, the leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer said he did not condone Ms Jenkyns' actions but he added that ""emotions were pretty raw"" on the day the clip was filmed. In a tweet Ms Jenkyns said that on that day a ""baying mob outside the gates were insulting MPs on their way in as is sadly all too common."" She said she had previously received abuse and death threats, two of which are currently being investigated by the police.

Wallace has been focused on support for the Ukrainian war effort against Russia More now on Ben Wallace declaring he won't contest the leadership race, which he says was made after ""careful consideration"" with colleagues and family members. The announcement will come as a surprise to some given that the defence secretary was the bookies' favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory Party leader. Oddschecker, which collates the odds from a number of bookies, had placed Rishi Sunak as the second favourite to lead the party, followed by Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss. So far, Sunak and Tugendhat have already declared their leadership bids, along with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. We are also expecting to hear from Sajid Javid, Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt in the coming days as the leadership race gathers pace. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, the bookies' favourite to become Boris Johnson's successor, has announced he is not running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Wallace says it was ""not an easy choice"", but his focus is on his current job as defence secretary and ""keeping this great country safe"". Allow Twitter content?

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak was one of the
first to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet this week, shortly after ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid - leading to a wave of ministerial resignations which culminated in the end of Mr Johnson's prime ministerial career.ï»¿ It appears Johnson is disappointed with the actions of his former right-hand man,
with a No 10 source telling me Rishi Sunak has a ""short memory"". Boris
Johnson's allies feel he's the reason the former chancellor became a household
name, with the PM giving him a significant promotion to run the Treasury in
2020. They expected more loyalty in return. Relationships
between prime ministers and chancellors can be famously difficult. It appears
Johnson and Sunak will now go down as a partnership that ended in bad blood. So what does
Boris Johnson do now? Prime minister's typically don't get involved in
leadership contests for their successor. But Johnson is not a typical
leader. He may stay
above the fray. But it's safe to say Rishi Sunak won't be getting his endorsement. Also on the airwaves this morning was Conservative MP Liam Fox, who argues former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is best placed to deal with the economic challenges facing the country. The ex-chancellor isthe most high profile figure so farto have entered the race. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fox  described him as ""an
outstanding individual"". ""What I want to see is somebody whoâs actually got a plan to
see the spending of the government controlled over time,"" the North Somerset MP added. ""What we canât do is continue to spend money we havenât got and
leave the burden on future taxpayers,"" he said. Mark Spencer is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, has said Rishi Sunak is the best candidate to replace Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, Spencer points out that during the Covid pandemic Sunak developed the furlough scheme and was responsible for saving ""millions of jobs"", adding ""that's a fantastic track record."" ""We have come out of Covid with one of the best economies in the G7 and I think that again is down to Rishi's management and I think that demonstrates he has got the experience and the ability to do the job."" There's been a suggestion this morning - from senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker - that the leadership contest could be wrapped up by early August, if the process is ""truncated"". We're expecting a timetable to be set out after the 1922 Committee meets on Monday afternoon to decide how to move forward. For now, we can guide you through the process with this graphic - as you'll see, there are quite a few hoops to jump through before a new leader, and therefore PM, is chosen. Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. For two months, the work of detectives in Durham hit the pause button on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of Labour, after he decided he would resign if he was fined, consistent with his demand that it should have meant the same for Boris Johnson. Sir Keir is relieved. But in the time it took for the police to reach a decision that allows him to draw the strongest contrast with the prime minister, Mr Johnson has resigned. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Sir Keir sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now Mr Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Mr Johnson may not present Sir Keir with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. Read more.  Rishi Sunak's bid is the lead story for most of Saturday's papers. The Timesdescribes Mr Sunak's three minute launch video - with the tag-line, ""Ready for Rishi"" - as ""slickly produced"" and says his launch stole a march on his rivals. The Daily Telegraphsays the former chancellor is widely considered the favourite but adds attacks on him from supporters of other candidates are mounting. The Financial Timesheadline is ""Sunak accused of treachery"", with the paper reporting allies of Boris Johnson are blaming him for triggering the prime minister's exit. The Guardiansays tax cuts are expected to feature heavily in what is likely to be a chaotic, and at times bitter, leadership race. ""Let Battle Begin"" is its headline. Read the full paper review here. Tom Tugendhat, the first Conservative MP to put himself forward, has set out what he believes the party needs under new leadership in a newspaper article. The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee says he hopes to ""deliver a fresh start"" as the party must ""act now to restore trust and repair integrity in British politics"" and ensure a ""clean slate"". Writing inThe Times Scotland,external, he says he wants to ""to unite the party around conservative principles, renewing our pursuit of economic growth and a strengthened Union"". He says: ""If we are to defeat Labour and the SNP-Green coalition, our party will need a fresh start under serious and tested leadership."" Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling and a former soldier,announced his bid yesterday. Staying with Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher has offered his thoughts on former chancellor Rishi Sunak's bid. He said Sunak is in a ""bind"" where he will have to defend
high taxes in the leadership contest. The MP for Wycombe said he was
a huge fan of Sunak's but said that he will
have to defend his recent tax policies. He added that he believes current tax
levels are doing more harm than good. MP Steve Baker has ruled himself out of the Conservative leadership contest after previously suggesting he might consider a bid. The former Brexit minister is instead backing Attorney General Suella Braverman for the top job. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Baker said he was being realistic in not running, adding that without cabinet experience, it would be difficult to make it to the final two candidates. ""As much as I would love to seriously run, I will get the prime minister I want with Suella,"" he said. Baker said she has ""fierce resolve"", ""great authenticity"", and possesses ""all the right Conservative values"". A senior Tory backbench MP says he anticipates the shortlist of two could known by 21 July when Parliament breaks for the summer. And speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Charles Walker said it's possible the winner could be chosen in less than a month. The timescale for the contest will be decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs. Sir Charles, a former joint acting chairman of the committee, urged the leadership candidates not to ""knock lumps out of each other"", adding those with ""no hope"" should drop out of the contest ""for the greater good"". ""I think we've got to get through the thinning process very, very quickly, he said. Sir Charles said the process of selecting a new Tory leader could be ""truncated"" by waiving regional hustings, but acknowledged this would favour the better known candidate. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the fourth person to announce a bid for leader of the Conservative party. The MP for Saffron Walden, who resigned her job earlier this week, says she wants to lead a government that will ""tell the truth"". Writingin the Times,external, she says ""without change the Conservative Party, Britain and the Western world will continue to drift"", adding that the nation needs a ""strong but limited government focused on the essentials"". Badenoch, who joins Rishi Sunak, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman in the leadership race, also hits out at ""identity politics"" and says Boris Johnson was ""a symptom of the problems we face, not the cause of them"". She says she supports lower taxes ""to boost growth and productivity, and accompanied by tight spending discipline"". You can read morehere.

Tesco and Heinz reach agreement in price row,"Tesco and Heinz have reached an agreement which will see some of the UK's best known products back on the supermarket chain's shelves in the coming days. Heinz beans and tomato ketchup were among the products that had disappeared from Tesco's shelves in a pricing row. Tesco declined to say whether those products would be going up in price due to the new agreement. The row reflects pressures on firms and suppliers as the cost of living soars. The dispute between Tesco and Kraft Heinz began at the end of June after the US giant tried to boost the prices it was charging the UK's largest supermarket. Kraft Heinz said at the time it was becoming more expensive to make its products. Baked beans, ketchup and tomato soup were among the staples that went missing from shelves in some Tesco stores after Heinz stopped supplying the retailer. But Tesco said on Friday that it had ""reached an agreement that will see the full range of Heinz products return to Tesco shelves and online"". ""Lorries full of Heinz products including Heinz Tomato Ketchup and Heinz Beanz will hit the road shortly, and Tesco colleagues will be working hard to ensure shelves are filled again over the coming days,"" Tesco said in a statement. ""It's great to be back together."" Last month, the Daily Telegraph reported that Heinz had wanted to charge 30% more to supply some products. A Tesco spokesperson declined to say on Friday how a deal had been agreed, and whether it would mean higher prices for customers. Food manufacturers have reported rising costs in recent months, including for energy and commodities, with some warning that they would need to raise the prices they charge to retailers. As well as Heinz, Tesco also fell out with Mars in a row over prices. This row - which is as yet unresolved - has led to the US food giant halting supplies of Whiskas pet food to the supermarket chain. Whiskas pet food off Tesco shelves after price row Ged Futter, who used to be an Asda executive and is now a director at consultancy The Retail Mind, said it was very likely that Tesco would have agreed to the price rises that Heinz wanted. ""[Tesco] has to have those products on its shelves,"" he said, because Heinz products are available from so many other retailers. He said Tesco was ""just encouraging shoppers to shop elsewhere"" by not having those products at a time when many customers were being squeezed by prices going up quickly. Mr Futter added that Mars was potentially in an even stronger bargaining position than Kraft Heinz, partly because the amount of pet food it sells to Tesco is only a very small part of its business. All food manufacturers are facing extreme price pressures, he said, with ""literally everything"" becoming more expensive. ""Packaging, cans, plastic for bottles, cardboard, paper for labels - all going up. All ingredients: food, fertiliser, and fuel - all going up."" This year, the price of fertiliser has increased from Â£150 per tonne to Â£1,000 per tonne, he said. It is not just big suppliers who are passing on costs - medium-sized and small firms are too, Mr Futter added. ""If they supply at the previous cost they will go bust.""

A shock killing that could change Japan forever,"Since news broke this morning ofShinzo Abe's shooting, messages have been pouring in from friends and contacts, all asking the same question: how could this have happened in Japan? I felt much the same myself. Living here you get used to not thinking about violent crime. The identity of the victim only makes the news more shocking. Shinzo Abe may no longer be Japan's prime minister, but he's still a huge figure in Japanese public life, and probably the most recognisable Japanese politician of the last three decades. Who would want to kill Abe? And why? I'm trying to think of an equivalent - of another act of political violence that would be similarly shocking to the local population. The one that comes to mind is the shooting of Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme in 1986. When I say people don't think about violent crime here, I'm not exaggerating. Yes, there are the Yakuza, Japan's famously violent organised crime gangs. But most people never come in to contact with them. Even the Yakuza shy away from guns because the penalties for illegal possession are just not worth it. Owning a gun in Japan is extremely difficult. It requires no criminal record, mandatory training, psychological evaluation, and extensive background checks including police interviewing neighbours. Consequently, gun crime virtually doesn't exist here. On average, there are fewer than 10 gun-related deaths in Japan each year. In 2017, there were just three. Little wonder then that much of the attention has been focused on the gunman and the weapon he used. Who is he? Where did he get the gun from? Japanese media is reporting that the 41-year-old is a former member of the country's self-defence forces, the equivalent of an army. But closer inspection shows he only spent three years in the navy. The gun he used is more curious. Pictures of it lying on the ground after the shooting show what looks like a home-made weapon. Two bits of steel pipe stuck together with black gaffer tape, with some sort of handmade trigger. It looks like something fashioned from plans downloaded off the internet. So, was this a deliberate political attack, or the act of a fantasist, someone who wanted to become famous, by shooting someone famous? So far, we don't know. The news has shocked a country that prides itself on public safety Japan has certainly had its share of political assassinations. The most famous was in 1960 when the leader of Japan's socialist party, Inejiro Asanuma, was stabbed in the abdomen by a right-wing fanatic wielding a samurai sword. Although right-wing extremists still exist in Japan, Abe, a right-wing nationalist, would be an unlikely target. In recent years, we have seen another type of crime becoming more common here. The quiet, lonely male with a grudge against someone or something. In 2019, a man set fire to a building housing a popular animation studio in Kyoto, killing 36 people. The man told police he had a grudge against the studio because it had ""stolen his work"". In another case in 2008, a disgruntled young man drove a truck into a crowd of shoppers in Tokyo's Akihabara district, then got out and started stabbing onlookers. Seven people were killed. Before carrying out the attack he had posted a message online saying, ""I will kill people in Akihabara"" and ""I don't have a single friend, I am ignored because I'm ugly. I am lower than trash"". It's not clear yet whether Abe's shooting fits in to the first or the second category. But it seems certain that the assassination will change Japan. Given how safe Japan is, security here is very relaxed. During election campaigns, like the ongoing one, politicians literally stand on street corners giving speeches and shaking hands with shoppers and passers-by. It's almost certainly why Abe's attacker was able to get so close and discharge the weapon he had cobbled together. That surely has to change after today.

PM's Chequers wedding party moved after criticism,"Boris and Carrie Johnson got married last year A wedding party for Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie will no longer be held at the prime minister's country house following criticism of the venue choice. Newspaper reports said plans had been made for a party at Chequers in July. A No 10 source told the BBC ""nothing had been 100% firmed up"" and an alternative location will now be used. Mr and Mrs Johnson were married in a low-key, private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral last year. At the time, a Downing Street spokesperson said the couple would celebrate again with family and friends during the summer this year, with their honeymoon also delayed until then. But plans for the wedding party came under scrutiny after Mr Johnson's dramatic resignation as Tory leader on Thursday following a rebellion by his own cabinet. A grace-and-favour mansion set in rural south-east England, Chequers is the official country residence of the UK prime minister. Owned by the Chequers Trust, the 16th-century Buckinghamshire manor house has an indoor swimming pool, hundreds of acres of lawns, and is used by prime ministers to entertain guests and host cabinet away days. Follow latest reaction to Boris Johnson's resignation Race to replace Boris Johnson begins Mr Johnson announced his resignation but intends to stay on as prime minister until a successor is elected in a process that could take months. Chequers is the official the country residence of the UK prime minister Some of his critics, including former Prime Minister John Major, have urged Mr Johnson to resign immediately, but he has remained as caretaker and appointed a new cabinet. A new Tory leader and prime minister is expected to be installed by the autumn, with Mr Johnson due to remain in office until that process has played out. Earlier, Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner suggested that Mr Johnson was only staying on because he wants ""a party at Chequers for his wedding"". She said Labour would bring a motion of no confidence in Parliament before summer recess, unless the Conservative Party forced Mr Johnson out immediately. Although the motion is likely to fail as it would need Tory support, Ms Rayner said ""the fact he's trying to cling on for the next couple of months is completely unacceptable"". One newly-appointed minister, Education Secretary James Cleverly, said he had heard about reports of plans to host the wedding party at Chequers in July and did not have a problem with it. ""I think that if that [the leadership succession process] is done by that point in time, I suspect that it would be a rather generous action of the new prime minister for that to go ahead,"" he told the BBC. ""Private functions like that do not impose a burden on the public purse."" Last year Mr Cleverly shared a photograph of the newlywed Johnsons enjoying their reception in the garden of Downing Street following the ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

Downing Street did not reveal how many guests were invited to the ceremony but 30 was the maximum number of attendees allowed under Covid-19 restrictions in England at the time. Mr Johnson, 58, has two children with Mrs Johnson, 34, and the prime minister has been married twice before. Mrs Johnson used to work in the Conservative Party press office and on Mr Johnson's successful campaign to be re-elected as mayor in London. The couple were first romantically linked by the media in early 2019. In February 2020,they revealed that they were engagedand that she was pregnant with their son, Wilfred,who was born in April 2020.

Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event.

Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

Race to replace Boris Johnson begins,"Jeremy Hunt lost to Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership contest in 2019 Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is considering a Tory leadership bid as the race to succeed Boris Johnson heats up following his dramatic resignation. Allies claim Mr Hunt is attracting a lot of support from Tory colleagues. Senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat and Attorney General Suella Braverman have already announced plans to stand. Mr Johnson was forced out as Tory leader after a cabinet revolt over his leadership but wants to stay on as PM until the party chooses a successor. Opposition parties and some Tories want him to go now - but that appears unlikely to happen and prime ministers have stayed on during leadership transitions in the past. He hasappointed a new cabinet line-up,replacing ministers that resigned in protest at his leadership, and has told them he will not ask them to make major policy decisions until a new leader is in place. Follow the latest updates on the race to succeed Johnson PM's Chequers wedding party moved after criticism Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said in an ""ideal world"" deputy PM Dominic Raab would take over for a few weeks but ""that ship has sailed"". ""We must now live with the fact that Boris Johnson will be prime minister until a successor can be voted on,"" Sir Geoffrey added. THE NEXT PM:Sunak, Truss and other potential candidates WHAT NOW?How a new leader is elected LOST SUPPORT:Five things that led to PM's downfall JOHNSON:The PM who broke all the rules VIDEO:Johnson's career in moments A timetable for the Tory leadership race is due to be confirmed next week and the new prime minister is expected to be in position by September. The Labour Party has threatened to try and unseat the PM immediately through a vote of no confidence, although this would need considerable support among Conservatives to succeed. Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner told the BBC ""the fact he's trying to cling on for the next couple of months is completely unacceptable"". Mr Hunturged Tory MPs to oust the prime minister in a party confidence vote last monthbut has not publicly commented on his leadership ambitions since Mr Johnson quit as party leader. A former health and foreign secretary, Mr Hunt ran for the Conservative leadership in 2019 and made the final two, before being beaten by Mr Johnson in the ballot of party members. The chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee Mr Tugendhat, launched his leadership bid by writing in theDaily Telegraph,externalon Friday, promising tax cuts and ""new energy and ideas"" for government. ""I have served before - in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister,"" said the former soldier, who has been a prominent critic of Mr Johnson. Attorney General Ms Braverman has already confirmed she will stand, while former Brexit minister Mr Baker said he was ""seriously"" considering running after being asked by people to do so. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps - who both revolted against Mr Johnson - are also considering leadership challenges. So too is Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, a bookmakers' favourite who is said to be taking soundings from Tory colleagues. In a tweet,external, Mr Wallace addressed speculation ""I'm going to be next prime minister"" by jokingly sharing a picture of an American former basketball player who shares his name. ""I'd vote for you!,"" Mr Wallace wrote. Meanwhile Conservative MPs Rehman Chishti and John Baron have told the BBC they were thinking about running for leadership of the party. ""We need leaders who best reflect modern Britain and can provide solutions to the challenges our nation is facing now,"" said Mr Chishti, a former barrister and UK trade envoy to Pakistan. In what could be a big field of candidates, other Tory MPs tipped to run include: Foreign Secretary Liz Truss Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak Home Secretary Priti Patel Trade minister Penny Mordaunt Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng More declarations are expected in the coming days, but some senior Tories have already said they will not be running, including former Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and former Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It may not surprise you to discover that Westminster is a postcode which doesn't suffer a deficit of ambition. The wannabes will fight a popularity contest among Tory MPs in the next few weeks, and should two of them be left at the end of that process, Conservative Party members will get the final say over the summer. Somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 people will be charged with selecting the next head of our government on our behalf. It is a safe bet the next prime minister will be a very different character to Boris Johnson. Given the manner and motivations behind his toppling, being seen to ooze integrity and revere truth are qualities all the candidates will aspire to illustrate. But beyond that there will be an intriguing debate about what it means to a Conservative in 2022. When a new leader assumes office, the political landscape will instantly shift. More from Chris Nearly 60 Conservative MPs have quit government roles in recent days at both senior and junior levels, raising doubts about the government's ability to function. Speaking to his newly appointed cabinet on Thursday, Mr Johnson promised he wouldnot use his remaining time in No 10 to make ""major changes of direction"". On Friday, the PM's spokesman said the government will focus on delivering pre-agreed policy and manifesto commitments and would not seek to make spending changes.

Prince Harry wins latest stage in Mail libel claim,"The Duke of Sussex has said the article in question caused him ""substantial hurt, embarrassment and distress, which is continuing"" Parts of a Mail on Sunday story about the Duke of Sussex's dispute over his security were potentially defamatory, a judge has said in an initial ruling. Prince Harry is suing Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) for libel over a February article about his legal battle with the Home Office. His barrister said the story falsely suggested he had ""lied"" and ""cynically"" tried to manipulate public opinion. But ANL said it contained ""no hint of impropriety"" and was not defamatory. The High Court ruling,externalis the first stage of the libel battle, which aims to establish what the article meant and what claims the newspaper group will have to defend. The court will decide after further hearings whether the duke's libel case succeeds or fails and why. High Court hearing for Prince Harry libel claim The story, published in the Mail on Sunday and online, referred to the Duke of Sussex's separate legal case against the Home Office over security arrangements when he and his family are in the UK. Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that the article meant Prince Harry was responsible for ""spinning the facts"" and misleading the public into thinking he had been offering to pay for police protection and was challenging a refusal by the government to allow him to do so. The article also maintained that court documents revealed the duke had only offered to fund the security arrangements after the legal battle began, and he had unjustifiably tried to prevent documents and witness statements in the case becoming public, the judge said. But he rejected claims by Prince Harry's legal team that the article meant the prince had ""lied"". Lawyers for the newspaper publisher had argued the focus of the article was on statements put out by the duke's ""PR machine"" rather than by Prince Harry himself. But the judge disagreed, saying that without further clarification, readers would believe statements made on the prince's behalf were approved by him. In a written statement to last month's preliminary hearing, Prince Harry said it had caused him ""substantial hurt, embarrassment and distress, which is continuing"". The latest libel ruling comes a day after a court heard Prince Harry faced ""significant tensions"" with a top aide to the Queen involved in downgrading his security. Harry faced tensions with royal officials - lawyer In that case, Prince Harry's lawyer said he had not been aware Sir Edward Young, the Queen's private secretary, played a role.

Mark Rowley announced as Met Police commissionerMark Rowley is returning to the Met Police to take the top job after four years in private industry.London,"Sir Mark Rowley will serve an initial five-year term, with an annual salary of just under Â£293,000 Sir Mark Rowley has been named as the new commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, taking over the role vacated by Dame Cressida Dick. Sir Mark, 57, served as head of the Met Police's counter-terrorism unit between 2014 and 2018, before leaving to take a role in private industry. Dame Cressidastood down as commissioner in Februaryfollowing a series of scandals. Sir Mark said he was ""deeply honoured"" to be appointed as commissioner. In a statement, he said: ""Our mission is to lead the renewal of policing by consent which has been so heavily dented in recent years, as trust and confidence have fallen. ""We will deliver more trust, less crime and high standards for London and beyond, and we will work with London's diverse communities as we together renew the uniquely British invention of 'policing by consent'."" Sir Mark will serve an initial five-year term, with an annual salary of just under Â£293,000. This video can not be played Sir Mark Rowley spoke to BBC Breakfast in April 2022 about the challenges facing police In 2018 he was knighted after leading the national police response to the Manchester Arena bombing, the Westminster Bridge attack and the London Bridge attack. Sir Mark began his police career as a constable in the West Midlands force in 1987, after graduating with a degree in mathematics from Cambridge University. Between 2008 and 2011, he was the chief constable of Surrey Police, before joining the Met to become the assistant commissioner for specialist crime and operations. Met needs root-and-branch reform, Sadiq Khan says Why is it so hard to fix the Metâs toxic culture? The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick Since leaving the Met Police, Sir Mark worked on security and policy projects includingcarrying out a review with the Commission for Countering Extremism,external. He first applied to be commissioner in 2017, losing out to Dame Cressida. Dame Cressida Dick resigned after Sadiq Khan criticised her handling of racist, misogynist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers The Met's first female commissioner resigned five months ago after Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said he had lost confidence in her leadership. The final months of her tenure were marked by a series of scandals, including themurder of Sarah Everardby a serving policeman and Dame Cressida's handling of racist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers at Charing Cross police station. The challenges facing Sir Mark Rowley as the UK's top police officer are enormous. One element of the package, counter-terrorism, will be the easiest for him to return to, thanks to his years of work in that field. The harder job is rebuilding trust in the Metropolitan Police which has been rocked by a series of scandals. Like his  predecessor, Dame Cressida Dick, he is academically thoughtful about the challenges of modern policing - but one of the key differences between the two of them is that Sir Mark has regularly thought not just about how to police - but how to communicate policing in order to build and maintain trust. His first priority will be to come up with an action plan to get the forceout of a form of special measuresimposed by national inspectors of policing standards. That close oversight is known in the jargon as ""engage"". But to win the trust of Londoners, Sir Mark knows he will have to find new and more effective ways of engaging with them too. Home Secretary Priti Patel said of the new appointment: ""I look forward to working closely with Sir Mark. ""This will be a challenging period, but with a focus on tackling neighbourhood crime and delivering the basics of policing, Sir Mark is committed to tackling the significant challenges confronting the force and to making London's streets safer by driving down crime and bringing more criminals to justice."" His appointment was broadly welcomed byformer Met Det Supt Shabnam Chaudhri, who said Sir Mark had ""a mountain to climb"" to rebuild trust in the force, but added it was ""really good"" he had recently been working outside of the Met, which meant he was ""completely fresh and untarnished"". Former shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said it was ""disappointing that Priti Patel and Sadiq Khan decided to bring back Mark Rowley from retirement"". The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MPsaid of Sir Mark,external: ""He spent much of his career in the Met. No evidence that he is a reformer. Missed opportunity.""

"Petrol pricing is cause for concern, warns watchdogThe UK's competition body launches an in-depth study of the market with fuel prices at record highs.BusinessComments","Petrol and diesel pricing will be investigated by the UK's competition watchdog after it found ""cause for concern in some parts"" of the industry. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it had discovered a sharp rise in prices once fuel had been processed by oil refineries. It also found ""significant differences in price"" between forecourts in ""many rural and urban areas"". However, it said retailers had passed on a 5p fuel duty cut to motorists. The initial review of the market by the CMA was requested by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng last month over concerns that retailers and forecourts were failing to implement the cut for consumers. The CMA's initial review found that ""on the whole the fuel duty cut appears to have been implemented"". However, the competition body will now immediately begin an in-depth study of the market amid record fuel prices. While oil prices are elevated due to Russia's assault on Ukraine, Brent crude - the international benchmark - is currently $104 a barrel, far below this year's peak of $128 reached in early March. But petrol and diesel prices remain at a record high, fuelling the cost of living which is rising at the sharpest pace for 40 years. The average price for a litre of petrol is now 191.43p, according to the RAC motoring association, taking the cost of filling an average sized 55-litre family car to Â£105.29. Average diesel prices have reached 199.05p a litre. The CMA said a main driver of rises was the growing gap between the price of crude oil before it goes into a processing plant compared to the price once oil refineries have processed it into petrol and diesel. The difference between crude oil and the wholesale price of petrol and diesel had tripled in the past year from 10p to nearly 35p per litre. The CMA said the increase accounts for over 40% - or 24p per litre - of the rise in fuel prices over the past year. Oil refiners turn crude oil into diesel, petrol and other products. Refineries cash in as petrol prices soar Fuel prices: Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? ""While there is no escaping the global pressures pushing up fuel prices, the growing gap between the oil price, and the wholesale price of petrol and diesel, is a cause for concern,"" said Sarah Cardell, general counsel at the CMA. ""We now need to get to the bottom of whether there are legitimate reasons for this and, if not, what action can be taken to address it."" She added: ""On the whole the retail market does seem to be competitive, but there are some areas that warrant further investigation. These include finding out whether the disparities in price between urban and rural areas are justified."" By Caroline Davies, BBC business correspondent Fuel prices are at record highs, but are some parts of the market making it worse? The CMA was originally asked to see if retailers significantly added to the problem. The answer from today's report is mostly it doesn't think so - the fuel duty cut the government implemented has been passed on, for instance - although the CMA is going to dig in further. Now it is looking a bit higher up the chain to see if oil refineries are causing a problem; is the big difference between the amount they pay for crude oil and the amount they sell it for wholesale legitimate? The CMA has suggested some measures like requiring petrol stations to share data on current prices to help transparency and costs now. While there's an appreciation by groups like the RAC that thorough and fair reports take time, there's also frustration too. A review following a review is not necessarily what drivers who are feeling the pinch now want. The AA's Jack Cousens said that while the motoring association welcomed the probe into road fuel pricing it felt that the problem ""is not the gap between the oil price and wholesale price feeding through to the forecourts but the length of time it takes for that wholesale price to be reflected at the pump"". ""The fuel trade has no trouble in passing on rising costs to the customer but lags badly in passing on savings. It has been labelled 'rocket and feather' pricing, and it exists."" But the CMA said that its review found that the difference between wholesale petrol and diesel prices and what forecourts charge for fuel ""has not been a significant contributor to the overall rise in pump prices"". Gordon Balmer, executive director of the Petrol Retailers Association said: ""In recent months, we have seen motoring organisations and politicians attempting to scapegoat petrol retailers. ""This report exonerates petrol retailers and leaves unanswered questions about the extent to which these critics understand the retail fuel market at all."" In its initial review, the CMA found that ""motorists face higher prices in some parts of the UK than in others"". It said fuel price competition usually takes place at a local level, meaning that retailers will set prices based on what local rivals are charging, ""and work to the benefit of motorists"". If there are few competitors in one area, then drivers could end up paying more for their fuel. The CMA said: ""A competitive retail fuel market can be particularly important to rural communities, which tend to be more reliant on cars as a means of transport."" It said rural areas pay on average 1p-2p per litre more for road fuel: ""Although in some areas the difference will be substantially more."" Although the CMA found that on the whole retailers appear to have passed on the 5p cut in fuel duty, some MPs are calling for an additional tax cut. Motorists pay both fuel duty and 20% VAT on petrol and diesel. ""Urgent action needs to be taken,"" Conservative MP Robert Halfon told the BBC. ""The government needs to slash either VAT or fuel duty and to ensure that that cut is passed on to motorists at the pump. ""So not only do we need to cut taxes because motorists are being fleeced by the government and by the oil companies, they need to make sure there is a pump watch, a regulator so there is fair competition at the pumps, so that any tax cut is passed through to the motorist."" Tax will be a key issue among those competing to replace Prime Minister Boris Johnson as leader of the Conservative party after he resigned on Thursday. But it is expected to take some weeks to find his replacement and it is not clear if key policy decisions, such a tax cuts, will be made during this period.

LiveLiveJapan's ex-leader Shinzo Abe assassinated while giving speech,"The suspect in the assassination of Shinzo Abe used a handmade gun to kill Japan's former PM, police say Officers said they found several handmade weapons at the home of the suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, 41 Abe, 67, was shot at twice from behind while giving a campaign speech in southern Japan, suffering wounds to his neck and chest He was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead about five hours later at 5pm local time Japan's current prime minister, Fumio Kishida, says he is ""lost for words"", describing Abe as a ""personal friend"" Abe - in office in 2006-07 and 2012-20 - remains the country's longest-serving PM and best-known political figure internationally Global leaders are reacting with shock; PM Boris Johnson says the UK stands with the Japanese people at a ""sad and dark time"" Edited by Alex Therrien and Emma Owen We're wrapping up our live coverage now. If you want to read our news story about the day's events, it'shere. Our visual guide to how the day unfolded, detailed articles on Shinzo Abe's life and legacy, video clips and more can be find on our topic page -here. Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

The legacy of Japan's longest-serving PM,"Japanese PM Shinzo Abe wielded influence on domestic politics even after stepping down Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as ""Abenomics"". A highly popular, and a highly controversial politician, the 67-year-old Abe led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to victory twice. His shocking death harkens back to images of the violent days in pre-war Japanese politics, when political assassinations were, if not commonplace, not unheard of. A string of political assassinations were part of Japan's march towards WWII. As a popular and divisive politician, it was part of his trade to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Abe knew from childhood that those masses are not always friendly, and that he had to fight back against criticism. Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Shinzo Abe when he announced his resignation in 2020 Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. When he stepped down after weeks of speculation, he revealed he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis. He was succeeded by close party ally Yoshihide Suga, but was still seen as a powerful figure in Japanese politics. As the son of former foreign minister Shintaro Abe and grandson of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe was born into a political dynasty. He felt his mission was to continue the task of his ancestors - to make Japan strong, great, and a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. He looked up to Kishi, who strove to strengthen Japan's economic rule over China and Manchuria during World War II, and then was instrumental in creating the political dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe's aversion to protesters may have its roots in how his revered grandfather was driven from power, following a huge anti-government protest in 1960. Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993, and in 2005 he became chief cabinet secretary. His rise to the top came swiftly as he became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister in 2006. Mr Abe, picture here after being elected for the first time in 2006, hailed from a political family But a series of scandals - including the government's loss of pension records, affecting about 50 million claims - hit his administration hard. A heavy loss for the LDP followed in upper house elections in July 2007, and in September of that year he resigned due to ulcerative colitis. But then in 2012, Abe returned as prime minister, saying that he had overcome the disease with the help of medication. He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2017, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister. His popularity fluctuated, but he remained largely unchallenged due to his influence in the LDP, which amended its rules to allow him to serve a third term as party leader. With his hawkish stance on defence and foreign policy, Abe repeated the importance of being an equal ally and partner with the US and other Western powers. This fed into his long-held goal of revising Japan's post-war pacifist constitution so it could finally become a ""normal country"". Conservatives see the constitution - drafted by the US - as a reminder of the humiliating defeat of Japanese troops in WWII. The influence of his grandfather also fed into Abe's wariness of China emerging as the dominant force in Asia, reinforcing his conviction that Japan needed to pull its weight and become a military force to defend itself. These nationalistic and militaristic platforms were deeply divisive, horrifying parts of the population who cherish the pacifist constitution, while giving voice and even credibility to those blatant revisionist and nationalist groups and sentiments which for a long time in post-war Japan used to be a minority and only spoken in hushed tones. His nationalist views have often raised tensions with China and South Korea, particularly after his 2013 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site linked to Japan's militarism before and during WWII. Repeated visits also irked left-wing factions in Japan, who viewed it as an attempt by Abe to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the war. Shinzo Abe's visit to Yasukuni sparked anger In 2015, he pushed for the right to collective self-defence, enabling Japan to mobilise troops overseas to defend itself and allies under attack. Despite opposition from Japan's neighbours and even the Japanese public, Japan's parliament approved this controversial change. His larger goal of revising the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military remains unfulfilled, and continues to be a divisive topic in the country. He was also unable to secure the return of what Japan refers to as the Northern Territories - a chain of disputed islands off the northern prefecture of Hokkaido that are claimed by both Japan and Russia. Abe's rapport with former US president Donald Trump was credited with shielding Japan from crippling US-led trade tariffs, and having to fork out more money to support the presence of US troops in the country. He spearheaded""Abenomics"" policies, a comprehensive policy package aimed at making Japan strong by reviving the economy from the doldrums of deflation, while maintaining fiscal discipline. The popularity of these policies led to Abe and the LDP's return to power in 2012. But his efforts faced a major challenge when the country again went into recession in the spring of 2020. That and other slowdowns raised questions about the effectiveness of his approach. Abe appeared onstage dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games Abe's popularity was further hit by concerns over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics believe his campaigns aimed at boosting domestic tourism contributed to a resurgence of infections. They also say other promises of Abenomics  - such as empowering women in the workforce, tackling nepotism and changing unhealthy work cultures - remained unfulfilled. Internationally, he has been credited with holding the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a massive trade agreement between 11 countries - together, following an abrupt withdrawal by the US under Mr Trump's administration. Abe's resignation announcement led to an internal struggle among LDP factions, because he declined to name a successor. He was eventually succeeded by Yoshihide Suga. But Abe continued to hold sway over domestic politics in Japan, even after Suga was replaced by current prime minister Fumio Kishida. On 8 July, Abe was in the southern city of Nara campaigning on behalf of a candidate running for Japan's upper house. He was delivering a speech when he was shot by a gunman - a 41-year-old who is believed to be a former member of the Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of a navy. According to NHK and other news reports, the suspect said he was ""dissatisfied with Abe"" but that ""it has nothing to with political grudges"". Abe was conscious when taken to hospital, but died later from his injuries. He leaves his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ who he married in 1987.

If you want to read our news story about the day's events, it'shere. Our visual guide to how the day unfolded, detailed articles on Shinzo Abe's life and legacy, video clips and more can be find on our topic page -here. Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

We're ending our live coverage now, thanks for joining us today in the wake of a frantic week in UK politics. You can keep up with the latest developments on the Conservative Party leadership contesthere. We'll be ending our coverage of the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader (and prime minister) shortly. Here is a recap of what's been happening today: After today's news that early bookies' favourite Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the running, it's worth reminding you where things currently stand. Rishi Sunak,Tom
Tugendhat,Suella BravermanandKemi Badenochhave confirmed they will stand, whileSajid Javid,Grant ShappsandJeremy Huntsay they
are considering running. Steve Baker, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, James Cleverly and Matt Hancock have
all ruled themselves out. Other possible candidates includePenny Mordauntand Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss. So who are the bookmakers' favourites? Oddschecker collates the odds from a number of  bookies - here's the latest. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent It's recently looked like Ben Wallace was in a particularly strong
position. The defence secretary is popular with grassroots Conservatives. He's been topping
surveys that the website Conservative Home runs of party members. Given they're the electorate that will ultimately choose the
next prime minister, he seemed like a candidate who could get all the way to
No 10 if he wanted to. But he's decided it's not for him. He gave it consideration, but
ultimately says he wants to focus on his current job. The big question now, is who he will endorse? Any candidate
getting him on board would likely get a big boost. I suspect he'll be fielding a few phone calls
from other leadership hopefuls this afternoon. Andrea Jenkyns raised her middle finger as she went through the gates of Downing Street to hear Boris Johnson's resignation speech New education minister Andrea Jenkyns has said she "" should have shown more composure"" as she appeared to make a rude gesture while entering Downing Street. In a widely-shared video she is seen showing the crowd her middle finger while on her way to No 10. On Saturday, the leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer said he did not condone Ms Jenkyns' actions but he added that ""emotions were pretty raw"" on the day the clip was filmed. In a tweet Ms Jenkyns said that on that day a ""baying mob outside the gates were insulting MPs on their way in as is sadly all too common."" She said she had previously received abuse and death threats, two of which are currently being investigated by the police. ""I had reached the end of my tether,"" she said, adding: ""I responded and stood up for myself...I should have shown more composure but am only human."" Readmore. Allow Twitter content?

Wallace has been focused on support for the Ukrainian war effort against Russia More now on Ben Wallace declaring he won't contest the leadership race, which he says was made after ""careful consideration"" with colleagues and family members. The announcement will come as a surprise to some given that the defence secretary was the bookies' favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory Party leader. Oddschecker, which collates the odds from a number of bookies, had placed Rishi Sunak as the second favourite to lead the party, followed by Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss. So far, Sunak and Tugendhat have already declared their leadership bids, along with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. We are also expecting to hear from Sajid Javid, Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt in the coming days as the leadership race gathers pace. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, the bookies' favourite to become Boris Johnson's successor, has announced he is not running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Wallace says it was ""not an easy choice"", but his focus is on his current job as defence secretary and ""keeping this great country safe"". Allow Twitter content?

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak was one of the
first to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet this week, shortly after ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid - leading to a wave of ministerial resignations which culminated in the end of Mr Johnson's prime ministerial career.ï»¿ It appears Johnson is disappointed with the actions of his former right-hand man,
with a No 10 source telling me Rishi Sunak has a ""short memory"". Boris
Johnson's allies feel he's the reason the former chancellor became a household
name, with the PM giving him a significant promotion to run the Treasury in
2020. They expected more loyalty in return. Relationships
between prime ministers and chancellors can be famously difficult. It appears
Johnson and Sunak will now go down as a partnership that ended in bad blood. So what does
Boris Johnson do now? Prime minister's typically don't get involved in
leadership contests for their successor. But Johnson is not a typical
leader. He may stay
above the fray. But it's safe to say Rishi Sunak won't be getting his endorsement. Also on the airwaves this morning was Conservative MP Liam Fox, who argues former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is best placed to deal with the economic challenges facing the country. The ex-chancellor isthe most high profile figure so farto have entered the race. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fox  described him as ""an
outstanding individual"". ""What I want to see is somebody whoâs actually got a plan to
see the spending of the government controlled over time,"" the North Somerset MP added. ""What we canât do is continue to spend money we havenât got and
leave the burden on future taxpayers,"" he said. Mark Spencer is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, has said Rishi Sunak is the best candidate to replace Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, Spencer points out that during the Covid pandemic Sunak developed the furlough scheme and was responsible for saving ""millions of jobs"", adding ""that's a fantastic track record."" ""We have come out of Covid with one of the best economies in the G7 and I think that again is down to Rishi's management and I think that demonstrates he has got the experience and the ability to do the job."" There's been a suggestion this morning - from senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker - that the leadership contest could be wrapped up by early August, if the process is ""truncated"". We're expecting a timetable to be set out after the 1922 Committee meets on Monday afternoon to decide how to move forward. For now, we can guide you through the process with this graphic - as you'll see, there are quite a few hoops to jump through before a new leader, and therefore PM, is chosen. Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. For two months, the work of detectives in Durham hit the pause button on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of Labour, after he decided he would resign if he was fined, consistent with his demand that it should have meant the same for Boris Johnson. Sir Keir is relieved. But in the time it took for the police to reach a decision that allows him to draw the strongest contrast with the prime minister, Mr Johnson has resigned. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Sir Keir sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now Mr Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Mr Johnson may not present Sir Keir with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. Read more.  Rishi Sunak's bid is the lead story for most of Saturday's papers. The Timesdescribes Mr Sunak's three minute launch video - with the tag-line, ""Ready for Rishi"" - as ""slickly produced"" and says his launch stole a march on his rivals. The Daily Telegraphsays the former chancellor is widely considered the favourite but adds attacks on him from supporters of other candidates are mounting. The Financial Timesheadline is ""Sunak accused of treachery"", with the paper reporting allies of Boris Johnson are blaming him for triggering the prime minister's exit. The Guardiansays tax cuts are expected to feature heavily in what is likely to be a chaotic, and at times bitter, leadership race. ""Let Battle Begin"" is its headline. Read the full paper review here. Tom Tugendhat, the first Conservative MP to put himself forward, has set out what he believes the party needs under new leadership in a newspaper article. The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee says he hopes to ""deliver a fresh start"" as the party must ""act now to restore trust and repair integrity in British politics"" and ensure a ""clean slate"". Writing inThe Times Scotland,external, he says he wants to ""to unite the party around conservative principles, renewing our pursuit of economic growth and a strengthened Union"". He says: ""If we are to defeat Labour and the SNP-Green coalition, our party will need a fresh start under serious and tested leadership."" Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling and a former soldier,announced his bid yesterday. Staying with Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher has offered his thoughts on former chancellor Rishi Sunak's bid. He said Sunak is in a ""bind"" where he will have to defend
high taxes in the leadership contest. The MP for Wycombe said he was
a huge fan of Sunak's but said that he will
have to defend his recent tax policies. He added that he believes current tax
levels are doing more harm than good. MP Steve Baker has ruled himself out of the Conservative leadership contest after previously suggesting he might consider a bid. The former Brexit minister is instead backing Attorney General Suella Braverman for the top job. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Baker said he was being realistic in not running, adding that without cabinet experience, it would be difficult to make it to the final two candidates. ""As much as I would love to seriously run, I will get the prime minister I want with Suella,"" he said. Baker said she has ""fierce resolve"", ""great authenticity"", and possesses ""all the right Conservative values"". A senior Tory backbench MP says he anticipates the shortlist of two could known by 21 July when Parliament breaks for the summer. And speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Charles Walker said it's possible the winner could be chosen in less than a month. The timescale for the contest will be decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs. Sir Charles, a former joint acting chairman of the committee, urged the leadership candidates not to ""knock lumps out of each other"", adding those with ""no hope"" should drop out of the contest ""for the greater good"". ""I think we've got to get through the thinning process very, very quickly, he said. Sir Charles said the process of selecting a new Tory leader could be ""truncated"" by waiving regional hustings, but acknowledged this would favour the better known candidate. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the fourth person to announce a bid for leader of the Conservative party. The MP for Saffron Walden, who resigned her job earlier this week, says she wants to lead a government that will ""tell the truth"". Writingin the Times,external, she says ""without change the Conservative Party, Britain and the Western world will continue to drift"", adding that the nation needs a ""strong but limited government focused on the essentials"". Badenoch, who joins Rishi Sunak, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman in the leadership race, also hits out at ""identity politics"" and says Boris Johnson was ""a symptom of the problems we face, not the cause of them"". She says she supports lower taxes ""to boost growth and productivity, and accompanied by tight spending discipline"". You can read morehere.

Hunt mulls Tory leadership bid as contest gets going,"Defence Secretary Ben Wallace rules himself out of the running for the leadership of the Conservative Party Wallace says he is concentrating on his current job and hopes the Tories ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues that we are all elected to address"" A No 10 source accuses leadership contender Rishi Sunak of having a ""short memory"" after Boris Johnson ""backed him to the hilt"". The ex-chancellor has launched his campaign, saying ""someone has to grip this moment and make the right decisions"" Former Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the latest Conservative MP to enter the Tory leadership race Attorney General Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, have also said they are running Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also expected to launch a bid, as are Liz Truss, Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi Edited by Jeremy Gahagan The defence secretary says he hopes the Conservatives can ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues"". We're ending our live coverage now, thanks for joining us today in the wake of a frantic week in UK politics. You can keep up with the latest developments on the Conservative Party leadership contesthere. We'll be ending our coverage of the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader (and prime minister) shortly. Here is a recap of what's been happening today: After today's news that early bookies' favourite Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the running, it's worth reminding you where things currently stand. Rishi Sunak,Tom
Tugendhat,Suella BravermanandKemi Badenochhave confirmed they will stand, whileSajid Javid,Grant ShappsandJeremy Huntsay they
are considering running. Steve Baker, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, James Cleverly and Matt Hancock have
all ruled themselves out. Other possible candidates includePenny Mordauntand Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss. So who are the bookmakers' favourites? Oddschecker collates the odds from a number of  bookies - here's the latest. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent It's recently looked like Ben Wallace was in a particularly strong
position. The defence secretary is popular with grassroots Conservatives. He's been topping
surveys that the website Conservative Home runs of party members. Given they're the electorate that will ultimately choose the
next prime minister, he seemed like a candidate who could get all the way to
No 10 if he wanted to. But he's decided it's not for him. He gave it consideration, but
ultimately says he wants to focus on his current job. The big question now, is who he will endorse? Any candidate
getting him on board would likely get a big boost. I suspect he'll be fielding a few phone calls
from other leadership hopefuls this afternoon. Andrea Jenkyns raised her middle finger as she went through the gates of Downing Street to hear Boris Johnson's resignation speech New education minister Andrea Jenkyns has said she "" should have shown more composure"" as she appeared to make a rude gesture while entering Downing Street. In a widely-shared video she is seen showing the crowd her middle finger while on her way to No 10. On Saturday, the leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer said he did not condone Ms Jenkyns' actions but he added that ""emotions were pretty raw"" on the day the clip was filmed. In a tweet Ms Jenkyns said that on that day a ""baying mob outside the gates were insulting MPs on their way in as is sadly all too common."" She said she had previously received abuse and death threats, two of which are currently being investigated by the police. ""I had reached the end of my tether,"" she said, adding: ""I responded and stood up for myself...I should have shown more composure but am only human."" Readmore. Allow Twitter content?

Wallace has been focused on support for the Ukrainian war effort against Russia More now on Ben Wallace declaring he won't contest the leadership race, which he says was made after ""careful consideration"" with colleagues and family members. The announcement will come as a surprise to some given that the defence secretary was the bookies' favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory Party leader. Oddschecker, which collates the odds from a number of bookies, had placed Rishi Sunak as the second favourite to lead the party, followed by Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss. So far, Sunak and Tugendhat have already declared their leadership bids, along with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. We are also expecting to hear from Sajid Javid, Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt in the coming days as the leadership race gathers pace. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, the bookies' favourite to become Boris Johnson's successor, has announced he is not running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Wallace says it was ""not an easy choice"", but his focus is on his current job as defence secretary and ""keeping this great country safe"". Allow Twitter content?

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak was one of the
first to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet this week, shortly after ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid - leading to a wave of ministerial resignations which culminated in the end of Mr Johnson's prime ministerial career.ï»¿ It appears Johnson is disappointed with the actions of his former right-hand man,
with a No 10 source telling me Rishi Sunak has a ""short memory"". Boris
Johnson's allies feel he's the reason the former chancellor became a household
name, with the PM giving him a significant promotion to run the Treasury in
2020. They expected more loyalty in return. Relationships
between prime ministers and chancellors can be famously difficult. It appears
Johnson and Sunak will now go down as a partnership that ended in bad blood. So what does
Boris Johnson do now? Prime minister's typically don't get involved in
leadership contests for their successor. But Johnson is not a typical
leader. He may stay
above the fray. But it's safe to say Rishi Sunak won't be getting his endorsement. Also on the airwaves this morning was Conservative MP Liam Fox, who argues former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is best placed to deal with the economic challenges facing the country. The ex-chancellor isthe most high profile figure so farto have entered the race. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fox  described him as ""an
outstanding individual"". ""What I want to see is somebody whoâs actually got a plan to
see the spending of the government controlled over time,"" the North Somerset MP added. ""What we canât do is continue to spend money we havenât got and
leave the burden on future taxpayers,"" he said. Mark Spencer is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, has said Rishi Sunak is the best candidate to replace Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, Spencer points out that during the Covid pandemic Sunak developed the furlough scheme and was responsible for saving ""millions of jobs"", adding ""that's a fantastic track record."" ""We have come out of Covid with one of the best economies in the G7 and I think that again is down to Rishi's management and I think that demonstrates he has got the experience and the ability to do the job."" There's been a suggestion this morning - from senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker - that the leadership contest could be wrapped up by early August, if the process is ""truncated"". We're expecting a timetable to be set out after the 1922 Committee meets on Monday afternoon to decide how to move forward. For now, we can guide you through the process with this graphic - as you'll see, there are quite a few hoops to jump through before a new leader, and therefore PM, is chosen. Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. For two months, the work of detectives in Durham hit the pause button on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of Labour, after he decided he would resign if he was fined, consistent with his demand that it should have meant the same for Boris Johnson. Sir Keir is relieved. But in the time it took for the police to reach a decision that allows him to draw the strongest contrast with the prime minister, Mr Johnson has resigned. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Sir Keir sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now Mr Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Mr Johnson may not present Sir Keir with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. Read more.  Rishi Sunak's bid is the lead story for most of Saturday's papers. The Timesdescribes Mr Sunak's three minute launch video - with the tag-line, ""Ready for Rishi"" - as ""slickly produced"" and says his launch stole a march on his rivals. The Daily Telegraphsays the former chancellor is widely considered the favourite but adds attacks on him from supporters of other candidates are mounting. The Financial Timesheadline is ""Sunak accused of treachery"", with the paper reporting allies of Boris Johnson are blaming him for triggering the prime minister's exit. The Guardiansays tax cuts are expected to feature heavily in what is likely to be a chaotic, and at times bitter, leadership race. ""Let Battle Begin"" is its headline. Read the full paper review here. Tom Tugendhat, the first Conservative MP to put himself forward, has set out what he believes the party needs under new leadership in a newspaper article. The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee says he hopes to ""deliver a fresh start"" as the party must ""act now to restore trust and repair integrity in British politics"" and ensure a ""clean slate"". Writing inThe Times Scotland,external, he says he wants to ""to unite the party around conservative principles, renewing our pursuit of economic growth and a strengthened Union"". He says: ""If we are to defeat Labour and the SNP-Green coalition, our party will need a fresh start under serious and tested leadership.""

Japan's ex-leader Shinzo Abe assassinated while giving speech,"The suspect in the assassination of Shinzo Abe used a handmade gun to kill Japan's former PM, police say Officers said they found several handmade weapons at the home of the suspect, Tetsuya Yamagami, 41 Abe, 67, was shot at twice from behind while giving a campaign speech in southern Japan, suffering wounds to his neck and chest He was rushed to hospital but was pronounced dead about five hours later at 5pm local time Japan's current prime minister, Fumio Kishida, says he is ""lost for words"", describing Abe as a ""personal friend"" Abe - in office in 2006-07 and 2012-20 - remains the country's longest-serving PM and best-known political figure internationally Global leaders are reacting with shock; PM Boris Johnson says the UK stands with the Japanese people at a ""sad and dark time"" Edited by Alex Therrien and Emma Owen We're wrapping up our live coverage now. If you want to read our news story about the day's events, it'shere. Our visual guide to how the day unfolded, detailed articles on Shinzo Abe's life and legacy, video clips and more can be find on our topic page -here. Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

Race to replace Boris Johnson beginsJeremy Hunt is among the Tory MPs considering a bid to be the next Tory leader and prime minister.UK PoliticsComments,"Jeremy Hunt lost to Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership contest in 2019 Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is considering a Tory leadership bid as the race to succeed Boris Johnson heats up following his dramatic resignation. Allies claim Mr Hunt is attracting a lot of support from Tory colleagues. Senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat and Attorney General Suella Braverman have already announced plans to stand. Mr Johnson was forced out as Tory leader after a cabinet revolt over his leadership but wants to stay on as PM until the party chooses a successor. Opposition parties and some Tories want him to go now - but that appears unlikely to happen and prime ministers have stayed on during leadership transitions in the past. He hasappointed a new cabinet line-up,replacing ministers that resigned in protest at his leadership, and has told them he will not ask them to make major policy decisions until a new leader is in place. Follow the latest updates on the race to succeed Johnson PM's Chequers wedding party moved after criticism Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said in an ""ideal world"" deputy PM Dominic Raab would take over for a few weeks but ""that ship has sailed"". ""We must now live with the fact that Boris Johnson will be prime minister until a successor can be voted on,"" Sir Geoffrey added. THE NEXT PM:Sunak, Truss and other potential candidates WHAT NOW?How a new leader is elected LOST SUPPORT:Five things that led to PM's downfall JOHNSON:The PM who broke all the rules VIDEO:Johnson's career in moments A timetable for the Tory leadership race is due to be confirmed next week and the new prime minister is expected to be in position by September. The Labour Party has threatened to try and unseat the PM immediately through a vote of no confidence, although this would need considerable support among Conservatives to succeed. Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner told the BBC ""the fact he's trying to cling on for the next couple of months is completely unacceptable"". Mr Hunturged Tory MPs to oust the prime minister in a party confidence vote last monthbut has not publicly commented on his leadership ambitions since Mr Johnson quit as party leader. A former health and foreign secretary, Mr Hunt ran for the Conservative leadership in 2019 and made the final two, before being beaten by Mr Johnson in the ballot of party members. The chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee Mr Tugendhat, launched his leadership bid by writing in theDaily Telegraph,externalon Friday, promising tax cuts and ""new energy and ideas"" for government. ""I have served before - in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister,"" said the former soldier, who has been a prominent critic of Mr Johnson. Attorney General Ms Braverman has already confirmed she will stand, while former Brexit minister Mr Baker said he was ""seriously"" considering running after being asked by people to do so. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps - who both revolted against Mr Johnson - are also considering leadership challenges. So too is Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, a bookmakers' favourite who is said to be taking soundings from Tory colleagues. In a tweet,external, Mr Wallace addressed speculation ""I'm going to be next prime minister"" by jokingly sharing a picture of an American former basketball player who shares his name. ""I'd vote for you!,"" Mr Wallace wrote. Meanwhile Conservative MPs Rehman Chishti and John Baron have told the BBC they were thinking about running for leadership of the party. ""We need leaders who best reflect modern Britain and can provide solutions to the challenges our nation is facing now,"" said Mr Chishti, a former barrister and UK trade envoy to Pakistan. In what could be a big field of candidates, other Tory MPs tipped to run include: Foreign Secretary Liz Truss Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak Home Secretary Priti Patel Trade minister Penny Mordaunt Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng More declarations are expected in the coming days, but some senior Tories have already said they will not be running, including former Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and former Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It may not surprise you to discover that Westminster is a postcode which doesn't suffer a deficit of ambition. The wannabes will fight a popularity contest among Tory MPs in the next few weeks, and should two of them be left at the end of that process, Conservative Party members will get the final say over the summer. Somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 people will be charged with selecting the next head of our government on our behalf. It is a safe bet the next prime minister will be a very different character to Boris Johnson. Given the manner and motivations behind his toppling, being seen to ooze integrity and revere truth are qualities all the candidates will aspire to illustrate. But beyond that there will be an intriguing debate about what it means to a Conservative in 2022. When a new leader assumes office, the political landscape will instantly shift. More from Chris Nearly 60 Conservative MPs have quit government roles in recent days at both senior and junior levels, raising doubts about the government's ability to function. Speaking to his newly appointed cabinet on Thursday, Mr Johnson promised he wouldnot use his remaining time in No 10 to make ""major changes of direction"". On Friday, the PM's spokesman said the government will focus on delivering pre-agreed policy and manifesto commitments and would not seek to make spending changes.

What world makes of exit,"Boris Johnson hosts G7 world leaders for a summit in Cornwall last year Boris Johnson's almost three years in Downing Street have included their fair share of turbulent world events: Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Covid pandemic and, of course, Brexit to name three. So how is his resignation being seen around the world? Our correspondents give us the views from their regions: Is the EU rubbing its hands with glee at Boris Johnson's downfall? Yes - but also no. Over the last 24 hours, I've been getting texts and calls from EU diplomats, filled with multiple question and exclamation marks. European media headlines drip disdain and incredulity at what they view as a political operabuffa(slapstick opera performance) currently unfolding in the UK. But the EU view has often been one of impatient disappointment that Mr Johnson lasted so long as prime minister. A number of European countries - particularly those in central and eastern Europe - are exceedingly grateful to Boris Johnson for his hardline stance on Russia, even before Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine. But they believe that to be a UK position that will hold even after he is no longer prime minister. This video can not be played Watch: Boris Johnson: A career in moments Few in mainland Europe will shed a tear when Mr Johnson goes. Politicians blame him for blustering his way through Brexit. They accuse him of failing to be honest with the British people about its true implications. Wholesale rejection of Mr Johnson's bill currently making its way through parliament, to unilaterally rewrite the international post-Brexit treaty on Northern Ireland, has managed to unite the normally bickering EU institutions: the Commission, Parliament and Council. That said, no one I've spoken to in Brussels sounds particularly hopeful as to who may eventually take over from Mr Johnson as UK prime minister. Most here say they view the plethora of resignations of Conservative ministers as self-interested career-saving attempts, rather than evidence they disagree with Mr Johnson's policies. Not even opposition Labour leader Keir Starmer talks about reversing Brexit, or noticeably softening it. The main EU hope expressed today is the same I heard immediately after the 2016 Brexit vote: EU politicians wish for a UK leader, they say, who has the political confidence to talk and negotiate with Brussels, rather than constantly playing to, and being distracted by, the political gallery at home. Read more from Katya here. Joe Biden and the Democrats in control of the US government are unlikely to be too distraught over Boris Johnson's fall from grace. Some, in fact, may celebrate the news that has made headlines across the US. In a statement released on Thursday to BBC US media partner CBS News, Mr Biden simply notes that the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK  ""remains strong and enduring"", never mentioning Mr Johnson by name. The embattled Brit didn't even get a ""we wish him best of luck in his future endeavours"". The American president has never appeared a fan of his British counterpart, disagreeing with him on the wisdom of Brexit and expressing particular concern for the difficult situation it has created for his ancestral homeland of Ireland. It is true that Mr Biden has relied on Mr Johnson as a steadfast ally in his attempts to rally a united European response to Russian aggression in Ukraine. And the two have worked together to counter rising Chinese influence in the Pacific. Boris Johnson and Joe Biden at last month's Nato summit in Madrid But to many Democrats, Mr Johnson and Donald Trump are political peas in a pod, with similar views on trade and immigration and similarly iconoclastic political instincts. By their logic, anything that is bad for Mr Johnson bodes ill for Mr Trump and his Republican allies. And anything that hurts Mr Trump is good for the Democrats. Mr Biden may want to take pause, however, as Mr Johnson's undoing could have less in common with Mr Trump's political disposition than with his own. Setting aside the litany of scandals that were the proximate cause of Mr Johnson's downfall, the British prime minister had seen his political standing eroded by issues bedevilling most Western democracies - economic uncertainty, surging inflation and social discord. No one - in the UK, US or elsewhere - has figured out an easy solution to these problems. And they all may eventually reap the whirlwind that public discontent with the status quo has sown. So while the American Left may welcome what it sees as Mr Johnson's final reckoning, his departure could be a harbinger of doom for those currently in power in the US, not for the Republicans on the sidelines or the man contemplating a political revival in Mar-a-Lago. For those keenly following British politics on the continent, a common thread is emerging from early reaction to news of Boris Johnson's resignation as party leader and prime minister in a few months' time: one of envy. Those who've taken to social media have lamented how uncommon it is in many African countries for a leader to step down from power or even for his party to force him to leave over a lack of performance. They've used his resignation to comment on the seeming lack of accountability of politicians in their own countries to the people they govern. It's important to add, however, that Mr Johnson has not been seen as a close friend of Africa during his term in office. It is perhaps to be expected that news of his leaving has been met with limited reaction. This is big news in places such as Australia, India, Malaysia and here in Singapore as well, of course - countries that have had historical links to the UK and inherited their parliamentary system as part of being previous colonies. And more than one commentator has asked the question: what kind of signal is the UK sending about the state of democracy to the rest of the world, when even after a number of his colleagues have asked for him to step down - ostensibly for the good of the country - the leader initially refused to go? Is this - many are wondering - the slow demise of the democratic system? There's also concern about how this might affect geopolitics, given the war in Ukraine, and whether this is a distraction in the West that again could take away from more pressing issues that Asian governments are concerned about - like the cost of living, inflation and the rising influence of China in the region.

Hospital buildings risky and need repair - bosses,"Some hospital leaders in England say they are ""living with risk"" every day, with buildings in urgent need of repair. According to NHS trust bosses, delays to funding allocations have stalled vital upgrade projects. Structural safety concerns caused the critical care unit at one trust to be temporarily closed and planned operations were stopped. The government said it was working closely with trusts on building plans. NHS Providers - which represent trusts in England - said one hospital is using temporary generators with no back-up. Another trust has installed props and steel beams in the maternity unit, making life very difficult for staff and mothers, according to hospital managers. The hospital leaders said the current political situation - with the government looking for a new leader - complicates matters. ""This kind of political paralysis and instability is deeply unhelpful for the NHS when we've got a whole range of critical decisions that need to be made not only in capital investments but also NHS pay,"" said NHS Providers chief executive Saffron Corder. The organisation added that the government's plan for 40 new hospitals in England by 2030 is ""on shaky ground"". The roof of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn is having to be supported by wooden and steel props A survey of members that are part of this new building programme suggests half are not confident the funding they have been allocated will be sufficient to deliver the project. A number of trusts were still awaiting the go-ahead for ""shovel ready"" projects, Ms Cordery said. The programme was ""already moving at glacial pace"" and a power vacuum at Westminster would be ""deeply unhelpful to trusts and their local communities who are waiting for decisions"". The 40 new hospitals election pledge, made by the Conservatives in 2019, has proved controversial, with debate over what a ""new hospital"" means. The Department of Health and Social Care says the definition encompasses: a major new clinical building on an existing site a new wing of an existing hospital a major refurbishment and alteration of a hospital building The National Audit Office (NAO) says it will start a value-for-money review of the new-hospitals programme later this year. What's happened to the 40 new hospitals pledge? Hospital uses buckets catch rain Gareth Davies, from the NAO, said he had noted comments about the implications of delay for increasing costs at a time of high inflation, and whether all the projects truly met the classification of ""new hospital"" One hospital boss not included in the plan suggested it would be cheaper over the next decade to build a new facility than continue propping up and trying to keep the current structure safe. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with NHS trusts in the programme on the development of their building plans. ""Each of the building projects will be new hospitals providing brand new, state-of-the-art facilities to ensure world-class provision of healthcare for NHS patients and staff by replacing outdated infrastructure.""

"Dylan's new Blowin' In The Wind sells for Â£1.5mA one-off re-recording of the star's 1963 classic sells in just four minutes, to an anonymous bidder.","Bob Dylan celebrates the 60th anniversary of his music career this year A one-off re-recording of Bob Dylan singing his 1963 classic Blowin' In The Wind has sold at auction for almost Â£1.5 million. The release is the first new studio recording of the song since Dylan wrote it in 1962 and was sold by Christie's in London on Thursday. Bidding lasted just four minutes - coincidentally the same as the running time of the song itself. The sale beat Christie's original estimate of Â£600,000 - Â£1 million. The name of the bidder has yet to be revealed. The auction house said it was ""pleased with the excellent result"". One-off Bob Dylan recording could sell for Â£1m 80 things you may not know about Bob Dylan Dylan 'beyond words' over Nobel Prize Dylan's new version of Blowin' In The Wind was presented on a unique ""Ionic Original"" disc  - a patented technology that promises to deliver higher quality audio than normal vinyl. The disc is made of aluminium, treated with a layer of nitrocellulose then coated with a sapphire and quartz gradient, but is playable on any regular turntable. It's the brainchild of Grammy-winning musician T Bone Burnett, who also produced and played on the new Dylan's recording. ""We recorded it live,"" he told the BBC earlier this week, ""and I think we did it in one take, if I'm not mistaken"". ""It felt holy. It always feels holy for me, playing with Bob."" Dylan delivers the lyrics with the hard-won wisdom of his 81 years, turning an angry young man's protest song into a more contemplative reflection on humanity's inability to learn from its mistakes. Unlike the original, he is backed by a small band, including Greg Leisz on mandolin and Don Was on bass. T Bone Burnett (pictured) and Bob Dylan have their signatures etched into the 10-inch disc However, few people will ever get to hear the song, as the disc was sold as a one-off physical object, meaning the buyer has no rights to distribute it. Burnett said he viewed the disc as ""an original handmade original piece of work"". ""We're only making one because that's the way we want to present this to the world. It's the equivalent of an oil painting."" He added that future one-offs could also be sold on the fine art market, to help support artists whose incomes have been slashed by streaming and falling CD sales. ""In time, as we're able to develop this market, every musician will have access to it and have a whole new way of earning a living. ""Musicians have been victims of the age of mechanical reproduction. Now, we are going back to the future, with one-off pieces of singular art.""

PM's Chequers wedding party moved after criticismBoris Johnson and his wife Carrie had reportedly been planning a wedding party at Chequers in July.UK Politics,"Boris and Carrie Johnson got married last year A wedding party for Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie will no longer be held at the prime minister's country house following criticism of the venue choice. Newspaper reports said plans had been made for a party at Chequers in July. A No 10 source told the BBC ""nothing had been 100% firmed up"" and an alternative location will now be used. Mr and Mrs Johnson were married in a low-key, private ceremony at Westminster Cathedral last year. At the time, a Downing Street spokesperson said the couple would celebrate again with family and friends during the summer this year, with their honeymoon also delayed until then. But plans for the wedding party came under scrutiny after Mr Johnson's dramatic resignation as Tory leader on Thursday following a rebellion by his own cabinet. A grace-and-favour mansion set in rural south-east England, Chequers is the official country residence of the UK prime minister. Owned by the Chequers Trust, the 16th-century Buckinghamshire manor house has an indoor swimming pool, hundreds of acres of lawns, and is used by prime ministers to entertain guests and host cabinet away days. Follow latest reaction to Boris Johnson's resignation Race to replace Boris Johnson begins Mr Johnson announced his resignation but intends to stay on as prime minister until a successor is elected in a process that could take months. Chequers is the official the country residence of the UK prime minister Some of his critics, including former Prime Minister John Major, have urged Mr Johnson to resign immediately, but he has remained as caretaker and appointed a new cabinet. A new Tory leader and prime minister is expected to be installed by the autumn, with Mr Johnson due to remain in office until that process has played out. Earlier, Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner suggested that Mr Johnson was only staying on because he wants ""a party at Chequers for his wedding"". She said Labour would bring a motion of no confidence in Parliament before summer recess, unless the Conservative Party forced Mr Johnson out immediately. Although the motion is likely to fail as it would need Tory support, Ms Rayner said ""the fact he's trying to cling on for the next couple of months is completely unacceptable"". One newly-appointed minister, Education Secretary James Cleverly, said he had heard about reports of plans to host the wedding party at Chequers in July and did not have a problem with it. ""I think that if that [the leadership succession process] is done by that point in time, I suspect that it would be a rather generous action of the new prime minister for that to go ahead,"" he told the BBC. ""Private functions like that do not impose a burden on the public purse."" Last year Mr Cleverly shared a photograph of the newlywed Johnsons enjoying their reception in the garden of Downing Street following the ceremony. Allow Twitter content?

Downing Street did not reveal how many guests were invited to the ceremony but 30 was the maximum number of attendees allowed under Covid-19 restrictions in England at the time. Mr Johnson, 58, has two children with Mrs Johnson, 34, and the prime minister has been married twice before. Mrs Johnson used to work in the Conservative Party press office and on Mr Johnson's successful campaign to be re-elected as mayor in London. The couple were first romantically linked by the media in early 2019. In February 2020,they revealed that they were engagedand that she was pregnant with their son, Wilfred,who was born in April 2020.

Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

The legacy of Japan's longest serving PM,"Japanese PM Shinzo Abe wielded influence on domestic politics even after stepping down Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as ""Abenomics"". A highly popular, and a highly controversial politician, the 67-year-old Abe led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to victory twice. His shocking death harkens back to images of the violent days in pre-war Japanese politics, when political assassinations were, if not commonplace, not unheard of. A string of political assassinations were part of Japan's march towards WWII. As a popular and divisive politician, it was part of his trade to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Abe knew from childhood that those masses are not always friendly, and that he had to fight back against criticism. Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Shinzo Abe when he announced his resignation in 2020 Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. When he stepped down after weeks of speculation, he revealed he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis. He was succeeded by close party ally Yoshihide Suga, but was still seen as a powerful figure in Japanese politics. As the son of former foreign minister Shintaro Abe and grandson of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe was born into a political dynasty. He felt his mission was to continue the task of his ancestors - to make Japan strong, great, and a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. He looked up to Kishi, who strove to strengthen Japan's economic rule over China and Manchuria during World War II, and then was instrumental in creating the political dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe's aversion to protesters may have its roots in how his revered grandfather was driven from power, following a huge anti-government protest in 1960. Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993, and in 2005 he became chief cabinet secretary. His rise to the top came swiftly as he became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister in 2006. Mr Abe, picture here after being elected for the first time in 2006, hailed from a political family But a series of scandals - including the government's loss of pension records, affecting about 50 million claims - hit his administration hard. A heavy loss for the LDP followed in upper house elections in July 2007, and in September of that year he resigned due to ulcerative colitis. But then in 2012, Abe returned as prime minister, saying that he had overcome the disease with the help of medication. He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2017, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister. His popularity fluctuated, but he remained largely unchallenged due to his influence in the LDP, which amended its rules to allow him to serve a third term as party leader. With his hawkish stance on defence and foreign policy, Abe repeated the importance of being an equal ally and partner with the US and other Western powers. This fed into his long-held goal of revising Japan's post-war pacifist constitution so it could finally become a ""normal country"". Conservatives see the constitution - drafted by the US - as a reminder of the humiliating defeat of Japanese troops in WWII. The influence of his grandfather also fed into Abe's wariness of China emerging as the dominant force in Asia, reinforcing his conviction that Japan needed to pull its weight and become a military force to defend itself. These nationalistic and militaristic platforms were deeply divisive, horrifying parts of the population who cherish the pacifist constitution, while giving voice and even credibility to those blatant revisionist and nationalist groups and sentiments which for a long time in post-war Japan used to be a minority and only spoken in hushed tones. His nationalist views have often raised tensions with China and South Korea, particularly after his 2013 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site linked to Japan's militarism before and during WWII. Repeated visits also irked left-wing factions in Japan, who viewed it as an attempt by Abe to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the war. Shinzo Abe's visit to Yasukuni sparked anger In 2015, he pushed for the right to collective self-defence, enabling Japan to mobilise troops overseas to defend itself and allies under attack. Despite opposition from Japan's neighbours and even the Japanese public, Japan's parliament approved this controversial change. His larger goal of revising the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military remains unfulfilled, and continues to be a divisive topic in the country. He was also unable to secure the return of what Japan refers to as the Northern Territories - a chain of disputed islands off the northern prefecture of Hokkaido that are claimed by both Japan and Russia. Abe's rapport with former US president Donald Trump was credited with shielding Japan from crippling US-led trade tariffs, and having to fork out more money to support the presence of US troops in the country. He spearheaded""Abenomics"" policies, a comprehensive policy package aimed at making Japan strong by reviving the economy from the doldrums of deflation, while maintaining fiscal discipline. The popularity of these policies led to Abe and the LDP's return to power in 2012. But his efforts faced a major challenge when the country again went into recession in the spring of 2020. That and other slowdowns raised questions about the effectiveness of his approach. Abe appeared onstage dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games Abe's popularity was further hit by concerns over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics believe his campaigns aimed at boosting domestic tourism contributed to a resurgence of infections. They also say other promises of Abenomics  - such as empowering women in the workforce, tackling nepotism and changing unhealthy work cultures - remained unfulfilled. Internationally, he has been credited with holding the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a massive trade agreement between 11 countries - together, following an abrupt withdrawal by the US under Mr Trump's administration. Abe's resignation announcement led to an internal struggle among LDP factions, because he declined to name a successor. He was eventually succeeded by Yoshihide Suga. But Abe continued to hold sway over domestic politics in Japan, even after Suga was replaced by current prime minister Fumio Kishida. On 8 July, Abe was in the southern city of Nara campaigning on behalf of a candidate running for Japan's upper house. He was delivering a speech when he was shot by a gunman - a 41-year-old who is believed to be a former member of the Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of a navy. According to NHK and other news reports, the suspect said he was ""dissatisfied with Abe"" but that ""it has nothing to with political grudges"". Abe was conscious when taken to hospital, but died later from his injuries. He leaves his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ who he married in 1987.

Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hospital buildings risky and need repair - bossesSome NHS buildings are unsafe and urgently need upgrading, trust bosses warn.HealthComments","Some hospital leaders in England say they are ""living with risk"" every day, with buildings in urgent need of repair. According to NHS trust bosses, delays to funding allocations have stalled vital upgrade projects. Structural safety concerns caused the critical care unit at one trust to be temporarily closed and planned operations were stopped. The government said it was working closely with trusts on building plans. NHS Providers - which represent trusts in England - said one hospital is using temporary generators with no back-up. Another trust has installed props and steel beams in the maternity unit, making life very difficult for staff and mothers, according to hospital managers. The hospital leaders said the current political situation - with the government looking for a new leader - complicates matters. ""This kind of political paralysis and instability is deeply unhelpful for the NHS when we've got a whole range of critical decisions that need to be made not only in capital investments but also NHS pay,"" said NHS Providers chief executive Saffron Corder. The organisation added that the government's plan for 40 new hospitals in England by 2030 is ""on shaky ground"". The roof of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn is having to be supported by wooden and steel props A survey of members that are part of this new building programme suggests half are not confident the funding they have been allocated will be sufficient to deliver the project. A number of trusts were still awaiting the go-ahead for ""shovel ready"" projects, Ms Cordery said. The programme was ""already moving at glacial pace"" and a power vacuum at Westminster would be ""deeply unhelpful to trusts and their local communities who are waiting for decisions"". The 40 new hospitals election pledge, made by the Conservatives in 2019, has proved controversial, with debate over what a ""new hospital"" means. The Department of Health and Social Care says the definition encompasses: a major new clinical building on an existing site a new wing of an existing hospital a major refurbishment and alteration of a hospital building The National Audit Office (NAO) says it will start a value-for-money review of the new-hospitals programme later this year. What's happened to the 40 new hospitals pledge? Hospital uses buckets catch rain Gareth Davies, from the NAO, said he had noted comments about the implications of delay for increasing costs at a time of high inflation, and whether all the projects truly met the classification of ""new hospital"" One hospital boss not included in the plan suggested it would be cheaper over the next decade to build a new facility than continue propping up and trying to keep the current structure safe. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with NHS trusts in the programme on the development of their building plans. ""Each of the building projects will be new hospitals providing brand new, state-of-the-art facilities to ensure world-class provision of healthcare for NHS patients and staff by replacing outdated infrastructure.""

The legacy of Japan's longest serving PMHow the attack unfoldedVideoVideoA gunshot is heard before Shinzo Abe collapsesAbe visit to Nara only confirmed on ThursdayVideoVideoVideo from the scene of the shooting,"Japanese PM Shinzo Abe wielded influence on domestic politics even after stepping down Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as ""Abenomics"". A highly popular, and a highly controversial politician, the 67-year-old Abe led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to victory twice. His shocking death harkens back to images of the violent days in pre-war Japanese politics, when political assassinations were, if not commonplace, not unheard of. A string of political assassinations were part of Japan's march towards WWII. As a popular and divisive politician, it was part of his trade to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Abe knew from childhood that those masses are not always friendly, and that he had to fight back against criticism. Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Shinzo Abe when he announced his resignation in 2020 Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. When he stepped down after weeks of speculation, he revealed he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis. He was succeeded by close party ally Yoshihide Suga, but was still seen as a powerful figure in Japanese politics. As the son of former foreign minister Shintaro Abe and grandson of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe was born into a political dynasty. He felt his mission was to continue the task of his ancestors - to make Japan strong, great, and a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. He looked up to Kishi, who strove to strengthen Japan's economic rule over China and Manchuria during World War II, and then was instrumental in creating the political dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe's aversion to protesters may have its roots in how his revered grandfather was driven from power, following a huge anti-government protest in 1960. Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993, and in 2005 he became chief cabinet secretary. His rise to the top came swiftly as he became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister in 2006. Mr Abe, picture here after being elected for the first time in 2006, hailed from a political family But a series of scandals - including the government's loss of pension records, affecting about 50 million claims - hit his administration hard. A heavy loss for the LDP followed in upper house elections in July 2007, and in September of that year he resigned due to ulcerative colitis. But then in 2012, Abe returned as prime minister, saying that he had overcome the disease with the help of medication. He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2017, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister. His popularity fluctuated, but he remained largely unchallenged due to his influence in the LDP, which amended its rules to allow him to serve a third term as party leader. With his hawkish stance on defence and foreign policy, Abe repeated the importance of being an equal ally and partner with the US and other Western powers. This fed into his long-held goal of revising Japan's post-war pacifist constitution so it could finally become a ""normal country"". Conservatives see the constitution - drafted by the US - as a reminder of the humiliating defeat of Japanese troops in WWII. The influence of his grandfather also fed into Abe's wariness of China emerging as the dominant force in Asia, reinforcing his conviction that Japan needed to pull its weight and become a military force to defend itself. These nationalistic and militaristic platforms were deeply divisive, horrifying parts of the population who cherish the pacifist constitution, while giving voice and even credibility to those blatant revisionist and nationalist groups and sentiments which for a long time in post-war Japan used to be a minority and only spoken in hushed tones. His nationalist views have often raised tensions with China and South Korea, particularly after his 2013 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site linked to Japan's militarism before and during WWII. Repeated visits also irked left-wing factions in Japan, who viewed it as an attempt by Abe to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the war. Shinzo Abe's visit to Yasukuni sparked anger In 2015, he pushed for the right to collective self-defence, enabling Japan to mobilise troops overseas to defend itself and allies under attack. Despite opposition from Japan's neighbours and even the Japanese public, Japan's parliament approved this controversial change. His larger goal of revising the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military remains unfulfilled, and continues to be a divisive topic in the country. He was also unable to secure the return of what Japan refers to as the Northern Territories - a chain of disputed islands off the northern prefecture of Hokkaido that are claimed by both Japan and Russia. Abe's rapport with former US president Donald Trump was credited with shielding Japan from crippling US-led trade tariffs, and having to fork out more money to support the presence of US troops in the country. He spearheaded""Abenomics"" policies, a comprehensive policy package aimed at making Japan strong by reviving the economy from the doldrums of deflation, while maintaining fiscal discipline. The popularity of these policies led to Abe and the LDP's return to power in 2012. But his efforts faced a major challenge when the country again went into recession in the spring of 2020. That and other slowdowns raised questions about the effectiveness of his approach. Abe appeared onstage dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games Abe's popularity was further hit by concerns over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics believe his campaigns aimed at boosting domestic tourism contributed to a resurgence of infections. They also say other promises of Abenomics  - such as empowering women in the workforce, tackling nepotism and changing unhealthy work cultures - remained unfulfilled. Internationally, he has been credited with holding the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a massive trade agreement between 11 countries - together, following an abrupt withdrawal by the US under Mr Trump's administration. Abe's resignation announcement led to an internal struggle among LDP factions, because he declined to name a successor. He was eventually succeeded by Yoshihide Suga. But Abe continued to hold sway over domestic politics in Japan, even after Suga was replaced by current prime minister Fumio Kishida. On 8 July, Abe was in the southern city of Nara campaigning on behalf of a candidate running for Japan's upper house. He was delivering a speech when he was shot by a gunman - a 41-year-old who is believed to be a former member of the Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of a navy. According to NHK and other news reports, the suspect said he was ""dissatisfied with Abe"" but that ""it has nothing to with political grudges"". Abe was conscious when taken to hospital, but died later from his injuries. He leaves his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ who he married in 1987.

Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

Theranos exec Sunny Balwani convicted of fraud,"Balwani's company was once worth $9bn (Â£7.5bn), but was based on blood testing technology that did not work Silicon Valley executive Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani has been found guilty of deceiving investors as part of a plot with ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes. He falsely and repeatedly claimed that their company, Theranos, had a device that could detect hundreds of diseases with a few drops of blood. Holmes was found guilty at a separate trial in January where she accused Balwani of abuse - which he denies. Both Holmes, 38, and Balwani, 57, will be sentenced by a judge in the autumn. Holmes is facing around 20 years in prison and is currently free on bail. Balwani also faces up to 20 years in prison as well as millions of dollars in restitution payments to his victims. Theranos was once worth $9bn (Â£7.5bn), but was based on blood testing technology that did not work. The verdict was read on the fifth day of jury deliberations at a courthouse in San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Balwani was found guilty of all 12 charges against him. Who is Sunny Balwani? During closing arguments on 21 June, prosecutors showed text messages sent by Balwani to Holmes. ""I am responsible for everything at Theranos,"" he wrote in 2015. ""All have been my decisions too."" Assistant US Attorney Jeffrey Schenk called the message an admission of guilt. ""He's acknowledging his role in the fraud,"" he said. Sunny Balwani was Theranos' number two. Holmes was the company's founder and leader. But Balwani ran the everyday operations of the company. He had no medical training to speak of, and some thought that might be enough to convince a jury that he simply did not understand that Theranos' technology didn't work. His lawyers also argued that he invested his own money in the company - why do that if he thought the technology was dud? But this set of verdicts makes him just as culpable, in some respects more culpable, for the Theronos scandal than Holmes. Holmes was convicted of four charges of fraud, Balwani of 12 counts. He was also convicted of defrauding patients, something Holmes avoided. It means that Balwani will now go down in history as front and centre in the Theranos saga. Here in Silicon Valley, execs at start-ups and tech companies will be looking on. They'll note that an executive was convicted of wider charges of fraud than the founder and chief executive. It sets an important legal warning to managers - it's not always the boss that shoulders the greatest burden of responsibility. The verdict also partly vindicates Elizabeth Holmes' legal team, who placed her on the witness stand to be cross-examined. A risky move that may have paid off. Theranos was once the darling of biotech and Silicon Valley. Holmes was able to raise more than $900m from investors, including billionaires like media magnate Rupert Murdoch and tech mogul Larry Ellison. The firm promised it would revolutionise the healthcare industry with a test that could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes with only a few drops of blood. But these claims began to unravel in 2015 after a Wall Street Journal investigation reported that its core blood-testing technology did not work. The three-month case against Balwani bore large similarities to the government's prosecutions of Holmes. Lawyers for Balwani argued that he was also duped by Holmes, after he joined the company and became chief financial officer in 2010. Before breaking up as the company fell apart in 2016, the couple went to great lengths to ensure that investors and employees were unaware of their romantic relationship. His lawyers pointed out that after investing $15m of his own money into Theranos, he never cashed out his stock options despite his investment rising to some $500m. Unlike Holmes, Balwani did not take the stand to testify in his defence. Holmes reportedly first met Balwani during a college trip to Beijing when she was 18. He was a 37-year-old South Asian immigrant who had made millions selling his software company before the dot-com bubble burst. Around the same time he met Holmes, he divorced his wife, a Japanese artist. Their relationship became a romantic one around the time that Holmes was starting Theranos. While Holmes was the face of the company, he was the businessman serving as the president and chief operating officer. ""Ms Holmes and Mr Balwani were partners in virtually everything,"" prosecutor Robert Leach said earlier in the trial. ""The defendant and Holmes knew the rosy falsehoods that they were telling investors were contrary to the reality within Theranos.""

Chris Mason: New leader will shift political landscapeWho could be the next prime minister?What happens now?Themâs the BreaksitcastWhat does Europe make of Boris Johnson's resignation?,"He climbed high and fell fast. Boris Johnson will be remembered as a convention-smashing, rule-bending, first name recognition prime minister. A man whose character strengths, in the eyes of many Conservative MPs, were also his weaknesses. Great at campaigning, poor at governing, many backbenchers found themselves reflecting. Standing at the lectern in Downing Street, Boris Johnson was forced to articulate that his imagined future had been crushed. The boy who dreamed of being ""world king"" ejected. A primary colours prime minister provoking colourful reactions to the near end: protesters just beyond the Downing Street gates screaming ""liar"", some of his most loyal MPs comparing his defenestration to the downfall of Lady Thatcher. Boris Johnson is now, he insists, a prime minister emasculated, fulfilling a duty rather than a bucket list of ambitions. His supporters are pointing to convention that departing prime ministers loiter until their replacement rolls up, rather than instantly skedaddle to make way for a caretaker PM. As a spectator to this noise from Westminster, you might ponder: why them and what next? Why them, that tiny collection of MPs, deciding who should govern and lead, so relatively soon after a big election win? Well, in a parliamentary democracy, for better or worse - as opposed to those countries with a presidency - our party leaders, and so our prime ministers, are chosen by their parties, (and affiliated trade unions in the case of the Labour Party) not the rest of us. It means the thinnest sliver of the country will get to decide who replaces Boris Johnson. The electorate will have the chance to endorse or reject the chosen one, but only at the next election. Who could be the next prime minister? What happens next? In pictures: The rise and fall of a prime minister It may not surprise you to discover that Westminster is a postcode which doesn't suffer a deficit of ambition. The wannabes will fight a popularity contest among Tory MPs in the next few weeks, and two of them should be left at the end of that process, Conservative Party members will have the final say. Over the course of the summer, somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 people will be charged with selecting the next head of our government on our behalf. It is a safe bet the next prime minister will be a very different character to Boris Johnson. Given the manner and motivations behind his toppling, being seen to ooze integrity and revere truth are qualities all the candidates will aspire to illustrate. But beyond that, there will be an intriguing debate about what it means to a Conservative in 2022. A Conservative in a high tax, high spending era. A Conservative in post-Brexit Britain, where neither main party at Westminster contests the fundamentals of the UK's departure from the EU, but where our relations with our nearest neighbours have not normalised since. When a new leader assumes office, the political landscape will instantly shift. Yes, they will have novelty and freshness, at least for a bit. But no electoral mandate to call their own. And the opposition parties will confront a new opponent. As the Boris Johnson era concludes, so too will there be new turf upon which the arguments of tomorrow will play out.

Shinzo Abe: The legacy of Japan's longest serving PM,"Japanese PM Shinzo Abe wielded influence on domestic politics even after stepping down Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as ""Abenomics"". A highly popular, and a highly controversial politician, the 67-year-old Abe led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to victory twice. His shocking death harkens back to images of the violent days in pre-war Japanese politics, when political assassinations were, if not commonplace, not unheard of. A string of political assassinations were part of Japan's march towards WWII. As a popular and divisive politician, it was part of his trade to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Abe knew from childhood that those masses are not always friendly, and that he had to fight back against criticism. Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Shinzo Abe when he announced his resignation in 2020 Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. When he stepped down after weeks of speculation, he revealed he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis. He was succeeded by close party ally Yoshihide Suga, but was still seen as a powerful figure in Japanese politics. As the son of former foreign minister Shintaro Abe and grandson of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe was born into a political dynasty. He felt his mission was to continue the task of his ancestors - to make Japan strong, great, and a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. He looked up to Kishi, who strove to strengthen Japan's economic rule over China and Manchuria during World War II, and then was instrumental in creating the political dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe's aversion to protesters may have its roots in how his revered grandfather was driven from power, following a huge anti-government protest in 1960. Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993, and in 2005 he became chief cabinet secretary. His rise to the top came swiftly as he became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister in 2006. Mr Abe, picture here after being elected for the first time in 2006, hailed from a political family But a series of scandals - including the government's loss of pension records, affecting about 50 million claims - hit his administration hard. A heavy loss for the LDP followed in upper house elections in July 2007, and in September of that year he resigned due to ulcerative colitis. But then in 2012, Abe returned as prime minister, saying that he had overcome the disease with the help of medication. He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2017, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister. His popularity fluctuated, but he remained largely unchallenged due to his influence in the LDP, which amended its rules to allow him to serve a third term as party leader. With his hawkish stance on defence and foreign policy, Abe repeated the importance of being an equal ally and partner with the US and other Western powers. This fed into his long-held goal of revising Japan's post-war pacifist constitution so it could finally become a ""normal country"". Conservatives see the constitution - drafted by the US - as a reminder of the humiliating defeat of Japanese troops in WWII. The influence of his grandfather also fed into Abe's wariness of China emerging as the dominant force in Asia, reinforcing his conviction that Japan needed to pull its weight and become a military force to defend itself. These nationalistic and militaristic platforms were deeply divisive, horrifying parts of the population who cherish the pacifist constitution, while giving voice and even credibility to those blatant revisionist and nationalist groups and sentiments which for a long time in post-war Japan used to be a minority and only spoken in hushed tones. His nationalist views have often raised tensions with China and South Korea, particularly after his 2013 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site linked to Japan's militarism before and during WWII. Repeated visits also irked left-wing factions in Japan, who viewed it as an attempt by Abe to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the war. Shinzo Abe's visit to Yasukuni sparked anger In 2015, he pushed for the right to collective self-defence, enabling Japan to mobilise troops overseas to defend itself and allies under attack. Despite opposition from Japan's neighbours and even the Japanese public, Japan's parliament approved this controversial change. His larger goal of revising the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military remains unfulfilled, and continues to be a divisive topic in the country. He was also unable to secure the return of what Japan refers to as the Northern Territories - a chain of disputed islands off the northern prefecture of Hokkaido that are claimed by both Japan and Russia. Abe's rapport with former US president Donald Trump was credited with shielding Japan from crippling US-led trade tariffs, and having to fork out more money to support the presence of US troops in the country. He spearheaded""Abenomics"" policies, a comprehensive policy package aimed at making Japan strong by reviving the economy from the doldrums of deflation, while maintaining fiscal discipline. The popularity of these policies led to Abe and the LDP's return to power in 2012. But his efforts faced a major challenge when the country again went into recession in the spring of 2020. That and other slowdowns raised questions about the effectiveness of his approach. Abe appeared onstage dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games Abe's popularity was further hit by concerns over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics believe his campaigns aimed at boosting domestic tourism contributed to a resurgence of infections. They also say other promises of Abenomics  - such as empowering women in the workforce, tackling nepotism and changing unhealthy work cultures - remained unfulfilled. Internationally, he has been credited with holding the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a massive trade agreement between 11 countries - together, following an abrupt withdrawal by the US under Mr Trump's administration. Abe's resignation announcement led to an internal struggle among LDP factions, because he declined to name a successor. He was eventually succeeded by Yoshihide Suga. But Abe continued to hold sway over domestic politics in Japan, even after Suga was replaced by current prime minister Fumio Kishida. On 8 July, Abe was in the southern city of Nara campaigning on behalf of a candidate running for Japan's upper house. He was delivering a speech when he was shot by a gunman - a 41-year-old who is believed to be a former member of the Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of a navy. According to NHK and other news reports, the suspect said he was ""dissatisfied with Abe"" but that ""it has nothing to with political grudges"". Abe was conscious when taken to hospital, but died later from his injuries. He leaves his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ who he married in 1987.

Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

We're ending our live coverage now, thanks for joining us today in the wake of a frantic week in UK politics. You can keep up with the latest developments on the Conservative Party leadership contesthere. We'll be ending our coverage of the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader (and prime minister) shortly. Here is a recap of what's been happening today: After today's news that early bookies' favourite Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the running, it's worth reminding you where things currently stand. Rishi Sunak,Tom
Tugendhat,Suella BravermanandKemi Badenochhave confirmed they will stand, whileSajid Javid,Grant ShappsandJeremy Huntsay they
are considering running. Steve Baker, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, James Cleverly and Matt Hancock have
all ruled themselves out. Other possible candidates includePenny Mordauntand Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss. So who are the bookmakers' favourites? Oddschecker collates the odds from a number of  bookies - here's the latest. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent It's recently looked like Ben Wallace was in a particularly strong
position. The defence secretary is popular with grassroots Conservatives. He's been topping
surveys that the website Conservative Home runs of party members. Given they're the electorate that will ultimately choose the
next prime minister, he seemed like a candidate who could get all the way to
No 10 if he wanted to. But he's decided it's not for him. He gave it consideration, but
ultimately says he wants to focus on his current job. The big question now, is who he will endorse? Any candidate
getting him on board would likely get a big boost. I suspect he'll be fielding a few phone calls
from other leadership hopefuls this afternoon. Andrea Jenkyns raised her middle finger as she went through the gates of Downing Street to hear Boris Johnson's resignation speech New education minister Andrea Jenkyns has said she "" should have shown more composure"" as she appeared to make a rude gesture while entering Downing Street. In a widely-shared video she is seen showing the crowd her middle finger while on her way to No 10. On Saturday, the leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer said he did not condone Ms Jenkyns' actions but he added that ""emotions were pretty raw"" on the day the clip was filmed. In a tweet Ms Jenkyns said that on that day a ""baying mob outside the gates were insulting MPs on their way in as is sadly all too common."" She said she had previously received abuse and death threats, two of which are currently being investigated by the police. ""I had reached the end of my tether,"" she said, adding: ""I responded and stood up for myself...I should have shown more composure but am only human."" Readmore. Allow Twitter content?

Wallace has been focused on support for the Ukrainian war effort against Russia More now on Ben Wallace declaring he won't contest the leadership race, which he says was made after ""careful consideration"" with colleagues and family members. The announcement will come as a surprise to some given that the defence secretary was the bookies' favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory Party leader. Oddschecker, which collates the odds from a number of bookies, had placed Rishi Sunak as the second favourite to lead the party, followed by Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss. So far, Sunak and Tugendhat have already declared their leadership bids, along with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. We are also expecting to hear from Sajid Javid, Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt in the coming days as the leadership race gathers pace. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, the bookies' favourite to become Boris Johnson's successor, has announced he is not running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Wallace says it was ""not an easy choice"", but his focus is on his current job as defence secretary and ""keeping this great country safe"". Allow Twitter content?

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak was one of the
first to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet this week, shortly after ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid - leading to a wave of ministerial resignations which culminated in the end of Mr Johnson's prime ministerial career.ï»¿ It appears Johnson is disappointed with the actions of his former right-hand man,
with a No 10 source telling me Rishi Sunak has a ""short memory"". Boris
Johnson's allies feel he's the reason the former chancellor became a household
name, with the PM giving him a significant promotion to run the Treasury in
2020. They expected more loyalty in return. Relationships
between prime ministers and chancellors can be famously difficult. It appears
Johnson and Sunak will now go down as a partnership that ended in bad blood. So what does
Boris Johnson do now? Prime minister's typically don't get involved in
leadership contests for their successor. But Johnson is not a typical
leader. He may stay
above the fray. But it's safe to say Rishi Sunak won't be getting his endorsement. Also on the airwaves this morning was Conservative MP Liam Fox, who argues former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is best placed to deal with the economic challenges facing the country. The ex-chancellor isthe most high profile figure so farto have entered the race. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fox  described him as ""an
outstanding individual"". ""What I want to see is somebody whoâs actually got a plan to
see the spending of the government controlled over time,"" the North Somerset MP added. ""What we canât do is continue to spend money we havenât got and
leave the burden on future taxpayers,"" he said. Mark Spencer is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, has said Rishi Sunak is the best candidate to replace Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, Spencer points out that during the Covid pandemic Sunak developed the furlough scheme and was responsible for saving ""millions of jobs"", adding ""that's a fantastic track record."" ""We have come out of Covid with one of the best economies in the G7 and I think that again is down to Rishi's management and I think that demonstrates he has got the experience and the ability to do the job."" There's been a suggestion this morning - from senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker - that the leadership contest could be wrapped up by early August, if the process is ""truncated"". We're expecting a timetable to be set out after the 1922 Committee meets on Monday afternoon to decide how to move forward. For now, we can guide you through the process with this graphic - as you'll see, there are quite a few hoops to jump through before a new leader, and therefore PM, is chosen. Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. For two months, the work of detectives in Durham hit the pause button on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of Labour, after he decided he would resign if he was fined, consistent with his demand that it should have meant the same for Boris Johnson. Sir Keir is relieved. But in the time it took for the police to reach a decision that allows him to draw the strongest contrast with the prime minister, Mr Johnson has resigned. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Sir Keir sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now Mr Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Mr Johnson may not present Sir Keir with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. Read more.  Rishi Sunak's bid is the lead story for most of Saturday's papers. The Timesdescribes Mr Sunak's three minute launch video - with the tag-line, ""Ready for Rishi"" - as ""slickly produced"" and says his launch stole a march on his rivals. The Daily Telegraphsays the former chancellor is widely considered the favourite but adds attacks on him from supporters of other candidates are mounting. The Financial Timesheadline is ""Sunak accused of treachery"", with the paper reporting allies of Boris Johnson are blaming him for triggering the prime minister's exit. The Guardiansays tax cuts are expected to feature heavily in what is likely to be a chaotic, and at times bitter, leadership race. ""Let Battle Begin"" is its headline. Read the full paper review here. Tom Tugendhat, the first Conservative MP to put himself forward, has set out what he believes the party needs under new leadership in a newspaper article. The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee says he hopes to ""deliver a fresh start"" as the party must ""act now to restore trust and repair integrity in British politics"" and ensure a ""clean slate"". Writing inThe Times Scotland,external, he says he wants to ""to unite the party around conservative principles, renewing our pursuit of economic growth and a strengthened Union"". He says: ""If we are to defeat Labour and the SNP-Green coalition, our party will need a fresh start under serious and tested leadership."" Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling and a former soldier,announced his bid yesterday. Staying with Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher has offered his thoughts on former chancellor Rishi Sunak's bid. He said Sunak is in a ""bind"" where he will have to defend
high taxes in the leadership contest. The MP for Wycombe said he was
a huge fan of Sunak's but said that he will
have to defend his recent tax policies. He added that he believes current tax
levels are doing more harm than good. MP Steve Baker has ruled himself out of the Conservative leadership contest after previously suggesting he might consider a bid. The former Brexit minister is instead backing Attorney General Suella Braverman for the top job. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Baker said he was being realistic in not running, adding that without cabinet experience, it would be difficult to make it to the final two candidates. ""As much as I would love to seriously run, I will get the prime minister I want with Suella,"" he said. Baker said she has ""fierce resolve"", ""great authenticity"", and possesses ""all the right Conservative values"". A senior Tory backbench MP says he anticipates the shortlist of two could known by 21 July when Parliament breaks for the summer. And speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Charles Walker said it's possible the winner could be chosen in less than a month. The timescale for the contest will be decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs. Sir Charles, a former joint acting chairman of the committee, urged the leadership candidates not to ""knock lumps out of each other"", adding those with ""no hope"" should drop out of the contest ""for the greater good"". ""I think we've got to get through the thinning process very, very quickly, he said. Sir Charles said the process of selecting a new Tory leader could be ""truncated"" by waiving regional hustings, but acknowledged this would favour the better known candidate. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the fourth person to announce a bid for leader of the Conservative party. The MP for Saffron Walden, who resigned her job earlier this week, says she wants to lead a government that will ""tell the truth"". Writingin the Times,external, she says ""without change the Conservative Party, Britain and the Western world will continue to drift"", adding that the nation needs a ""strong but limited government focused on the essentials"". Badenoch, who joins Rishi Sunak, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman in the leadership race, also hits out at ""identity politics"" and says Boris Johnson was ""a symptom of the problems we face, not the cause of them"". She says she supports lower taxes ""to boost growth and productivity, and accompanied by tight spending discipline"". You can read morehere.

The hawk who gave his name to 'Abenomics',"Japanese PM Shinzo Abe wielded influence on domestic politics even after stepping down Shinzo Abe, Japan's longest-serving prime minister, was known for his hawkish foreign policy and a signature economic strategy that popularly came to be known as ""Abenomics"". A highly popular, and a highly controversial politician, the 67-year-old Abe led the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) to victory twice. His shocking death harkens back to images of the violent days in pre-war Japanese politics, when political assassinations were, if not commonplace, not unheard of. A string of political assassinations were part of Japan's march towards WWII. As a popular and divisive politician, it was part of his trade to stir up strong emotions among the masses. Abe knew from childhood that those masses are not always friendly, and that he had to fight back against criticism. Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Shinzo Abe when he announced his resignation in 2020 Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of the Fukushima nuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. When he stepped down after weeks of speculation, he revealed he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis. He was succeeded by close party ally Yoshihide Suga, but was still seen as a powerful figure in Japanese politics. As the son of former foreign minister Shintaro Abe and grandson of former prime minister Nobusuke Kishi, Abe was born into a political dynasty. He felt his mission was to continue the task of his ancestors - to make Japan strong, great, and a force to be reckoned with on the international stage. He looked up to Kishi, who strove to strengthen Japan's economic rule over China and Manchuria during World War II, and then was instrumental in creating the political dominance of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP). Abe's aversion to protesters may have its roots in how his revered grandfather was driven from power, following a huge anti-government protest in 1960. Abe was first elected to parliament in 1993, and in 2005 he became chief cabinet secretary. His rise to the top came swiftly as he became Japan's youngest post-war prime minister in 2006. Mr Abe, picture here after being elected for the first time in 2006, hailed from a political family But a series of scandals - including the government's loss of pension records, affecting about 50 million claims - hit his administration hard. A heavy loss for the LDP followed in upper house elections in July 2007, and in September of that year he resigned due to ulcerative colitis. But then in 2012, Abe returned as prime minister, saying that he had overcome the disease with the help of medication. He was subsequently re-elected in 2014 and 2017, becoming Japan's longest-serving prime minister. His popularity fluctuated, but he remained largely unchallenged due to his influence in the LDP, which amended its rules to allow him to serve a third term as party leader. With his hawkish stance on defence and foreign policy, Abe repeated the importance of being an equal ally and partner with the US and other Western powers. This fed into his long-held goal of revising Japan's post-war pacifist constitution so it could finally become a ""normal country"". Conservatives see the constitution - drafted by the US - as a reminder of the humiliating defeat of Japanese troops in WWII. The influence of his grandfather also fed into Abe's wariness of China emerging as the dominant force in Asia, reinforcing his conviction that Japan needed to pull its weight and become a military force to defend itself. These nationalistic and militaristic platforms were deeply divisive, horrifying parts of the population who cherish the pacifist constitution, while giving voice and even credibility to those blatant revisionist and nationalist groups and sentiments which for a long time in post-war Japan used to be a minority and only spoken in hushed tones. His nationalist views have often raised tensions with China and South Korea, particularly after his 2013 visit to Tokyo's Yasukuni shrine, a controversial site linked to Japan's militarism before and during WWII. Repeated visits also irked left-wing factions in Japan, who viewed it as an attempt by Abe to whitewash Japanese atrocities during the war. Shinzo Abe's visit to Yasukuni sparked anger In 2015, he pushed for the right to collective self-defence, enabling Japan to mobilise troops overseas to defend itself and allies under attack. Despite opposition from Japan's neighbours and even the Japanese public, Japan's parliament approved this controversial change. His larger goal of revising the constitution to formally recognise Japan's military remains unfulfilled, and continues to be a divisive topic in the country. He was also unable to secure the return of what Japan refers to as the Northern Territories - a chain of disputed islands off the northern prefecture of Hokkaido that are claimed by both Japan and Russia. Abe's rapport with former US president Donald Trump was credited with shielding Japan from crippling US-led trade tariffs, and having to fork out more money to support the presence of US troops in the country. He spearheaded""Abenomics"" policies, a comprehensive policy package aimed at making Japan strong by reviving the economy from the doldrums of deflation, while maintaining fiscal discipline. The popularity of these policies led to Abe and the LDP's return to power in 2012. But his efforts faced a major challenge when the country again went into recession in the spring of 2020. That and other slowdowns raised questions about the effectiveness of his approach. Abe appeared onstage dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games Abe's popularity was further hit by concerns over his handling of the Covid-19 pandemic. Critics believe his campaigns aimed at boosting domestic tourism contributed to a resurgence of infections. They also say other promises of Abenomics  - such as empowering women in the workforce, tackling nepotism and changing unhealthy work cultures - remained unfulfilled. Internationally, he has been credited with holding the Trans-Pacific Partnership - a massive trade agreement between 11 countries - together, following an abrupt withdrawal by the US under Mr Trump's administration. Abe's resignation announcement led to an internal struggle among LDP factions, because he declined to name a successor. He was eventually succeeded by Yoshihide Suga. But Abe continued to hold sway over domestic politics in Japan, even after Suga was replaced by current prime minister Fumio Kishida. On 8 July, Abe was in the southern city of Nara campaigning on behalf of a candidate running for Japan's upper house. He was delivering a speech when he was shot by a gunman - a 41-year-old who is believed to be a former member of the Self-Defense Force, Japan's equivalent of a navy. According to NHK and other news reports, the suspect said he was ""dissatisfied with Abe"" but that ""it has nothing to with political grudges"". Abe was conscious when taken to hospital, but died later from his injuries. He leaves his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ who he married in 1987.

Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons.

The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

Theranos exec Sunny Balwani convicted of fraudHe and fraudster Elizabeth Holmes ran the Silicon Valley company as a couple before its implosion.US & Canada,"Balwani's company was once worth $9bn (Â£7.5bn), but was based on blood testing technology that did not work Silicon Valley executive Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani has been found guilty of deceiving investors as part of a plot with ex-girlfriend Elizabeth Holmes. He falsely and repeatedly claimed that their company, Theranos, had a device that could detect hundreds of diseases with a few drops of blood. Holmes was found guilty at a separate trial in January where she accused Balwani of abuse - which he denies. Both Holmes, 38, and Balwani, 57, will be sentenced by a judge in the autumn. Holmes is facing around 20 years in prison and is currently free on bail. Balwani also faces up to 20 years in prison as well as millions of dollars in restitution payments to his victims. Theranos was once worth $9bn (Â£7.5bn), but was based on blood testing technology that did not work. The verdict was read on the fifth day of jury deliberations at a courthouse in San Jose, California, in the heart of Silicon Valley. Balwani was found guilty of all 12 charges against him. Who is Sunny Balwani? During closing arguments on 21 June, prosecutors showed text messages sent by Balwani to Holmes. ""I am responsible for everything at Theranos,"" he wrote in 2015. ""All have been my decisions too."" Assistant US Attorney Jeffrey Schenk called the message an admission of guilt. ""He's acknowledging his role in the fraud,"" he said. Sunny Balwani was Theranos' number two. Holmes was the company's founder and leader. But Balwani ran the everyday operations of the company. He had no medical training to speak of, and some thought that might be enough to convince a jury that he simply did not understand that Theranos' technology didn't work. His lawyers also argued that he invested his own money in the company - why do that if he thought the technology was dud? But this set of verdicts makes him just as culpable, in some respects more culpable, for the Theronos scandal than Holmes. Holmes was convicted of four charges of fraud, Balwani of 12 counts. He was also convicted of defrauding patients, something Holmes avoided. It means that Balwani will now go down in history as front and centre in the Theranos saga. Here in Silicon Valley, execs at start-ups and tech companies will be looking on. They'll note that an executive was convicted of wider charges of fraud than the founder and chief executive. It sets an important legal warning to managers - it's not always the boss that shoulders the greatest burden of responsibility. The verdict also partly vindicates Elizabeth Holmes' legal team, who placed her on the witness stand to be cross-examined. A risky move that may have paid off. Theranos was once the darling of biotech and Silicon Valley. Holmes was able to raise more than $900m from investors, including billionaires like media magnate Rupert Murdoch and tech mogul Larry Ellison. The firm promised it would revolutionise the healthcare industry with a test that could detect conditions such as cancer and diabetes with only a few drops of blood. But these claims began to unravel in 2015 after a Wall Street Journal investigation reported that its core blood-testing technology did not work. The three-month case against Balwani bore large similarities to the government's prosecutions of Holmes. Lawyers for Balwani argued that he was also duped by Holmes, after he joined the company and became chief financial officer in 2010. Before breaking up as the company fell apart in 2016, the couple went to great lengths to ensure that investors and employees were unaware of their romantic relationship. His lawyers pointed out that after investing $15m of his own money into Theranos, he never cashed out his stock options despite his investment rising to some $500m. Unlike Holmes, Balwani did not take the stand to testify in his defence. Holmes reportedly first met Balwani during a college trip to Beijing when she was 18.

Dozens send 'dronations' to help Ukraine fightThe country hopes to collect thousands of hobbyist and commercial drones.,"A Ukrainian soldier uses a small consumer drone Dozens of people have given their hobby and commercial drones to Ukraine after it appealed for ""dronations"" to help build its ""army of drones"". The country is also asking for money to buy 200 military reconnaissance drones. Ukrainian and Russian forces have used small consumer drones, or unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), in the war. But Justin Bronk, of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI), says while small drones are useful, tactics are adapting to counter them. Small and commercial drones can provide a live view of the enemy's positions, he says. ""Both sides in Ukraine have been able to very rapidly exploit that real-time video picture, to call down artillery fire and quickly correct it so that it's very, very accurate, even when using old school unguided artillery, on to enemy forces,"" he said. But he warned electronic counter-measures were becoming increasingly effective. The proposed army of drones is a complex programme involving procurement, maintenance and replacement, as well as pilot training, Ukraine says. Col Oleksii Noskov, assistant commander-in-chief of Ukraine's armed forces, said: ""The army of drones will allow us to constantly monitor the 2,470km-long (1,535 miles) front line and to field an effective response to enemy attacks, using modern technology."" Mykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine's minister of digital transformation, told the BBC via email that the first goal of the campaign was to purchase tactical drones which have a 100-mile range and are equipped with a sophisticated camera, GPS and mapping tools. However, after studying the issue, he said ""our team understood that Ukraine's army still needed quadcopters"", and so he said the country was asking people to ""donate their own drones"". Ukraine hopes to collect thousands of multi-use and commercial UAVs. Drones which meet the minimum standards are being donated to Ukraine via two warehouses, one in Poland and the other in the US. Mr Fedorov also wants companies to get involved, adding: ""This project is a great opportunity for drone manufacturers to test their equipment in harsh conditions."" The campaign, which was launched on Friday, has already raised Â£5.7m, enabling the purchase of two military UAVs. Dozens of small drones had also been received,Mr Fedorov tweeted.,external The military ""warmate"" drones, according to Mr Bronk, are a type of loitering munition manufactured in Poland. According to the company's website, the drone ""constitutes a good alternative for anti-tank guided missiles"". According to Mr Fedorov, hobby and commercial drones have already shown their effectiveness on the battlefield. Russia has also made use of them. Earlier this year, Mr Fedorov called on market leaderDJI to stop selling drones in Russia and,in a significant intervention for a Chinese firm,it halted sales in both Russia and Ukraine. ""Russia is using hobby/commercial drones to strike and conduct reconnaissance in their unprovoked and unfair war,"" Mr Fedorov wrote. ""It is crucial that the world's largest commercial drone-maker, DJI, stopped sales in Russia."" Mykhailo Fedorov appeals for ""dronations"" Valerii Iakovenko, co-founder of Ukrainian company DroneUA, told BBC News that DJI's action had pushed up costs to Ukraine, while Russia was still able to continue to obtain drones via Belarus. His company had been supplying drones and robotics to the government since before the war. Drones, along with Elon Musk's Starlink satellite internet system and professional radio equipment, were now among the most sought-after technology, he said. And even small ones were useful mostly providing field data, locating enemy troops and correcting artillery fire. ""A huge number of volunteer operators that joined the Ukrainian forces are also making a difference,"" Mr Iakovenko said. ""Drone pilots of small consumer drones are providing aerial intelligence along the whole front line. ""It is all about the speed of information exchange between the field and in the general staff, to make decisions almost immediately."" This video can not be played Watch: The volunteers using drones to monitor Russian troops Mr Bronk says Ukrainians in particular have been very inventive in finding ways to source and then use commercial, as well as military-grade drones. This includes ""using them as improvised loitering munitions to strike targets at significant distance, including, recently, an oil refinery in Rostov with a commercial grade UAV with an improvised warhead"". But tactics, he warns, are changing. ""What's happened in the last couple of months in Donbas is that the Russians have managed to concentrate their electronic warfare assets and integrate them well with their ongoing operations. As a result, Mr Bronk says, whenever Ukraine sends up a small UAV using radio remote control ""the Russian electronic warfare kit picks it up and immediately either takes it over or just cuts the command link electronically and forces it to return"". To avoid this, instead of being flown by remote control, small drones have to be programmed to fly a set route and have targets identified when footage is analysed on their return. This slow process is of limited value against moving targets, he said. Mr Bronk felt that what Ukraine needed were loitering munitions capable of targeting and attacking Russian electronic warfare systems.

Dylan's new Blowin' In The Wind sells for Â£1.5m,"Bob Dylan celebrates the 60th anniversary of his music career this year A one-off re-recording of Bob Dylan singing his 1963 classic Blowin' In The Wind has sold at auction for almost Â£1.5 million. The release is the first new studio recording of the song since Dylan wrote it in 1962 and was sold by Christie's in London on Thursday. Bidding lasted just four minutes - coincidentally the same as the running time of the song itself. The sale beat Christie's original estimate of Â£600,000 - Â£1 million. The name of the bidder has yet to be revealed. The auction house said it was ""pleased with the excellent result"". One-off Bob Dylan recording could sell for Â£1m 80 things you may not know about Bob Dylan Dylan 'beyond words' over Nobel Prize Dylan's new version of Blowin' In The Wind was presented on a unique ""Ionic Original"" disc  - a patented technology that promises to deliver higher quality audio than normal vinyl. The disc is made of aluminium, treated with a layer of nitrocellulose then coated with a sapphire and quartz gradient, but is playable on any regular turntable. It's the brainchild of Grammy-winning musician T Bone Burnett, who also produced and played on the new Dylan's recording. ""We recorded it live,"" he told the BBC earlier this week, ""and I think we did it in one take, if I'm not mistaken"". ""It felt holy. It always feels holy for me, playing with Bob."" Dylan delivers the lyrics with the hard-won wisdom of his 81 years, turning an angry young man's protest song into a more contemplative reflection on humanity's inability to learn from its mistakes. Unlike the original, he is backed by a small band, including Greg Leisz on mandolin and Don Was on bass. T Bone Burnett (pictured) and Bob Dylan have their signatures etched into the 10-inch disc However, few people will ever get to hear the song, as the disc was sold as a one-off physical object, meaning the buyer has no rights to distribute it. Burnett said he viewed the disc as ""an original handmade original piece of work"". ""We're only making one because that's the way we want to present this to the world. It's the equivalent of an oil painting."" He added that future one-offs could also be sold on the fine art market, to help support artists whose incomes have been slashed by streaming and falling CD sales. ""In time, as we're able to develop this market, every musician will have access to it and have a whole new way of earning a living. ""Musicians have been victims of the age of mechanical reproduction. Now, we are going back to the future, with one-off pieces of singular art."" The Dylan record was the final lot in Christie's Exceptional sale, which mostly focused on royal furniture and works of art. An Egyptian limestone statue, dating to 2400 BC, sold for Â£6 million; while a pair of Napoleonic flintlock pistols fetched Â£976,000.

If you want to read our news story about the day's events, it'shere. Our visual guide to how the day unfolded, detailed articles on Shinzo Abe's life and legacy, video clips and more can be find on our topic page -here. Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

"PM 'thinks' he reported oligarch meeting, MPs toldBoris Johnson met ex-KGB man Alexander Lebedev without officials but says they were informed after.UK","Alexander Lebedev in Moscow in 2019 Boris Johnson ""thinks"" he reported a meeting with Russian oligarch and ex-KGB officer Alexander Lebedev, a Foreign Office minister has said. Vicki Ford initially told MPs that in 2018 when he was foreign secretary, Mr Johnson reported the meeting, where no officials were present, ""as required"".

If you want to read our news story about the day's events, it'shere. Our visual guide to how the day unfolded, detailed articles on Shinzo Abe's life and legacy, video clips and more can be find on our topic page -here. Our writers today were Sam Hancock, Emily McGarvey and Thomas Mackintosh. That's it for now, and thanks for joining us. We're bringing this live page to an end soon, so here's a recap of what happened today. The shooting  Hospital press conference  The suspect  Police press conference  Shinzo Abe married his wife Akie, a radio DJ, in 1987 Shinzo Abe was born into a prominent political family in Tokyo. His grandfather, Nobusuke Kishi, served as prime minister while his father, Shintaro Abe, previously served as foreign minister. Abe graduated with a degree in political science from Seikei University in Tokyo before studying public policy in the US. He began his career working for a Japanese steel manufacturer before leaving to pursue a number of government positions. Abe married his wife, Akie, a Japanese radio DJ and socialite in 1987, who was nicknamed the ""domestic opposition party"" due to her outspoken views which often contradicted her husband's. Abe and his wife had no children, having undergone unsuccessful fertility treatments early in their marriage. Abe's younger brother, Nobuo Kishi, became Japan's defence minister, while his older brother, Hironobu Abe, became president and CEO of a packaging corporation. Abe stepped down as prime minister in 2020 after revealing he had suffered a relapse of ulcerative colitis - the condition that caused him to resign in 2007 before returning to his post in 2012. Professor Yuichi Hosoya, who advised Shinzo Abe's government on security and foreign affairs, has remembered him as ""very gentle and kind - unlike the media image"". ""He was a very sensitive person,"" Prof Hosoya, who teaches history at Keio University in Tokyo, tells the BBC. ""He always tried to listen to others and he was very flexible."" Crediting Abe with making Japan an ""international community"", Prof Hosoya says he ""fulfilled promises"" which is why leaders trusted him. On China, he adds Abe understood that Japan's ""national interest lay in better relations"" there. ""In 2006, he visited Beijing before he visited Washington DC because he knew that at that time the first priority was to repair the damage between the two countries."" Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has said he is ""deeply saddened"". ""The world has lost a great man of vision, and Canada has lost a close friend. ""My thoughts are with his wife, Akie, and the people of Japan as they mourn this loss,"" he said. Nadeem ShadBBC News From the day he stepped
into office to the day he left, Shinzo Abe went about changing Japan inside and
out. He revisited and
reinterpreted Japanâs post-war âpacifistâ constitution, introduced a new state
secrecy law and supercharged the decade-long stagnant economy in a move that
became known as ""Abenomics"". On foreign policy Abe
forged relationships with Western democracies while also cultivating ties with
countries such as Russia. A staunch US ally, he
leaned towards Washington but remained pragmatic towards China despite tensions
over disputed territorial claims. After stepping down, a visit
to Japanâs controversial war memorial, the Yasukuni Shrine, and comments on
Taiwan drew the ire of Chinese authorities. His countryâs longest
serving leader, Abe created a sense of stability and continuity for many. While he left power amid
mediocre approval ratings, he was arguably Japanâs most powerful leader since
World War Two. You can read more about his legacy here. If you're just joining us, our graphics team have set out what happened in the city of Nara earlier today. Abe, 67, was making a campaign speech outside a railway station for Kei Sato, an incumbent member of the upper house of parliament, unaware of another figure in the background, a casually dressed youngish man with a black cross-body bag. At 11:30 local time (02:30 GMT) footage of the event shows the man moving forward, minutes after the former prime minister starts his speech. Shots ring out and Abe falls to the ground, visibly bleeding. As terrified spectators duck down, security officials tackle the 41-year-old suspect, who makes no attempt to run. They wrestle him to the ground and take him into custody. Eyewitnesses say they saw the man carrying what they describe as a large gun and firing twice at Abe from behind. Abe dressed as Super Mario at the Rio Olympics closing ceremony Shinzo Abe's first stint as prime minister was brief - for a little over a year starting in 2006 - and controversial. But he made a surprising political comeback in 2012, staying in power until 2020 when he resigned for health reasons. Japan was in a recession when he began his second term and his economic policy was credited with helping return growth to a faltering economy. He oversaw Japan's recovery from a massive earthquake and tsunami in Tohoku in 2011, which killed nearly 20,000 people and led to a meltdown of theFukushimanuclear reactors. Abe also had his unexpected moments, such as popping up dressed asSuper Marioat the Rio Olympics closing ceremony in 2016 ahead of the 2020 Tokyo Games. Just days after stepping down as PM,he visited a controversial war memorial. TheYasukuni Shrinehonours Japan's war dead, but also convicted war criminals. Visits by Japan's leaders to it had previously been seen as showing a lack of remorse for its militaristic past. You can read moreabout his legacy in Japan and in countries across the globe here. The Queen hosted former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and his wife, Akie, at Buckingham Palace in May 2016 The Queen has sent a message of condolence to the Emperor of Japan. The UK monarch said: ""My family and I were deeply saddened to hear the news of the sudden and tragic death of former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. ""I have fond memories of meeting Mr Abe and his wife during their visit to the United Kingdom in 2016. ""His love for Japan, and his desire to forge ever-closer bonds with the United Kingdom, were clear. ""I wish to convey my deepest sympathy and condolences to his family and to the people of Japan at this difficult time."" More words describing Shinzo Abe as a towering politician on the global stage - this time from former US President Donald Trump. ""He was a unifier like no other, but above all, he was a man who loved and cherished his magnificent country, Japan. ""Shinzo Abe will be greatly missed."" Trump added that the suspect ""will hopefully be dealt with swiftly and harshly"". In February 2017, Trump welcomed Abe to the White House and then to his resort in Florida where the pair played a round of golf. The former Japanese prime minister even fell into a bunker while Trump carried on golfing. Nine months later, Trump travelled to Japan and then again in May 2019, becoming the first world leader to meet the newly-enthroned Emperor Naruhito. This video can not be played Trump carries on golfing as Japan's Shinzo Abe falls into bunker in 2017 The incident has been a huge shock for the people of Japan. Gun violence is rare, but questions are now being asked about the level of security in place for politicians touring the country. A Tokyo-based journalist, Paul Nadeau, has been speaking to the BBC about what people expect from a typical campaign event in Japan. ""The thing that people should realise about Japanese campaigns is that they're much more immediate relationships between the public and the politician. ""The rallies will fill up a town square or the plaza in front of a railway station. ""You can shake hands with the prime minister, you can share some grapes, you can compliment his hair. It's just about all go and as crowded as it is, as many people as there are, there's never a sense of danger or a sense of threat or insecurity. ""No one really ever gets all that worked up and so the security detail that's attached to the prime minister, whoever it is, reflects that."" Sakiko ShiraishiReporting from Tokyo A large crowd had gathered to hear what Shinzo Abe had to say The assassination occurred two days before the Upper House election, which is of grave importance to Japan. Since no other national election is due for the next six years, the winner is certain to make major policy advances. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) has pledged to revise the constitution in this election. This includes revision of Article 9, the pacifist clause that bans Japan from having a military and taking part in warfare. Other proposed LDP changes are ones liberals fear will violate and undermine basic human rights in this country. Abe was known for his conservative outlook and hawkish foreign policy, and revising the constitution had been a long-held goal. Now, many fear that the constitutional agenda will be decided amidst the great confusion of his shocking death. On social media, people are posting all kinds of opinions: mourning Abe's death, condemning terrorism, suppressing various criticisms, calling for a calm vote, promoting a sympathy vote, and expressing concern about it. Some write they've been crying all day. At this point, the election is expected to be held as scheduled. Reuters have put out this picture of the moment just before the suspect was tackled. The air is thick with smoke and he's carrying what appears to be a weapon in his left hand. As we've been reporting, police don't know what his motive was yet - he told police he had a grudge against a ""specific organisation"". At the police press conference, it's emerged that he has said it was not about politics. People have been leaving flowers near the site of the shooting. Here's the scene in Nara now: There's a bit more detail from the press conference on what police have found at the suspect's home. Officials say that in addition to the handmade weapons, they also discovered a number of explosives. As a result, nearby residents have been asked to evacuate until the area can be declared safe. On the gun, police said it was made using a mix of materials such as metal and wood, but they are unable to say whether it was made using a 3D printer. Investigations are ongoing into whether he acted alone, they said. And on the unnamed organisation the suspect told police he has an issue with, police say they are still establishing whether Abe has any connection to it. Police outside the hospital where Shinzo Abe was taken As we've been reporting, police investigating the shooting have been giving an update. Here's what we learned:  US President Joe Biden has said he is ""stunned, outraged and deeply saddened"". Biden, like President Barack Obama, worked closely with the former Japanese prime minister when he was US vice-president. He said: ""He was a champion of the alliance between our nations and the friendship between our people. ""The longest serving Japanese prime minister, his vision of a free and open Indo-Pacific will endure. ""Above all, he cared deeply about the Japanese people and dedicated his life to their service. ""Even at the moment he was attacked, he was engaged in the work of democracy. ""While there are many details that we do not yet know, we know that violent attacks are never acceptable and that gun violence always leaves a deep scar on the communities that are affected by it. ""The United States stands with Japan in this moment of grief. I send my deepest condolences to his family."" Former US President Barack Obama has released a statement. Obama, who worked closely with Abe when they were both leaders of their respective countries, said: ""I am shocked and saddened by the assassination of my friend and long-time partner Shinzo Abe in Japan. ""Former prime minister Abe was devoted to both the country he served and the extraordinary alliance between the United States and Japan. ""I will always remember the work we did to strengthen our alliance,the moving experience of traveling to Hiroshimaand Pearl Harbor together, and the grace he and his wife Akie Abe showed to me and Michelle. ""Michelle and I send our deepest condolences to the people of Japan who are very much in our thoughts at this painful moment."" The suspect travelled to the site in Nara where the former prime minister was giving a speech by train, police say. But officers cannot say whether he had arrived immediately before the event was due to take place. Police would not say whether any bullets were found at the scene of the shooting, adding that investigations are ongoing. Police at the press conference are being questioned about the security of the event where Shinzo Abe was talking to supporters of Japan's Liberal Democratic Party. One journalist asks why there was space for people to walk, or stand, behind Abe when he gave his speech. He also quizzes police on the level of security at the event. In response, police say before they can speculate about who is at fault, or ""responsible"", the investigation needs to be carried out. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Hospital buildings risky and need repair - bossesSome NHS buildings are unsafe and urgently need upgrading, trust bosses warn.","Some hospital leaders in England say they are ""living with risk"" every day, with buildings in urgent need of repair. According to NHS trust bosses, delays to funding allocations have stalled vital upgrade projects. Structural safety concerns caused the critical care unit at one trust to be temporarily closed and planned operations were stopped. The government said it was working closely with trusts on building plans. NHS Providers - which represent trusts in England - said one hospital is using temporary generators with no back-up. Another trust has installed props and steel beams in the maternity unit, making life very difficult for staff and mothers, according to hospital managers. The hospital leaders said the current political situation - with the government looking for a new leader - complicates matters. ""This kind of political paralysis and instability is deeply unhelpful for the NHS when we've got a whole range of critical decisions that need to be made not only in capital investments but also NHS pay,"" said NHS Providers chief executive Saffron Corder. The organisation added that the government's plan for 40 new hospitals in England by 2030 is ""on shaky ground"". The roof of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn is having to be supported by wooden and steel props A survey of members that are part of this new building programme suggests half are not confident the funding they have been allocated will be sufficient to deliver the project. A number of trusts were still awaiting the go-ahead for ""shovel ready"" projects, Ms Cordery said. The programme was ""already moving at glacial pace"" and a power vacuum at Westminster would be ""deeply unhelpful to trusts and their local communities who are waiting for decisions"". The 40 new hospitals election pledge, made by the Conservatives in 2019, has proved controversial, with debate over what a ""new hospital"" means. The Department of Health and Social Care says the definition encompasses: a major new clinical building on an existing site a new wing of an existing hospital a major refurbishment and alteration of a hospital building The National Audit Office (NAO) says it will start a value-for-money review of the new-hospitals programme later this year. What's happened to the 40 new hospitals pledge? Hospital uses buckets catch rain Gareth Davies, from the NAO, said he had noted comments about the implications of delay for increasing costs at a time of high inflation, and whether all the projects truly met the classification of ""new hospital"" One hospital boss not included in the plan suggested it would be cheaper over the next decade to build a new facility than continue propping up and trying to keep the current structure safe. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We are working closely with NHS trusts in the programme on the development of their building plans. ""Each of the building projects will be new hospitals providing brand new, state-of-the-art facilities to ensure world-class provision of healthcare for NHS patients and staff by replacing outdated infrastructure.""

The ex-chancellor has launched his campaign, saying ""someone has to grip this moment and make the right decisions"" Former Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the latest Conservative MP to enter the Tory leadership race Attorney General Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat, chair of the Commons foreign affairs committee, have also said they are running Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt is also expected to launch a bid, as are Liz Truss, Sajid Javid and Nadhim Zahawi Edited by Jeremy Gahagan The defence secretary says he hopes the Conservatives can ""swiftly return to focusing on the issues"". We're ending our live coverage now, thanks for joining us today in the wake of a frantic week in UK politics. You can keep up with the latest developments on the Conservative Party leadership contesthere. We'll be ending our coverage of the contest to be the next Conservative Party leader (and prime minister) shortly. Here is a recap of what's been happening today: After today's news that early bookies' favourite Ben Wallace has ruled himself out of the running, it's worth reminding you where things currently stand. Rishi Sunak,Tom
Tugendhat,Suella BravermanandKemi Badenochhave confirmed they will stand, whileSajid Javid,Grant ShappsandJeremy Huntsay they
are considering running. Steve Baker, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab, James Cleverly and Matt Hancock have
all ruled themselves out. Other possible candidates includePenny Mordauntand Foreign SecretaryLiz Truss. So who are the bookmakers' favourites? Oddschecker collates the odds from a number of  bookies - here's the latest. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent It's recently looked like Ben Wallace was in a particularly strong
position. The defence secretary is popular with grassroots Conservatives. He's been topping
surveys that the website Conservative Home runs of party members. Given they're the electorate that will ultimately choose the
next prime minister, he seemed like a candidate who could get all the way to
No 10 if he wanted to. But he's decided it's not for him. He gave it consideration, but
ultimately says he wants to focus on his current job. The big question now, is who he will endorse? Any candidate
getting him on board would likely get a big boost. I suspect he'll be fielding a few phone calls
from other leadership hopefuls this afternoon. Andrea Jenkyns raised her middle finger as she went through the gates of Downing Street to hear Boris Johnson's resignation speech New education minister Andrea Jenkyns has said she "" should have shown more composure"" as she appeared to make a rude gesture while entering Downing Street. In a widely-shared video she is seen showing the crowd her middle finger while on her way to No 10. On Saturday, the leader of the House of Commons Mark Spencer said he did not condone Ms Jenkyns' actions but he added that ""emotions were pretty raw"" on the day the clip was filmed. In a tweet Ms Jenkyns said that on that day a ""baying mob outside the gates were insulting MPs on their way in as is sadly all too common."" She said she had previously received abuse and death threats, two of which are currently being investigated by the police. ""I had reached the end of my tether,"" she said, adding: ""I responded and stood up for myself...I should have shown more composure but am only human."" Readmore. Allow Twitter content?

Wallace has been focused on support for the Ukrainian war effort against Russia More now on Ben Wallace declaring he won't contest the leadership race, which he says was made after ""careful consideration"" with colleagues and family members. The announcement will come as a surprise to some given that the defence secretary was the bookies' favourite to succeed Boris Johnson as Tory Party leader. Oddschecker, which collates the odds from a number of bookies, had placed Rishi Sunak as the second favourite to lead the party, followed by Penny Mordaunt, Tom Tugendhat and Liz Truss. So far, Sunak and Tugendhat have already declared their leadership bids, along with Suella Braverman and Kemi Badenoch. We are also expecting to hear from Sajid Javid, Grant Shapps and Jeremy Hunt in the coming days as the leadership race gathers pace. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, the bookies' favourite to become Boris Johnson's successor, has announced he is not running for the leadership of the Conservative Party. Wallace says it was ""not an easy choice"", but his focus is on his current job as defence secretary and ""keeping this great country safe"". Allow Twitter content?

David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak was one of the
first to resign from Boris Johnson's cabinet this week, shortly after ex-Health Secretary Sajid Javid - leading to a wave of ministerial resignations which culminated in the end of Mr Johnson's prime ministerial career.ï»¿ It appears Johnson is disappointed with the actions of his former right-hand man,
with a No 10 source telling me Rishi Sunak has a ""short memory"". Boris
Johnson's allies feel he's the reason the former chancellor became a household
name, with the PM giving him a significant promotion to run the Treasury in
2020. They expected more loyalty in return. Relationships
between prime ministers and chancellors can be famously difficult. It appears
Johnson and Sunak will now go down as a partnership that ended in bad blood. So what does
Boris Johnson do now? Prime minister's typically don't get involved in
leadership contests for their successor. But Johnson is not a typical
leader. He may stay
above the fray. But it's safe to say Rishi Sunak won't be getting his endorsement. Also on the airwaves this morning was Conservative MP Liam Fox, who argues former Chancellor Rishi Sunak is best placed to deal with the economic challenges facing the country. The ex-chancellor isthe most high profile figure so farto have entered the race. Announcing his decision to stand ina social media video,external, Mr Sunak said he wanted to ""restore trust, rebuild the economy and reunite the country"". Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Mr Fox  described him as ""an
outstanding individual"". ""What I want to see is somebody whoâs actually got a plan to
see the spending of the government controlled over time,"" the North Somerset MP added. ""What we canât do is continue to spend money we havenât got and
leave the burden on future taxpayers,"" he said. Mark Spencer is backing the former chancellor Rishi Sunak Mark Spencer, the leader of the House of Commons, has said Rishi Sunak is the best candidate to replace Boris Johnson. Speaking to the BBC, Spencer points out that during the Covid pandemic Sunak developed the furlough scheme and was responsible for saving ""millions of jobs"", adding ""that's a fantastic track record."" ""We have come out of Covid with one of the best economies in the G7 and I think that again is down to Rishi's management and I think that demonstrates he has got the experience and the ability to do the job."" There's been a suggestion this morning - from senior backbencher Sir Charles Walker - that the leadership contest could be wrapped up by early August, if the process is ""truncated"". We're expecting a timetable to be set out after the 1922 Committee meets on Monday afternoon to decide how to move forward. For now, we can guide you through the process with this graphic - as you'll see, there are quite a few hoops to jump through before a new leader, and therefore PM, is chosen. Chris MasonPolitical editor This is the week we found out, barring something totally unforeseen, who will lead the Labour Party into the next general election: Sir Keir Starmer. And we found out who definitely won't be leading the Conservatives into it: Boris Johnson. For two months, the work of detectives in Durham hit the pause button on Sir Keir Starmer's leadership of Labour, after he decided he would resign if he was fined, consistent with his demand that it should have meant the same for Boris Johnson. Sir Keir is relieved. But in the time it took for the police to reach a decision that allows him to draw the strongest contrast with the prime minister, Mr Johnson has resigned. As the PM's political woes multiplied in recent months, he was, for Labour and others, a political target the size of a barn door. And Sir Keir sought to define himself as everything Boris Johnson was not. But now Mr Johnson will soon be the former prime minister, the Labour leader now faces the moving target of a range of possible future ones. And whoever replaces Mr Johnson may not present Sir Keir with quite the same scope for critique as he's had in recent months. Read more.  Rishi Sunak's bid is the lead story for most of Saturday's papers. The Timesdescribes Mr Sunak's three minute launch video - with the tag-line, ""Ready for Rishi"" - as ""slickly produced"" and says his launch stole a march on his rivals. The Daily Telegraphsays the former chancellor is widely considered the favourite but adds attacks on him from supporters of other candidates are mounting. The Financial Timesheadline is ""Sunak accused of treachery"", with the paper reporting allies of Boris Johnson are blaming him for triggering the prime minister's exit. The Guardiansays tax cuts are expected to feature heavily in what is likely to be a chaotic, and at times bitter, leadership race. ""Let Battle Begin"" is its headline. Read the full paper review here. Tom Tugendhat, the first Conservative MP to put himself forward, has set out what he believes the party needs under new leadership in a newspaper article. The chairman of the Commons Foreign Affairs Committee says he hopes to ""deliver a fresh start"" as the party must ""act now to restore trust and repair integrity in British politics"" and ensure a ""clean slate"". Writing inThe Times Scotland,external, he says he wants to ""to unite the party around conservative principles, renewing our pursuit of economic growth and a strengthened Union"". He says: ""If we are to defeat Labour and the SNP-Green coalition, our party will need a fresh start under serious and tested leadership."" Tugendhat, the MP for Tonbridge and Malling and a former soldier,announced his bid yesterday. Staying with Steve Baker, the Tory backbencher has offered his thoughts on former chancellor Rishi Sunak's bid. He said Sunak is in a ""bind"" where he will have to defend
high taxes in the leadership contest. The MP for Wycombe said he was
a huge fan of Sunak's but said that he will
have to defend his recent tax policies. He added that he believes current tax
levels are doing more harm than good. MP Steve Baker has ruled himself out of the Conservative leadership contest after previously suggesting he might consider a bid. The former Brexit minister is instead backing Attorney General Suella Braverman for the top job. Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Baker said he was being realistic in not running, adding that without cabinet experience, it would be difficult to make it to the final two candidates. ""As much as I would love to seriously run, I will get the prime minister I want with Suella,"" he said. Baker said she has ""fierce resolve"", ""great authenticity"", and possesses ""all the right Conservative values"". A senior Tory backbench MP says he anticipates the shortlist of two could known by 21 July when Parliament breaks for the summer. And speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Sir Charles Walker said it's possible the winner could be chosen in less than a month. The timescale for the contest will be decided by the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs. Sir Charles, a former joint acting chairman of the committee, urged the leadership candidates not to ""knock lumps out of each other"", adding those with ""no hope"" should drop out of the contest ""for the greater good"". ""I think we've got to get through the thinning process very, very quickly, he said. Sir Charles said the process of selecting a new Tory leader could be ""truncated"" by waiving regional hustings, but acknowledged this would favour the better known candidate. Former equalities minister Kemi Badenoch has become the fourth person to announce a bid for leader of the Conservative party. The MP for Saffron Walden, who resigned her job earlier this week, says she wants to lead a government that will ""tell the truth"". Writingin the Times,external, she says ""without change the Conservative Party, Britain and the Western world will continue to drift"", adding that the nation needs a ""strong but limited government focused on the essentials"". Badenoch, who joins Rishi Sunak, Tom Tugendhat and Suella Braverman in the leadership race, also hits out at ""identity politics"" and says Boris Johnson was ""a symptom of the problems we face, not the cause of them"". She says she supports lower taxes ""to boost growth and productivity, and accompanied by tight spending discipline"". You can read morehere.

What's happened to the 40 new hospitals pledge?,"The Conservatives' pledge to build 40 new hospitals by 2030 is facing a review by the government's spending watchdog. The National Audit Office says it ""plans to start a value for money review of the New Hospitals Programme later this year"" and report its findings in 2023. The pledge was in the 2019 Conservative election manifesto and has been repeated many times by Boris Johnson. But how many of these hospitals are genuinely new? When, the pledge was first made - many would have assumed that it referred to brand new hospitals, adding to overall hospital capacity. But in August 2021, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC)sent out guidance to NHS trusts on ""key media lines"" to use,externalwhen responding to questions about the pledge. It defined a ""new"" hospital in three ways: A whole new hospital on a new site or current NHS land A major new clinical building on an existing site or a new wing of an existing hospital A major refurbishment and alteration of all but the building frame or main structure It said there was a variety of schemes but they ""must always be referred to as a new hospital"". In November 2021, the BBC emailed every NHS Trust involved, asking which of the three categories their project fitted into. Some didn't reply. But of the 34 trusts who responded: five said they were building a whole new hospital 12 said they were building new wings nine said they were rebuilding existing hospital buildings Others were unable to tell us which category their development fell into. For instance, Lance McCarthy, chief executive at The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust, said: ""Our current plans are for a new hospital on a new site. However, our business case has not yet been approved. ""We are unable to confirm which category we fall into until we have received final approval."" The BBC examined the details of the 40 hospital projects, as listedon a government website,,externaland also looked at literature provided by the trusts. The Nuffield Trust, a health think tank, did the same research. It defines a ""new"" hospital as ""a new building on an entirely new site"". If you use this definition, you find that: 22 are rebuilding projects 12 are new wings within existing hospitals three involve rebuilding non-urgent care hospitals three are new hospitals (two general hospitals and one non-urgent care hospital) We asked the DHSC to confirm this breakdown, but it did not do this. The government website also includes ""competition for eight further hospitals including new mental health hospitals"". Details of these projects are yet to be announced. Nigel Edwards, from the Nuffield Trust, said: ""The definitions here are confusing but there is a substantial amount of new hospital building, but only two are new [general] hospitals on new sites. ""The rest are a combination of substantial rebuilds, new wings and a range of substantial new developments. People might equate a new hospital with a completely new building on a new site but the programme is quite reasonably focusing on rebuilding and extending the existing stock of hospitals."" Laurie Rachet-Jacquet, an economic analyst at the Health Foundation, told the BBC: ""They are not all 'hospitals' as most people would recognise them."" She argued that if the government was building 40 new hospitals, the cost would be much higher. ""Around Â£3.7bn has been committed to the Hospital Building Programme. But according to NHS Providers, a mid-sized hospital costs around Â£500m. Forty completely new mid-sized hospitals would therefore require in the region of Â£20bn - not Â£3.7bn."" London and South West will benefit The BBC asked the DHSC to clarify how many entirely new hospitals were being built. In response, a spokesperson said ""we have committed to build 48 hospitals by 2030, backed by an initial Â£3.7bn"". Mr Johnson was asked the same thing at Prime Minister's Questions and replied: ""You obviously don't go around building on greenfield sites... you rebuild hospitals and that is what we have said for the last two-and-a-half years."" Have these eight election promises been met? Prime Minister's Questions claims fact-checked There won't be ""40 more hospitals"" - by 2030. The projects that do involve building entirely new general hospitals are designed to coincide with the closure of old hospitals. And they were both due to open before the government made its hospitals pledge. The Midland Metropolitan University Hospital in Smethwick is an entirely new hospital which will have 670 beds and 15 operating theatres. The hospital had been due to open in 2018 at a cost of Â£350m, but construction was delayed by the collapse of the building firm Carillion. A report by the National Audit Office said the total costs associated with the project are likely to reach Â£988m. It's not due to open now until 2023. The redevelopment of the Royal Liverpool Hospital was due to begin in 2013 and to be completed in March 2017 at a cost of Â£335m. But because of delays in construction and the collapse of Carillion, the 646-bed facility is now set to be completed in the autumn of 2022, and may eventually cost more than Â£1bn. In its annual report,,externalthe Infrastructure and Projects Authority (IPA) gave the overall project an ""amber/red"" ranking, meaning delivery of the project "" is in doubt with major risks or issues apparent in a number of key areas"". On 19 November, the Health Service Journalreported that the IPA's rating for the project has since been downgraded to ""red"".,externalThis means it ""appears to be unachievable and there are major issues with project definition, schedule, budget, quality and/or delivery of benefits, which at this stage do not appear to be manageable or resolvable"". The new report has not been published but has not been denied by the government. The DHSC told the BBC that a ""red"" rating was not unusual for a programme at this early stage of its development and that it does not reflect any delays to individual schemes in the programme. When the BBC asked the DHSC for an update in June 2022, a spokesperson reiterated the pledge to deliver the new hospitals ""by the end of the decade"" and said the first of these hospitals ""opened for patients last year and a further six are in construction."" They later confirmed that this was the Northern Centre for Cancer Care, a new clinical building at the Cumberland Infirmary in Carlisle, which opened in August 2021. This article was first published in December 2021 and has been updated to include the National Audit Office comments and a progress update from the DHSC. Additional reporting by Eleanor Frost.

Hospital uses buckets catch rain,"The roof of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in King's Lynn is having to be supported by wooden and steel props Staff at a hospital with 1,500 props supporting its roof have had to plan where to place buckets when it rains. The Queen Elizabeth Hospital, in King's Lynn, Norfolk, has steel and wooden posts in 56 areas. Karon Strong, head of nursing for medicine, said staff knew ""exactly where the buckets would need to go"" to catch water when rain was forecast. ""It's not what staff want to experience and it's not what the staff want for the patients either,"" she said. ""You'll walk down a corridor, you'll walk down a bay and we've got buckets catching water. ""As you can imagine, if you're a patient lying in a bed, and looking up, its really quite a frightening experience for the patient."" Karon Strong, head of nursing for medicine, said the roof situation was bad for both patients and staff Last year,hospital board papers,externalsaid the situation posed a""direct risk to the life and safety of patients"". Jackie Rushbrooke said her husband Reg, who has been in hospital for two weeks, was ""quite frightened"" by the props. ""He mentioned it when he first came in,"" she said, while praising the quality of nursing care. She added: ""I think when he's in bed and that's all he can see, it's frightening sometimes for him."" Jackie Rushbrooke said her husband Reg was rather ""frightened"" by the props supporting the roof Caroline Shaw, hospital chief executive, reassured patients the roof was safe and said a team was checking it on a daily basis. She understood some patients might find the situation ""frightening"" and said staff were doing all they could to explain the situation to patients. Ms Shaw, who previously ran a city hospital in Nottingham, said she was ""hugely shocked by the environment here, and by the state of the hospital, and I guess really by the lack of capital investment in the past"". She said she was ""absolutely determined"" to get a new hospital. Necton Ward is the latest area to be fitted with roof supports In 2020, the government announced40 hospitals would be built by 2030,externalas part of a package worth Â£3.7bn, with a further eight schemes invited to bid for future funding. The trust is waiting to hear if it will be one of those eight across England that will be chosen to get a new hospital. The hospital opened in 1980 and was one of seven hospitals built using a material called reinforced autoclaved aerated concrete. This material hasserious weaknesses and is deteriorating, with uncertainty over its structural integrity leading to more than Â£100m being spent this financial year on safety measures across the affected sites.

Succession contest begins after Johnson resigns,"Jeremy Hunt lost to Boris Johnson in a Tory leadership contest in 2019 Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt is considering a Tory leadership bid as the race to succeed Boris Johnson heats up following his dramatic resignation. Allies claim Mr Hunt is attracting a lot of support from Tory colleagues. Senior backbencher Tom Tugendhat and Attorney General Suella Braverman have already announced plans to stand. Mr Johnson was forced out as Tory leader after a cabinet revolt over his leadership but wants to stay on as PM until the party chooses a successor. Opposition parties and some Tories want him to go now - but that appears unlikely to happen and prime ministers have stayed on during leadership transitions in the past. He hasappointed a new cabinet line-up,replacing ministers that resigned in protest at his leadership, and has told them he will not ask them to make major policy decisions until a new leader is in place. Follow the latest updates on the race to succeed Johnson PM's Chequers wedding party moved after criticism Sir Geoffrey Clifton-Brown, the treasurer of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs, said in an ""ideal world"" deputy PM Dominic Raab would take over for a few weeks but ""that ship has sailed"". ""We must now live with the fact that Boris Johnson will be prime minister until a successor can be voted on,"" Sir Geoffrey added. THE NEXT PM:Sunak, Truss and other potential candidates WHAT NOW?How a new leader is elected LOST SUPPORT:Five things that led to PM's downfall JOHNSON:The PM who broke all the rules VIDEO:Johnson's career in moments A timetable for the Tory leadership race is due to be confirmed next week and the new prime minister is expected to be in position by September. The Labour Party has threatened to try and unseat the PM immediately through a vote of no confidence, although this would need considerable support among Conservatives to succeed. Labour's Deputy Leader Angela Rayner told the BBC ""the fact he's trying to cling on for the next couple of months is completely unacceptable"". Mr Hunturged Tory MPs to oust the prime minister in a party confidence vote last monthbut has not publicly commented on his leadership ambitions since Mr Johnson quit as party leader. A former health and foreign secretary, Mr Hunt ran for the Conservative leadership in 2019 and made the final two, before being beaten by Mr Johnson in the ballot of party members. The chairman of the Commons foreign affairs committee Mr Tugendhat, launched his leadership bid by writing in theDaily Telegraph,externalon Friday, promising tax cuts and ""new energy and ideas"" for government. ""I have served before - in the military, and now in Parliament. Now I hope to answer the call once again as prime minister,"" said the former soldier, who has been a prominent critic of Mr Johnson. Attorney General Ms Braverman has already confirmed she will stand, while former Brexit minister Mr Baker said he was ""seriously"" considering running after being asked by people to do so. Former Health Secretary Sajid Javid and Transport Secretary Grant Shapps - who both revolted against Mr Johnson - are also considering leadership challenges. So too is Defence Secretary Ben Wallace, a bookmakers' favourite who is said to be taking soundings from Tory colleagues. In a tweet,external, Mr Wallace addressed speculation ""I'm going to be next prime minister"" by jokingly sharing a picture of an American former basketball player who shares his name. ""I'd vote for you!,"" Mr Wallace wrote. Meanwhile Conservative MPs Rehman Chishti and John Baron have told the BBC they were thinking about running for leadership of the party. ""We need leaders who best reflect modern Britain and can provide solutions to the challenges our nation is facing now,"" said Mr Chishti, a former barrister and UK trade envoy to Pakistan. In what could be a big field of candidates, other Tory MPs tipped to run include: Foreign Secretary Liz Truss Former Chancellor Rishi Sunak Home Secretary Priti Patel Trade minister Penny Mordaunt Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng More declarations are expected in the coming days, but some senior Tories have already said they will not be running, including former Levelling Up Secretary Michael Gove, Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab and former Health Secretary Matt Hancock. It may not surprise you to discover that Westminster is a postcode which doesn't suffer a deficit of ambition. The wannabes will fight a popularity contest among Tory MPs in the next few weeks, and should two of them be left at the end of that process, Conservative Party members will get the final say over the summer. Somewhere between 100,000 and 200,000 people will be charged with selecting the next head of our government on our behalf. It is a safe bet the next prime minister will be a very different character to Boris Johnson. Given the manner and motivations behind his toppling, being seen to ooze integrity and revere truth are qualities all the candidates will aspire to illustrate. But beyond that there will be an intriguing debate about what it means to a Conservative in 2022. When a new leader assumes office, the political landscape will instantly shift. More from Chris Nearly 60 Conservative MPs have quit government roles in recent days at both senior and junior levels, raising doubts about the government's ability to function. Speaking to his newly appointed cabinet on Thursday, Mr Johnson promised he wouldnot use his remaining time in No 10 to make ""major changes of direction"". On Friday, the PM's spokesman said the government will focus on delivering pre-agreed policy and manifesto commitments and would not seek to make spending changes.

England heavily beaten by Hardik-inspired India,"This video can not be played Hardik stars with bat and ball against England First Twenty20, Ageas Bowl India 198-8 (20 overs)Pandya 51 (33), Suryakumar 39 (19); Jordan 2-23; Moeen 2-26 England 148 (19.3 overs)Moeen 36 (20); Hardik 4-33 India win by 50 runs Scorecard England lost their first match under new white-ball captain Jos Buttler as Hardik Pandya inspired India to a dominant 50-run victory in the first Twenty20 at the Ageas Bowl. After his side were set a challenging target of 199, Buttler was out for a first-ball duck, bowled by a Bhuvneshwar Kumar inswinger. Hardik then removed Dawid Malan for 21, Liam Livingstone for another duck and Jason Roy for a tortured four from 16 balls, all in his first seven deliveries. England were 33-4 after 6.1 overs and could not recover as they were bowled out in the final over for 148. All-rounder Hardik finished with 4-33 to add to his 51 from 33 balls - the highest score in India's 198-8. The tourists had looked on course for a total well in excess of 200 only to be pegged back by good death bowling, Chris Jordan the pick of England's attack with 2-23. Yet India's impressive performance with the ball ensured they took a 1-0 lead in the three-match series, their white-ball side hitting back after England's stunning Test victory on Tuesday. Buttler's outfit can level the series with victory in the second match at Edgbaston on Saturday before the finale 24 hours later at Trent Bridge. India in England 2022 - fixtures & results Pick your England T20 World Cup side These sides were back in action just two days after England's sensational win at Edgbaston, the hosts riding a wave of momentum created by their Test performances under Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. But these are two entirely different squads and England, without the likes of Jonny Bairstow because of the quick turnaround, could not repeat their red-ball heroics at the start of another new era. These games are significant, not least since they are England's first since the retirement of World Cup-winning captain Eoin Morgan, but also because it is just three months until the T20 World Cup in Australia where both sides be among the favourites. At halfway, India's total looked no more than par, though it proved well beyond England. The opening two overs of England's chase set the tone, Bhuvneshwar and debutant Arshdeep Singh finding lavish swing to the delight of a vibrant, predominately India-supporting crowd. Buttler, the form batter in the world in this format, was bowled by a brilliant delivery which hooped in, cut back off the pitch and flicked pad before going onto the stumps. It was a sorry start to his tenure but the topsy-turvy nature of T20s means he will believe his side can strike back immediately. Buttler's dismissal was backed up brilliantly by Arshdeep, whose first over in international cricket was a maiden. Just as number three Malan began to find his feet by moving to 21 with a fourth boundary, he played onto his stumps off Hardik when trying to run the ball through gully. Livingstone followed just three balls later, gloving a scoop off Hardik to the keeper, and Roy's pain was ended when he sliced an attempted drive to the first ball of the all-rounder's next over into the hands of third man. Moeen Ali and Harry Brook gave England slight hope, both surviving dropped chances in a stand of 61. However, they fell in the same over trying to attack leg-spinner Yuzvendra Chahal to all but end England's hopes. That left England 100-6 and the hosts were seven down an over later when Hardik claimed his fourth - Sam Curran top-edging a hook. Arshdeep took the final two wickets of Reece Topley and Matt Parkinson, his first scalps for India and a reward for his fine opening spell. This video can not be played 'Outstanding!' - Curran makes superb diving catch England's bowling depth is being tested more than their batting by injury and the intense schedule, fast bowlers Jofra Archer and Mark Wood two significant absentees. After a fast start, India captain Rohit Sharma was caught behind for 24 off spinner Moeen Ali, who also had Ishan Kishan caught off a top-edged sweep for eight. England's attack included three left-arm seamers - Tymal Mills, Sam Curran and Reece Topley - and they were all punished by Suryakumar Yadav and Hardik. But the England bowlers came back well. When India were 141-4 after 13 overs a score of 220 looked possible. Jordan used the short ball effectively, bowling bouncers to dismiss Deepak Hooda for 33 and Suryakumar for 39, while Hardik's innings was ended by another short ball from Topley that was hit to deep point. Topley, Jordan and Mills conceded only 20 runs in the last three overs but it proved to be in vain. England captain Jos Buttler, speaking to Sky Sports:""We've been outplayed. India bowled fantastically well and we couldn't get back in the game from that point. ""The ball swung for as long as I can remember in a T20 match. We needed to hit it into the stands to stop it swinging. But credit to India I thought they were fantastic."" India captain Rohit Sharma, speaking to Sky Sports:""A great performance from ball one. The pitch was good so you could back yourself. At no point did we think we are trying to take the game ahead of ourselves. We back our basics of the game very well. ""Hardik prepared himself wonderfully from the IPL. His bowling is something he wanted to do more of. He came in, bowled quick, and got rewards for his variation.""
