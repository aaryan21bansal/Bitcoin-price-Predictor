In Dame Deborah's final message, shared by her family, she urged people to ""find a life worth enjoying"". She wrote: ""Take risks; love deeply; have no regrets; and always, always have rebellious hope."" And it is clear she lived by this philosophy - particularly in the final weeks of her life.

Williams beaten in thriller on Wimbledon return,"This video can not be played Wimbledon 2022: Serena Williams loses to Harmony Tan on singles return Wimbledon 2022 on the BBC Venue:All England ClubDates:27 June-10 July Coverage:Live across BBC TV, radio and online with extensive coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Serena Williams' hopes of a victorious return to Wimbledon after a year out ended with a loss to Harmony Tan. The American great, 40, returned to the same Centre Court where she had limped out injured last year with a passionate display in a 7-5 1-6 7-6 (10-7) defeat. Willed on by a fervent crowd, Williams answered questions over her fitness with a dynamic display that put her two points from a win before Tan edged it. The burning question now is surely 'was this her last Wimbledon'? ""That's a question I can't answer,"" she told a news conference. ""I don't know. ""Who knows? Who knows where I'll pop up."" Raducanu and Murray lead the way on day three 'I love being called a trailblazer' - Ons Jabeur column Live scores, results and order of play Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone It is almost a year to the day since Williams limped tearfully off Centre Court after slipping and hurting her right ankle in her first-round match against Aliaksandra Sasnovich. The crowd that day might have wondered if they would ever see the American great back at the grass-court Grand Slam, with age and injury against her. Even she herself admitted while at Eastbourne this month - where she made her comeback in the doubles alongside Ons Jabeur - that she had harboured her own doubts. But Williams walked on to the same court, where she has won seven of her 23 Grand Slam singles titles, to a rousing reception. Now ranked 1,204th in the world, she had needed to request a wildcard to enter the draw. And she soon showed why she was never going to be turned down. Shaking off a slightly rusty start in which she was broken by the Wimbledon debutant in the first game, Williams found her feet - and her voice - as she roared when a smash sealed a break back. The pair traded further breaks, with Williams hitting balls on the run, moving much better than a year out of the sport might have suggested, and delivering some of the trademark powerful shots that have made her one of her sport's all-time greats. But a break for Tan in the 11th game left the Frenchwoman serving for the set, which she sealed with a forehand winner. Such was the excitement at times during some lengthy and high quality points that the umpire even had to remind the packed Centre Court: ""I know it's very exciting but as a courtesy to both players please be quiet during the rallies."" And that was before the roof went on before the start of the second set to raise the decibel level further. Williams held quickly to love and then broke in a near 20-minute second game, which featured 12 deuces, on her way to a 5-0 lead. Tan, 24, earned a morale-boosting hold before Williams served out to take it to a deciding set. The American, whose only matches in the past year were last week's two doubles, broke early in the third but tenacious Tan soon pegged her back. Williams had celebrated as if she had won the match when she broke for 5-4 in the decider but it proved premature when, having led 30-15 while serving for the match, she was broken again. Williams forged a 4-0 lead in the final-set tie-break but it slipped away as Tan delivered some stunning winners and the American netted a forehand on match point. ""For my first Wimbledon it's wow - just wow,"" said world number 115 Tan. ""It's a dream because, you know, I saw Serena on the TV when I was young. She's a legend. When you play her, I was scared. I mean, I was scared when I was on the court, but really happy to be there."" There had always been sense that Williams had unfinished business at Wimbledon after the way her tournament ended after six games last year and one of the big motivating factors behind her return was not wanting that to be her final SW19 memory. She has always remained motivated by the desire to equal Margaret Court's all-time record of 24 Grand Slam singles titles, and her best chance of doing that is likely to be on a fast grass surface. She can take some encouragement from the fact she stayed at a high level during a draining encounter that finished after 22:30 BST and lasted three hours 11 minutes. But whether that is enough to keep her in the sport when she has huge business interests and family life to enjoy remains to be seen. Asked whether she would be OK with this match being her last Wimbledon memory, she was categorical: ""Obviously not. You know me. Definitely not. ""But today I gave all I could do, you know, today. Maybe tomorrow I could have given more. Maybe a week ago I could have given more. But today was what I could do. ""At some point you have to be able to be OK with that."" But she said coming so close to victory made her want to hit the practice courts and she did not rule out an appearance at the US Open in August-September. ""I mean, when you're at home, especially in New York, and the US Open, that being the first place I've won a Grand Slam [in 1999], is something that's always super special. ""There's definitely lots of motivation to get better and to play at home.""

Turkey supports Finland and Sweden Nato bid,"Nato membership would end over 200 years of Swedish non-alignment Nato member Turkey has agreed to support Sweden and Finland's membership of the alliance. It had initially opposed the Nordic countries' bids to join. Turkey was angered by what it saw as their willingness to host Kurdish militants. Sweden and Finland could not join Nato without Turkey's support. Russia strongly opposes the two states joining and has used the expansion of the West's defensive military alliance as a pretext for its war in Ukraine. But Moscow's invasion has had the opposite effect, with the path now clear for the two countries to join Nato. Foreign ministers fromthe three countries signed a joint security pact,externalthat addressed Turkey's concerns. Will Sweden and Finland go from neutral to Nato? Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Sweden agreed to step up its work on Turkish extradition requests of suspected militants. The two Nordic nations will also lift their restrictions on selling weapons to Turkey, he said. Finland's President Niinisto said the three countries signed the joint memorandum ""to extend their full support against threats to each other's security"". Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said it was ""a very important step for Nato"". Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said it ""got what it wanted"" from Sweden and Finland. The two Nordic nations announced their intentions to join Nato in May, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Stoltenberg had suggested the process could move ""very quickly"" as they already shared a close relationship with the alliance. But that was not the case as Nato member Turkey accused the two countries of protecting Kurdish militants and said they would not back their membership. Any Nato enlargement must be approved by all 30 members. Turkey has long accused Sweden of harbouring what it calls militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but Stockholm denies it. Now the two countries have agreed to some of Turkey's demands, and militants will face a crackdown under amendments to Swedish and Finnish law. If Sweden and Finland do become members, it will end over 200 years of Swedish non-alignment. Finland adopted neutrality following a bitter defeat by the Soviet Union during World War Two. Finnish public support for joining Nato was for years at around 20-25%. But since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has shot up to a record high of 79%, according to the latest opinion poll. In Sweden, 60% of the population say it was right to apply, again far higher than before the war. The metaphoric champagne corks will be popping in Nato's senior ranks tonight as the biggest stumbling block is removed to admit two major new members. Finland and Sweden are already modern, Western-leaning democracies with well-trained and well-equipped militaries used to operating in the often challenging conditions of Europe's far North. Their accession, once it is complete, will bring the number of Nato countries bordering the Baltic Sea to eight, effectively turning it into a Nato lake. Russia's two outlets, at St Petersburg and Kaliningrad, will be increasingly isolated, only adding to the Kremlin's paranoia. Finland and Sweden are joining Nato because Russia invaded Ukraine. That invasion was intended to push Nato further from Russia's borders. Instead, it has achieved the exact opposite.

Met Police put into a form of special measures,"The UK's largest police force will have to report to inspectors more regularly The Met Police has been placed into an advanced stage of monitoring, in what Home Secretary Priti Patel has described as ""special measures"". Recently the force has been hit by a series of scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard, the strip-search of Child Q and officers being caught exchanging offensive messages. In February Dame Cressida Dick quit as commissioner. Ms Patel said she backed the move taken by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said in a statement: ""We can confirm that we are now monitoring the Metropolitan Police Service through our Engage process, which provides additional scrutiny and support to help it make improvements."" The Engage level of monitoring is used by HMICFRS when a force ""is not succeeding in managing, mitigating or eradicating"" a cause of concern. PM urges public to trust police after Everard case Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief It means the UK's largest police force will be required to report to inspectors more regularly and could be asked to meet specific crime-fighting targets. The Met could also receive support from the College of Policing, the National Police Chiefs Council or other external organisations. In a statement the force said: ""We recognise the cumulative impact of events and problems that the Met is dealing with. ""We understand the impact this has had on communities and we share their disappointment. ""We are determined to be a police service Londoners can be proud of. We are talking to the inspectorate about next steps."" Other forces that have been the subject of the inspectorate's Engage process includeGreater Manchester Police in 2020andCleveland Constabulary in 2019. Dame Cressida Dick's replacement as commissioner is expected to be announced this summer Ms Patel said it was clear to her the Met Police was falling short in getting ""the basics right"". She said she backed the inspectorate's action and called on both the force and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan ""to take immediate action to begin addressing"" the issues facing the Met. The home secretary added: ""The process to recruit a new commissioner is well under way and I have made clear that the successful candidate must demonstrate sustained improvements in the Met Police in order to regain public trust both in London and across the country. ""The new commissioner will need to deliver on the public's priorities for the police - making our streets safer, bearing down on crime and bringing more criminals to justice, while continuing to recruit thousands of new officers to protect local communities."" The new Met Police commissioner will be appointed by the Queen following a recommendation by Home Secretary Priti Patel Mr Khan said the watchdog had raised very serious concerns and called for ""root-and-branch"" reforms to change the Met Police's performance and culture. He added: ""A series of appalling scandals have not only exposed deep cultural problems but have damaged the confidence of Londoners in the capital's police service. ""The decision by the HMIC to now move the Met into special measures has laid bare the substantial performance failings by the force."" The family of Child Q, the teenager who was strip-searched in Hackney by Met Police officers while she was menstruating, have welcomed the decision taken by the inspectorate. In a statement they said: ""The Met has shown time and again that it cannot do its job properly and its officers' actions have had life-changing, devastating consequences for innocent people across London, including Child Q. ""It is no wonder that there is little to no faith left in the Metropolitan Police. ""We hope the additional scrutiny of special measures will result in permanent change in the force's culture and practices."" By Lucy Gilder BBC Home Affairs Researcher Under the so-called special measures, the Met will face greater scrutiny by inspectors and will be expected to report to them more regularly. Acting Commissioner Sir Stephen House will be required to submit an improvement plan to the HMICFRS for inspection. As part of this process, the Met may receive support to improve from bodies such as the National Police Chiefs' Council. Later on, a policing performance oversight group will consider the changes the Met has made to address its problems. This is the first time in the Met's history that it has been placed under special measures. Greater Manchester Police, Cleveland Police and Gloucestershire Constabulary are the only other police forces in England and Wales who are also being monitored by the HMICFRS.

Hamilton & F1 condemn Piquet over racist language,"Nelson Piquet won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987 Lewis Hamilton has said ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1 after three-time world champion Nelson Piquet used racially abusive language about him. The 69-year-old Brazilian, who won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987, used a racially offensive term to refer to Hamilton in a podcast. Piquet has been condemned by Formula 1, Hamilton's Mercedes team and the FIA. ""It's more than language,"" said seven-time world champion Hamilton. ""These archaic mindsets need to change and have no place in our sport. I've been surrounded by these attitudes and targeted my whole life. ""There has been plenty of time to learn. Time has come for action."" Piquet was discussing the accident between Hamilton and Red Bull driver Max Verstappen on the first lap of last year's British Grand Prix. He described the incident as ""a joke"", said Hamilton had been ""lucky"" only Verstappen crashed, and used a swear word in expressing his opinion that Hamilton had made a mistake. This weekend's British Grand Prix is the first anniversary of the incident, which was one of a series between the two drivers as they disputed last year's world title - a championship decided in controversial circumstances at the 2021 finale in Abu Dhabi. An F1 statement said: ""Discriminatory or racist language is unacceptable in any form and has no part in society. ""Lewis is an incredible ambassador for our sport and deserves respect."" It added: ""His tireless efforts to increase diversity and inclusion are a lesson to many and something we are committed to at F1."" Piquet, who is the father of Verstappen's partner Kelly Piquet, has a history of making unsavoury and unpleasant statements. During his driving career, he publicly questioned Ayrton Senna's sexuality and called his rival ""the Sao Paulo taxi driver"". He also made offensive comments about Nigel Mansell and the Briton's wife when they were team-mates at Williams. ""We condemn in the strongest terms any use of racist or discriminatory language of any kind,"" said Mercedes. ""Lewis has spearheaded our sport's efforts to combat racism, and he is a true champion of diversity on and off track. ""Together, we share a vision for a diverse and inclusive motorsport, and this incident underlines the fundamental importance of continuing to strive for a brighter future."" The FIA, motorsport's governing body, said: ""The FIA strongly condemns any racist or discriminatory language and behaviour, which have no place in sport or wider society. ""We express our solidarity with Lewis Hamilton and fully support his commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion in motor sport.""

Population of England and Wales up 6% in a decade,"The population of England and Wales has risen to 59,597,300, the first results from the 2021 census have shown. It grew by more than 3.5 million (6.3%) since the previous census in 2011, and has more people over 65 than ever. When added to published census figures for Northern Ireland and official estimate of the Scottish population for 2020, the UK population now stands at 66,966,400. The rise is one of the biggest since the census began in 1801. And it shows the population rose in each of the English regions and Wales. The census, carried out every 10 years by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), asks people to answer questions about themselves, their household and their home to build a detailed snapshot of society. The results are intended to help organisations make decisions on planning and funding public services such as transport, education and healthcare. The 2021 survey was carried out on 21 March last year, and came against the backdrop of Brexit -  which has seen restrictions on immigration - and the coronavirus pandemic. It is in the local detail where this census will have its biggest impact. The population of each local authority dictates how much funding the council gets, so if the figure published on Tuesday is markedly below the population projection for that area, it could mean budget cuts. The number of people in Kensington and Chelsea on census day was 10% lower than the figure at the previous census in 2011. Westminster was down 7%. One theory is that some of the wealthier residents had gone to their second or third homes during the pandemic. Among the places which saw the biggest increases were Tewkesbury and Vale of White Horse on the edge of the Cotswolds. The figures show one sixth (18.6%, 11.1 million) of the population in 2021 are now over 65 - up from 16.4% (9.2 million) in 2011. Some 0.9% of the population, 527,900 people, are now aged 90 or over. In 2011 that figure was 429,017, or 0.8% of the population. There were 10.4 million people aged 15 and under in 2021, the figures show, making up 17.4% of the population. There are more people in this age group compared with 2011, but the proportion of the overall population aged 15 or under has decreased slightly from 17.6% since 2011. Overall, the highest population growth was in the east of England, which gained approximately 488,000 people from 2011 - an increase of 8.3%. Wales had the smallest population growth, of 1.4%, and the north-east of England increased by 1.9%. Some large towns and cities have seen their populations fall, including Sunderland, Gateshead, Swansea and the London boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Westminster. The place with the biggest increases was the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, where the population grew by 22.1%. Bedford, Cambridge and Peterborough all saw big increases. Your device may not support this visualisation The census counted 30,420,100 women (51.0% of the overall population) and 29,177,200 men (49.0%) in England and Wales. Population growth has slowed slightly across the last decade. Between 2001 and 2011 the figure for England and Wales grew by 7.8%. The census has counted half a million fewer people than was projected. Data from the 2021 census for England and Wales will be published in stages over the next two years, the ONS said. Future releases will include figures on ethnicity, religion, the labour market, education and housing. Also, for the first time, there will be information on UK armed forces veterans, sexual orientation and gender identity.

Wales' population hits new high but growth is lowest,"Pupils from Tonyrefail Primary School in Rhondda Cynon Taf hold up the new population figure for Wales The population of Wales has reached record levels - but it is growing more slowly than in England or any of its regions. The first results of Census 2021 have been published, revealing more than one in five people are now over 65. Newport saw the biggest jump in its population in Wales - up 9.5% since 2011. But seven areas saw population falls, with the 5.8% drop in Ceredigion the third steepest in England and Wales. The population in Wales on Census Day in March 2021 stood at 3,107,500 - up by 44,000 since the previous census 10 years before. But that 1.4% growth compares with a 6.6% rise in England. Even in Newport, which grew the most in Wales over the decade to 159,600, this was only 69th highest rise acrossEngland and Wales. The first set of Census results,published by the Office for National Statistics (ONS),external, also shows: There were 1,586,600 women (51.1% of the population) and 1,521,000 men (48.9%) in Wales, similar ratios to the previous census There were more people than ever before in the older age groups - with 21.3% over 65, up from 18.4% in 2011 The proportion of under 15s fell slightly to 16.5% of the population - down from 16.9% The new population of Wales is 3,107,500 - up from 3,063,456 on Census day in 2011 - and the highest since censuses began 220 years ago. The rate of growth in Wales across the last decade (1.4%) is lower than the growth we saw in the 10 years to 2011, when the population grew by 5.5%. That rate of growth was also lower than any region of England, ranging from 8.3% in the east of England down to 1.9% in north east England, which saw the lowest growth in England. Newport has seen by far the biggest growth in population among Welsh local authorities. Its population has risen by 9.5%, followed by the capital Cardiff - a 4.7% growth to 362,400. New housing alongside the River Usk has sprung up in recent years and the end of the Severn crossing tolls in 2018 may have been a factor in attracting more people to live in Newport. Local estate agent Jonathan Hollins said the city was also competitively priced, compared to its neighbours. ""You can probably get a bigger house with a garden, with a garage, with parking compared to a similar price in say, Cardiff or Bristol,"" he told BBC Wales. ""You've got the M4 motorway, great bus links, you've got a good train service connecting the local area, and you've also got good quality of life."" Population of England and Wales up 6% in a decade Eight things you need to know about the census ONS: Play the census map game,external Bridgend (4.5%) and Vale of Glamorgan (4.3%) have seen the next biggest increases. But seven local authority areas have seen falls in population. The steepest is in Ceredigion, which has seen its population drop from 75,922 to 71,500 (down 5.8%). There are also fewer people in Blaenau Gwent than 10 years ago - a 4.2% fall, while Gwynedd's population has declined by 3.7%. There were also declines in Caerphilly, Anglesey, Conwy and a slight drop in Swansea, while there was zero growth in Merthyr Tydfil. Wales had a larger percentage of people aged over 65 than all regions of England, apart from the south west. More than a fifth (21.3%) of the Welsh population - that's 662,000 people - were aged 65 years and over, up from 18.4% a decade before. That's a higher proportion than in England, where it rose to 18.4%. Powys (27.8%), Conwy (27.4%) and Anglesey (26.4%) have the highest proportions of over 65s. And the over 90s population has risen to 1% (from 0.8%) to 29,700. Conwy has the highest proportion - 1.5%. Pupils from Tonyrefail Primary School in Rhondda Cynon Taf were given lesson from Census officials Wales also had a lower proportion of people aged under 15 - 16.5% - than in England (17.4%) and lower than regions of England, apart from the south west. Newport (19%) and Merthyr Tydfil (18%) had the highest proportions of under 15s, while Ceredigion (13.1%) and Powys (14.4%) had the lowest. Cardiff has seen its population rise by 4.7% in a decade Not surprisingly, London is the most densely populated place across England and Wales, with 5,598 people living in every square kilometre. That's 37 times more densely populated than Wales as a whole. In Wales, there are 150 people for every square kilometre. ONS say this is about the same as 1.1 residents for each area the size of a football pitch. Given the rural nature of large parts of Wales, it's no surprise either that Powys (26 residents per sq km) has the lowest population density. As well as the least dense in Wales, Powys has the lowest population density of any local authority area in England and Wales, along with Eden in Cumbria, which had been out on its own as the lowest in 2011. Ceredigion and Gwynedd are also in the lowest 10 areas for population density. Cardiff (2,572 residents per sq km) is more than three times as densely populated as the next Welsh urban area, Newport (838 people per sq km). But it only ranks 73rd in densest populations in local authorities across England and Wales. Your device may not support this visualisation ONS will be releasing further results from the Census in the months to come. From October, this will include new questions on sexual orientation, gender identity and previous service in the armed forces. Results concerning Welsh language ability will also be published later in 2022. The details the Census provides are used to help policy-makers and organisations make decisions on how to provide a whole range of services in the future.

Dame Deborah was praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, having shared her experiences of treatment and daily life since her diagnosis in 2016. A deputy head teacher, she started a cancer blog, before writing for the Sun and becoming a BBC broadcaster. But on 9 May she announced that she was no longer receiving active care and did not know how long she had left. ""My body just can't continue any more,"" she saidin a post on her @bowelbabe Instagram account,external. She also launched a new fund, called the Bowelbabe fund, to raise money for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients.

Deborah James made a dame by William at her home Deborah James visits rose named for her at Chelsea In May, she was given a damehood by Prince William at her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, where she had chosen to stay. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - who donated to the research fund - praised her ""tireless efforts"" and thanked her for ""giving hope"" to those living with the disease. For her part, Dame Deborah said William's visit was ""surreal"". ""You can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind,"" she said. The money raised through her Bowelbabe fund will support Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Hospital - a specialist cancer treatment facility. Bowel Cancer UK, of which Dame Deborah was a patron, said she had turned her bowel cancer diagnosis ""into an incredible force for good"" and would save countless lives through her campaigning. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the former teacher had an ""incredible energy"" and a ""marvellous knack of making things happen"". Paying tribute to the presenter's awareness-raising work, Ms Edwards said: ""She had this incredible power to connect with people. She leaves a tremendous legacy behind her"". Dame Deborah campaigned to raise awareness about bowel cancer, urging people to check for symptoms, during and after her treatment. Following one operation, while in an anaesthetic daze, she ordered a poo costume online - which she would wear while recording her podcast. Signing off her finalpodcastin May, she said: ""Check your poo. Come on. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo. ""I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere.

This expansion is happening gradually over four years and started in April last year.

Bland died aged 40 in September 2018, two years after being diagnosed with breast cancer. BBC 5 Live presenter Tony Livesey, who was a friend of Dame Deborah and did her final broadcast interview earlier this month, said the campaigner was ""one of the most remarkable women I've ever met"". ""All the fame she's had was a by-product of just the work she wanted to do to save one life,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. BBC News presenter George Alagiah, who is living with bowel cancer, recalled speaking to Dame Deborah at the Royal Marsden Hospital. Mr Alagiah told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the campaigner answered his questions about the symptoms he might experience with the illness.

Supreme Court to rule on Scottish referendum plan,"Nicola Sturgeon names 19 October 2023 for a second independence vote and accepts her plan could be subject to legal scrutiny by the Supreme Court The first minister tells the Scottish Parliament that independence will not be easy but ""will help us chart our own course"" However, opposition leaders at Holyrood tell Ms Sturgeon that she should stop obsessing about another referendum and deal with the pressing issues facing the country today Ms Sturgeon will write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for discussions over establishing the pathway towards a second vote on the country's future When Scotland had the first referendum in 2014 it was made possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Boris Johnson - have refused to give that order for a second time Following Ms Sturgeon's statement, the PM said the details would be studied ""very carefully"" and the UK government would ""respond properly"" BBC Scotland News This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon proposes 19 October 2023 as date for referendum  That's all from the live page team. Have a lovely evening. James CookScotland Editor, BBC News The Queen attended an armed forces parade in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to address the
Scottish Parliament this afternoon, the British state was putting on a show
just over the road. At the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the armed forces were
paying tribute to the Queen in an act of loyalty parade - a rare public
appearance for the monarch these days. Of course it's not the 400-year-old
union of the Scottish and English crowns which the first minister wants to
dissolve, but the 300-year-old union of the parliaments. How? Part one of her
strategy is to try her luck in the Supreme Court, where many legal scholars
expect her to lose. If she does, part two kicks in - fighting the next general
election on the single issue of independence to try to generate political
rather than legal pressure. For its part the UK government appears confident
that Scottish voters do not want a referendum now - and the polls appear to support
that position. But ""not now"" is by definition not a long-term
strategy unless it is accompanied by a decline in support for independence. Given that polls also suggest leaving the UK is especially popular among
younger voters, it's not just Ms Sturgeon who is gambling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In the immediacy, Holyrood will go into its summer recess
after FMQs on Thursday. The first minister will be hoping she has charged things
up for a season of people engaging with the debate on independence. The Supreme Court is also due to go on its summer holidays
from 29 July. It is not yet clear when judges might consider the matter of
indyref2. The case will be referred directly to the President of the
court â Lord Reed, a Scottish judge â to decide how and when it will move
forward. In the meantime, the Scottish government will continue
building the case for independence, with detailed policy papers expected on
issues like currency and borders to come. Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says her party and the SNP were elected to Holyrood to deliver an independence referendum. ""With the best legal advice in the world you still need to take the matter to court so the first minister is quite right to push the point so there can be no question that any referendum we have is absolutely legal,"" she says. ""Knowing the legal status of that bill means we could move forward with a common understanding and the unionists will have to engage in the debate. If they think the Union is so great, why can they not say so? I think it is because they can't put a good case for the Union and they are afraid they are going to lose this time."" Loran Slater, Scottish Greens co-leader Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says he does not think there will be another referendum next year. Mr Cole-Hamilton tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that the lord advocate, Scotland's top law officer, should be questioned by the Scottish Parliament. He says it is very likely that she told the first minister that her plans for a referendum were illegal under the terms of the Scotland Act and that will be proven in the Supreme Court. Mr Cole-Hamilton says it is a ""sad and depressing day"" and ""a criminal waste of time and oxygen"" when there are many other things we should be focussing on. Craig Hoy, from the Scottish Conservatives, says Nicola Sturgeon has wasted more time in the Scottish Parliament talking about the independence referendum. ""I think it is quite clear this is the wrong priority and it is only right therefore that we do not engage,"" he tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime radio programme. Mr Hoy says it is for the Scottish government to debate how to bring forward an independence referendum because it is them who want to have it. ""It is quite clear from opinion polls that the Scottish people don't support another referendum next year and I'm not going to play the first minister's games,"" he adds. The Tory MSP insists the Scottish government should be focusing on the big issues it has powers over right now. Neil Gray says: ""Obviously we set out in the election last year that we wanted to give the people of Scotland their say over their future."" When you combine the SNP and the Greens there is an overwhelming majority at Holyrood for independence, the SNP minister says. He says his first preference would be for Boris Johnson to respect democracy, respect the will of the Scottish people and negotiate over a section 30 order. Mr Gray accepts the prime minister has said now is not the time for indyref2, so the SNP are looking to establish the legality of the Scottish Parliament progressing with a referendum bill to ensure they can enact the wishes of the people of Scotland. The Scottish government's Culture, Europe and International Development Minister, Neil Gray, tellsRadio Scotland's Drivetimehe thinks Nicola Sturgeon's route map is the right way to proceed. ""We're honouring the mandate that was given to the Scottish government,"" he says. ""An overwhelming majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament last year were elected on a prospectus of delivering a second independence referendum ""So first and foremost this is about respecting democracy."" He says he hopes the Supreme Court finds in his party's favour, but if it's unsuccessful they will make the next general election a de facto referendum. That would leave it to the Scottish people to have their democratic say, he says. So, 19 October 2023. That's the date when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would like to hold a second referendum on Scottish Independence. Legal approval for such a vote currently lies with the Supreme Court. But if that avenue proves unforthcoming then it is always within the gift of the prime minister to allow it to take place. Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""It's just a massive distraction. ""I would be very interested to see the actual legal advice the lord advocate has given the first minister, because it's clear that the bill is going to the Supreme Court first, in order to determine whether or not it's legal."" Mr Murray points out that without a section 30 agreement, a referendum is not legal. He says we are going to spend the next 18 months talking about the process of a referendum rather than key issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Speaking to reporters as he flew from the G7 summit in Germany
to the Nato summit in Spain, the prime minister was asked about Nicola
Sturgeonâs plans, which she announced while Boris Johnson was in the air. Mr Johnson said: ""I haven't seen anything she's said yetâ¦.We'll study it very
carefully and respond properly."" I think the focus of the country should be building a stronger economy. I certainly think that we'll have a stronger economy and a stronger country together."" Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Prof Aileen
McHarg, a public law expert from Durham University, says Ms Sturgeon made a ""clever move"" today. She says it was ""unexpected"" that the reference to the Supreme Court would happen in advance of a bill being passed by parliament. Prof McHarg knows of only one previous use of the procedure - by the attorney general for Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court refused to hear that case, she says. ""This is quite an obscure process, but I think it is quite a clever way to avoid all those arguments that you would have expected about the lawfulness of a bill as the legislation is going through the parliament."" She says it's a difficult call to suggest how the case would go. Prof McHarg adds: ""The test they will be applying is: is there more than a loose or consequential connection between this bill, or proposed legislation, and the reserved matter of the Union?"" The UK government has been quick to issue its response to Nicola Sturgeon's statement. âWe
are clear that now is not the time to be talking about another independence
referendum,"" a spokesperson said. âPeople
across Scotland want to see both of their governments working together on the
issues that matter to them. That includes tackling the cost of living, ensuring
energy security, leading the international response against Russiaâs invasion
of Ukraine and growing our economy. That remains our priority. âA
decision has been taken by the First Minister to publish a Bill, and the Lord
Advocate has made a referral to the UK Supreme Court. UK Government law
officers will now consider their response.â The spokesperson adds that the UK government will
respond to the first ministerâs letter to the prime minister in due course and its clear
view is that the constitution is reserved to Westminster. Pamela
Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, says Nicola Sturgeon ""is acting against the will of the people of Scotland"". She adds: âPoll after poll shows that the vast majority of us do not want a second
referendum. âThe first ministerâs announcement is a disgraceful waste of resources and
public money. The job of government is to focus on the peopleâs priorities â cutting NHS waiting times, improving education standards, tackling the climate emergency, creating more affordable housing, investing in social care, and growing our economy. Rather than divide the people of Scotland, as part of the UK we can invest more in public services and bring our communities together.â Pamela Nash, Scotland in Union chief executive In 2014, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for power to hold a referendum to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood Alex Salmond has given his reaction to Nicola Sturgeon's statement on indyref2. The former first minister says he welcomes the fact that ""we now have some clarity of purpose on independence
and that a starting gun has finally been fired with a clear timetable leading
to 19th October next
year"". He adds: ""However, we need a united movement and grassroots campaign to deliver
success. In particular, voices outwith government will be needed so that the
cause of independence is not weighed down by the day-to-day troubles of the
SNP/Green coalition. ""We should not give up on bending Boris Johnson to the peopleâs will on
a section 30 order to deliver a referendum under the same terms I previously
negotiated in the Edinburgh Agreement which enabled the referendum in 2014. ""There has never been a weaker UK prime minister. But that will require a
concerted campaign of popular, parliamentary and diplomatic initiatives. And it
is urgency which is required to stop Westminster taking Scotland to the
cleaners on a daily basis."" You can hear John Beattie's interview with Mr Salmond after the 16:30 news on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. Just click on the tab at the top of this page. The question of Scottish sovereignty can also not simply be left to the UK Supreme Court.  The concept of using the UK general election as a backstop will cause a wry smile to those within the SNP and in the wider movement who have been calling for that for the last five years. However, even then, we need to be prepared with the popular campaign which will be required to force recognition of Scotland's Claim of Right.â Alex Salmond, Former first minister Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent Scotland's Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain The fact Lord Advocate Dorothy
Bain is prepared to personally represent the Scottish government in this
case means it can be viewed as a genuine enterprise, not just some political
âwheeze.â But this remains a gamble for the first minister. The Supreme Court could rule there's no case
to answer, that the Scotland Act clearly reserves powers over the Union to
Westminster. The judges might decline to consider draft
legislation that is still subject to amendment, preferring instead to rule on a
finished bill. The stakes are high. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Downing Street has said it will âcarefully study
the detailsâ of Nicola Sturgeonâs proposal to hold a referendum on Scottish
independence in October 2023. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesman said the UK governmentâs
position remained unchanged. âBoth ours and the Scottish government's priority should be working together
with a relentless focus on the issues that we know matter to people up and down
the country,â the spokesman said. âBut a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully
study the details of the proposal and the Supreme Court will now consider
whether to accept the Scottish government's Lord Advocate referral.â Asked about whether the next general election would becoming a ""de facto
referendum"" as the first minister had suggested, the spokesman said they
would not get into âhypotheticalsâ. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent What was announced today is essentially a twist on Nicola
Sturgeonâs original plan for a referendum. That was to ask for a transfer of power from Westminster,
publish a bill and pass it through Holyrood, then defend it from legal
challenge in court. What changed today was that Ms Sturgeon isnât going to wait
for a legal challenge to her bill â instead, her government has moved to
trigger an immediate Supreme Court showdown, to settle the question of
competence once and for all. There may be a lot of familiar elements here, but if this
puts the legal argument to bed it will be a tangible step forward for the
independence debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia strongly opposes the two states joining and has used the expansion of the West's defensive military alliance as a pretext for its war in Ukraine. But Moscow's invasion has had the opposite effect, with the path now clear for the two countries to join Nato. Foreign ministers fromthe three countries signed a joint security pact,externalthat addressed Turkey's concerns. Will Sweden and Finland go from neutral to Nato? Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Sweden agreed to step up its work on Turkish extradition requests of suspected militants. The two Nordic nations will also lift their restrictions on selling weapons to Turkey, he said. Finland's President Niinisto said the three countries signed the joint memorandum ""to extend their full support against threats to each other's security"". Sweden's Prime Minister Magdalena Andersson said it was ""a very important step for Nato"". Turkey President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's office said it ""got what it wanted"" from Sweden and Finland. The two Nordic nations announced their intentions to join Nato in May, in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Mr Stoltenberg had suggested the process could move ""very quickly"" as they already shared a close relationship with the alliance. But that was not the case as Nato member Turkey accused the two countries of protecting Kurdish militants and said they would not back their membership. Any Nato enlargement must be approved by all 30 members. Turkey has long accused Sweden of harbouring what it calls militants from the banned Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), but Stockholm denies it. Now the two countries have agreed to some of Turkey's demands, and militants will face a crackdown under amendments to Swedish and Finnish law. If Sweden and Finland do become members, it will end over 200 years of Swedish non-alignment. Finland adopted neutrality following a bitter defeat by the Soviet Union during World War Two. Finnish public support for joining Nato was for years at around 20-25%. But since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it has shot up to a record high of 79%, according to the latest opinion poll. In Sweden, 60% of the population say it was right to apply, again far higher than before the war. The metaphoric champagne corks will be popping in Nato's senior ranks tonight as the biggest stumbling block is removed to admit two major new members. Finland and Sweden are already modern, Western-leaning democracies with well-trained and well-equipped militaries used to operating in the often challenging conditions of Europe's far North. Their accession, once it is complete, will bring the number of Nato countries bordering the Baltic Sea to eight, effectively turning it into a Nato lake. Russia's two outlets, at St Petersburg and Kaliningrad, will be increasingly isolated, only adding to the Kremlin's paranoia. Finland and Sweden are joining Nato because Russia invaded Ukraine. That invasion was intended to push Nato further from Russia's borders. Instead, it has achieved the exact opposite.

Met Police put into a form of special measuresThe force has been hit by a number of scandals in recent years including the murder of Sarah Everard.London,"The UK's largest police force will have to report to inspectors more regularly The Met Police has been placed into an advanced stage of monitoring, in what Home Secretary Priti Patel has described as ""special measures"". Recently the force has been hit by a series of scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard, the strip-search of Child Q and officers being caught exchanging offensive messages. In February Dame Cressida Dick quit as commissioner. Ms Patel said she backed the move taken by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said in a statement: ""We can confirm that we are now monitoring the Metropolitan Police Service through our Engage process, which provides additional scrutiny and support to help it make improvements."" The Engage level of monitoring is used by HMICFRS when a force ""is not succeeding in managing, mitigating or eradicating"" a cause of concern. PM urges public to trust police after Everard case Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief It means the UK's largest police force will be required to report to inspectors more regularly and could be asked to meet specific crime-fighting targets. The Met could also receive support from the College of Policing, the National Police Chiefs Council or other external organisations. In a statement the force said: ""We recognise the cumulative impact of events and problems that the Met is dealing with. ""We understand the impact this has had on communities and we share their disappointment. ""We are determined to be a police service Londoners can be proud of. We are talking to the inspectorate about next steps."" Other forces that have been the subject of the inspectorate's Engage process includeGreater Manchester Police in 2020andCleveland Constabulary in 2019. Dame Cressida Dick's replacement as commissioner is expected to be announced this summer Ms Patel said it was clear to her the Met Police was falling short in getting ""the basics right"". She said she backed the inspectorate's action and called on both the force and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan ""to take immediate action to begin addressing"" the issues facing the Met. The home secretary added: ""The process to recruit a new commissioner is well under way and I have made clear that the successful candidate must demonstrate sustained improvements in the Met Police in order to regain public trust both in London and across the country. ""The new commissioner will need to deliver on the public's priorities for the police - making our streets safer, bearing down on crime and bringing more criminals to justice, while continuing to recruit thousands of new officers to protect local communities."" The new Met Police commissioner will be appointed by the Queen following a recommendation by Home Secretary Priti Patel Mr Khan said the watchdog had raised very serious concerns and called for ""root-and-branch"" reforms to change the Met Police's performance and culture. He added: ""A series of appalling scandals have not only exposed deep cultural problems but have damaged the confidence of Londoners in the capital's police service. ""The decision by the HMIC to now move the Met into special measures has laid bare the substantial performance failings by the force."" The family of Child Q, the teenager who was strip-searched in Hackney by Met Police officers while she was menstruating, have welcomed the decision taken by the inspectorate. In a statement they said: ""The Met has shown time and again that it cannot do its job properly and its officers' actions have had life-changing, devastating consequences for innocent people across London, including Child Q. ""It is no wonder that there is little to no faith left in the Metropolitan Police. ""We hope the additional scrutiny of special measures will result in permanent change in the force's culture and practices."" By Lucy Gilder BBC Home Affairs Researcher Under the so-called special measures, the Met will face greater scrutiny by inspectors and will be expected to report to them more regularly. Acting Commissioner Sir Stephen House will be required to submit an improvement plan to the HMICFRS for inspection. As part of this process, the Met may receive support to improve from bodies such as the National Police Chiefs' Council. Later on, a policing performance oversight group will consider the changes the Met has made to address its problems. This is the first time in the Met's history that it has been placed under special measures. Greater Manchester Police, Cleveland Police and Gloucestershire Constabulary are the only other police forces in England and Wales who are also being monitored by the HMICFRS.

"Hamilton & F1 condemn Piquet over racist languageLewis Hamilton says ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1.","Nelson Piquet won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987 Lewis Hamilton has said ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1 after three-time world champion Nelson Piquet used racially abusive language about him. The 69-year-old Brazilian, who won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987, used a racially offensive term to refer to Hamilton in a podcast. Piquet has been condemned by Formula 1, Hamilton's Mercedes team and the FIA. ""It's more than language,"" said seven-time world champion Hamilton. ""These archaic mindsets need to change and have no place in our sport. I've been surrounded by these attitudes and targeted my whole life. ""There has been plenty of time to learn. Time has come for action."" Piquet was discussing the accident between Hamilton and Red Bull driver Max Verstappen on the first lap of last year's British Grand Prix. He described the incident as ""a joke"", said Hamilton had been ""lucky"" only Verstappen crashed, and used a swear word in expressing his opinion that Hamilton had made a mistake. This weekend's British Grand Prix is the first anniversary of the incident, which was one of a series between the two drivers as they disputed last year's world title - a championship decided in controversial circumstances at the 2021 finale in Abu Dhabi. An F1 statement said: ""Discriminatory or racist language is unacceptable in any form and has no part in society. ""Lewis is an incredible ambassador for our sport and deserves respect."" It added: ""His tireless efforts to increase diversity and inclusion are a lesson to many and something we are committed to at F1."" Piquet, who is the father of Verstappen's partner Kelly Piquet, has a history of making unsavoury and unpleasant statements. During his driving career, he publicly questioned Ayrton Senna's sexuality and called his rival ""the Sao Paulo taxi driver"". He also made offensive comments about Nigel Mansell and the Briton's wife when they were team-mates at Williams. ""We condemn in the strongest terms any use of racist or discriminatory language of any kind,"" said Mercedes. ""Lewis has spearheaded our sport's efforts to combat racism, and he is a true champion of diversity on and off track. ""Together, we share a vision for a diverse and inclusive motorsport, and this incident underlines the fundamental importance of continuing to strive for a brighter future."" The FIA, motorsport's governing body, said: ""The FIA strongly condemns any racist or discriminatory language and behaviour, which have no place in sport or wider society.

"Russia threat requires Army cash boost - ministerBut the PM, on his way to a Nato summit, says the UK is the world's third biggest defence spender.UKComments","The UK has donated weapons to Ukraine, including next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW) Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has urged the prime minister to increase spending on the UK's armed forces in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a speech, he said funding must react to the ""direct"" threat Russia poses to Europe. The UK currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defence, matching the target Nato sets for its members. But Mr Wallace has reportedly written to the PM asking for an increase to 2.5% by 2028. He later denied the 2.5% figure but at a conference hosted by the Royal United Services Institute think tank (Rusi), said investment needs to continue to grow before it ""becomes too late"". He described Russia as the ""most direct and pressing threat to Europe"" and said it was ""increasingly clear President Putin cannot be deterred by threat of punishment or the costs imposed upon his people"". ""I'm serious when I say there is a very real danger that Russia will lash out against wider Europe,"" Mr Wallace added. Boris Johnson, on his way to a Nato summit in Madrid, said the defence alliance had ""never been of more vital importance"" and described it as the ""indispensable guarantor of European security"". The PM said the UK was the third biggest defence spender in the world, with it allocating 2.3% of its national income. ""We've another Â£24bn going in under the current spending review, the biggest since the end of the Cold War"", he added. The prime minister also defended a decision to break a manifesto promise to raise defence spending by more than inflation every year in this parliament, saying: ""It should be looked at over the life of a parliament, not a single data point."" An assessment by Nato, published this week, indicated that the UK spent an estimated 2.26% of GDP on defence in 2021 and was on course for 2.12% in 2022. BBC political editor Chris Mason said it would have been more surprising if the government had stuck to the commitment given the rate at which prices were rising. Boris Johnson earlier declined to comment when asked about future defence spending levels on the final day of the G7 summit in Germany, but said the UK's commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence was ""a floor not a ceiling."" New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' Ukraine can hit Russia with UK weapons - minister General Sir Patrick Sanders, the new head of the Army, spoke at the same Rusi conference and outlined his plans to mobilise forces to deter Russian escalation of hostilities. He said he had never known such a clear threat ""as the brutal aggression of President Putin"" and likened the current conflict in Ukraine to the build-up to World War Two, describing it as a ""1937 moment"" - when the UK allowedHitler to expand German territory unchecked,external. ""We're living through a period of history as profound as the one our forebears did 80 years ago,"" he said. The mobilisation effort must start now to prevent war, not provoke it, according to the general. Gen Sir Patrick became chief of the Army earlier this month Allies' readiness and spending on defence was already on the agenda at the summit of Nato leaders in Madrid, which runs until Thursday. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has already made clear he wants a target of members spending at least 2% of their annual national income on defence. Earlier, Nato's former deputy supreme commander, Sir Richard Shirreff, told the BBC the UK and its allies must build up its deterrent presence in order to prevent further Russian escalation. Nato had come a long way since the start of the conflict, he said, and every member state should equip their armed forces so they were ready for an offensive. The UK governmentsaid it was spending Â£1.3bn ($1.6bn) on military support for Ukraine, including sending long-range rocket systems. Anti-tank weapons, short-range missiles, armoured vehicles, drones and air defence systems have also been donated to the country.

The story of Ghislaine Maxwell's downfall,"She was the toast of high society in London and New York. Now Ghislaine Maxwell has been sentenced to 20 years in jail for grooming and trafficking underage girls. Ghislaine Maxwell was born on Christmas Day 1961. Three days later, a car carrying her 15-year-old brother Michael crashed into a lorry along a foggy Oxfordshire road. Michael Maxwell would spend the remaining seven years of his life in a coma. Although she had been born into material abundance - her father was the publishing tycoon Robert Maxwell - by every account, Ghislaine Maxwell's earliest years were disfigured by emotional neglect. Betty, her mother, later admitted in her memoir that after Michael's accident the baby ""was hardly given a glance"" by her devastated parents. One day in 1965, according to Betty, three-year-old Ghislaine Maxwell stood in front of her and declared: ""Mummy, I exist."" Betty also believed the toddler developed anorexia. To compensate, from this point both parents went to the opposite extreme and began lavishing affection on their youngest child. Robert Maxwell with seven of his nine children. Ghislaine Maxwell is pictured sitting on her mother's knee Though she was never spared the abuse and the rages her father would inflict on every one of his offspring, she would soon emerge as his favourite. And, Betty would later write in her 1994 memoir, that favourite daughter ""became spoiled, the only one of my children I can truly say that about"". The charges against Maxwell are so shocking - grooming and sex trafficking girls for abuse by the paedophile financier Jeffrey Epstein - it's tempting to look for an explanation in her dysfunctional childhood. But just as her crimes are impossible to excuse, Maxwell is a difficult woman to comprehend. For a life lived in public, the fine details of her biography have always been unusually elusive. Key moments in the sex trafficking trial How accusers' testimony brought Ghislaine Maxwell down What trial means for Prince Andrew Maxwell was raised in Headington Hill Hall, a vast Italianate mansion overlooking Oxford in the UK. Rather than buying it himself, her plutocrat father had somehow persuaded its owner, Oxford City Council, to rent it to him for a minimal sum in return for renovating the property. It was, he said, ""the best council house in the country"". Throughout Ghislaine Maxwell's childhood, lavish parties were thrown at Headington Hill Hall, with politicians, celebrities and media grandees in attendance. But after the VIPs had left the building it was a deeply emotionally austere place to grow up. Robert Maxwell had risen from extreme poverty in a Czechoslovak Jewish settlement - most of his family were murdered in the Holocaust - to become a British Army war hero, then an academic publishing magnate, a Labour MP and eventually owner of the Daily Mirror, one of the UK's biggest-selling newspapers. As a businessman, he was reviled as a bully. At home, meanwhile, he is depicted in Fall, John Preston's biography, as a ""draconian father"" who abused his children both physically and verbally. Robert Maxwell at a party on his yacht with daughter Ghislaine Maxwell and wife Betty, circa 1990 They would be interrogated at the dinner table about geopolitics or their plans for the future and reduced to tears if he considered their answers unsatisfactory. ""He would beat us with a belt - girls as well as boys,"" another of Robert's offspring, Ian, told Preston. Although his favourite, Ghislaine Maxwell wasn't immune from any of this. But while some of her siblings withdrew or rebelled, she was always anxious to please her father - she told Tatler in 2000 he was an ""inspiring"" parent - and dedicated herself to keeping him happy. It must have worked, after a fashion - Maxwell Snr later named his private yacht theLady Ghislaine, rather than after Betty or his three older daughters. And evidently, he had grand hopes for his youngest daughter - he apparently harboured ambitions of marrying her off to the late John F Kennedy Jnr. She was educated at Marlborough College and Oxford University, where she studied modern history and languages. ""It was very clear to me even as an undergraduate that she was interested in power and money,"" says the writer Anna Pasternak, who was a contemporary at Oxford and moved in the same social circles. ""She was one of those people at parties who always looked over your shoulder to see if there was somebody more powerful or more interesting while she was air-kissing you."" Rachel Johnson, the UK prime minister's sister and another Oxford contemporary, recently raised eyebrows when sherecalled,externalspotting Ghislaine Maxwell across the Balliol junior common room - ""a shiny glamazon with naughty eyes holding court astride a table, a high-heeled boot resting on my brother Boris's thigh."" After graduating, Maxwell's father appointed her as a director at Oxford United, the football club he owned and chaired, and also set her up with her own company supplying corporate gifts. But in the pages of Tatler or Nigel Dempster's Daily Mail gossip column, where she was now a regular fixture, she was usually described as a ""socialite"" rather than a businesswoman. She began dating Count Gianfranco Cicogna, an Italian aristocrat. She also founded a kind of private member's club exclusively for women. Pasternak attended on a few occasions and, while the idea seemed innovative at the time, she considered Maxwell an unlikely feminist champion. ""My recollection is that she was kind of breezily charming to other women, but I don't remember her being a very close friend of another woman,"" Pasternak says. ""I think that women weren't really important to her - only as a means to get to another powerful man."" In January 1991, after her father acquired the struggling New York Daily News, she was dispatched to its headquarters as his representative. It was her point of entry into the social scene of Manhattan. But in November that year, her world was upended. Her father vanished from the deck of theLady Ghislaineoff the Canary Islands and his body was later found floating in the sea. Ghislaine Maxwell flew straight to Las Palmas, where the yacht had been taken. By every account, she was inconsolable at the loss of her father. The day after his death, she was deputed to deliver an emotional speech to the world's press, who had gathered at the quayside. Ghislaine Maxwell, holding a framed photograph of her late father in Jerusalem, 1991 Soon enough it came out that Robert Maxwell had raided the Mirror Group's pension fund of Â£440m ($583m) as part of a scheme to artificially inflate the company's share price at the expense of 32,000 of his employees. Now the Maxwell family and the British government were left to pick up the pieces - the latter eventually paying Â£100m ($132m) towards a bailout of the fund. In June 1992, two of Robert's sons, Ian and Kevin, were arrested and charged with fraud. They were eventually acquitted in January 1996. While her father's guilt was obvious to most people, Ghislaine Maxwell continued to defend him. ""He wasn't a crook,""she told Vanity Fair's Edward Klein,externalin early 1992. ""A thief to me is somebody who steals money. Do I think that my father did that? No. I don't know what he did. Obviously, something happened. Did he put it in his own pocket? Did he run off with the money? No. And that's my definition of a crook."" While the rest of her siblings accepted Robert Maxwell's death was either an accident or suicide, his youngest daughter insisted he must have been murdered. Despite her protests, the fall-out from the Mirror pension scandal made the UK a less than welcoming place for her. In November 1992 it was reported that she had bought a $4,000 (Â£3,019) one-way Concorde ticket to New York. In 2005, Harry Mount was feeling lonely in Manhattan. Aged 33, he'd just been appointed as the Daily Telegraph's New York correspondent but, as yet, knew few people in the city. When a friend asked him if he wanted to tag along with him to a party at Ghislaine Maxwell's house, Mount jumped at the chance. She was, after all, well known as a prominent figure in Manhattan society who'd been photographed with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and even Pope John Paul II. Among the great and the good of US society, her cut-glass British accent and friendship with Prince Andrew marked her out as an exotic, alluring figure. When Mount arrived at her five-storey mansion on the Upper East Side, he was astonished when she bounded towards him and began bombarding him with questions. He recalls her listening intently to his replies as though he were the most fascinating person in the world. ""There was no reason why she should have been particularly friendly to me,"" says Mount, now editor of the Oldie magazine, where he haswritten about their encounter,external. ""She could well have frozen me out while being perfectly polite."" Mount assumed her effusiveness and charm were by-products of her troubled childhood. ""You end up with this mixture of great connections and confidence and you move among the great and the good - but fundamentally, you're not that sure of yourself,"" he says. ""And people who aren't sure of themselves are a bit nicer than those who often are."" It was only later that Mount realised there was something he had missed. Ghislaine Maxwell had reportedly been left with an Â£80,000 ($106,000)-a-year income from a trust fund. It should have occurred to him, he later reflected, that this amount wouldn't have been nearly enough to pay for her opulent house. Years later, prosecutors would suggest the property had been funded by Jeffrey Epstein. At that stage Mount didn't know about her connection to the well-known financier. But before long Epstein's relationship with Maxwell would be scrutinised by every journalist in the city. Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell In 2005, the parents of a 14-year-old girl told police Epstein had molested their daughter, and three years later he received an 18-month prison sentence. After his release, the allegations against him began to snowball. He was accused of running a ""vast network"" of girls for sex. He was arrested again in 2019 on charges of sex trafficking and died in his prison cell just over a month later. Inevitably the authorities' focus turned to Maxwell. Like her father, Epstein was an enormously wealthy man from humble origins - in his case, a working-class neighbourhood in Brooklyn. Also like Robert Maxwell, he would eventually be disgraced and die of an apparent suicide in disputed circumstances. Ghislaine Maxwell's relationship with Epstein was no doubt mutually beneficial. She could introduce him to her wealthy and powerful friends; he in turn had the capital to fund the kind of lifestyle she had grown up to expect. During the trial, as well as emphasising the pair's closeness, prosecutors noted that Maxwell ""was not a particularly wealthy person when she met Epstein"". Certainly, after she returned to New York in the wake her father's death, it was reported that she was working in real estate and living in a $2,000 (Â£1,500)-a-month apartment - a decent standard of living by any means, not least when the trust fund was taken into account, but nonetheless somewhat less than she might have been accustomed to. But the fine details of the relationship are not easy to pin down. When it began, how long it lasted and how exactly it should be characterised were all issues of contention at the trial, which has just concluded. Four charges in Maxwell's trial related to the period 1994-97, when the indictment stated that she was among Epstein's closest associates and also in an ""intimate relationship"" with him. By the 2000s, she was linked with another businessman, Ted Waitt. But it appeared that she carried on working for Epstein. By the time of a2003 profile,external, Epstein described Maxwell as his ""best friend"" and journalist Vicky Ward noted that much of his life appeared to be organised by her.Intimate photosof Maxwell and Epstein together released by prosecutors suggested they had remained close. In court documents, former employees at the Epstein mansion in Palm Beach described her as the house manager who supervised staff, looked after finances and acted as a social co-ordinator. A housekeeper testified that Maxwell gave staff a 58-page instruction manual and ordered them to speak only when spoken to, avoiding eye contact with Epstein. It's tempting to conclude that just as Maxwell learned to appease the whims of her capricious, bullying father, she applied those same skills on Epstein. Whatever the exact nature of their relationship, the prosecution portrayed their closeness as a crucial factor in their pattern of abuse - with Ghislaine Maxwell seeking out and grooming victims for Epstein. In December 2021, a jury found her guilty of five of six counts - including the most serious charge, that of sex trafficking of a minor. ""Ghislaine controlled the girls,"" Sarah Ransome, who says she was abused by Epstein, told the BBC's Panorama programme. ""She would be the one getting all the girls in check. She knew what Jeffrey likedâ¦ this was very much a joint effort."" In the months following Epstein's death, Maxwell went to ground. Newspapersspeculated as to her whereabouts,external. A photograph of her outside a Los Angeles branch of In-N-Out Burger appeared on front pages around the world. Then, in July 2020, she was arrested at her secluded mansion in the US state of New Hampshire. A few months later, it emerged to general surprise that she had married a tech CEO named Scott Borgerson. Maxwell was held at the Metropolitan Detention Centre in Brooklyn. While she waited for her trial to begin, her brother Ian told the BBC's Today programme that she was being held in a 6ft by 9ft (1.8m by 2.7m) cell with a concrete bed. ""She is under 24-hour, around-the-clock surveillance, with 10 cameras, including one that moves and tracks her movement,"" he said. ""She's not allowed to move into the corners of her cell and she's not allowed to be within two and a half feet of the cell door. That is her existence."" It was an ignominious fate for a woman who had spent most of her life surrounded by material riches. It was left to the prosecution to explain why on earth she would commit the crimes that had put her there. Prosecutors suggested money was an incentive. The journalist John Sweeney, who explored the case in his podcast Hunting Ghislaine and is writing a book about it, suggests a deeper psychological motive was at play. ""You can't understand what happened with Jeffrey Epstein without understanding her relationship with her father,"" he says. ""The truth is that Ghislaine learned to service her father and then had to service a second monster - that's what she's done her entire life."" Another similarity between Robert Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein is that both escaped a full reckoning for their crimes. And defence lawyers argued Ghislaine Maxwell was a scapegoat for Epstein - the age-old story of a woman taking the blame for the misdeeds of her partner. But Pasternak dismisses the idea that Maxwell is in any way less culpable than Epstein. ""There is absolutely no way that he could have had access to that many young girls, whose lives they've obliterated, without Ghislaine,"" says the author. While the trial was under way, Ian Maxwell wrote anarticle for The Spectator,externalputting across his sister's defence. It began with a reprimand to the media corps. They'd been pronouncing her name inaccurately, he said. It wasn't ""Jizlaine"". Instead, he insisted, it was ""Giilen"". For anyone following the case, it seemed remarkable that such a basic detail had been so consistently wrong. This was a woman, after all, who had lived her entire life in the news pages and gossip columns. But as the trial progressed it became apparent that so much that had been assumed about her - her relationship status at any one time, the source of her income, and, quite often, her whereabouts - were likely not as they seemed. Her crimes surely defy explanation, too. And for all that her rise and fall were conducted in public, Ghislaine Maxwell remains unknowable.

The damning testimony that brought Maxwell down,"The first time I saw Ghislaine Maxwell, I followed her from the door of her luxurious brownstone down the streets of Manhattan, asking her about the horrific allegations against her. Nearly a decade later, I saw her for the final time, in court and no longer able to run away from the truth about her life with Jeffrey Epstein. This is one of the most high-profile convictions of a woman for enabling a sex trafficking ring. And most importantly, it's a major victory for the more than 100 accusers who fought for more than a decade to have Epstein and his co-conspirators face criminal charges. The 60-year-old daughter of a British media tycoon has been found guilty of grooming and trafficking girls as young as 14 years old for sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. There were several powerful moments inside a packed courtroom in New York City, mainly from the prosecution which kept its case simple to avoid overwhelming the jury. Their aim was to show Maxwell was Epstein's partner in crime, a sexual predator whose modus operandi was clearly illustrated by four victims' experiences. Follow reaction to the verdict The prosecution's opening statement to the jury began with 11 words that sounded like the start of a children's book. ""I want to tell you about a young girl named Jane."" But for these women this was no fairytale. It was a nightmare and it was very real. How real became apparent the following day when Jane took the stand. She testified that Maxwell and Jeffrey Epstein approached her when she was 14 years old at a summer arts camp in 1994. Over the next two years, she said she was abused about every other week with Maxwell sometimes taking part. This was one of her key exchanges with prosecutors: Q. What was Maxwell's demeanour like during these incidents? A. I would say that it seemed very casual, like it was - like it was very normal, like it was not a big deal. Q. And when she behaved like that, how did that make you feel? A. Well, it made me feel confused because that did not feel normal to me; I'd never seen anything like this or felt any of this, and it was very embarrassing.  You know, it's all these mixed emotions.  When you're 14, you have no idea what's going on. The other accusers would later recount similar experiences. Maxwell argued she was unaware of Epstein's abuse One of the most heart wrenching testimonies came from Carolyn, who testified under her first name. The woman was visibly broken down by years of trauma and addiction to pain killers and cocaine. She had been raped by her grandfather at four years old, dropped out of school in the 7th grade, and was neglected by a mother who abused substances. Carolyn told the court it was one of Epstein's most outspoken accusers Virginia Roberts, now Virginia Giuffre, that first told her at 14 years old that she could make money by massaging a wealthy friend of hers. Carolyn met Ghislaine Maxwell when she showed up at Epstein's mansion in 2001. Maxwell, she said, told Virginia to take her upstairs to the massage room and ""show her what to do."" Prosecutors told jurors that by this time period, Maxwell had devised a pyramid scheme of abuse that no longer required her to personally find young girls for Epstein. Instead, they would reward vulnerable girls who brought someone new with extra cash. Carolyn was paid hundreds of dollars to ""massage"" Epstein on each of the over 100 encounters until she ""became too old."" She brought three other friends to Epstein. Carolyn said Maxwell once told her ""she had a great body for Epstein and his friends"" before touching her breasts. Maxwell was convicted on five counts: conspiracy to entice minors to travel to engage in illegal sex acts conspiracy to transport minors with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity transportation of a minor with intent to engage in criminal sexual activity conspiracy to commit sex trafficking sex trafficking of minors The teenage girls often came from troubled homes. Their families faced things like bankruptcy, substance abuse or previous sexual assault. And even when they didn't, Ghislaine Maxwell and Epstein lured them in with friendship, gifts, and promises to help their careers or to pay for schooling. That ""grooming"" process, prosecutors said, was a key part of Maxwell's ""playbook."" She then used the ruse of massages as an excuse to get the girls to touch Epstein and to normalise sexual contact. Prosecutors said Maxwell would walk the girls into a room to be molested and abused, and sometimes was present ""to make it all feel normal and casual."" The two other accusers in the indictment were at or over the age of consent in the places the abuse took place, and therefore the judge ruled the sex acts weren't illegal. Still, Kate going by a pseudonym, and Annie Farmer who publicly identified herself, were equally compelling on the stand to prove Maxwell's grooming tactics. Key moments from trial Who is Ghislaine Maxwell? Ghislaine Maxwell's family had complained about her treatment in prison, saying it amounted to torture. Nevertheless, in court Maxwell was an extremely engaged and animated defendant. She carefully studied exhibits, looked witnesses in the eye, and often passed notes to her lawyers to convey her thoughts. She appeared to be in good spirits, hugging her defence team and blowing kisses and waving to her family in court. Her steely defiance was best captured when the judge Alison Nathan asked her if she would testify in her own defence. Instead of responding to the judge with a simple yes or no, she stood up and informed the court that there was ""no need"" for her to do so because the prosecution had not proven its case. Her defence case, in contrast, was less assured. Lawyers called on just nine witnesses over two days. Their strategy relied heavily on poking holes in the case brought by prosecutors, who bear the burden of proving the allegations beyond a reasonable doubt. This video can not be played Watch: The secret lives of Maxwell and Epstein The entire foundation of the prosecution's case rested on the four accusers' credibility. It is because their testimony was so convincing to jurors that Ghislaine Maxwell has been convicted. Legal experts said attacking the women's memories and motives didn't help the defendant. ""Ghislaine Maxwell had the disadvantage of having to explain this parade of young girls who were coming in and out of the home daily underneath her supervision,"" says Mitchell Epner, a former prosecutor. ""She claimed she knew none of that. And when the jurors concluded that she was a liar, they concluded she was a predator."" Ghislaine Maxwell 'won't get fair trial' - brother One of the only pieces of physical evidence displayed in the courtroom was a green folding massage table taken from a police raid of Epstein's Palm Beach estate in 2005. It was an attempt from the prosecution to almost recreate the scene of the crimes right there in the middle of the courtroom. A retired police officer testified that they also recovered a box of sex toys. A hard drive recovered during a separate raid by the FBI of Epstein's Manhattan mansion contained emails sent by Ghislaine Maxwell to a staff member in which she complains that the house manager, Juan Alessi, did not tidy up Epstein's massage creams. That led the police to Mr Alessi, who provided some of the most damning and X-rated corroborating testimony in the whole trial.  Reporters covering the case had to hurriedly write notes to keep up with his startling revelations about the household. He told the court that Epstein would have three massages a day. When Mr Alessi would clean up after, he would put the sex toys back where they belonged, in a basket in Ghislaine Maxwell's closet, off the master bedroom she shared with Epstein. Mr Alessi said Epstein or Maxwell would sometimes direct him to contact and pick up young women for massages. He recalled seeing two underage girls that appeared to be 14 or 15 years old, Jane and Virginia Roberts. House rules, including in a 59-page manual, Mr Alessi said, told staff to be deaf, dumb and blind and forbade them from making eye contact with Epstein. ""There was a culture of silence. That was by design, the defendant's design, because behind closed doors, the defendant and Epstein were committing heinous crimes,"" Assistant US Attorney Lara Pomerantz said. This video can not be played Epstein accuser: Ghislaine Maxwell is a 'master manipulator' Police raids of Epstein's homes also produced intimate photos showing the duo's jet-setting, luxurious lifestyle and close connection. In one picture, the pair are seen relaxing at the Queen's Balmoral residence - when Prince Andrew reportedly invited the couple to the Scottish estate. In another, Ghislaine Maxwell is on a private plane with Epstein, massaging his foot and rubbing it against her cleavage. The staggering wealth on display from opulent properties in Palm Beach, New York and New Mexico only highlighted the vast power dynamics at play. The pair used wealth to lure and make young girls feel indebted to them. Several witnesses, including the four women, recalled how the duo would name drop their friends in high places, such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump or Prince Andrew, and display photos of them alongside the Pope John Paul II or Fidel Castro in their properties. None alleged any wrongdoing by Epstein and Maxwell's famous friends. These connections proved to be no insulation from justice and the conviction is a significant moment for people who are often found at the other end of the social ladder. ""This guilty verdict is immensely meaningful to sexual abuse victims everywhere,"" said Lisa Bloom, an attorney for eight of Epstein's victims. ""No matter who you are, no matter what kinds of circles you travel in, no matter how much money you have, no matter how many years have passed since the sexual abuse, justice is still possible.""

"Hamilton & F1 condemn Piquet over racist languageLewis Hamilton says ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1.BBC Sport","Nelson Piquet won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987 Lewis Hamilton has said ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1 after three-time world champion Nelson Piquet used racially abusive language about him. The 69-year-old Brazilian, who won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987, used a racially offensive term to refer to Hamilton in a podcast. Piquet has been condemned by Formula 1, Hamilton's Mercedes team and the FIA. ""It's more than language,"" said seven-time world champion Hamilton. ""These archaic mindsets need to change and have no place in our sport. I've been surrounded by these attitudes and targeted my whole life. ""There has been plenty of time to learn. Time has come for action."" Piquet was discussing the accident between Hamilton and Red Bull driver Max Verstappen on the first lap of last year's British Grand Prix. He described the incident as ""a joke"", said Hamilton had been ""lucky"" only Verstappen crashed, and used a swear word in expressing his opinion that Hamilton had made a mistake. This weekend's British Grand Prix is the first anniversary of the incident, which was one of a series between the two drivers as they disputed last year's world title - a championship decided in controversial circumstances at the 2021 finale in Abu Dhabi. An F1 statement said: ""Discriminatory or racist language is unacceptable in any form and has no part in society. ""Lewis is an incredible ambassador for our sport and deserves respect."" It added: ""His tireless efforts to increase diversity and inclusion are a lesson to many and something we are committed to at F1."" Piquet, who is the father of Verstappen's partner Kelly Piquet, has a history of making unsavoury and unpleasant statements. During his driving career, he publicly questioned Ayrton Senna's sexuality and called his rival ""the Sao Paulo taxi driver"". He also made offensive comments about Nigel Mansell and the Briton's wife when they were team-mates at Williams. ""We condemn in the strongest terms any use of racist or discriminatory language of any kind,"" said Mercedes. ""Lewis has spearheaded our sport's efforts to combat racism, and he is a true champion of diversity on and off track. ""Together, we share a vision for a diverse and inclusive motorsport, and this incident underlines the fundamental importance of continuing to strive for a brighter future.""

"Russia threat requires Army cash boost - ministerBut the PM, on his way to a Nato summit, says the UK is the world's third biggest defence spender.","The UK has donated weapons to Ukraine, including next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW) Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has urged the prime minister to increase spending on the UK's armed forces in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a speech, he said funding must react to the ""direct"" threat Russia poses to Europe. The UK currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defence, matching the target Nato sets for its members. But Mr Wallace has reportedly written to the PM asking for an increase to 2.5% by 2028. He later denied the 2.5% figure but at a conference hosted by the Royal United Services Institute think tank (Rusi), said investment needs to continue to grow before it ""becomes too late"". He described Russia as the ""most direct and pressing threat to Europe"" and said it was ""increasingly clear President Putin cannot be deterred by threat of punishment or the costs imposed upon his people"". ""I'm serious when I say there is a very real danger that Russia will lash out against wider Europe,"" Mr Wallace added. Boris Johnson, on his way to a Nato summit in Madrid, said the defence alliance had ""never been of more vital importance"" and described it as the ""indispensable guarantor of European security"". The PM said the UK was the third biggest defence spender in the world, with it allocating 2.3% of its national income. ""We've another Â£24bn going in under the current spending review, the biggest since the end of the Cold War"", he added. The prime minister also defended a decision to break a manifesto promise to raise defence spending by more than inflation every year in this parliament, saying: ""It should be looked at over the life of a parliament, not a single data point."" An assessment by Nato, published this week, indicated that the UK spent an estimated 2.26% of GDP on defence in 2021 and was on course for 2.12% in 2022. BBC political editor Chris Mason said it would have been more surprising if the government had stuck to the commitment given the rate at which prices were rising. Boris Johnson earlier declined to comment when asked about future defence spending levels on the final day of the G7 summit in Germany, but said the UK's commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence was ""a floor not a ceiling."" New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' Ukraine can hit Russia with UK weapons - minister General Sir Patrick Sanders, the new head of the Army, spoke at the same Rusi conference and outlined his plans to mobilise forces to deter Russian escalation of hostilities. He said he had never known such a clear threat ""as the brutal aggression of President Putin"" and likened the current conflict in Ukraine to the build-up to World War Two, describing it as a ""1937 moment"" - when the UK allowedHitler to expand German territory unchecked,external. ""We're living through a period of history as profound as the one our forebears did 80 years ago,"" he said. The mobilisation effort must start now to prevent war, not provoke it, according to the general. Gen Sir Patrick became chief of the Army earlier this month Allies' readiness and spending on defence was already on the agenda at the summit of Nato leaders in Madrid, which runs until Thursday. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has already made clear he wants a target of members spending at least 2% of their annual national income on defence. Earlier, Nato's former deputy supreme commander, Sir Richard Shirreff, told the BBC the UK and its allies must build up its deterrent presence in order to prevent further Russian escalation. Nato had come a long way since the start of the conflict, he said, and every member state should equip their armed forces so they were ready for an offensive. The UK governmentsaid it was spending Â£1.3bn ($1.6bn) on military support for Ukraine, including sending long-range rocket systems. Anti-tank weapons, short-range missiles, armoured vehicles, drones and air defence systems have also been donated to the country.

She had been receiving end-of-life care for bowel cancer at home and had raised millions for cancer research. The host of the BBC's You, Me and the Big C podcast was given a damehood in May in recognition of her fundraising. Dame Deborah, a mother of two, was diagnosed with bowel cancer in 2016. Her family described her as ""amazing"" and an ""inspiration"". They announced her death in a post on her Instagram page. ""We are deeply saddened to announce the death of Dame Deborah James; the most amazing wife, daughter, sister, mummy,"" it said. She passed away peacefully surrounded by her family. Her family said Dame Deborah shared her experience of cancer to ""raise awareness, break down barriers, challenge taboos and change the conversation around cancer"". ""Even in her most challenging moments, her determination to raise money and awareness was inspiring."" Deborah James 'taught us how to live and how to dieâ Tailored cancer care - Dame Deborah's fundraising legacy WatchDeborah James: Extended Interviewon iPlayer. Dame Deborah was praised for her no-nonsense approach to talking about cancer, having shared her experiences of treatment and daily life since her diagnosis in 2016. A deputy head teacher, she started a cancer blog, before writing for the Sun and becoming a BBC broadcaster. But on 9 May she announced that she was no longer receiving active care and did not know how long she had left. ""My body just can't continue any more,"" she saidin a post on her @bowelbabe Instagram account,external. She also launched a new fund, called the Bowelbabe fund, to raise money for research into personalised medicine for cancer patients. It surpassed Â£1m in less than 24 hours - smashing her initial goal of Â£250,000 - and has now raised almost Â£7m. Deborah James made a dame by William at her home Deborah James visits rose named for her at Chelsea In May, she was given a damehood by Prince William at her parents' home in Woking, Surrey, where she had chosen to stay. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge - who donated to the research fund - praised her ""tireless efforts"" and thanked her for ""giving hope"" to those living with the disease. For her part, Dame Deborah said William's visit was ""surreal"". ""You can imagine the cleaning antics and preparation went off the scale - but it was all irrelevant because William was so kind,"" she said. The money raised through her Bowelbabe fund will support Cancer Research UK, Bowel Cancer UK and the Royal Marsden Hospital - a specialist cancer treatment facility. Bowel Cancer UK, of which Dame Deborah was a patron, said she had turned her bowel cancer diagnosis ""into an incredible force for good"" and would save countless lives through her campaigning. Genevieve Edwards, chief executive of Bowel Cancer UK, said the former teacher had an ""incredible energy"" and a ""marvellous knack of making things happen"". Paying tribute to the presenter's awareness-raising work, Ms Edwards said: ""She had this incredible power to connect with people. She leaves a tremendous legacy behind her"". Dame Deborah campaigned to raise awareness about bowel cancer, urging people to check for symptoms, during and after her treatment. Following one operation, while in an anaesthetic daze, she ordered a poo costume online - which she would wear while recording her podcast. Signing off her finalpodcastin May, she said: ""Check your poo. Come on. I can't leave on any other word apart from check your poo. ""I still have images of me dancing in poo outfits everywhere. So maybe I should leave on that final word. Check your poo."" A persistent change in bowel habit - going more often, with looser stools and sometimes tummy pain Blood in the stools without other symptoms, such as piles Abdominal pain, discomfort or bloating always brought on by eating Regular bowel cancer screening is available to everyone aged 60-74 and this programme is expanding to include everyone aged 50-59. This expansion is happening gradually over four years and started in April last year. People in England aged 60-74 who are registered with a GP are automatically sent an NHS bowel cancer screening kit every two years. If you are outside this age group, you should still be aware of what bowel cancer symptoms are and visit your GP if you have any concerns. Source:NHS UK,external Prime Minister Boris Johnson described her as ""an inspiration to so many"", while Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said her charity work was ""truly inspirational... even in the most challenging moments"". The director general of the BBC, Tim Davie said she was a ""true inspiration"" and the way she talked about cancer ""moved the nation, inspired change and undoubtedly saved lives"". This video can not be played Watch: Deborah James ""can't really do anything more"" to fight cancer Dame Deborah co-hosted You, Me and the Big C with Rachael Bland and Lauren Mahon Dame Deborah began co-presenting You, Me and the Big C alongside Lauren Mahon and BBC Radio 5 Live newsreader Rachael Bland in 2018, with the show earning praise for its frank discussion of cancer. They spoke to celebrity guests and addressed practical matters, including hair loss, tips for dealing with finances and telling your nearest and dearest about illnesses. Bland died aged 40 in September 2018, two years after being diagnosed with breast cancer. BBC 5 Live presenter Tony Livesey, who was a friend of Dame Deborah and did her final broadcast interview earlier this month, said the campaigner was ""one of the most remarkable women I've ever met"". ""All the fame she's had was a by-product of just the work she wanted to do to save one life,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. BBC News presenter George Alagiah, who is living with bowel cancer, recalled speaking to Dame Deborah at the Royal Marsden Hospital. Mr Alagiah told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme the campaigner answered his questions about the symptoms he might experience with the illness. The newsreader said he was struck by Dame Deborah's ""sheer generosity"" and that their chat was ""typical of what I now know she was capable of doing and did for so many others"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Lucie Kon, a BBC producer and friend of Dame Deborah, called the podcast host ""the most amazing human out of anyone I know"" and said she would be ""alive in my mind forever"". Lucie said Dame Deborah showed that cancer does not have to be a ""life sentence"", and that the 40-year-old ""didn't want to be a victim"". Dame Deborah's first book, called F*** You Cancer: How to face the big C, live your life and still be yourself, was published in 2018. Her second book, How To Live When You Could Be Dead, is due to be released on 18 August. You can listen to Dame Deborah's final You, Me and the Big C podcast onBBC Sounds Allow Instagram content?

Logan Mwangi: Father asks why he had to die,"Ben Mwangi said his lasting memory of Logan was a ""happy little boy that called me Daddy"" The father of a five-year-old boy murdered by his mother, stepfather and a 14-year-old boy has asked why his son had to die in horrific circumstances. Angharad Williamson, 31, John Cole, 40, and the teen, who cannot be named,killed Logan Mwangiin July 2021. He suffered56 ""catastrophic"" injuriesand his body was dumped in a river near his home in Sarn, Bridgend county. ""It really doesn't seem real,"" said Logan's father, Ben Mwangi, in an interview with ITV. His son suffered multiple internal injuries, similar to those found in victims of a fall from a height or in a high-speed car crash. Logan's killers are due to be sentenced later this week after being convicted of murder in April. ""What child has to go through that sort of torture for such a long period of the time?"" asked Mr Mwangi, who had been denied contact with his son since April 2019 - around the time Williamson began her relationship with Cole. ""One of the biggest questions in my whole entire life I'll always be asking myself is, 'Why? Why did this happen? Why did Logan have to die?'"" FM rejects independent review of social services Logan's killers: A 'racist' and stockbroker's girl Angharad Williamson, John Cole and a 14-year-old are due to be sentenced for Logan's murder Friends said Cole told them he did not like Logan, and others said his attitude changed after becoming obsessed with the idea Williamson had cheated on him with Logan's father. ""For the past five years, I've been struggling and trying to fight just to see Logan,"" said Mr Mwangi ""All I've wanted to do was just be a dad."" A month before Logan was killed, social workers in Bridgendremoved him from the Child Protection Register. And the day before police found his body, a social worker spent 20 minutes outside Logan's home speaking to the defendants, but did not see or hear him. Ben Mwangi: ""If I can stop this from happening to anybody else, then that will be the biggest, positive, most positive thing"" Mr Mwangi said he had not been told his son was on the register and he wanted the law changed so social services had a duty to inform estranged parents. ""I probably would have tried to take him away,"" he said. ""If I can stop this from happening to anybody else, then that will be the biggest, positive, most positive thing."" He said his lasting memory of Logan was as a ""happy little boy that called me Daddy"". ""The wonderful memories I have with my son will never be tarnished,"" he said. ""They will forever be in my heart and soul."" Achild practice review,externalhas been launched into Logan's death which includes local councils, police, the probation service and NHS. An ITV documentary, The Murder Of Logan Mwangi, produced in conjunction with South Wales Police, starts on Thursday at 21:00 BST.

LiveLiveSupreme Court to rule on Scottish referendum plan1 hour ago,"Nicola Sturgeon names 19 October 2023 for a second independence vote and accepts her plan could be subject to legal scrutiny by the Supreme Court The first minister tells the Scottish Parliament that independence will not be easy but ""will help us chart our own course"" However, opposition leaders at Holyrood tell Ms Sturgeon that she should stop obsessing about another referendum and deal with the pressing issues facing the country today Ms Sturgeon will write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for discussions over establishing the pathway towards a second vote on the country's future When Scotland had the first referendum in 2014 it was made possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Boris Johnson - have refused to give that order for a second time Following Ms Sturgeon's statement, the PM said the details would be studied ""very carefully"" and the UK government would ""respond properly"" BBC Scotland News This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon proposes 19 October 2023 as date for referendum  That's all from the live page team. Have a lovely evening. James CookScotland Editor, BBC News The Queen attended an armed forces parade in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to address the
Scottish Parliament this afternoon, the British state was putting on a show
just over the road. At the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the armed forces were
paying tribute to the Queen in an act of loyalty parade - a rare public
appearance for the monarch these days. Of course it's not the 400-year-old
union of the Scottish and English crowns which the first minister wants to
dissolve, but the 300-year-old union of the parliaments. How? Part one of her
strategy is to try her luck in the Supreme Court, where many legal scholars
expect her to lose. If she does, part two kicks in - fighting the next general
election on the single issue of independence to try to generate political
rather than legal pressure. For its part the UK government appears confident
that Scottish voters do not want a referendum now - and the polls appear to support
that position. But ""not now"" is by definition not a long-term
strategy unless it is accompanied by a decline in support for independence. Given that polls also suggest leaving the UK is especially popular among
younger voters, it's not just Ms Sturgeon who is gambling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In the immediacy, Holyrood will go into its summer recess
after FMQs on Thursday. The first minister will be hoping she has charged things
up for a season of people engaging with the debate on independence. The Supreme Court is also due to go on its summer holidays
from 29 July. It is not yet clear when judges might consider the matter of
indyref2. The case will be referred directly to the President of the
court â Lord Reed, a Scottish judge â to decide how and when it will move
forward. In the meantime, the Scottish government will continue
building the case for independence, with detailed policy papers expected on
issues like currency and borders to come. Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says her party and the SNP were elected to Holyrood to deliver an independence referendum. ""With the best legal advice in the world you still need to take the matter to court so the first minister is quite right to push the point so there can be no question that any referendum we have is absolutely legal,"" she says. ""Knowing the legal status of that bill means we could move forward with a common understanding and the unionists will have to engage in the debate. If they think the Union is so great, why can they not say so? I think it is because they can't put a good case for the Union and they are afraid they are going to lose this time."" Loran Slater, Scottish Greens co-leader Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says he does not think there will be another referendum next year. Mr Cole-Hamilton tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that the lord advocate, Scotland's top law officer, should be questioned by the Scottish Parliament. He says it is very likely that she told the first minister that her plans for a referendum were illegal under the terms of the Scotland Act and that will be proven in the Supreme Court. Mr Cole-Hamilton says it is a ""sad and depressing day"" and ""a criminal waste of time and oxygen"" when there are many other things we should be focussing on. Craig Hoy, from the Scottish Conservatives, says Nicola Sturgeon has wasted more time in the Scottish Parliament talking about the independence referendum. ""I think it is quite clear this is the wrong priority and it is only right therefore that we do not engage,"" he tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime radio programme. Mr Hoy says it is for the Scottish government to debate how to bring forward an independence referendum because it is them who want to have it. ""It is quite clear from opinion polls that the Scottish people don't support another referendum next year and I'm not going to play the first minister's games,"" he adds. The Tory MSP insists the Scottish government should be focusing on the big issues it has powers over right now. Neil Gray says: ""Obviously we set out in the election last year that we wanted to give the people of Scotland their say over their future."" When you combine the SNP and the Greens there is an overwhelming majority at Holyrood for independence, the SNP minister says. He says his first preference would be for Boris Johnson to respect democracy, respect the will of the Scottish people and negotiate over a section 30 order. Mr Gray accepts the prime minister has said now is not the time for indyref2, so the SNP are looking to establish the legality of the Scottish Parliament progressing with a referendum bill to ensure they can enact the wishes of the people of Scotland. The Scottish government's Culture, Europe and International Development Minister, Neil Gray, tellsRadio Scotland's Drivetimehe thinks Nicola Sturgeon's route map is the right way to proceed. ""We're honouring the mandate that was given to the Scottish government,"" he says. ""An overwhelming majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament last year were elected on a prospectus of delivering a second independence referendum ""So first and foremost this is about respecting democracy."" He says he hopes the Supreme Court finds in his party's favour, but if it's unsuccessful they will make the next general election a de facto referendum. That would leave it to the Scottish people to have their democratic say, he says. So, 19 October 2023. That's the date when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would like to hold a second referendum on Scottish Independence. Legal approval for such a vote currently lies with the Supreme Court. But if that avenue proves unforthcoming then it is always within the gift of the prime minister to allow it to take place. Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""It's just a massive distraction. ""I would be very interested to see the actual legal advice the lord advocate has given the first minister, because it's clear that the bill is going to the Supreme Court first, in order to determine whether or not it's legal."" Mr Murray points out that without a section 30 agreement, a referendum is not legal. He says we are going to spend the next 18 months talking about the process of a referendum rather than key issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Speaking to reporters as he flew from the G7 summit in Germany
to the Nato summit in Spain, the prime minister was asked about Nicola
Sturgeonâs plans, which she announced while Boris Johnson was in the air. Mr Johnson said: ""I haven't seen anything she's said yetâ¦.We'll study it very
carefully and respond properly."" I think the focus of the country should be building a stronger economy. I certainly think that we'll have a stronger economy and a stronger country together."" Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Prof Aileen
McHarg, a public law expert from Durham University, says Ms Sturgeon made a ""clever move"" today. She says it was ""unexpected"" that the reference to the Supreme Court would happen in advance of a bill being passed by parliament. Prof McHarg knows of only one previous use of the procedure - by the attorney general for Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court refused to hear that case, she says. ""This is quite an obscure process, but I think it is quite a clever way to avoid all those arguments that you would have expected about the lawfulness of a bill as the legislation is going through the parliament."" She says it's a difficult call to suggest how the case would go. Prof McHarg adds: ""The test they will be applying is: is there more than a loose or consequential connection between this bill, or proposed legislation, and the reserved matter of the Union?"" The UK government has been quick to issue its response to Nicola Sturgeon's statement. âWe
are clear that now is not the time to be talking about another independence
referendum,"" a spokesperson said. âPeople
across Scotland want to see both of their governments working together on the
issues that matter to them. That includes tackling the cost of living, ensuring
energy security, leading the international response against Russiaâs invasion
of Ukraine and growing our economy. That remains our priority. âA
decision has been taken by the First Minister to publish a Bill, and the Lord
Advocate has made a referral to the UK Supreme Court. UK Government law
officers will now consider their response.â The spokesperson adds that the UK government will
respond to the first ministerâs letter to the prime minister in due course and its clear
view is that the constitution is reserved to Westminster. Pamela
Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, says Nicola Sturgeon ""is acting against the will of the people of Scotland"". She adds: âPoll after poll shows that the vast majority of us do not want a second
referendum. âThe first ministerâs announcement is a disgraceful waste of resources and
public money. The job of government is to focus on the peopleâs priorities â cutting NHS waiting times, improving education standards, tackling the climate emergency, creating more affordable housing, investing in social care, and growing our economy. Rather than divide the people of Scotland, as part of the UK we can invest more in public services and bring our communities together.â Pamela Nash, Scotland in Union chief executive In 2014, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for power to hold a referendum to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood Alex Salmond has given his reaction to Nicola Sturgeon's statement on indyref2. The former first minister says he welcomes the fact that ""we now have some clarity of purpose on independence
and that a starting gun has finally been fired with a clear timetable leading
to 19th October next
year"". He adds: ""However, we need a united movement and grassroots campaign to deliver
success. In particular, voices outwith government will be needed so that the
cause of independence is not weighed down by the day-to-day troubles of the
SNP/Green coalition. ""We should not give up on bending Boris Johnson to the peopleâs will on
a section 30 order to deliver a referendum under the same terms I previously
negotiated in the Edinburgh Agreement which enabled the referendum in 2014. ""There has never been a weaker UK prime minister. But that will require a
concerted campaign of popular, parliamentary and diplomatic initiatives. And it
is urgency which is required to stop Westminster taking Scotland to the
cleaners on a daily basis."" You can hear John Beattie's interview with Mr Salmond after the 16:30 news on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. Just click on the tab at the top of this page. The question of Scottish sovereignty can also not simply be left to the UK Supreme Court.  The concept of using the UK general election as a backstop will cause a wry smile to those within the SNP and in the wider movement who have been calling for that for the last five years. However, even then, we need to be prepared with the popular campaign which will be required to force recognition of Scotland's Claim of Right.â Alex Salmond, Former first minister Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent Scotland's Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain The fact Lord Advocate Dorothy
Bain is prepared to personally represent the Scottish government in this
case means it can be viewed as a genuine enterprise, not just some political
âwheeze.â But this remains a gamble for the first minister. The Supreme Court could rule there's no case
to answer, that the Scotland Act clearly reserves powers over the Union to
Westminster. The judges might decline to consider draft
legislation that is still subject to amendment, preferring instead to rule on a
finished bill. The stakes are high. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Downing Street has said it will âcarefully study
the detailsâ of Nicola Sturgeonâs proposal to hold a referendum on Scottish
independence in October 2023. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesman said the UK governmentâs
position remained unchanged. âBoth ours and the Scottish government's priority should be working together
with a relentless focus on the issues that we know matter to people up and down
the country,â the spokesman said. âBut a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully
study the details of the proposal and the Supreme Court will now consider
whether to accept the Scottish government's Lord Advocate referral.â Asked about whether the next general election would becoming a ""de facto
referendum"" as the first minister had suggested, the spokesman said they
would not get into âhypotheticalsâ. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent What was announced today is essentially a twist on Nicola
Sturgeonâs original plan for a referendum. That was to ask for a transfer of power from Westminster,
publish a bill and pass it through Holyrood, then defend it from legal
challenge in court. What changed today was that Ms Sturgeon isnât going to wait
for a legal challenge to her bill â instead, her government has moved to
trigger an immediate Supreme Court showdown, to settle the question of
competence once and for all. There may be a lot of familiar elements here, but if this
puts the legal argument to bed it will be a tangible step forward for the
independence debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

recap of what we know.  This live page has been brought to you by James FitzGerald, Thom Poole, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Robin Levinson-King, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich, Bernd Debusmann and Chris Giles. Fresh off its seismic ruling to overturn the right to an abortion, the US Supreme Court is expected to issue a major immigration decision within the next three days. The case concerns a controversial Trump administration policy - commonly known as ""remain in Mexico"" - that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as their cases make their way through US immigration courts, sometimes a years-long process. The Biden administration has scrapped the measure, arguing it is not an effective means of dealing with influxes at the border. Last year, a federal district judge in Texas ruled that such a move violates immigration law and ordered the government to restart the programme. In the final week of its 2021/22 term, the Supreme Court must now decide whether the Biden administration has the authority to end the policy. Migrants bound for the US wait in the southern border of Mexico While the number of migrants at the border has been steadily increasing since April 2020, the numbers spiked after Joe Biden became president. Economic problems and environmental disasters in Honduras, Guatemala, El
 Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba worsened during the pandemic, forcing some
 to take on a long and perilous journey north. Gangs and violence have 
also been given as reasons why some left home. In May alone, statistics show that239,416 arrestswere made at the border, a 2% increase from April. US officials say they are on pace to exceed two million migrant 
""encounters"" in the fiscal year that began in October, the fastest pace 
in more than 20 years. There's also been a sharp hike in the number of children crossing the border. In May, the number of unaccompanied minors taken into custodyrose to 14,699, from the 12,180 recorded in April. Officials
 are now bracing for an expected massive influx of migrants over the 
summer following the end of Title 42, a pandemic policy that allows 
migrant to be quickly expelled over concerns about spreading Covid-19. Read more:What are President Biden's challenges at the Mexico border? American officials have a tough job when it comes to
policing the border, says a lawyer who previously served as San Antonioâs top
prosecutor. This case looks âvery similarâ to a previous incident in which
a driver was convicted after 10 migrants were found dead in his truck, says John
Bash. But he admits such penalties are not always a successful
deterrent because smugglers know they are unlikely to be caught. It would be possible to check more vehicles on the US
border, Bash says, but this would harm commerce - so policymakers have to find a âbalanceâ. Bash thinks the answer is a âmore humane [â¦] effectiveâ approach
to border security, which he describes as under-resourced. Marcos GonzÃ¡lez DÃ­azBBC News Mundo correspondent in Mexico People traffickers and a lack of border control are also part of the problem, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador says ""A tremendous tragedy,â said Mexicoâs president about the immigrant deaths, among whom more than 20 were Mexican. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said this was due to the âpoverty and desperation of Central American and Mexican brothersâ, but also because âthere is trafficking of people and a lack of control, in this case at the Mexican-US border and also in the US interiorâ. Mexico is a common route for thousands of migrants who travel from other Latin American countries - especially Central America - to try to reach the US, and make the journey in dangerous conditions. Last year, 55 migrants died in a crash involving a truck clandestinely transporting more than 160 people in southern Mexico. LÃ³pez Obrador announced that migration and its economic and social causes would be one of the central topics of the meeting he would still be having with US President Joe Biden on 12 July in Washington DC. Bernd DebusmannBBC News, Washington Dangerous smuggling attempts in overcrowded vehicles are everyday â and often deadly â occurrences at the Mexican border, according to
former Border Patrol officer and immigration activist Jenn Budd. In an interview with the BBC, Budd â a former senior Border
Patrol agent who has since become an outspoken critic of the force â said that dozens of people are often packed in vehicles much smaller than the trailer
found Monday in San Antonio. In one instance, she recalls intercepting a vehicle in which
about 30 people were found flat âlike sardinesâ in the bed of a normal-sized
pick-up truck driving on a mountainous road. âThose trucks flip. People on the bottom often suffocate. Itâs
very common,â she said. In most cases, she added, migrants being transported by vehicle
have already undergone a âvery perilousâ journey on foot before arriving at a
rendezvous point with a smugglerâs vehicle. âSmugglers will tell them itâs a 15- or 30-minute walk. But the
reality is that it could be days,â she added. â[When they arrive] theyâre
already dehydrated.â Pope Francis has joined the chorus of those mourning the ""tragedy"" in Texas and Melilla - where at least 23 sub-Saharan migrants died. ""Let us pray together for these brothers and sisters who died following their hope of a better life,"" he wrote on Twitter.

The highway where the lorry was found is said to be popular for smuggling Officials in southern Texas have seen an increase in smugglers
using this highway â Quintana Road - and a similar method of cramming people
into the back of lorries, says an expert on migration policy. Gabriella Sanchez, a researcher and author on smuggling at the European University
Institute, tells BBC World that thereâs been a âproliferationâ of criminals
offering their smuggling services for a fee. But she says many migrants try on their own because they are
excluded from the smuggling âmarketâ due to rising demand and prices. Sanchez claims that riskier attempts at border crossings have
been made following a ban by then-President Trump on migrants applying for
asylum outside a so-called port of entry. She goes on to call for
âequal accessâ to people of all races, nationalities and classes when it comes
to applying for visas and passports. Blame aimed at President Biden over the deaths has been dismissed as âpartisan
politicsâ by the former commissioner of US customs and border protection under
President Obama. Republicans have claimed the Biden administration is
answerable for the truck deaths, because its âopenâ policies are encouraging
more and more risky journeys. But Gil Kerlikowske tells BBC World that migrantsâ
hazardous crossings can be explained by Covid issues and the âeconomic
opportunityâ offered by life in the US. Kerlikowske expects a record number of apprehensions to be
made along the US-Mexico border this year. âIt canât just be up to US border patrol to handle this
influx,â he comments. He accuses Congress of failing to reform immigration policy
to create âsome sort of system that would offer consistency for people wanting
to come into the United Statesâ. Two lawmakers who represent portions of San Antonio in the US Congress are Joaquin Castro, a Democrat, and Tony Gonzales, a Republican. Castro has placed the blame for Monday's migrant deaths on Trump-era immigration policies that the incumbent Biden administration has been unable to revoke. He called for an end to Title 42, a pandemic-related order that has enabled the mass expulsion of asylum-seekers, warning that it ""has created more business, repeat business, for human smugglers"" and has ""put desperate, oppressed people in grave danger of death"". Gonzales meanwhile has taken a different approach, repeatedly calling out ""the open borders agenda"" of the Biden administration. Calling for more border agents to be hired and an end to the ""catch and release"" of migrants awaiting trial, he twice tweeted that Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas - whose agency is in charge of immigration enforcement - must resign over Monday's incident.

Migration will be ""the main topic"" during Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's 12 July visit to the US, according to Andrew Rudman, the director of the Washington DC-based Wilson Center's Mexico Institute. Rudman says a challenge is that there are no short-term solutions that would stop migrants from attempting the dangerous voyage. ""Even if you could address the root causes of migration throughout the hemisphere... and fix them all, that doesnât change the conditions for the people who feel that migrating to the United States under horrible conditions is the best option. Those people are leaving today,"" he said. Mexico, Rudman added, is likely to repeat calls for a number of changes, including an accelerated asylum adjudication process and for more US support for Mexican authorities dealing with migrants on their side of the border. These efforts, however, will do little to address the root causes of illegal migration. ""If you decide that the best thing you can do for your family

LiveLiveTexas truck deaths 'horrific and heartbreaking' - White HouseFifty migrants are now known to have died after travelling in a truck during fierce temperatures.US & Canada,"Fifty people have died after being found inside an abandoned truck in Texas, Mexico's president says AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador says 22 Mexicans, seven Guatemalans and two Hondurans are among the dead The White House has described what happened as ""horrific and heartbreaking"", and says President Biden has been briefed on the situation Officials said a city worker had discovered the scene after hearing cries for help People were found trapped in the truck with no signs of water or cooling, during a heatwave in Texas Three people are being held in custody Edited by Chris Giles The road where the lorry stood is now largely empty, says our reporter We're pausing our live coverage now - but before we go hereâs a
recap of what we know.  This live page has been brought to you by James FitzGerald, Thom Poole, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Robin Levinson-King, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich, Bernd Debusmann and Chris Giles. Fresh off its seismic ruling to overturn the right to an abortion, the US Supreme Court is expected to issue a major immigration decision within the next three days. The case concerns a controversial Trump administration policy - commonly known as ""remain in Mexico"" - that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as their cases make their way through US immigration courts, sometimes a years-long process. The Biden administration has scrapped the measure, arguing it is not an effective means of dealing with influxes at the border. Last year, a federal district judge in Texas ruled that such a move violates immigration law and ordered the government to restart the programme. In the final week of its 2021/22 term, the Supreme Court must now decide whether the Biden administration has the authority to end the policy. Migrants bound for the US wait in the southern border of Mexico While the number of migrants at the border has been steadily increasing since April 2020, the numbers spiked after Joe Biden became president. Economic problems and environmental disasters in Honduras, Guatemala, El
 Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba worsened during the pandemic, forcing some
 to take on a long and perilous journey north. Gangs and violence have 
also been given as reasons why some left home. In May alone, statistics show that239,416 arrestswere made at the border, a 2% increase from April. US officials say they are on pace to exceed two million migrant 
""encounters"" in the fiscal year that began in October, the fastest pace 
in more than 20 years. There's also been a sharp hike in the number of children crossing the border. In May, the number of unaccompanied minors taken into custodyrose to 14,699, from the 12,180 recorded in April. Officials
 are now bracing for an expected massive influx of migrants over the 
summer following the end of Title 42, a pandemic policy that allows 
migrant to be quickly expelled over concerns about spreading Covid-19. Read more:What are President Biden's challenges at the Mexico border? American officials have a tough job when it comes to
policing the border, says a lawyer who previously served as San Antonioâs top
prosecutor. This case looks âvery similarâ to a previous incident in which
a driver was convicted after 10 migrants were found dead in his truck, says John
Bash. But he admits such penalties are not always a successful
deterrent because smugglers know they are unlikely to be caught. It would be possible to check more vehicles on the US
border, Bash says, but this would harm commerce - so policymakers have to find a âbalanceâ. Bash thinks the answer is a âmore humane [â¦] effectiveâ approach
to border security, which he describes as under-resourced.

Metropolitan Police put into special measures,"The UK's largest police force will have to report to inspectors more regularly The Met Police has been placed into an advanced stage of monitoring, in what Home Secretary Priti Patel has described as ""special measures"". Recently the force has been hit by a series of scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard, the strip-search of Child Q and officers being caught exchanging offensive messages. In February Dame Cressida Dick quit as commissioner. Ms Patel said she backed the move taken by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said in a statement: ""We can confirm that we are now monitoring the Metropolitan Police Service through our Engage process, which provides additional scrutiny and support to help it make improvements."" The Engage level of monitoring is used by HMICFRS when a force ""is not succeeding in managing, mitigating or eradicating"" a cause of concern. PM urges public to trust police after Everard case Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief It means the UK's largest police force will be required to report to inspectors more regularly and could be asked to meet specific crime-fighting targets. The Met could also receive support from the College of Policing, the National Police Chiefs Council or other external organisations. In a statement the force said: ""We recognise the cumulative impact of events and problems that the Met is dealing with. ""We understand the impact this has had on communities and we share their disappointment. ""We are determined to be a police service Londoners can be proud of. We are talking to the inspectorate about next steps."" Other forces that have been the subject of the inspectorate's Engage process includeGreater Manchester Police in 2020andCleveland Constabulary in 2019. Dame Cressida Dick's replacement as commissioner is expected to be announced this summer Ms Patel said it was clear to her the Met Police was falling short in getting ""the basics right"". She said she backed the inspectorate's action and called on both the force and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan ""to take immediate action to begin addressing"" the issues facing the Met. The home secretary added: ""The process to recruit a new commissioner is well under way and I have made clear that the successful candidate must demonstrate sustained improvements in the Met Police in order to regain public trust both in London and across the country. ""The new commissioner will need to deliver on the public's priorities for the police - making our streets safer, bearing down on crime and bringing more criminals to justice, while continuing to recruit thousands of new officers to protect local communities."" The new Met Police commissioner will be appointed by the Queen following a recommendation by Home Secretary Priti Patel Mr Khan said the watchdog had raised very serious concerns and called for ""root-and-branch"" reforms to change the Met Police's performance and culture. He added: ""A series of appalling scandals have not only exposed deep cultural problems but have damaged the confidence of Londoners in the capital's police service. ""The decision by the HMIC to now move the Met into special measures has laid bare the substantial performance failings by the force."" The family of Child Q, the teenager who was strip-searched in Hackney by Met Police officers while she was menstruating, have welcomed the decision taken by the inspectorate. In a statement they said: ""The Met has shown time and again that it cannot do its job properly and its officers' actions have had life-changing, devastating consequences for innocent people across London, including Child Q. ""It is no wonder that there is little to no faith left in the Metropolitan Police. ""We hope the additional scrutiny of special measures will result in permanent change in the force's culture and practices."" By Lucy Gilder BBC Home Affairs Researcher Under the so-called special measures, the Met will face greater scrutiny by inspectors and will be expected to report to them more regularly. Acting Commissioner Sir Stephen House will be required to submit an improvement plan to the HMICFRS for inspection. As part of this process, the Met may receive support to improve from bodies such as the National Police Chiefs' Council. Later on, a policing performance oversight group will consider the changes the Met has made to address its problems. This is the first time in the Met's history that it has been placed under special measures. Greater Manchester Police, Cleveland Police and Gloucestershire Constabulary are the only other police forces in England and Wales who are also being monitored by the HMICFRS.

Alex Scott: I will carry on despite sexist abuse,"The ex-Arsenal right-back, who made 140 appearances for England, has faced pushback since making the switch to TV presenting TV pundit and former England defender Alex Scott says she intends to continue as a football presenter despite receiving misogynistic comments. She told theRadio Times,externalshe has had tweets suggesting she stick to ironing and cooking, but feels a ""responsibility to change perceptions"". Scott, 37, has also been criticised for her accent, with one senior politician suggesting she have elocution lessons. Despite abuse the former Strictly star told the BBC she wanted to stay on air. She will be part of the BBC's coverage of the Women's European Championships next month. The Future of Women's Football - what we learned The ex-Arsenal right-back, who made 140 appearances for England, has faced pushback since making the switch to television presenting, including fromformer Labour minister and ex-House of Lords member Digby Jones last year, who criticised her pronunciation and asked if someone could give her elocution lessons. This video can not be played âWeâre not going anywhereâ - how female footballers are tackling online trolls The TV presenter, who is also a guest host of the One Show, said she had told the BBC's director of sport, Barbara Slater, that she ""didn't want to be taken off air because then who wins?"" Scott said: ""I've had so many tweets saying I should be at home ironing or cooking. ""I don't care about those, but sometimes people threaten my life and those have to be taken seriously. ""It's my responsibility to change perceptions by sitting in that chair and talking about football."" Alex Scott believes the women's game needs to be more diverse Hosts England are among the favourites for the Women's European championship, which begins on 6 July. Led by Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman, who won the Women's Euros with the Netherlands in 2017, England's first challenge will come on the opening night as they face Austria at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium. Female football has steadily become more popular over the years, with more women and girls playing the sport, according to the Football Association. Scott said the game's growth has had its downsides and feels diversity within the teams needs to be addressed. She said concrete pitches in council estate areas ""aren't as important any more"" as ""academies have appeared that are maybe two hours away, and an inner-city street kid doesn't have the financial means to access them"". ""One of the girls I'm mentoring said that when she looks at the England team she doesn't see herself represented... That needs to be addressed,"" she said.

Russia threat requires Army cash boost - minister,"The UK has donated weapons to Ukraine, including next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW) Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has urged the prime minister to increase spending on the UK's armed forces in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a speech, he said funding must react to the ""direct"" threat Russia poses to Europe. The UK currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defence, matching the target Nato sets for its members. But Mr Wallace has reportedly written to the PM asking for an increase to 2.5% by 2028. He later denied the 2.5% figure but at a conference hosted by the Royal United Services Institute think tank (Rusi), said investment needs to continue to grow before it ""becomes too late"". He described Russia as the ""most direct and pressing threat to Europe"" and said it was ""increasingly clear President Putin cannot be deterred by threat of punishment or the costs imposed upon his people"". ""I'm serious when I say there is a very real danger that Russia will lash out against wider Europe,"" Mr Wallace added. Boris Johnson, on his way to a Nato summit in Madrid, said the defence alliance had ""never been of more vital importance"" and described it as the ""indispensable guarantor of European security"". The PM said the UK was the third biggest defence spender in the world, with it allocating 2.3% of its national income. ""We've another Â£24bn going in under the current spending review, the biggest since the end of the Cold War"", he added. The prime minister also defended a decision to break a manifesto promise to raise defence spending by more than inflation every year in this parliament, saying: ""It should be looked at over the life of a parliament, not a single data point."" An assessment by Nato, published this week, indicated that the UK spent an estimated 2.26% of GDP on defence in 2021 and was on course for 2.12% in 2022. BBC political editor Chris Mason said it would have been more surprising if the government had stuck to the commitment given the rate at which prices were rising. Boris Johnson earlier declined to comment when asked about future defence spending levels on the final day of the G7 summit in Germany, but said the UK's commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence was ""a floor not a ceiling.""

Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has already made clear he wants a target of members spending at least 2% of their annual national income on defence. Earlier, Nato's former deputy supreme commander, Sir Richard Shirreff, told the BBC the UK and its allies must build up its deterrent presence in order to prevent further Russian escalation.

Met Police put into advanced stage of monitoring,"The UK's largest police force will have to report to inspectors more regularly The Met Police has been placed into an advanced stage of monitoring, in what Home Secretary Priti Patel has described as ""special measures"". Recently the force has been hit by a series of scandals including the murder of Sarah Everard, the strip-search of Child Q and officers being caught exchanging offensive messages. In February Dame Cressida Dick quit as commissioner. Ms Patel said she backed the move taken by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary. HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and Fire and Rescue Services (HMICFRS) said in a statement: ""We can confirm that we are now monitoring the Metropolitan Police Service through our Engage process, which provides additional scrutiny and support to help it make improvements."" The Engage level of monitoring is used by HMICFRS when a force ""is not succeeding in managing, mitigating or eradicating"" a cause of concern. PM urges public to trust police after Everard case Trust in police shaken by Everard case - Met chief It means the UK's largest police force will be required to report to inspectors more regularly and could be asked to meet specific crime-fighting targets. The Met could also receive support from the College of Policing, the National Police Chiefs Council or other external organisations. In a statement the force said: ""We recognise the cumulative impact of events and problems that the Met is dealing with. ""We understand the impact this has had on communities and we share their disappointment. ""We are determined to be a police service Londoners can be proud of. We are talking to the inspectorate about next steps."" Other forces that have been the subject of the inspectorate's Engage process includeGreater Manchester Police in 2020andCleveland Constabulary in 2019. Dame Cressida Dick's replacement as commissioner is expected to be announced this summer Ms Patel said it was clear to her the Met Police was falling short in getting ""the basics right"". She said she backed the inspectorate's action and called on both the force and Mayor of London Sadiq Khan ""to take immediate action to begin addressing"" the issues facing the Met. The home secretary added: ""The process to recruit a new commissioner is well under way and I have made clear that the successful candidate must demonstrate sustained improvements in the Met Police in order to regain public trust both in London and across the country. ""The new commissioner will need to deliver on the public's priorities for the police - making our streets safer, bearing down on crime and bringing more criminals to justice, while continuing to recruit thousands of new officers to protect local communities."" The new Met Police commissioner will be appointed by the Queen following a recommendation by Home Secretary Priti Patel Mr Khan said the watchdog had raised very serious concerns and called for ""root-and-branch"" reforms to change the Met Police's performance and culture. He added: ""A series of appalling scandals have not only exposed deep cultural problems but have damaged the confidence of Londoners in the capital's police service. ""The decision by the HMIC to now move the Met into special measures has laid bare the substantial performance failings by the force."" The family of Child Q, the teenager who was strip-searched in Hackney by Met Police officers while she was menstruating, have welcomed the decision taken by the inspectorate. In a statement they said: ""The Met has shown time and again that it cannot do its job properly and its officers' actions have had life-changing, devastating consequences for innocent people across London, including Child Q. ""It is no wonder that there is little to no faith left in the Metropolitan Police. ""We hope the additional scrutiny of special measures will result in permanent change in the force's culture and practices.""

Petrol sales banned in crisis-hit Sri Lanka,"Sri Lanka has suspended sales of fuel for non-essential vehicles as it faces its worst economic crisis in decades. For the next two weeks, only buses, trains and vehicles used for medical services and transporting food will be allowed to fill up with fuel. Schools in urban areas have shut, while officials have told the country's 22 million residents to work from home. The South Asian nation is in talks over a bailout deal as it struggles to pay for imports such as fuel and food. Sri Lanka is the first country to take the drastic step in halting sales of fuel to ordinary people ""since the 1970s oil crisis, when fuel was rationed in the US and Europe and speed limits introduced to reduce demand"", Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC. He said the ban underlined the steep rise in oil pricing and limited foreign exchange reserves in Sri Lanka. Many of the island's residents don't know how they will cope without fuel. There have been long queues at filling stations across Sri Lanka for months. Chinthaka Kumara, a 29-year-old taxi driver in Colombo, thought the ban would ""create more problems for people"". ""I'm a daily wage earner. I've been in this queue for three days and I don't know when we will get petrol,"" he told BBC Sinhala. A member of the security forces stands guard outside a fuel station in Colombo Drivers have been asked to go home, with tokens distributed aimed at rationing scarce fuel stocks. Some kept queuing, but others couldn't. ""I was in a queue for two days. I got a token - number 11 - but I don't know when I will get fuel,"" S Wijetunga, a 52-year-old private sector executive, told the BBC. ""I need to go to the office now, so I have no option but to leave my vehicle here and go in a three-wheeler."" Kenat, a motorised rickshaw driver in the Colombo suburb of Kotahena, said people like him were being ""destroyed"". ""Our family used to have three meals a day. Now we eat only twice a day. If this continues, it will come down to one meal,"" he told BBC Tamil. With an economy hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices and populist tax cuts, Sri Lanka lacks enough foreign currency to pay for imports of essential goods. Acute shortages of fuel, food and medicines have helped to push the cost of living to record highs in the country, where many people rely on motor vehicles for their livelihoods. On Monday, the government said it would ban private vehicles from buying petrol and diesel until 10 July. What's behind Sri Lanka's economic crisis? How Sri Lanka's war heroes became villains No medicine for kids in a collapsing health system Cabinet spokesperson Bandula Gunewardena said Sri Lanka had ""never faced such a severe economic crisis in its history"". The cash-strapped country has also sent officials to the major energy producers Russia and Qatar in a bid to secure cheap oil supplies. Over the weekend, officials said the country had only 9,000 tonnes of diesel and 6,000 tonnes of petrol to fuel essential services in the coming days. It has been estimated that the stocks would last for less than a week under regular demand. ""We are doing everything we can to get new stocks, but we don't know when that will be,"" power and energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera told reporters on Sunday. In Colombo, protests against price hikes erupted in April, with mounting calls for the president to quit In May, the countrydefaulted on its debts with international lendersfor the first time in its history. That followed weeks of protests against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government. His brother Mahinda quit as prime minister, but the president is still under pressure to resign. ""The government seems to take no action at all,"" Kannan, another driver seeking fuel in the capital, told BBC Tamil. ""They are asking us to be patient. They say they don't have dollars. But I ask the government - who is responsible for this?"" He suggested ""educated youngsters"" should lead the country instead. Last week, an International Monetary Fund team arrived in Sri Lanka for talks over a $3bn (Â£2.4bn) bailout deal. The government is also seeking assistance from India and China to import essential items. New Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said earlier this month the country neededat least $5bn over the next six months to pay for essential goodssuch as food, fuel and fertiliser. In recent weeks, ministers alsocalled on farmers to grow more riceand gavegovernment officials an extra day off a week to grow food, amid fears of shortages. This video can not be played Watch: Shot dead by Sri Lankan police while trying to get fuel The government blames the crisis on the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. But many experts say mismanagement is the main cause of the economic collapse. Sri Lanka's foreign currency reserves dwindled to almost nothing after years during which it imported much more than it exported and racked up huge debts with China on controversial infrastructure projects. When Sri Lanka's foreign currency shortages became a serious problem in early 2021, the government tried to limit the outflow by banning imports of chemical fertiliser, telling farmers to use locally sourced organic fertilisers instead. This led to widespread crop failure. Sri Lanka had to supplement its food stocks from abroad, which made its foreign currency shortage even worse.

LiveLiveTexas truck deaths 'horrific and heartbreaking' - White House3 minutes ago,"Fifty people have died after being found inside an abandoned truck in Texas, Mexico's president says AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador says 22 Mexicans, seven Guatemalans and two Hondurans are among the dead The White House has described what happened as ""horrific and heartbreaking"", and says President Biden has been briefed on the situation Officials said a city worker had discovered the scene after hearing cries for help People were found trapped in the truck with no signs of water or cooling, during a heatwave in Texas Three people are being held in custody Edited by Chris Giles The road where the lorry stood is now largely empty, says our reporter We're pausing our live coverage now - but before we go hereâs a
recap of what we know.  This live page has been brought to you by James FitzGerald, Thom Poole, Alexandra FouchÃ©, Robin Levinson-King, Sam Cabral, Holly Honderich, Bernd Debusmann and Chris Giles. Fresh off its seismic ruling to overturn the right to an abortion, the US Supreme Court is expected to issue a major immigration decision within the next three days. The case concerns a controversial Trump administration policy - commonly known as ""remain in Mexico"" - that forced asylum seekers to wait in Mexico as their cases make their way through US immigration courts, sometimes a years-long process. The Biden administration has scrapped the measure, arguing it is not an effective means of dealing with influxes at the border. Last year, a federal district judge in Texas ruled that such a move violates immigration law and ordered the government to restart the programme. In the final week of its 2021/22 term, the Supreme Court must now decide whether the Biden administration has the authority to end the policy. Migrants bound for the US wait in the southern border of Mexico While the number of migrants at the border has been steadily increasing since April 2020, the numbers spiked after Joe Biden became president. Economic problems and environmental disasters in Honduras, Guatemala, El
 Salvador, Nicaragua and Cuba worsened during the pandemic, forcing some
 to take on a long and perilous journey north. Gangs and violence have 
also been given as reasons why some left home. In May alone, statistics show that239,416 arrestswere made at the border, a 2% increase from April. US officials say they are on pace to exceed two million migrant 
""encounters"" in the fiscal year that began in October, the fastest pace 
in more than 20 years. There's also been a sharp hike in the number of children crossing the border. In May, the number of unaccompanied minors taken into custodyrose to 14,699, from the 12,180 recorded in April. Officials
 are now bracing for an expected massive influx of migrants over the 
summer following the end of Title 42, a pandemic policy that allows 
migrant to be quickly expelled over concerns about spreading Covid-19. Read more:What are President Biden's challenges at the Mexico border? American officials have a tough job when it comes to
policing the border, says a lawyer who previously served as San Antonioâs top
prosecutor. This case looks âvery similarâ to a previous incident in which
a driver was convicted after 10 migrants were found dead in his truck, says John
Bash. But he admits such penalties are not always a successful
deterrent because smugglers know they are unlikely to be caught. It would be possible to check more vehicles on the US
border, Bash says, but this would harm commerce - so policymakers have to find a âbalanceâ. Bash thinks the answer is a âmore humane [â¦] effectiveâ approach
to border security, which he describes as under-resourced. Marcos GonzÃ¡lez DÃ­azBBC News Mundo correspondent in Mexico People traffickers and a lack of border control are also part of the problem, AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador says ""A tremendous tragedy,â said Mexicoâs president about the immigrant deaths, among whom more than 20 were Mexican. AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador said this was due to the âpoverty and desperation of Central American and Mexican brothersâ, but also because âthere is trafficking of people and a lack of control, in this case at the Mexican-US border and also in the US interiorâ. Mexico is a common route for thousands of migrants who travel from other Latin American countries - especially Central America - to try to reach the US, and make the journey in dangerous conditions. Last year, 55 migrants died in a crash involving a truck clandestinely transporting more than 160 people in southern Mexico. LÃ³pez Obrador announced that migration and its economic and social causes would be one of the central topics of the meeting he would still be having with US President Joe Biden on 12 July in Washington DC. Bernd DebusmannBBC News, Washington Dangerous smuggling attempts in overcrowded vehicles are everyday â and often deadly â occurrences at the Mexican border, according to
former Border Patrol officer and immigration activist Jenn Budd. In an interview with the BBC, Budd â a former senior Border
Patrol agent who has since become an outspoken critic of the force â said that dozens of people are often packed in vehicles much smaller than the trailer
found Monday in San Antonio. In one instance, she recalls intercepting a vehicle in which
about 30 people were found flat âlike sardinesâ in the bed of a normal-sized
pick-up truck driving on a mountainous road. âThose trucks flip. People on the bottom often suffocate. Itâs
very common,â she said. In most cases, she added, migrants being transported by vehicle
have already undergone a âvery perilousâ journey on foot before arriving at a
rendezvous point with a smugglerâs vehicle. âSmugglers will tell them itâs a 15- or 30-minute walk. But the
reality is that it could be days,â she added. â[When they arrive] theyâre
already dehydrated.â Pope Francis has joined the chorus of those mourning the ""tragedy"" in Texas and Melilla - where at least 23 sub-Saharan migrants died. ""Let us pray together for these brothers and sisters who died following their hope of a better life,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""May the Lord might open our hearts so these misfortunes never happen again."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The highway where the lorry was found is said to be popular for smuggling Officials in southern Texas have seen an increase in smugglers
using this highway â Quintana Road - and a similar method of cramming people
into the back of lorries, says an expert on migration policy. Gabriella Sanchez, a researcher and author on smuggling at the European University
Institute, tells BBC World that thereâs been a âproliferationâ of criminals
offering their smuggling services for a fee. But she says many migrants try on their own because they are
excluded from the smuggling âmarketâ due to rising demand and prices. Sanchez claims that riskier attempts at border crossings have
been made following a ban by then-President Trump on migrants applying for
asylum outside a so-called port of entry. She goes on to call for
âequal accessâ to people of all races, nationalities and classes when it comes
to applying for visas and passports. Blame aimed at President Biden over the deaths has been dismissed as âpartisan
politicsâ by the former commissioner of US customs and border protection under
President Obama. Republicans have claimed the Biden administration is
answerable for the truck deaths, because its âopenâ policies are encouraging
more and more risky journeys. But Gil Kerlikowske tells BBC World that migrantsâ
hazardous crossings can be explained by Covid issues and the âeconomic
opportunityâ offered by life in the US. Kerlikowske expects a record number of apprehensions to be
made along the US-Mexico border this year. âIt canât just be up to US border patrol to handle this
influx,â he comments. He accuses Congress of failing to reform immigration policy
to create âsome sort of system that would offer consistency for people wanting
to come into the United Statesâ. Two lawmakers who represent portions of San Antonio in the US Congress are Joaquin Castro, a Democrat, and Tony Gonzales, a Republican. Castro has placed the blame for Monday's migrant deaths on Trump-era immigration policies that the incumbent Biden administration has been unable to revoke. He called for an end to Title 42, a pandemic-related order that has enabled the mass expulsion of asylum-seekers, warning that it ""has created more business, repeat business, for human smugglers"" and has ""put desperate, oppressed people in grave danger of death"". Gonzales meanwhile has taken a different approach, repeatedly calling out ""the open borders agenda"" of the Biden administration. Calling for more border agents to be hired and an end to the ""catch and release"" of migrants awaiting trial, he twice tweeted that Homeland Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas - whose agency is in charge of immigration enforcement - must resign over Monday's incident.

Angelica CasasReporting from San Antonio Today the road where the lorry stood last night is mostly empty, except for the occasional police car and stationed media. Yesterday it was the final destination for at least 50 migrants, who will never reach the cities or relatives they had been on their way to meet. Roberto Cantu, an artist from Dallas, made his way to San Antonio early this morning to bring mural prints depicting immigration. âWhat happened here really touched me,â Cantu said. âI see migrants as my brothers.â Other residents from the area have stopped by to see if there are any updates or to find out how they can help. San Antonio is an immigrant city with predominantly Latino roots, and is home to several migrant shelters and refugee communities. Itâs used to lending a helping hand to foreigners. Now, itâs the scene of a crime, forced to question how dozens of migrants would end up perishing here. Mexico's Foreign Minister Marcelo Ebrard says the country's attorney general will investigate the migrant deaths in Texas. A team will fly to Texas as part of the investigation, he added.

US President Biden says the Texas truck deaths show the need to take down the ""multi-billion-dollar criminal smuggling industry"". The practice is ""preying on migrants and leading to far too many innocent deaths,"" he comments in a statement. The criminals involved show ""no regard for the lives they endanger and exploit to make a profit,"" he adds. Biden says an investigation is ongoing. Guatemala's President Alejandro Giammattei has been speaking after it emerged at least seven of the migrants found dead in the truck were from his country. At a meeting in Washington DC, Guatemalan President Alejandro Giammattei blamed poverty, climate change and insecurity as primary drivers of migrants to the US. Stopping the flow of people, he said, will require building ""walls of prosperity"". [We need] safe, orderly, regularised migration,"" he said. On Monday, Giammattei met with US Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, saying that he was working on a âcommon strategic agendaâ to combat transnational organized crime and human trafficking. The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) has blamed the Biden administration's border policies for the deaths in Texas. The NBPC, is a labour union, which represents about 18,000 Border Patrol officers. In a series of tweets on Tuesday morning, the council said that the administration and its policies ""are the single biggest factor driving the criminal chaos on the border, and they must accept responsibility."" After the White House said the border was closed, the NBPC said: ""Someone should ask them how we end up with 46 people who were smuggled 250 miles from the border to San Antonio."" ""How did they get through a 'closed' border?"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Migration will be ""the main topic"" during Mexican President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador's 12 July visit to the US, according to Andrew Rudman, the director of the Washington DC-based Wilson Center's Mexico Institute. Rudman says a challenge is that there are no short-term solutions that would stop migrants from attempting the dangerous voyage. ""Even if you could address the root causes of migration throughout the hemisphere... and fix them all, that doesnât change the conditions for the people who feel that migrating to the United States under horrible conditions is the best option. Those people are leaving today,"" he said. Mexico, Rudman added, is likely to repeat calls for a number of changes, including an accelerated asylum adjudication process and for more US support for Mexican authorities dealing with migrants on their side of the border. These efforts, however, will do little to address the root causes of illegal migration. ""If you decide that the best thing you can do for your family
is pile into a truck with 50 other people, things are pretty bad,"" Rudman said. As we reported earlier, the US Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is leading a federal investigation into the deaths in Texas. A spokesperson for the agency confirms it has ""detained three individuals believed to be part of the smuggling conspiracy"". Anthony ZurcherBBC North America correspondent Governor Greg Abbott has hit out at the Biden administration It didnât take long after the
immigrant deaths in Texas were discovered for the political finger-pointing to
begin. Texas Governor Greg Abbott was
quick to assign blame, saying that President Joe Biden was responsible for the
fatalities. âThey are a result of his
deadly open-border policies,â he said. âThey show the deadly consequences of
his refusal to enforce the law.â That prompted a quick response
from White House Press Secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. âThe fact of the matter is,
the border is closed, which is in part why you see people trying to make this
dangerous journey using smuggling networks,â she said. Although jarring, the partisan
acrimony is not entirely surprising given the political environment in Texas at
the moment. Abbott is in the midst of a re-election campaign in which he has
made hard-line immigration policies, along with hot-button cultural and social
issues, a central feature. Abbott blames the Biden
administration's efforts to roll back Donald Trumpâs immigration policies for
creating a recent record surge of undocumented migrants at the border - although
many of those changes have been delayed by legal challenges. The governorâs Democratic
opponent, Beto OâRourke, has claimed Abbottâs stepped-up enforcement is in
part responsible for the human trafficking rings that endanger migrants who
lack legal avenues to enter the US. The San Antonio deaths come
just a month after the mass shooting in nearby Uvalde, Texas, which prompted
its own series of political accusations and recriminations between the two men. 50 deaths have been confirmed after bodies were found in a truck The United Nations is âdeeply distressed and shockedâ by the
news of dozens of migrant deaths in Texas, says Shabia Mantoo, a spokesperson
for the UNâs Refugee Agency. Mantoo tells the BBC that migrants, refugees and asylum
seekers worldwide are endangering their lives â or risking exploitation from traffickers â
by pursuing dangerous border crossings by land or sea. She explains that people in Central
America may flee to escape âpersecution, human rights violations or other abusesâ. Mantoo calls for safer alternatives, including âfair and
efficientâ asylum processes around the world â and more efforts to address the
root causes that make people flee their country. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Alex Scott: I will carry on despite sexist abuseThe TV presenter and ex-England defender says she feels a responsibility to change perceptions.,"The ex-Arsenal right-back, who made 140 appearances for England, has faced pushback since making the switch to TV presenting TV pundit and former England defender Alex Scott says she intends to continue as a football presenter despite receiving misogynistic comments. She told theRadio Times,externalshe has had tweets suggesting she stick to ironing and cooking, but feels a ""responsibility to change perceptions"". Scott, 37, has also been criticised for her accent, with one senior politician suggesting she have elocution lessons. Despite abuse the former Strictly star told the BBC she wanted to stay on air. She will be part of the BBC's coverage of the Women's European Championships next month. The Future of Women's Football - what we learned The ex-Arsenal right-back, who made 140 appearances for England, has faced pushback since making the switch to television presenting, including fromformer Labour minister and ex-House of Lords member Digby Jones last year, who criticised her pronunciation and asked if someone could give her elocution lessons. This video can not be played âWeâre not going anywhereâ - how female footballers are tackling online trolls The TV presenter, who is also a guest host of the One Show, said she had told the BBC's director of sport, Barbara Slater, that she ""didn't want to be taken off air because then who wins?"" Scott said: ""I've had so many tweets saying I should be at home ironing or cooking. ""I don't care about those, but sometimes people threaten my life and those have to be taken seriously. ""It's my responsibility to change perceptions by sitting in that chair and talking about football."" Alex Scott believes the women's game needs to be more diverse Hosts England are among the favourites for the Women's European championship, which begins on 6 July. Led by Dutch manager Sarina Wiegman, who won the Women's Euros with the Netherlands in 2017, England's first challenge will come on the opening night as they face Austria at Manchester United's Old Trafford stadium. Female football has steadily become more popular over the years, with more women and girls playing the sport, according to the Football Association. Scott said the game's growth has had its downsides and feels diversity within the teams needs to be addressed. She said concrete pitches in council estate areas ""aren't as important any more"" as ""academies have appeared that are maybe two hours away, and an inner-city street kid doesn't have the financial means to access them"". ""One of the girls I'm mentoring said that when she looks at the England team she doesn't see herself represented... That needs to be addressed,"" she said.

Is there a mandate for an independence referendum?,"Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs how she plans to holda second referendum on Scottish independence, regardless of whether or not the UK government grants formal consent. UK ministers have already indicated they will not do this. So, what are the arguments for and against another vote? There are more MSPs at Holyrood who support another independence referendum than there are against it. Together the SNP and the Greens won 72 of the 129 available seats. That majority - elected having made their indyref2 positions clear - is what Nicola Sturgeon has described as a ""cast iron democratic mandate"". What she does not have is the explicit legal power to hold a vote on Scotland's relationship with the UK - in or out of the 315-year-old union. Will there be another Scottish independence referendum? Sturgeon to set out indyref2 'route map' next week UK minister describes indyref2 plans as a 'wheeze' That's because the law setting up the Scottish Parliament specifically reserved decision-making over that part of the UK constitution to Westminster. That complicates and potentially trumps any mandate for a referendum. While some lawyers argue that it should be possible for Holyrood to hold a consultative ballot because the result would not be legally binding, others maintain that a Yes vote would undermine the union by creating the expectation of change. That would be for judges to decide. Ahead of the 2014 referendum, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for the vote to take place The way this tension was overcome for the 2014 referendum was byagreement between the Scottish and UK governments. The then prime minister, David Cameron, accepted that first minister at the time, Alex Salmond, had a mandate to ask voters if they would like independence. The Oxford Languages definition of a mandate is: ""the authority to carry out a policy, regarded as given by the electorate to a party or candidate that wins the election"". Mr Salmond and the SNP won a majority of the seats in the Scottish Parliament - 69 of 129 - under a proportional voting system designed to avoid any one party dominating. The SNP had promised a referendum in their manifesto. Westminster temporarily transferred powers to Holyrood, through what's known as asection 30 order, to allow MSPs to legislate for a referendum that was beyond legal challenge. That was then. The political mood is very different now. Not least because there has been a referendum, which was billed at the time as a ""once in a generation"" decision. Nicola Sturgeon and others on the Yes side repeated that ""once in a generation"" line throughout the 2014 campaign. I can also remember Alex Salmond explaining that the 17-18 year gaps between the Scottish constitutional referendums in 1979, 1997 and 2014 was what he meant by a generation. It can also be argued that Brexit fundamentally alters the circumstances in which that proposition was advanced - that it has been overtaken by events. As prime minister, Boris Johnson's view is that with a cost of living crisis and Covid recovery to deal with, ""now is not the time"" to revisit the independence question. Nicola Sturgeon thinks doing so is essential to allow Scotland to shape its own recovery. While Scottish SecretaryAlister Jack has said any request for another section 30 would be discussed, he's made pretty clear the answer would be ""no"". He has also rejected the idea that by refusing to co-operate the UK government would be denying democracy. ""I don't accept there's a mandate at all,"" he said. Mr Jack points out that, unlike 2011, theSNP did not win a majority of seats at Holyroodon their own. They were one short, with their total topped up by the Greens. Some who oppose indyref2 argue that the SNP - or perhaps the Yes side more generally - should also need to win a majority of the votes in the election. The SNP, Greens and Alba achieved that in the regional list ballot in 2021 but were outperformed in the constituency vote across Scotland by pro-UK parties, who consider that a mandate to resist indyref2. The Scottish secretary has even suggested that a majority of the electorate (not just those who actually vote) should be required. That would be a very high bar. The counter argument to all this is that the SNP and Greens have more seats and votes now than they had in 2011 and that therefore the mandate is stronger. Nicola Sturgeon has accused those who do not accept this of taking a ""wrecking ball"" to the idea of the UK as a voluntary partnership. To recap. One side thinks there is ""cast-iron"" authority for indyref2 while the other thinks it's non-existent. It may seem mind boggling that such difference is even possible. The problem, according to Chris Carman, a professor of citizenship at Glasgow University, is that ""there is no objective, independent benchmark on which to base claims of a mandate"". If vote strength is considered key, politics professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University argues that Nicola Sturgeon got ""at least as strong or equally arguably as weak a mandate as the one Boris Johnson secured in December 2019 to deliver Brexit"". In other words, Yes parties got roughly the same share of the vote in the constituency ballot at Holyrood in 2021 as Leave parties did in the Westminster election of 2019. The difference is that Holyrood does not necessarily have the legal clout to deliver what Nicola Sturgeon promised. TheScottish election study, carried out after the 2021 Holyrood election,external, suggests a majority of Scottish voters consider the outcome as a mandate for indyref2. That remains the case even when it is made clear the SNP did not win a majority of seats. However,more recent opinion polling suggests,externalthere may be limited public appetite for indyref2 being held before the end of 2023 as the Scottish government proposes. The debate is deadlocked with some suggesting there needs to be a Canada-style Clarity Act setting out the democratic route to independence. Without that or some other agreement between the two sides, it may be that the UK government has, in effect, a veto over Scottish government plans for indyref2. Nicola Sturgeon is determined to ensure that is not the case and set outher plans to bring about another referendumat Holyrood on Tuesday. By holding the line, Boris Johnson may hope that the Scottish public tire of constitutional politics and that the independence question fades in importance. It is also possible that UK resistance increases support for independence to levels that are harder to resist. That at least will be the aim of the indyref2 campaign that Nicola Sturgeon has started.

Sturgeon wants Scottish referendum on 19 October 2023,"Nicola Sturgeon names 19 October 2023 for a second independence vote and accepts her plan could be subject to legal scrutiny by the Supreme Court The first minister tells the Scottish Parliament that independence will not be easy but ""will help us chart our own course"" However, opposition leaders at Holyrood tell Ms Sturgeon that she should stop obsessing about another referendum and deal with the pressing issues facing the country today Ms Sturgeon will write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for discussions over establishing the pathway towards a second vote on the country's future When Scotland had the first referendum in 2014 it was made possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Boris Johnson - have refused to give that order for a second time Following Ms Sturgeon's statement, the PM said the details would be studied ""very carefully"" and the UK government would ""respond properly"" BBC Scotland News This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon proposes 19 October 2023 as date for referendum  That's all from the live page team. Have a lovely evening. James CookScotland Editor, BBC News The Queen attended an armed forces parade in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to address the
Scottish Parliament this afternoon, the British state was putting on a show
just over the road. At the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the armed forces were
paying tribute to the Queen in an act of loyalty parade - a rare public
appearance for the monarch these days. Of course it's not the 400-year-old
union of the Scottish and English crowns which the first minister wants to
dissolve, but the 300-year-old union of the parliaments. How? Part one of her
strategy is to try her luck in the Supreme Court, where many legal scholars
expect her to lose. If she does, part two kicks in - fighting the next general
election on the single issue of independence to try to generate political
rather than legal pressure. For its part the UK government appears confident
that Scottish voters do not want a referendum now - and the polls appear to support
that position. But ""not now"" is by definition not a long-term
strategy unless it is accompanied by a decline in support for independence. Given that polls also suggest leaving the UK is especially popular among
younger voters, it's not just Ms Sturgeon who is gambling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In the immediacy, Holyrood will go into its summer recess
after FMQs on Thursday. The first minister will be hoping she has charged things
up for a season of people engaging with the debate on independence. The Supreme Court is also due to go on its summer holidays
from 29 July. It is not yet clear when judges might consider the matter of
indyref2. The case will be referred directly to the President of the
court â Lord Reed, a Scottish judge â to decide how and when it will move
forward. In the meantime, the Scottish government will continue
building the case for independence, with detailed policy papers expected on
issues like currency and borders to come. Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says her party and the SNP were elected to Holyrood to deliver an independence referendum. ""With the best legal advice in the world you still need to take the matter to court so the first minister is quite right to push the point so there can be no question that any referendum we have is absolutely legal,"" she says. ""Knowing the legal status of that bill means we could move forward with a common understanding and the unionists will have to engage in the debate. If they think the Union is so great, why can they not say so? I think it is because they can't put a good case for the Union and they are afraid they are going to lose this time."" Loran Slater, Scottish Greens co-leader Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says he does not think there will be another referendum next year. Mr Cole-Hamilton tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that the lord advocate, Scotland's top law officer, should be questioned by the Scottish Parliament. He says it is very likely that she told the first minister that her plans for a referendum were illegal under the terms of the Scotland Act and that will be proven in the Supreme Court. Mr Cole-Hamilton says it is a ""sad and depressing day"" and ""a criminal waste of time and oxygen"" when there are many other things we should be focussing on. Craig Hoy, from the Scottish Conservatives, says Nicola Sturgeon has wasted more time in the Scottish Parliament talking about the independence referendum. ""I think it is quite clear this is the wrong priority and it is only right therefore that we do not engage,"" he tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime radio programme. Mr Hoy says it is for the Scottish government to debate how to bring forward an independence referendum because it is them who want to have it. ""It is quite clear from opinion polls that the Scottish people don't support another referendum next year and I'm not going to play the first minister's games,"" he adds. The Tory MSP insists the Scottish government should be focusing on the big issues it has powers over right now. Neil Gray says: ""Obviously we set out in the election last year that we wanted to give the people of Scotland their say over their future."" When you combine the SNP and the Greens there is an overwhelming majority at Holyrood for independence, the SNP minister says. He says his first preference would be for Boris Johnson to respect democracy, respect the will of the Scottish people and negotiate over a section 30 order. Mr Gray accepts the prime minister has said now is not the time for indyref2, so the SNP are looking to establish the legality of the Scottish Parliament progressing with a referendum bill to ensure they can enact the wishes of the people of Scotland. The Scottish government's Culture, Europe and International Development Minister, Neil Gray, tellsRadio Scotland's Drivetimehe thinks Nicola Sturgeon's route map is the right way to proceed. ""We're honouring the mandate that was given to the Scottish government,"" he says. ""An overwhelming majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament last year were elected on a prospectus of delivering a second independence referendum ""So first and foremost this is about respecting democracy."" He says he hopes the Supreme Court finds in his party's favour, but if it's unsuccessful they will make the next general election a de facto referendum. That would leave it to the Scottish people to have their democratic say, he says. So, 19 October 2023. That's the date when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would like to hold a second referendum on Scottish Independence. Legal approval for such a vote currently lies with the Supreme Court. But if that avenue proves unforthcoming then it is always within the gift of the prime minister to allow it to take place. Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""It's just a massive distraction. ""I would be very interested to see the actual legal advice the lord advocate has given the first minister, because it's clear that the bill is going to the Supreme Court first, in order to determine whether or not it's legal."" Mr Murray points out that without a section 30 agreement, a referendum is not legal. He says we are going to spend the next 18 months talking about the process of a referendum rather than key issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Speaking to reporters as he flew from the G7 summit in Germany
to the Nato summit in Spain, the prime minister was asked about Nicola
Sturgeonâs plans, which she announced while Boris Johnson was in the air. Mr Johnson said: ""I haven't seen anything she's said yetâ¦.We'll study it very
carefully and respond properly."" I think the focus of the country should be building a stronger economy. I certainly think that we'll have a stronger economy and a stronger country together."" Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Prof Aileen
McHarg, a public law expert from Durham University, says Ms Sturgeon made a ""clever move"" today. She says it was ""unexpected"" that the reference to the Supreme Court would happen in advance of a bill being passed by parliament. Prof McHarg knows of only one previous use of the procedure - by the attorney general for Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court refused to hear that case, she says. ""This is quite an obscure process, but I think it is quite a clever way to avoid all those arguments that you would have expected about the lawfulness of a bill as the legislation is going through the parliament."" She says it's a difficult call to suggest how the case would go. Prof McHarg adds: ""The test they will be applying is: is there more than a loose or consequential connection between this bill, or proposed legislation, and the reserved matter of the Union?"" The UK government has been quick to issue its response to Nicola Sturgeon's statement. âWe
are clear that now is not the time to be talking about another independence
referendum,"" a spokesperson said. âPeople
across Scotland want to see both of their governments working together on the
issues that matter to them. That includes tackling the cost of living, ensuring
energy security, leading the international response against Russiaâs invasion
of Ukraine and growing our economy. That remains our priority. âA
decision has been taken by the First Minister to publish a Bill, and the Lord
Advocate has made a referral to the UK Supreme Court. UK Government law
officers will now consider their response.â The spokesperson adds that the UK government will
respond to the first ministerâs letter to the prime minister in due course and its clear
view is that the constitution is reserved to Westminster. Pamela
Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, says Nicola Sturgeon ""is acting against the will of the people of Scotland"". She adds: âPoll after poll shows that the vast majority of us do not want a second
referendum. âThe first ministerâs announcement is a disgraceful waste of resources and
public money. The job of government is to focus on the peopleâs priorities â cutting NHS waiting times, improving education standards, tackling the climate emergency, creating more affordable housing, investing in social care, and growing our economy. Rather than divide the people of Scotland, as part of the UK we can invest more in public services and bring our communities together.â Pamela Nash, Scotland in Union chief executive In 2014, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for power to hold a referendum to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood Alex Salmond has given his reaction to Nicola Sturgeon's statement on indyref2. The former first minister says he welcomes the fact that ""we now have some clarity of purpose on independence
and that a starting gun has finally been fired with a clear timetable leading
to 19th October next
year"". He adds: ""However, we need a united movement and grassroots campaign to deliver
success. In particular, voices outwith government will be needed so that the
cause of independence is not weighed down by the day-to-day troubles of the
SNP/Green coalition. ""We should not give up on bending Boris Johnson to the peopleâs will on
a section 30 order to deliver a referendum under the same terms I previously
negotiated in the Edinburgh Agreement which enabled the referendum in 2014. ""There has never been a weaker UK prime minister. But that will require a
concerted campaign of popular, parliamentary and diplomatic initiatives. And it
is urgency which is required to stop Westminster taking Scotland to the
cleaners on a daily basis."" You can hear John Beattie's interview with Mr Salmond after the 16:30 news on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. Just click on the tab at the top of this page. The question of Scottish sovereignty can also not simply be left to the UK Supreme Court.  The concept of using the UK general election as a backstop will cause a wry smile to those within the SNP and in the wider movement who have been calling for that for the last five years. However, even then, we need to be prepared with the popular campaign which will be required to force recognition of Scotland's Claim of Right.â Alex Salmond, Former first minister Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent Scotland's Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain The fact Lord Advocate Dorothy
Bain is prepared to personally represent the Scottish government in this
case means it can be viewed as a genuine enterprise, not just some political
âwheeze.â But this remains a gamble for the first minister. The Supreme Court could rule there's no case
to answer, that the Scotland Act clearly reserves powers over the Union to
Westminster. The judges might decline to consider draft
legislation that is still subject to amendment, preferring instead to rule on a
finished bill. The stakes are high. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Downing Street has said it will âcarefully study
the detailsâ of Nicola Sturgeonâs proposal to hold a referendum on Scottish
independence in October 2023. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesman said the UK governmentâs
position remained unchanged. âBoth ours and the Scottish government's priority should be working together
with a relentless focus on the issues that we know matter to people up and down
the country,â the spokesman said. âBut a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully
study the details of the proposal and the Supreme Court will now consider
whether to accept the Scottish government's Lord Advocate referral.â Asked about whether the next general election would becoming a ""de facto
referendum"" as the first minister had suggested, the spokesman said they
would not get into âhypotheticalsâ. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent What was announced today is essentially a twist on Nicola
Sturgeonâs original plan for a referendum. That was to ask for a transfer of power from Westminster,
publish a bill and pass it through Holyrood, then defend it from legal
challenge in court. What changed today was that Ms Sturgeon isnât going to wait
for a legal challenge to her bill â instead, her government has moved to
trigger an immediate Supreme Court showdown, to settle the question of
competence once and for all. There may be a lot of familiar elements here, but if this
puts the legal argument to bed it will be a tangible step forward for the
independence debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Statement on Scottish independence referendum plan,"Nicola Sturgeon names 19 October 2023 for a second independence vote and accepts her plan could be subject to legal scrutiny by the Supreme Court The first minister tells the Scottish Parliament that independence will not be easy but ""will help us chart our own course"" However, opposition leaders at Holyrood tell Ms Sturgeon that she should stop obsessing about another referendum and deal with the pressing issues facing the country today Ms Sturgeon will write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for discussions over establishing the pathway towards a second vote on the country's future When Scotland had the first referendum in 2014 it was made possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Boris Johnson - have refused to give that order for a second time Following Ms Sturgeon's statement, the PM said the details would be studied ""very carefully"" and the UK government would ""respond properly"" BBC Scotland News This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon proposes 19 October 2023 as date for referendum  That's all from the live page team. Have a lovely evening. James CookScotland Editor, BBC News The Queen attended an armed forces parade in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to address the
Scottish Parliament this afternoon, the British state was putting on a show
just over the road. At the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the armed forces were
paying tribute to the Queen in an act of loyalty parade - a rare public
appearance for the monarch these days. Of course it's not the 400-year-old
union of the Scottish and English crowns which the first minister wants to
dissolve, but the 300-year-old union of the parliaments. How? Part one of her
strategy is to try her luck in the Supreme Court, where many legal scholars
expect her to lose. If she does, part two kicks in - fighting the next general
election on the single issue of independence to try to generate political
rather than legal pressure. For its part the UK government appears confident
that Scottish voters do not want a referendum now - and the polls appear to support
that position. But ""not now"" is by definition not a long-term
strategy unless it is accompanied by a decline in support for independence. Given that polls also suggest leaving the UK is especially popular among
younger voters, it's not just Ms Sturgeon who is gambling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In the immediacy, Holyrood will go into its summer recess
after FMQs on Thursday. The first minister will be hoping she has charged things
up for a season of people engaging with the debate on independence. The Supreme Court is also due to go on its summer holidays
from 29 July. It is not yet clear when judges might consider the matter of
indyref2. The case will be referred directly to the President of the
court â Lord Reed, a Scottish judge â to decide how and when it will move
forward. In the meantime, the Scottish government will continue
building the case for independence, with detailed policy papers expected on
issues like currency and borders to come. Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says her party and the SNP were elected to Holyrood to deliver an independence referendum. ""With the best legal advice in the world you still need to take the matter to court so the first minister is quite right to push the point so there can be no question that any referendum we have is absolutely legal,"" she says. ""Knowing the legal status of that bill means we could move forward with a common understanding and the unionists will have to engage in the debate. If they think the Union is so great, why can they not say so? I think it is because they can't put a good case for the Union and they are afraid they are going to lose this time."" Loran Slater, Scottish Greens co-leader Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says he does not think there will be another referendum next year. Mr Cole-Hamilton tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that the lord advocate, Scotland's top law officer, should be questioned by the Scottish Parliament. He says it is very likely that she told the first minister that her plans for a referendum were illegal under the terms of the Scotland Act and that will be proven in the Supreme Court. Mr Cole-Hamilton says it is a ""sad and depressing day"" and ""a criminal waste of time and oxygen"" when there are many other things we should be focussing on. Craig Hoy, from the Scottish Conservatives, says Nicola Sturgeon has wasted more time in the Scottish Parliament talking about the independence referendum. ""I think it is quite clear this is the wrong priority and it is only right therefore that we do not engage,"" he tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime radio programme. Mr Hoy says it is for the Scottish government to debate how to bring forward an independence referendum because it is them who want to have it. ""It is quite clear from opinion polls that the Scottish people don't support another referendum next year and I'm not going to play the first minister's games,"" he adds. The Tory MSP insists the Scottish government should be focusing on the big issues it has powers over right now. Neil Gray says: ""Obviously we set out in the election last year that we wanted to give the people of Scotland their say over their future."" When you combine the SNP and the Greens there is an overwhelming majority at Holyrood for independence, the SNP minister says. He says his first preference would be for Boris Johnson to respect democracy, respect the will of the Scottish people and negotiate over a section 30 order. Mr Gray accepts the prime minister has said now is not the time for indyref2, so the SNP are looking to establish the legality of the Scottish Parliament progressing with a referendum bill to ensure they can enact the wishes of the people of Scotland. The Scottish government's Culture, Europe and International Development Minister, Neil Gray, tellsRadio Scotland's Drivetimehe thinks Nicola Sturgeon's route map is the right way to proceed. ""We're honouring the mandate that was given to the Scottish government,"" he says. ""An overwhelming majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament last year were elected on a prospectus of delivering a second independence referendum ""So first and foremost this is about respecting democracy."" He says he hopes the Supreme Court finds in his party's favour, but if it's unsuccessful they will make the next general election a de facto referendum. That would leave it to the Scottish people to have their democratic say, he says. So, 19 October 2023. That's the date when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would like to hold a second referendum on Scottish Independence. Legal approval for such a vote currently lies with the Supreme Court. But if that avenue proves unforthcoming then it is always within the gift of the prime minister to allow it to take place. Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""It's just a massive distraction. ""I would be very interested to see the actual legal advice the lord advocate has given the first minister, because it's clear that the bill is going to the Supreme Court first, in order to determine whether or not it's legal."" Mr Murray points out that without a section 30 agreement, a referendum is not legal. He says we are going to spend the next 18 months talking about the process of a referendum rather than key issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Speaking to reporters as he flew from the G7 summit in Germany
to the Nato summit in Spain, the prime minister was asked about Nicola
Sturgeonâs plans, which she announced while Boris Johnson was in the air. Mr Johnson said: ""I haven't seen anything she's said yetâ¦.We'll study it very
carefully and respond properly."" I think the focus of the country should be building a stronger economy. I certainly think that we'll have a stronger economy and a stronger country together."" Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Prof Aileen
McHarg, a public law expert from Durham University, says Ms Sturgeon made a ""clever move"" today. She says it was ""unexpected"" that the reference to the Supreme Court would happen in advance of a bill being passed by parliament.

a section 30 order to deliver a referendum under the same terms I previously

The question of Scottish sovereignty can also not simply be left to the UK Supreme Court.  The concept of using the UK general election as a backstop will cause a wry smile to those within the SNP and in the wider movement who have been calling for that for the last five years. However, even then, we need to be prepared with the popular campaign which will be required to force recognition of Scotland's Claim of Right.â Alex Salmond, Former first minister Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent Scotland's Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain The fact Lord Advocate Dorothy
Bain is prepared to personally represent the Scottish government in this
case means it can be viewed as a genuine enterprise, not just some political
âwheeze.â But this remains a gamble for the first minister. The Supreme Court could rule there's no case

Westminster. The judges might decline to consider draft
legislation that is still subject to amendment, preferring instead to rule on a
finished bill. The stakes are high. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Downing Street has said it will âcarefully study
the detailsâ of Nicola Sturgeonâs proposal to hold a referendum on Scottish
independence in October 2023. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesman said the UK governmentâs
position remained unchanged. âBoth ours and the Scottish government's priority should be working together
with a relentless focus on the issues that we know matter to people up and down
the country,â the spokesman said. âBut a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully
study the details of the proposal and the Supreme Court will now consider
whether to accept the Scottish government's Lord Advocate referral.â Asked about whether the next general election would becoming a ""de facto
referendum"" as the first minister had suggested, the spokesman said they
would not get into âhypotheticalsâ. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent What was announced today is essentially a twist on Nicola
Sturgeonâs original plan for a referendum. That was to ask for a transfer of power from Westminster,
publish a bill and pass it through Holyrood, then defend it from legal
challenge in court. What changed today was that Ms Sturgeon isnât going to wait
for a legal challenge to her bill â instead, her government has moved to
trigger an immediate Supreme Court showdown, to settle the question of
competence once and for all. There may be a lot of familiar elements here, but if this
puts the legal argument to bed it will be a tangible step forward for the
independence debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Have a lovely evening. James CookScotland Editor, BBC News The Queen attended an armed forces parade in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to address the
Scottish Parliament this afternoon, the British state was putting on a show
just over the road. At the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the armed forces were
paying tribute to the Queen in an act of loyalty parade - a rare public
appearance for the monarch these days. Of course it's not the 400-year-old
union of the Scottish and English crowns which the first minister wants to
dissolve, but the 300-year-old union of the parliaments. How? Part one of her
strategy is to try her luck in the Supreme Court, where many legal scholars
expect her to lose. If she does, part two kicks in - fighting the next general
election on the single issue of independence to try to generate political
rather than legal pressure. For its part the UK government appears confident
that Scottish voters do not want a referendum now - and the polls appear to support
that position. But ""not now"" is by definition not a long-term
strategy unless it is accompanied by a decline in support for independence. Given that polls also suggest leaving the UK is especially popular among
younger voters, it's not just Ms Sturgeon who is gambling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In the immediacy, Holyrood will go into its summer recess
after FMQs on Thursday. The first minister will be hoping she has charged things
up for a season of people engaging with the debate on independence. The Supreme Court is also due to go on its summer holidays
from 29 July. It is not yet clear when judges might consider the matter of
indyref2. The case will be referred directly to the President of the
court â Lord Reed, a Scottish judge â to decide how and when it will move
forward. In the meantime, the Scottish government will continue
building the case for independence, with detailed policy papers expected on
issues like currency and borders to come. Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says her party and the SNP were elected to Holyrood to deliver an independence referendum. ""With the best legal advice in the world you still need to take the matter to court so the first minister is quite right to push the point so there can be no question that any referendum we have is absolutely legal,"" she says. ""Knowing the legal status of that bill means we could move forward with a common understanding and the unionists will have to engage in the debate. If they think the Union is so great, why can they not say so? I think it is because they can't put a good case for the Union and they are afraid they are going to lose this time."" Loran Slater, Scottish Greens co-leader Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says he does not think there will be another referendum next year. Mr Cole-Hamilton tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that the lord advocate, Scotland's top law officer, should be questioned by the Scottish Parliament. He says it is very likely that she told the first minister that her plans for a referendum were illegal under the terms of the Scotland Act and that will be proven in the Supreme Court. Mr Cole-Hamilton says it is a ""sad and depressing day"" and ""a criminal waste of time and oxygen"" when there are many other things we should be focussing on. Craig Hoy, from the Scottish Conservatives, says Nicola Sturgeon has wasted more time in the Scottish Parliament talking about the independence referendum. ""I think it is quite clear this is the wrong priority and it is only right therefore that we do not engage,"" he tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime radio programme. Mr Hoy says it is for the Scottish government to debate how to bring forward an independence referendum because it is them who want to have it. ""It is quite clear from opinion polls that the Scottish people don't support another referendum next year and I'm not going to play the first minister's games,"" he adds. The Tory MSP insists the Scottish government should be focusing on the big issues it has powers over right now. Neil Gray says: ""Obviously we set out in the election last year that we wanted to give the people of Scotland their say over their future."" When you combine the SNP and the Greens there is an overwhelming majority at Holyrood for independence, the SNP minister says. He says his first preference would be for Boris Johnson to respect democracy, respect the will of the Scottish people and negotiate over a section 30 order. Mr Gray accepts the prime minister has said now is not the time for indyref2, so the SNP are looking to establish the legality of the Scottish Parliament progressing with a referendum bill to ensure they can enact the wishes of the people of Scotland. The Scottish government's Culture, Europe and International Development Minister, Neil Gray, tellsRadio Scotland's Drivetimehe thinks Nicola Sturgeon's route map is the right way to proceed. ""We're honouring the mandate that was given to the Scottish government,"" he says. ""An overwhelming majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament last year were elected on a prospectus of delivering a second independence referendum ""So first and foremost this is about respecting democracy."" He says he hopes the Supreme Court finds in his party's favour, but if it's unsuccessful they will make the next general election a de facto referendum. That would leave it to the Scottish people to have their democratic say, he says. So, 19 October 2023. That's the date when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would like to hold a second referendum on Scottish Independence. Legal approval for such a vote currently lies with the Supreme Court. But if that avenue proves unforthcoming then it is always within the gift of the prime minister to allow it to take place. Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""It's just a massive distraction. ""I would be very interested to see the actual legal advice the lord advocate has given the first minister, because it's clear that the bill is going to the Supreme Court first, in order to determine whether or not it's legal."" Mr Murray points out that without a section 30 agreement, a referendum is not legal. He says we are going to spend the next 18 months talking about the process of a referendum rather than key issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Speaking to reporters as he flew from the G7 summit in Germany
to the Nato summit in Spain, the prime minister was asked about Nicola
Sturgeonâs plans, which she announced while Boris Johnson was in the air. Mr Johnson said: ""I haven't seen anything she's said yetâ¦.We'll study it very
carefully and respond properly."" I think the focus of the country should be building a stronger economy. I certainly think that we'll have a stronger economy and a stronger country together."" Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Prof Aileen
McHarg, a public law expert from Durham University, says Ms Sturgeon made a ""clever move"" today. She says it was ""unexpected"" that the reference to the Supreme Court would happen in advance of a bill being passed by parliament. Prof McHarg knows of only one previous use of the procedure - by the attorney general for Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court refused to hear that case, she says. ""This is quite an obscure process, but I think it is quite a clever way to avoid all those arguments that you would have expected about the lawfulness of a bill as the legislation is going through the parliament."" She says it's a difficult call to suggest how the case would go. Prof McHarg adds: ""The test they will be applying is: is there more than a loose or consequential connection between this bill, or proposed legislation, and the reserved matter of the Union?"" The UK government has been quick to issue its response to Nicola Sturgeon's statement. âWe
are clear that now is not the time to be talking about another independence
referendum,"" a spokesperson said. âPeople
across Scotland want to see both of their governments working together on the
issues that matter to them. That includes tackling the cost of living, ensuring
energy security, leading the international response against Russiaâs invasion
of Ukraine and growing our economy. That remains our priority. âA
decision has been taken by the First Minister to publish a Bill, and the Lord
Advocate has made a referral to the UK Supreme Court. UK Government law
officers will now consider their response.â The spokesperson adds that the UK government will
respond to the first ministerâs letter to the prime minister in due course and its clear
view is that the constitution is reserved to Westminster. Pamela
Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, says Nicola Sturgeon ""is acting against the will of the people of Scotland"". She adds: âPoll after poll shows that the vast majority of us do not want a second
referendum. âThe first ministerâs announcement is a disgraceful waste of resources and
public money. The job of government is to focus on the peopleâs priorities â cutting NHS waiting times, improving education standards, tackling the climate emergency, creating more affordable housing, investing in social care, and growing our economy. Rather than divide the people of Scotland, as part of the UK we can invest more in public services and bring our communities together.â Pamela Nash, Scotland in Union chief executive In 2014, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for power to hold a referendum to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood Alex Salmond has given his reaction to Nicola Sturgeon's statement on indyref2. The former first minister says he welcomes the fact that ""we now have some clarity of purpose on independence
and that a starting gun has finally been fired with a clear timetable leading
to 19th October next
year"". He adds: ""However, we need a united movement and grassroots campaign to deliver

independence in October 2023. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesman said the UK governmentâs
position remained unchanged. âBoth ours and the Scottish government's priority should be working together
with a relentless focus on the issues that we know matter to people up and down
the country,â the spokesman said. âBut a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully
study the details of the proposal and the Supreme Court will now consider
whether to accept the Scottish government's Lord Advocate referral.â Asked about whether the next general election would becoming a ""de facto
referendum"" as the first minister had suggested, the spokesman said they
would not get into âhypotheticalsâ. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent What was announced today is essentially a twist on Nicola
Sturgeonâs original plan for a referendum. That was to ask for a transfer of power from Westminster,
publish a bill and pass it through Holyrood, then defend it from legal
challenge in court. What changed today was that Ms Sturgeon isnât going to wait
for a legal challenge to her bill â instead, her government has moved to
trigger an immediate Supreme Court showdown, to settle the question of
competence once and for all. There may be a lot of familiar elements here, but if this
puts the legal argument to bed it will be a tangible step forward for the
independence debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Population of England and Wales up 6% in a decadeLast year's census shows one of the biggest population rises ever recorded.UK,"The population of England and Wales has risen to 59,597,300, the first results from the 2021 census have shown. It grew by more than 3.5 million (6.3%) since the previous census in 2011, and has more people over 65 than ever. When added to published census figures for Northern Ireland and official estimate of the Scottish population for 2020, the UK population now stands at 66,966,400. The rise is one of the biggest since the census began in 1801. And it shows the population rose in each of the English regions and Wales. The census, carried out every 10 years by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), asks people to answer questions about themselves, their household and their home to build a detailed snapshot of society. The results are intended to help organisations make decisions on planning and funding public services such as transport, education and healthcare. The 2021 survey was carried out on 21 March last year, and came against the backdrop of Brexit -  which has seen restrictions on immigration - and the coronavirus pandemic. It is in the local detail where this census will have its biggest impact. The population of each local authority dictates how much funding the council gets, so if the figure published on Tuesday is markedly below the population projection for that area, it could mean budget cuts. The number of people in Kensington and Chelsea on census day was 10% lower than the figure at the previous census in 2011. Westminster was down 7%. One theory is that some of the wealthier residents had gone to their second or third homes during the pandemic. Among the places which saw the biggest increases were Tewkesbury and Vale of White Horse on the edge of the Cotswolds. The figures show one sixth (18.6%, 11.1 million) of the population in 2021 are now over 65 - up from 16.4% (9.2 million) in 2011. Some 0.9% of the population, 527,900 people, are now aged 90 or over. In 2011 that figure was 429,017, or 0.8% of the population. There were 10.4 million people aged 15 and under in 2021, the figures show, making up 17.4% of the population. There are more people in this age group compared with 2011, but the proportion of the overall population aged 15 or under has decreased slightly from 17.6% since 2011. Overall, the highest population growth was in the east of England, which gained approximately 488,000 people from 2011 - an increase of 8.3%. Wales had the smallest population growth, of 1.4%, and the north-east of England increased by 1.9%. Some large towns and cities have seen their populations fall, including Sunderland, Gateshead, Swansea and the London boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Westminster. The place with the biggest increases was the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, where the population grew by 22.1%. Bedford, Cambridge and Peterborough all saw big increases. Your device may not support this visualisation The census counted 30,420,100 women (51.0% of the overall population) and 29,177,200 men (49.0%) in England and Wales. Population growth has slowed slightly across the last decade. Between 2001 and 2011 the figure for England and Wales grew by 7.8%. The census has counted half a million fewer people than was projected. Data from the 2021 census for England and Wales will be published in stages over the next two years, the ONS said. Future releases will include figures on ethnicity, religion, the labour market, education and housing. Also, for the first time, there will be information on UK armed forces veterans, sexual orientation and gender identity.

Statement due on Scottish independence referendum,"Nicola Sturgeon names 19 October 2023 for a second independence vote and accepts her plan could be subject to legal scrutiny by the Supreme Court The first minister tells the Scottish Parliament that independence will not be easy but ""will help us chart our own course"" However, opposition leaders at Holyrood tell Ms Sturgeon that she should stop obsessing about another referendum and deal with the pressing issues facing the country today Ms Sturgeon will write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for discussions over establishing the pathway towards a second vote on the country's future When Scotland had the first referendum in 2014 it was made possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Boris Johnson - have refused to give that order for a second time Following Ms Sturgeon's statement, the PM said the details would be studied ""very carefully"" and the UK government would ""respond properly"" BBC Scotland News This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon proposes 19 October 2023 as date for referendum  That's all from the live page team. Have a lovely evening. James CookScotland Editor, BBC News The Queen attended an armed forces parade in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to address the
Scottish Parliament this afternoon, the British state was putting on a show
just over the road. At the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the armed forces were
paying tribute to the Queen in an act of loyalty parade - a rare public
appearance for the monarch these days. Of course it's not the 400-year-old
union of the Scottish and English crowns which the first minister wants to
dissolve, but the 300-year-old union of the parliaments. How? Part one of her
strategy is to try her luck in the Supreme Court, where many legal scholars
expect her to lose. If she does, part two kicks in - fighting the next general
election on the single issue of independence to try to generate political
rather than legal pressure. For its part the UK government appears confident
that Scottish voters do not want a referendum now - and the polls appear to support
that position. But ""not now"" is by definition not a long-term
strategy unless it is accompanied by a decline in support for independence. Given that polls also suggest leaving the UK is especially popular among
younger voters, it's not just Ms Sturgeon who is gambling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In the immediacy, Holyrood will go into its summer recess
after FMQs on Thursday. The first minister will be hoping she has charged things
up for a season of people engaging with the debate on independence. The Supreme Court is also due to go on its summer holidays
from 29 July. It is not yet clear when judges might consider the matter of
indyref2. The case will be referred directly to the President of the
court â Lord Reed, a Scottish judge â to decide how and when it will move
forward. In the meantime, the Scottish government will continue
building the case for independence, with detailed policy papers expected on
issues like currency and borders to come. Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says her party and the SNP were elected to Holyrood to deliver an independence referendum. ""With the best legal advice in the world you still need to take the matter to court so the first minister is quite right to push the point so there can be no question that any referendum we have is absolutely legal,"" she says. ""Knowing the legal status of that bill means we could move forward with a common understanding and the unionists will have to engage in the debate. If they think the Union is so great, why can they not say so? I think it is because they can't put a good case for the Union and they are afraid they are going to lose this time."" Loran Slater, Scottish Greens co-leader Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says he does not think there will be another referendum next year. Mr Cole-Hamilton tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that the lord advocate, Scotland's top law officer, should be questioned by the Scottish Parliament. He says it is very likely that she told the first minister that her plans for a referendum were illegal under the terms of the Scotland Act and that will be proven in the Supreme Court. Mr Cole-Hamilton says it is a ""sad and depressing day"" and ""a criminal waste of time and oxygen"" when there are many other things we should be focussing on. Craig Hoy, from the Scottish Conservatives, says Nicola Sturgeon has wasted more time in the Scottish Parliament talking about the independence referendum. ""I think it is quite clear this is the wrong priority and it is only right therefore that we do not engage,"" he tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime radio programme. Mr Hoy says it is for the Scottish government to debate how to bring forward an independence referendum because it is them who want to have it. ""It is quite clear from opinion polls that the Scottish people don't support another referendum next year and I'm not going to play the first minister's games,"" he adds. The Tory MSP insists the Scottish government should be focusing on the big issues it has powers over right now. Neil Gray says: ""Obviously we set out in the election last year that we wanted to give the people of Scotland their say over their future."" When you combine the SNP and the Greens there is an overwhelming majority at Holyrood for independence, the SNP minister says. He says his first preference would be for Boris Johnson to respect democracy, respect the will of the Scottish people and negotiate over a section 30 order. Mr Gray accepts the prime minister has said now is not the time for indyref2, so the SNP are looking to establish the legality of the Scottish Parliament progressing with a referendum bill to ensure they can enact the wishes of the people of Scotland. The Scottish government's Culture, Europe and International Development Minister, Neil Gray, tellsRadio Scotland's Drivetimehe thinks Nicola Sturgeon's route map is the right way to proceed. ""We're honouring the mandate that was given to the Scottish government,"" he says. ""An overwhelming majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament last year were elected on a prospectus of delivering a second independence referendum ""So first and foremost this is about respecting democracy."" He says he hopes the Supreme Court finds in his party's favour, but if it's unsuccessful they will make the next general election a de facto referendum. That would leave it to the Scottish people to have their democratic say, he says. So, 19 October 2023. That's the date when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would like to hold a second referendum on Scottish Independence. Legal approval for such a vote currently lies with the Supreme Court. But if that avenue proves unforthcoming then it is always within the gift of the prime minister to allow it to take place. Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""It's just a massive distraction. ""I would be very interested to see the actual legal advice the lord advocate has given the first minister, because it's clear that the bill is going to the Supreme Court first, in order to determine whether or not it's legal."" Mr Murray points out that without a section 30 agreement, a referendum is not legal. He says we are going to spend the next 18 months talking about the process of a referendum rather than key issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Speaking to reporters as he flew from the G7 summit in Germany
to the Nato summit in Spain, the prime minister was asked about Nicola
Sturgeonâs plans, which she announced while Boris Johnson was in the air. Mr Johnson said: ""I haven't seen anything she's said yetâ¦.We'll study it very
carefully and respond properly."" I think the focus of the country should be building a stronger economy. I certainly think that we'll have a stronger economy and a stronger country together."" Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Prof Aileen
McHarg, a public law expert from Durham University, says Ms Sturgeon made a ""clever move"" today. She says it was ""unexpected"" that the reference to the Supreme Court would happen in advance of a bill being passed by parliament. Prof McHarg knows of only one previous use of the procedure - by the attorney general for Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court refused to hear that case, she says. ""This is quite an obscure process, but I think it is quite a clever way to avoid all those arguments that you would have expected about the lawfulness of a bill as the legislation is going through the parliament."" She says it's a difficult call to suggest how the case would go. Prof McHarg adds: ""The test they will be applying is: is there more than a loose or consequential connection between this bill, or proposed legislation, and the reserved matter of the Union?"" The UK government has been quick to issue its response to Nicola Sturgeon's statement. âWe
are clear that now is not the time to be talking about another independence
referendum,"" a spokesperson said. âPeople
across Scotland want to see both of their governments working together on the
issues that matter to them. That includes tackling the cost of living, ensuring
energy security, leading the international response against Russiaâs invasion
of Ukraine and growing our economy. That remains our priority. âA
decision has been taken by the First Minister to publish a Bill, and the Lord
Advocate has made a referral to the UK Supreme Court. UK Government law
officers will now consider their response.â The spokesperson adds that the UK government will
respond to the first ministerâs letter to the prime minister in due course and its clear
view is that the constitution is reserved to Westminster. Pamela
Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, says Nicola Sturgeon ""is acting against the will of the people of Scotland"". She adds: âPoll after poll shows that the vast majority of us do not want a second
referendum. âThe first ministerâs announcement is a disgraceful waste of resources and
public money. The job of government is to focus on the peopleâs priorities â cutting NHS waiting times, improving education standards, tackling the climate emergency, creating more affordable housing, investing in social care, and growing our economy. Rather than divide the people of Scotland, as part of the UK we can invest more in public services and bring our communities together.â Pamela Nash, Scotland in Union chief executive In 2014, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for power to hold a referendum to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood Alex Salmond has given his reaction to Nicola Sturgeon's statement on indyref2. The former first minister says he welcomes the fact that ""we now have some clarity of purpose on independence
and that a starting gun has finally been fired with a clear timetable leading
to 19th October next
year"". He adds: ""However, we need a united movement and grassroots campaign to deliver
success. In particular, voices outwith government will be needed so that the
cause of independence is not weighed down by the day-to-day troubles of the
SNP/Green coalition. ""We should not give up on bending Boris Johnson to the peopleâs will on
a section 30 order to deliver a referendum under the same terms I previously
negotiated in the Edinburgh Agreement which enabled the referendum in 2014. ""There has never been a weaker UK prime minister. But that will require a
concerted campaign of popular, parliamentary and diplomatic initiatives. And it
is urgency which is required to stop Westminster taking Scotland to the
cleaners on a daily basis."" You can hear John Beattie's interview with Mr Salmond after the 16:30 news on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. Just click on the tab at the top of this page. The question of Scottish sovereignty can also not simply be left to the UK Supreme Court.  The concept of using the UK general election as a backstop will cause a wry smile to those within the SNP and in the wider movement who have been calling for that for the last five years. However, even then, we need to be prepared with the popular campaign which will be required to force recognition of Scotland's Claim of Right.â Alex Salmond, Former first minister Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent Scotland's Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain The fact Lord Advocate Dorothy
Bain is prepared to personally represent the Scottish government in this
case means it can be viewed as a genuine enterprise, not just some political
âwheeze.â But this remains a gamble for the first minister. The Supreme Court could rule there's no case
to answer, that the Scotland Act clearly reserves powers over the Union to
Westminster. The judges might decline to consider draft
legislation that is still subject to amendment, preferring instead to rule on a
finished bill. The stakes are high. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Downing Street has said it will âcarefully study
the detailsâ of Nicola Sturgeonâs proposal to hold a referendum on Scottish
independence in October 2023. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesman said the UK governmentâs
position remained unchanged. âBoth ours and the Scottish government's priority should be working together
with a relentless focus on the issues that we know matter to people up and down
the country,â the spokesman said. âBut a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully

Craig Hoy, from the Scottish Conservatives, says Nicola Sturgeon has wasted more time in the Scottish Parliament talking about the independence referendum. ""I think it is quite clear this is the wrong priority and it is only right therefore that we do not engage,"" he tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime radio programme. Mr Hoy says it is for the Scottish government to debate how to bring forward an independence referendum because it is them who want to have it. ""It is quite clear from opinion polls that the Scottish people don't support another referendum next year and I'm not going to play the first minister's games,"" he adds. The Tory MSP insists the Scottish government should be focusing on the big issues it has powers over right now. Neil Gray says: ""Obviously we set out in the election last year that we wanted to give the people of Scotland their say over their future."" When you combine the SNP and the Greens there is an overwhelming majority at Holyrood for independence, the SNP minister says. He says his first preference would be for Boris Johnson to respect democracy, respect the will of the Scottish people and negotiate over a section 30 order. Mr Gray accepts the prime minister has said now is not the time for indyref2, so the SNP are looking to establish the legality of the Scottish Parliament progressing with a referendum bill to ensure they can enact the wishes of the people of Scotland. The Scottish government's Culture, Europe and International Development Minister, Neil Gray, tellsRadio Scotland's Drivetimehe thinks Nicola Sturgeon's route map is the right way to proceed. ""We're honouring the mandate that was given to the Scottish government,"" he says. ""An overwhelming majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament last year were elected on a prospectus of delivering a second independence referendum ""So first and foremost this is about respecting democracy."" He says he hopes the Supreme Court finds in his party's favour, but if it's unsuccessful they will make the next general election a de facto referendum. That would leave it to the Scottish people to have their democratic say, he says. So, 19 October 2023. That's the date when First Minister Nicola Sturgeon would like to hold a second referendum on Scottish Independence. Legal approval for such a vote currently lies with the Supreme Court. But if that avenue proves unforthcoming then it is always within the gift of the prime minister to allow it to take place. Ian Murray, the Labour MP for Edinburgh South, tellsBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""It's just a massive distraction. ""I would be very interested to see the actual legal advice the lord advocate has given the first minister, because it's clear that the bill is going to the Supreme Court first, in order to determine whether or not it's legal."" Mr Murray points out that without a section 30 agreement, a referendum is not legal. He says we are going to spend the next 18 months talking about the process of a referendum rather than key issues. Prime Minister Boris Johnson Speaking to reporters as he flew from the G7 summit in Germany
to the Nato summit in Spain, the prime minister was asked about Nicola
Sturgeonâs plans, which she announced while Boris Johnson was in the air. Mr Johnson said: ""I haven't seen anything she's said yetâ¦.We'll study it very
carefully and respond properly."" I think the focus of the country should be building a stronger economy. I certainly think that we'll have a stronger economy and a stronger country together."" Boris Johnson, Prime Minister Speaking on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme, Prof Aileen
McHarg, a public law expert from Durham University, says Ms Sturgeon made a ""clever move"" today. She says it was ""unexpected"" that the reference to the Supreme Court would happen in advance of a bill being passed by parliament. Prof McHarg knows of only one previous use of the procedure - by the attorney general for Northern Ireland. The Supreme Court refused to hear that case, she says. ""This is quite an obscure process, but I think it is quite a clever way to avoid all those arguments that you would have expected about the lawfulness of a bill as the legislation is going through the parliament."" She says it's a difficult call to suggest how the case would go. Prof McHarg adds: ""The test they will be applying is: is there more than a loose or consequential connection between this bill, or proposed legislation, and the reserved matter of the Union?"" The UK government has been quick to issue its response to Nicola Sturgeon's statement. âWe
are clear that now is not the time to be talking about another independence
referendum,"" a spokesperson said. âPeople
across Scotland want to see both of their governments working together on the
issues that matter to them. That includes tackling the cost of living, ensuring
energy security, leading the international response against Russiaâs invasion
of Ukraine and growing our economy. That remains our priority. âA
decision has been taken by the First Minister to publish a Bill, and the Lord
Advocate has made a referral to the UK Supreme Court. UK Government law
officers will now consider their response.â The spokesperson adds that the UK government will
respond to the first ministerâs letter to the prime minister in due course and its clear
view is that the constitution is reserved to Westminster. Pamela
Nash, chief executive of the anti-independence group Scotland in Union, says Nicola Sturgeon ""is acting against the will of the people of Scotland"". She adds: âPoll after poll shows that the vast majority of us do not want a second
referendum. âThe first ministerâs announcement is a disgraceful waste of resources and
public money. The job of government is to focus on the peopleâs priorities â cutting NHS waiting times, improving education standards, tackling the climate emergency, creating more affordable housing, investing in social care, and growing our economy. Rather than divide the people of Scotland, as part of the UK we can invest more in public services and bring our communities together.â Pamela Nash, Scotland in Union chief executive In 2014, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for power to hold a referendum to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood Alex Salmond has given his reaction to Nicola Sturgeon's statement on indyref2. The former first minister says he welcomes the fact that ""we now have some clarity of purpose on independence
and that a starting gun has finally been fired with a clear timetable leading
to 19th October next
year"". He adds: ""However, we need a united movement and grassroots campaign to deliver
success. In particular, voices outwith government will be needed so that the
cause of independence is not weighed down by the day-to-day troubles of the
SNP/Green coalition. ""We should not give up on bending Boris Johnson to the peopleâs will on
a section 30 order to deliver a referendum under the same terms I previously
negotiated in the Edinburgh Agreement which enabled the referendum in 2014. ""There has never been a weaker UK prime minister. But that will require a
concerted campaign of popular, parliamentary and diplomatic initiatives. And it
is urgency which is required to stop Westminster taking Scotland to the
cleaners on a daily basis."" You can hear John Beattie's interview with Mr Salmond after the 16:30 news on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. Just click on the tab at the top of this page. The question of Scottish sovereignty can also not simply be left to the UK Supreme Court.  The concept of using the UK general election as a backstop will cause a wry smile to those within the SNP and in the wider movement who have been calling for that for the last five years. However, even then, we need to be prepared with the popular campaign which will be required to force recognition of Scotland's Claim of Right.â Alex Salmond, Former first minister Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent Scotland's Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain The fact Lord Advocate Dorothy
Bain is prepared to personally represent the Scottish government in this
case means it can be viewed as a genuine enterprise, not just some political
âwheeze.â But this remains a gamble for the first minister. The Supreme Court could rule there's no case
to answer, that the Scotland Act clearly reserves powers over the Union to
Westminster. The judges might decline to consider draft
legislation that is still subject to amendment, preferring instead to rule on a
finished bill. The stakes are high. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Downing Street has said it will âcarefully study
the detailsâ of Nicola Sturgeonâs proposal to hold a referendum on Scottish
independence in October 2023. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesman said the UK governmentâs
position remained unchanged. âBoth ours and the Scottish government's priority should be working together
with a relentless focus on the issues that we know matter to people up and down
the country,â the spokesman said. âBut a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully
study the details of the proposal and the Supreme Court will now consider
whether to accept the Scottish government's Lord Advocate referral.â Asked about whether the next general election would becoming a ""de facto
referendum"" as the first minister had suggested, the spokesman said they
would not get into âhypotheticalsâ. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent What was announced today is essentially a twist on Nicola
Sturgeonâs original plan for a referendum. That was to ask for a transfer of power from Westminster,
publish a bill and pass it through Holyrood, then defend it from legal
challenge in court. What changed today was that Ms Sturgeon isnât going to wait
for a legal challenge to her bill â instead, her government has moved to
trigger an immediate Supreme Court showdown, to settle the question of
competence once and for all. There may be a lot of familiar elements here, but if this
puts the legal argument to bed it will be a tangible step forward for the
independence debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Hamilton & F1 condemn Piquet over racist languageLewis Hamilton says ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1 after three-time world champion Nelson Piquet uses racially abusive language about him.BBC Sport","Nelson Piquet won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987 Lewis Hamilton has said ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1 after three-time world champion Nelson Piquet used racially abusive language about him. The 69-year-old Brazilian, who won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987, used a racially offensive term to refer to Hamilton in a podcast. Piquet has been condemned by Formula 1, Hamilton's Mercedes team and the FIA. ""It's more than language,"" said seven-time world champion Hamilton. ""These archaic mindsets need to change and have no place in our sport. I've been surrounded by these attitudes and targeted my whole life. ""There has been plenty of time to learn. Time has come for action."" Piquet was discussing the accident between Hamilton and Red Bull driver Max Verstappen on the first lap of last year's British Grand Prix. He described the incident as ""a joke"", said Hamilton had been ""lucky"" only Verstappen crashed, and used a swear word in expressing his opinion that Hamilton had made a mistake. This weekend's British Grand Prix is the first anniversary of the incident, which was one of a series between the two drivers as they disputed last year's world title - a championship decided in controversial circumstances at the 2021 finale in Abu Dhabi. An F1 statement said: ""Discriminatory or racist language is unacceptable in any form and has no part in society. ""Lewis is an incredible ambassador for our sport and deserves respect."" It added: ""His tireless efforts to increase diversity and inclusion are a lesson to many and something we are committed to at F1."" Piquet, who is the father of Verstappen's partner Kelly Piquet, has a history of making unsavoury and unpleasant statements. During his driving career, he publicly questioned Ayrton Senna's sexuality and called his rival ""the Sao Paulo taxi driver"". He also made offensive comments about Nigel Mansell and the Briton's wife when they were team-mates at Williams. ""We condemn in the strongest terms any use of racist or discriminatory language of any kind,"" said Mercedes. ""Lewis has spearheaded our sport's efforts to combat racism, and he is a true champion of diversity on and off track. ""Together, we share a vision for a diverse and inclusive motorsport, and this incident underlines the fundamental importance of continuing to strive for a brighter future."" The FIA, motorsport's governing body, said: ""The FIA strongly condemns any racist or discriminatory language and behaviour, which have no place in sport or wider society. ""We express our solidarity with Lewis Hamilton and fully support his commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion in motor sport.""

Petrol sales banned in crisis-hit Sri LankaThe country says it is saving its limited fuel supplies for vehicles used for essential services.,"Sri Lanka has suspended sales of fuel for non-essential vehicles as it faces its worst economic crisis in decades. For the next two weeks, only buses, trains and vehicles used for medical services and transporting food will be allowed to fill up with fuel. Schools in urban areas have shut, while officials have told the country's 22 million residents to work from home. The South Asian nation is in talks over a bailout deal as it struggles to pay for imports such as fuel and food. Sri Lanka is the first country to take the drastic step in halting sales of fuel to ordinary people ""since the 1970s oil crisis, when fuel was rationed in the US and Europe and speed limits introduced to reduce demand"", Nathan Piper, head of oil and gas research at Investec, told the BBC. He said the ban underlined the steep rise in oil pricing and limited foreign exchange reserves in Sri Lanka. Many of the island's residents don't know how they will cope without fuel. There have been long queues at filling stations across Sri Lanka for months. Chinthaka Kumara, a 29-year-old taxi driver in Colombo, thought the ban would ""create more problems for people"". ""I'm a daily wage earner. I've been in this queue for three days and I don't know when we will get petrol,"" he told BBC Sinhala. A member of the security forces stands guard outside a fuel station in Colombo Drivers have been asked to go home, with tokens distributed aimed at rationing scarce fuel stocks. Some kept queuing, but others couldn't. ""I was in a queue for two days. I got a token - number 11 - but I don't know when I will get fuel,"" S Wijetunga, a 52-year-old private sector executive, told the BBC. ""I need to go to the office now, so I have no option but to leave my vehicle here and go in a three-wheeler."" Kenat, a motorised rickshaw driver in the Colombo suburb of Kotahena, said people like him were being ""destroyed"". ""Our family used to have three meals a day. Now we eat only twice a day. If this continues, it will come down to one meal,"" he told BBC Tamil. With an economy hit hard by the pandemic, rising energy prices and populist tax cuts, Sri Lanka lacks enough foreign currency to pay for imports of essential goods. Acute shortages of fuel, food and medicines have helped to push the cost of living to record highs in the country, where many people rely on motor vehicles for their livelihoods. On Monday, the government said it would ban private vehicles from buying petrol and diesel until 10 July. What's behind Sri Lanka's economic crisis? How Sri Lanka's war heroes became villains No medicine for kids in a collapsing health system Cabinet spokesperson Bandula Gunewardena said Sri Lanka had ""never faced such a severe economic crisis in its history"". The cash-strapped country has also sent officials to the major energy producers Russia and Qatar in a bid to secure cheap oil supplies. Over the weekend, officials said the country had only 9,000 tonnes of diesel and 6,000 tonnes of petrol to fuel essential services in the coming days. It has been estimated that the stocks would last for less than a week under regular demand. ""We are doing everything we can to get new stocks, but we don't know when that will be,"" power and energy minister Kanchana Wijesekera told reporters on Sunday. In Colombo, protests against price hikes erupted in April, with mounting calls for the president to quit In May, the countrydefaulted on its debts with international lendersfor the first time in its history. That followed weeks of protests against President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's government. His brother Mahinda quit as prime minister, but the president is still under pressure to resign. ""The government seems to take no action at all,"" Kannan, another driver seeking fuel in the capital, told BBC Tamil. ""They are asking us to be patient. They say they don't have dollars. But I ask the government - who is responsible for this?"" He suggested ""educated youngsters"" should lead the country instead. Last week, an International Monetary Fund team arrived in Sri Lanka for talks over a $3bn (Â£2.4bn) bailout deal. The government is also seeking assistance from India and China to import essential items. New Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said earlier this month the country neededat least $5bn over the next six months to pay for essential goodssuch as food, fuel and fertiliser. In recent weeks, ministers alsocalled on farmers to grow more riceand gavegovernment officials an extra day off a week to grow food, amid fears of shortages. This video can not be played Watch: Shot dead by Sri Lankan police while trying to get fuel The government blames the crisis on the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. But many experts say mismanagement is the main cause of the economic collapse. Sri Lanka's foreign currency reserves dwindled to almost nothing after years during which it imported much more than it exported and racked up huge debts with China on controversial infrastructure projects. When Sri Lanka's foreign currency shortages became a serious problem in early 2021, the government tried to limit the outflow by banning imports of chemical fertiliser, telling farmers to use locally sourced organic fertilisers instead. This led to widespread crop failure. Sri Lanka had to supplement its food stocks from abroad, which made its foreign currency shortage even worse.

LiveLiveStatement due on Scottish independence referendumScotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon will outline her route map to a second independence referendum.Scotland,"Nicola Sturgeon names 19 October 2023 for a second independence vote and accepts her plan could be subject to legal scrutiny by the Supreme Court The first minister tells the Scottish Parliament that independence will not be easy but ""will help us chart our own course"" However, opposition leaders at Holyrood tell Ms Sturgeon that she should stop obsessing about another referendum and deal with the pressing issues facing the country today Ms Sturgeon will write to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for discussions over establishing the pathway towards a second vote on the country's future When Scotland had the first referendum in 2014 it was made possible because the UK government granted the necessary power, called a Section 30 order However, in the near eight years that have passed two Conservative prime ministers - Theresa May and Boris Johnson - have refused to give that order for a second time Following Ms Sturgeon's statement, the PM said the details would be studied ""very carefully"" and the UK government would ""respond properly"" BBC Scotland News This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon proposes 19 October 2023 as date for referendum  That's all from the live page team. Have a lovely evening. James CookScotland Editor, BBC News The Queen attended an armed forces parade in Edinburgh on Tuesday morning As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to address the
Scottish Parliament this afternoon, the British state was putting on a show
just over the road. At the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the armed forces were
paying tribute to the Queen in an act of loyalty parade - a rare public
appearance for the monarch these days. Of course it's not the 400-year-old
union of the Scottish and English crowns which the first minister wants to
dissolve, but the 300-year-old union of the parliaments. How? Part one of her
strategy is to try her luck in the Supreme Court, where many legal scholars
expect her to lose. If she does, part two kicks in - fighting the next general
election on the single issue of independence to try to generate political
rather than legal pressure. For its part the UK government appears confident
that Scottish voters do not want a referendum now - and the polls appear to support
that position. But ""not now"" is by definition not a long-term
strategy unless it is accompanied by a decline in support for independence. Given that polls also suggest leaving the UK is especially popular among
younger voters, it's not just Ms Sturgeon who is gambling. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent In the immediacy, Holyrood will go into its summer recess
after FMQs on Thursday. The first minister will be hoping she has charged things
up for a season of people engaging with the debate on independence. The Supreme Court is also due to go on its summer holidays
from 29 July. It is not yet clear when judges might consider the matter of
indyref2. The case will be referred directly to the President of the
court â Lord Reed, a Scottish judge â to decide how and when it will move
forward. In the meantime, the Scottish government will continue
building the case for independence, with detailed policy papers expected on
issues like currency and borders to come. Lorna Slater, co-leader of the Scottish Greens, says her party and the SNP were elected to Holyrood to deliver an independence referendum. ""With the best legal advice in the world you still need to take the matter to court so the first minister is quite right to push the point so there can be no question that any referendum we have is absolutely legal,"" she says. ""Knowing the legal status of that bill means we could move forward with a common understanding and the unionists will have to engage in the debate. If they think the Union is so great, why can they not say so? I think it is because they can't put a good case for the Union and they are afraid they are going to lose this time."" Loran Slater, Scottish Greens co-leader Scottish Lib Dem leader Alex Cole-Hamilton says he does not think there will be another referendum next year. Mr Cole-Hamilton tells BBC Scotland's Drivetime programme that the lord advocate, Scotland's top law officer, should be questioned by the Scottish Parliament. He says it is very likely that she told the first minister that her plans for a referendum were illegal under the terms of the Scotland Act and that will be proven in the Supreme Court. Mr Cole-Hamilton says it is a ""sad and depressing day"" and ""a criminal waste of time and oxygen"" when there are many other things we should be focussing on.

Rather than divide the people of Scotland, as part of the UK we can invest more in public services and bring our communities together.â Pamela Nash, Scotland in Union chief executive In 2014, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for power to hold a referendum to be transferred from Westminster to Holyrood Alex Salmond has given his reaction to Nicola Sturgeon's statement on indyref2. The former first minister says he welcomes the fact that ""we now have some clarity of purpose on independence
and that a starting gun has finally been fired with a clear timetable leading
to 19th October next
year"". He adds: ""However, we need a united movement and grassroots campaign to deliver
success. In particular, voices outwith government will be needed so that the
cause of independence is not weighed down by the day-to-day troubles of the
SNP/Green coalition. ""We should not give up on bending Boris Johnson to the peopleâs will on
a section 30 order to deliver a referendum under the same terms I previously
negotiated in the Edinburgh Agreement which enabled the referendum in 2014. ""There has never been a weaker UK prime minister. But that will require a
concerted campaign of popular, parliamentary and diplomatic initiatives. And it
is urgency which is required to stop Westminster taking Scotland to the
cleaners on a daily basis."" You can hear John Beattie's interview with Mr Salmond after the 16:30 news on BBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime programme. Just click on the tab at the top of this page. The question of Scottish sovereignty can also not simply be left to the UK Supreme Court.  The concept of using the UK general election as a backstop will cause a wry smile to those within the SNP and in the wider movement who have been calling for that for the last five years. However, even then, we need to be prepared with the popular campaign which will be required to force recognition of Scotland's Claim of Right.â Alex Salmond, Former first minister Kirsten CampbellBBC Scotland political correspondent Scotland's Lord Advocate Dorothy Bain The fact Lord Advocate Dorothy
Bain is prepared to personally represent the Scottish government in this
case means it can be viewed as a genuine enterprise, not just some political
âwheeze.â But this remains a gamble for the first minister. The Supreme Court could rule there's no case
to answer, that the Scotland Act clearly reserves powers over the Union to
Westminster. The judges might decline to consider draft
legislation that is still subject to amendment, preferring instead to rule on a
finished bill. The stakes are high. Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent Downing Street has said it will âcarefully study
the detailsâ of Nicola Sturgeonâs proposal to hold a referendum on Scottish
independence in October 2023. The prime ministerâs deputy official spokesman said the UK governmentâs
position remained unchanged. âBoth ours and the Scottish government's priority should be working together
with a relentless focus on the issues that we know matter to people up and down
the country,â the spokesman said. âBut a decision has been taken by the first minister, so we will carefully
study the details of the proposal and the Supreme Court will now consider
whether to accept the Scottish government's Lord Advocate referral.â Asked about whether the next general election would becoming a ""de facto
referendum"" as the first minister had suggested, the spokesman said they
would not get into âhypotheticalsâ. Philip SimBBC Scotland political correspondent What was announced today is essentially a twist on Nicola
Sturgeonâs original plan for a referendum. That was to ask for a transfer of power from Westminster,
publish a bill and pass it through Holyrood, then defend it from legal
challenge in court. What changed today was that Ms Sturgeon isnât going to wait
for a legal challenge to her bill â instead, her government has moved to
trigger an immediate Supreme Court showdown, to settle the question of
competence once and for all. There may be a lot of familiar elements here, but if this
puts the legal argument to bed it will be a tangible step forward for the
independence debate. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Cut prices, cost of living tsar urges businessesDavid Buttress will launch a taxpayer-funded campaign after asking business to come up with ideas to help consumers.","Businesses are being asked to cut prices for consumers in a new government campaign. Number 10's new cost of living tsar David Buttress asked business leaders on Monday night for their ideas on""how to help"" tackle the cost of living. A government source told the BBC the government will not provide any funding for businesses to cut prices. But a taxpayer-funded ad campaign to promote the initiative will run next month. The campaign would be about recognising the efforts of businesses who are trying to help consumers with the rising cost of living, and ""amplifying and channelling them"" as well as encouraging other businesses to do the same. The BBC has been told businesses will be encouraged to join the campaign by introducing price-cutting measures, and in exchange will add the campaign name and logo to their branding. The government intends to launch the campaign in early July. David Buttress is a former chief executive of Just Eat In a speech to business leaders at the CBI on Monday night, Mr Buttress told them he wanted their ""best ideas on how to help"" to take to the ""heart of government"". Examples he used to demonstrate how private companies could help included ""extending mobile phone company social tariffs"", ""learning from the success of Gregg's breakfast clubs"" - where the chain gives a free breakfast to some school children - or popularising apps that sell off cheap food that would otherwise go to waste. Theformer Just Eat chief executivesaid there were four points in the year that businesses could provide price cuts to help people - summer holidays, children returning to school for the new term, inflation going up in Autumn, and Christmas. The government will be ""rolling out the official name with branding and logos shortly"", Mr Buttress said. It's understood the slogan, which is still being decided, will promote a message about helping out in tough times, which businesses could display to give them ""kudos"", as a government source put it, by cutting their prices for consumers using money they would otherwise use on marketing. In 2020, thegovernment launched the 'Eat Out To Help Out' schemeto support hospitality businesses - where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays for a limited period. The Eat Out to Help Out campaign gave a discount to diners The government provided funding to the hospitality businesses during this period to fund the discount. It's understood that the proposed campaign will not see the government provide businesses with money to cut costs for consumers. Instead, the taxpayer will fund a public information campaign highlighting the campaign name, logo and what support and deals are available from the private sector. Technology minister Chris Philp told Sky News that there are no ""easy fixes"" to inflation, and said he did not believe pay rises would help. He said: ""If we have a series of across-the-board pay increases for everybody, then what is going to happen is that is just going to see even more inflation."" Mr Philp said the government was doing what it could to support the poorest households and he believed the current inflationary spike is only a ""transitory phenomenon"", driven by the war in Ukraine and the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.

F1 condemns Piquet's racist language about Hamilton,"Nelson Piquet won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987 Lewis Hamilton has said ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1 after three-time world champion Nelson Piquet used racially abusive language about him. The 69-year-old Brazilian, who won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987, used a racially offensive term to refer to Hamilton in a podcast. Piquet has been condemned by Formula 1, Hamilton's Mercedes team and the FIA. ""It's more than language,"" said seven-time world champion Hamilton. ""These archaic mindsets need to change and have no place in our sport. I've been surrounded by these attitudes and targeted my whole life. ""There has been plenty of time to learn. Time has come for action."" Piquet was discussing the accident between Hamilton and Red Bull driver Max Verstappen on the first lap of last year's British Grand Prix. He described the incident as ""a joke"", said Hamilton had been ""lucky"" only Verstappen crashed, and used a swear word in expressing his opinion that Hamilton had made a mistake. This weekend's British Grand Prix is the first anniversary of the incident, which was one of a series between the two drivers as they disputed last year's world title - a championship decided in controversial circumstances at the 2021 finale in Abu Dhabi. An F1 statement said: ""Discriminatory or racist language is unacceptable in any form and has no part in society. ""Lewis is an incredible ambassador for our sport and deserves respect."" It added: ""His tireless efforts to increase diversity and inclusion are a lesson to many and something we are committed to at F1."" Piquet, who is the father of Verstappen's partner Kelly Piquet, has a history of making unsavoury and unpleasant statements. During his driving career, he publicly questioned Ayrton Senna's sexuality and called his rival ""the Sao Paulo taxi driver"". He also made offensive comments about Nigel Mansell and the Briton's wife when they were team-mates at Williams. ""We condemn in the strongest terms any use of racist or discriminatory language of any kind,"" said Mercedes. ""Lewis has spearheaded our sport's efforts to combat racism, and he is a true champion of diversity on and off track. ""Together, we share a vision for a diverse and inclusive motorsport, and this incident underlines the fundamental importance of continuing to strive for a brighter future."" The FIA, motorsport's governing body, said: ""The FIA strongly condemns any racist or discriminatory language and behaviour, which have no place in sport or wider society. ""We express our solidarity with Lewis Hamilton and fully support his commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion in motor sport.""

Is there a case for a new independence referendum?,"Nicola Sturgeon has told MSPs how she plans to holda second referendum on Scottish independence, regardless of whether or not the UK government grants formal consent. UK ministers have already indicated they will not do this. So, what are the arguments for and against another vote? There are more MSPs at Holyrood who support another independence referendum than there are against it. Together the SNP and the Greens won 72 of the 129 available seats. That majority - elected having made their indyref2 positions clear - is what Nicola Sturgeon has described as a ""cast iron democratic mandate"". What she does not have is the explicit legal power to hold a vote on Scotland's relationship with the UK - in or out of the 315-year-old union. Will there be another Scottish independence referendum? Sturgeon to set out indyref2 'route map' next week UK minister describes indyref2 plans as a 'wheeze' That's because the law setting up the Scottish Parliament specifically reserved decision-making over that part of the UK constitution to Westminster. That complicates and potentially trumps any mandate for a referendum. While some lawyers argue that it should be possible for Holyrood to hold a consultative ballot because the result would not be legally binding, others maintain that a Yes vote would undermine the union by creating the expectation of change. That would be for judges to decide. Ahead of the 2014 referendum, Alex Salmond and David Cameron struck an agreement for the vote to take place The way this tension was overcome for the 2014 referendum was byagreement between the Scottish and UK governments. The then prime minister, David Cameron, accepted that first minister at the time, Alex Salmond, had a mandate to ask voters if they would like independence. The Oxford Languages definition of a mandate is: ""the authority to carry out a policy, regarded as given by the electorate to a party or candidate that wins the election"". Mr Salmond and the SNP won a majority of the seats in the Scottish Parliament - 69 of 129 - under a proportional voting system designed to avoid any one party dominating. The SNP had promised a referendum in their manifesto. Westminster temporarily transferred powers to Holyrood, through what's known as asection 30 order, to allow MSPs to legislate for a referendum that was beyond legal challenge. That was then. The political mood is very different now. Not least because there has been a referendum, which was billed at the time as a ""once in a generation"" decision. Nicola Sturgeon and others on the Yes side repeated that ""once in a generation"" line throughout the 2014 campaign. I can also remember Alex Salmond explaining that the 17-18 year gaps between the Scottish constitutional referendums in 1979, 1997 and 2014 was what he meant by a generation. It can also be argued that Brexit fundamentally alters the circumstances in which that proposition was advanced - that it has been overtaken by events. As prime minister, Boris Johnson's view is that with a cost of living crisis and Covid recovery to deal with, ""now is not the time"" to revisit the independence question. Nicola Sturgeon thinks doing so is essential to allow Scotland to shape its own recovery. While Scottish SecretaryAlister Jack has said any request for another section 30 would be discussed, he's made pretty clear the answer would be ""no"". He has also rejected the idea that by refusing to co-operate the UK government would be denying democracy. ""I don't accept there's a mandate at all,"" he said. Mr Jack points out that, unlike 2011, theSNP did not win a majority of seats at Holyroodon their own. They were one short, with their total topped up by the Greens. Some who oppose indyref2 argue that the SNP - or perhaps the Yes side more generally - should also need to win a majority of the votes in the election. The SNP, Greens and Alba achieved that in the regional list ballot in 2021 but were outperformed in the constituency vote across Scotland by pro-UK parties, who consider that a mandate to resist indyref2. The Scottish secretary has even suggested that a majority of the electorate (not just those who actually vote) should be required. That would be a very high bar. The counter argument to all this is that the SNP and Greens have more seats and votes now than they had in 2011 and that therefore the mandate is stronger. Nicola Sturgeon has accused those who do not accept this of taking a ""wrecking ball"" to the idea of the UK as a voluntary partnership. To recap. One side thinks there is ""cast-iron"" authority for indyref2 while the other thinks it's non-existent. It may seem mind boggling that such difference is even possible. The problem, according to Chris Carman, a professor of citizenship at Glasgow University, is that ""there is no objective, independent benchmark on which to base claims of a mandate"". If vote strength is considered key, politics professor Sir John Curtice of Strathclyde University argues that Nicola Sturgeon got ""at least as strong or equally arguably as weak a mandate as the one Boris Johnson secured in December 2019 to deliver Brexit"". In other words, Yes parties got roughly the same share of the vote in the constituency ballot at Holyrood in 2021 as Leave parties did in the Westminster election of 2019. The difference is that Holyrood does not necessarily have the legal clout to deliver what Nicola Sturgeon promised. TheScottish election study, carried out after the 2021 Holyrood election,external, suggests a majority of Scottish voters consider the outcome as a mandate for indyref2. That remains the case even when it is made clear the SNP did not win a majority of seats. However,more recent opinion polling suggests,externalthere may be limited public appetite for indyref2 being held before the end of 2023 as the Scottish government proposes. The debate is deadlocked with some suggesting there needs to be a Canada-style Clarity Act setting out the democratic route to independence. Without that or some other agreement between the two sides, it may be that the UK government has, in effect, a veto over Scottish government plans for indyref2. Nicola Sturgeon is determined to ensure that is not the case and set outher plans to bring about another referendumat Holyrood on Tuesday. By holding the line, Boris Johnson may hope that the Scottish public tire of constitutional politics and that the independence question fades in importance. It is also possible that UK resistance increases support for independence to levels that are harder to resist. That at least will be the aim of the indyref2 campaign that Nicola Sturgeon has started.

"UK population grew 6% in a decade, census shows","The population of England and Wales has risen to 59,597,300, the first results from the 2021 census have shown. It grew by more than 3.5 million (6.3%) since the previous census in 2011, and has more people over 65 than ever. When added to published census figures for Northern Ireland and official estimate of the Scottish population for 2020, the UK population now stands at 66,966,400. The rise is one of the biggest since the census began in 1801. And it shows the population rose in each of the English regions and Wales. The census, carried out every 10 years by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), asks people to answer questions about themselves, their household and their home to build a detailed snapshot of society. The results are intended to help organisations make decisions on planning and funding public services such as transport, education and healthcare. The 2021 survey was carried out on 21 March last year, and came against the backdrop of Brexit -  which has seen restrictions on immigration - and the coronavirus pandemic. It is in the local detail where this census will have its biggest impact. The population of each local authority dictates how much funding the council gets, so if the figure published on Tuesday is markedly below the population projection for that area, it could mean budget cuts. The number of people in Kensington and Chelsea on census day was 10% lower than the figure at the previous census in 2011. Westminster was down 7%. One theory is that some of the wealthier residents had gone to their second or third homes during the pandemic. Among the places which saw the biggest increases were Tewkesbury and Vale of White Horse on the edge of the Cotswolds. The figures show one sixth (18.6%, 11.1 million) of the population in 2021 are now over 65 - up from 16.4% (9.2 million) in 2011. Some 0.9% of the population, 527,900 people, are now aged 90 or over. In 2011 that figure was 429,017, or 0.8% of the population. There were 10.4 million people aged 15 and under in 2021, the figures show, making up 17.4% of the population. There are more people in this age group compared with 2011, but the proportion of the overall population aged 15 or under has decreased slightly from 17.6% since 2011. Overall, the highest population growth was in the east of England, which gained approximately 488,000 people from 2011 - an increase of 8.3%. Wales had the smallest population growth, of 1.4%, and the north-east of England increased by 1.9%. Some large towns and cities have seen their populations fall, including Sunderland, Gateshead, Swansea and the London boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Westminster. The place with the biggest increases was the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, where the population grew by 22.1%. Bedford, Cambridge and Peterborough all saw big increases. Your device may not support this visualisation The census counted 30,420,100 women (51.0% of the overall population) and 29,177,200 men (49.0%) in England and Wales. Population growth has slowed slightly across the last decade. Between 2001 and 2011 the figure for England and Wales grew by 7.8%. The census has counted half a million fewer people than was projected. Data from the 2021 census for England and Wales will be published in stages over the next two years, the ONS said.

Heathrow told to reduce passenger charge,"Heathrow has been told to cut passenger charges for airlines each year until 2026 by the Civil Aviation Authority. The regulator said the reduction in charges reflected the recent rebound in passenger numbers, but would still allow the airport to invest. But Heathrow, which wanted the charges raised, said the move would undermine the delivery of key improvements. The charges are paid by airlines, but can then be passed onto passengers via airfares. The fees go towards operating terminals, runways, baggage systems and security. At the moment, the average charge per passenger at Heathrow is Â£30.19, and the CAA has said this will fall to Â£26.31 by 2026. However, Heathrow wanted to increase it to Â£41.95. The CAA said the reduction in the charge ""reflects expected increases in passenger numbers as the recovery from the pandemic continues and the higher level of the price cap in 2022, which was put in place in 2021 to reflect the challenges from the pandemic at the time"". In December 2021, Heathrow was given permission to raise the passenger charge from Â£19.60 to Â£30.19 for this summer. BA Heathrow staff back summer strikes over pay Heathrow reopens Terminal 4 after Covid closure Richard Moriarty, chief executive of the CAA, said the cut in charges was ""about doing the right thing for consumers"". ""Our independent and impartial analysis balances affordable charges for consumers, while allowing Heathrow to make the investment needed for the future."" However, Heathrow chief executive John Holland-Kaye said the regulator ""continues to underestimate what it takes to deliver a good passenger service, both in terms of the level of investment and operating costs required and the fair incentive needed for private investors to finance it"". ""Uncorrected, these elements of the CAA's proposal will only result in passengers getting a worse experience at Heathrow as investment in service dries up,"" he said. How much should Heathrow be able to charge airlines per passenger for the cost of operating terminals, runways, baggage systems and security? The airport and major airlines that use it have very different views. The CAA says it has considered expected increases in passenger numbers, although it does highlight that uncertainties lie ahead, and Heathrow passenger numbers aren't predicted to recover to pre-Covid levels until 2025. It also talks of balancing the need for charges that are affordable for consumers - that is, that won't prompt big fare hikes - with allowing Heathrow to invest in big improvements that will improve passengers' experience. Heathrow argues that balance has not been got right. Airlines see today's announcement as positive, but called for the charges to be lower still. This is an important milestone but not the end of the story. The proposals are now subject to consultation before a final decision is published later this year. Then, there will be the option of appealing to the Competition and Markets Authority. Mr Moriarty told the BBC's Today programme that the strength of the recovery ""with more passengers coming in"" meant charges could be lowered. But he said the cap would still allow for Â£3.6bn investment by Heathrow, including new baggage systems for terminal 2. Earlier this month5,000 passengers were hit by Heathrow flight cancellationsafter problems with the baggage system led toluggage piling up. Mr Moriarty said that problems of disabled passengers being left on planes after other passengers had got off,highlighted by BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner, meant the airport must ""raise its game"". ""When it comes to disruption, everyone in aviation wants to avoid the scenes that we've seen over the last couple of months,"" he said. ""Everyone is working really hard to bring new people into the system with recruitment and we've also put pressure on the airlines to make sure their schedules over the next few months are deliverable for the passenger"". He said the proposals should take Â£4 off the cost of a ticket from Heathrow by 2026. At the moment, the Â£30.19 charge makes up about 5% of the cost of a typical fare from Heathrow to New York. Shai Weiss, the chief executive of Virgin Atlantic, said the regulator ""can and must go further to lower the cap"" from its proposals, especially as consumers face cost of living pressures. The chief executive of British Airways owner IAG, Luis Gallego, said: ""In 2022 airport charges at Heathrow will still be three times more expensive than its EU rivals and 56% higher than last year."" Industry body Airlines UK said the Heathrow charges were ""still too high"", adding that it was ""the most expensive airport in the world"". ""The CAA can and should go further to bring it into line with other European hubs,"" it added. The International Air Transport Association (Iata) called for Heathrow charges to drop ""now"", saying the rise announced in December 2021 was ""based on false assumptions that are already being proven wrong by the strong post-pandemic demand for travel"". Willie Walsh, Iata's director general, said: ""The CAA must stop rewarding this monopoly whose insatiable desire to gouge its customers will damage the competitiveness of 'Global Britain'.""

"UK population grew 6% in a decade, census showsThe population of England and Wales reached 59,597,300 last year, according to figures just released.UK","The population of England and Wales has risen to 59,597,300, the first results from the 2021 census have shown. It grew by more than 3.5 million (6.3%) since the previous census in 2011, and has more people over 65 than ever. When added to published census figures for Northern Ireland and official estimate of the Scottish population for 2020, the UK population now stands at 66,966,400. The rise is one of the biggest since the census began in 1801. And it shows the population rose in each of the English regions and Wales. The census, carried out every 10 years by the Office for National Statistics (ONS), asks people to answer questions about themselves, their household and their home to build a detailed snapshot of society. The results are intended to help organisations make decisions on planning and funding public services such as transport, education and healthcare. The 2021 survey was carried out on 21 March last year, and came against the backdrop of Brexit -  which has seen restrictions on immigration - and the coronavirus pandemic. It is in the local detail where this census will have its biggest impact. The population of each local authority dictates how much funding the council gets, so if the figure published on Tuesday is markedly below the population projection for that area, it could mean budget cuts. The number of people in Kensington and Chelsea on census day was 10% lower than the figure at the previous census in 2011. Westminster was down 7%. One theory is that some of the wealthier residents had gone to their second or third homes during the pandemic. Among the places which saw the biggest increases were Tewkesbury and Vale of White Horse on the edge of the Cotswolds. The figures show one sixth (18.6%, 11.1 million) of the population in 2021 are now over 65 - up from 16.4% (9.2 million) in 2011. Some 0.9% of the population, 527,900 people, are now aged 90 or over. In 2011 that figure was 429,017, or 0.8% of the population. There were 10.4 million people aged 15 and under in 2021, the figures show, making up 17.4% of the population. There are more people in this age group compared with 2011, but the proportion of the overall population aged 15 or under has decreased slightly from 17.6% since 2011. Overall, the highest population growth was in the east of England, which gained approximately 488,000 people from 2011 - an increase of 8.3%. Wales had the smallest population growth, of 1.4%, and the north-east of England increased by 1.9%. Some large towns and cities have seen their populations fall, including Sunderland, Gateshead, Swansea and the London boroughs of Kensington and Chelsea, Camden and Westminster. The place with the biggest increases was the east London borough of Tower Hamlets, where the population grew by 22.1%. Bedford, Cambridge and Peterborough all saw big increases. Your device may not support this visualisation The census counted 30,420,100 women (51.0% of the overall population) and 29,177,200 men (49.0%) in England and Wales. Population growth has slowed slightly across the last decade. Between 2001 and 2011 the figure for England and Wales grew by 7.8%. The census has counted half a million fewer people than was projected. Data from the 2021 census for England and Wales will be published in stages over the next two years, the ONS said. Future releases will include figures on ethnicity, religion, the labour market, education and housing. Also, for the first time, there will be information on UK armed forces veterans, sexual orientation and gender identity.

F1 condemns Piquet's racist language about HamiltonFormula 1 condemns three-time world champion Nelson Piquet for using racially abusive language about Lewis Hamilton.BBC Sport,"Nelson Piquet won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987 Lewis Hamilton has said ""archaic mindsets need to change"" and have no place in Formula 1 after three-time world champion Nelson Piquet used racially abusive language about him. The 69-year-old Brazilian, who won the world title in 1981, 1983 and 1987, used a racially offensive term to refer to Hamilton in a podcast. Piquet has been condemned by Formula 1, Hamilton's Mercedes team and the FIA. ""It's more than language,"" said seven-time world champion Hamilton. ""These archaic mindsets need to change and have no place in our sport. I've been surrounded by these attitudes and targeted my whole life. ""There has been plenty of time to learn. Time has come for action."" Piquet was discussing the accident between Hamilton and Red Bull driver Max Verstappen on the first lap of last year's British Grand Prix. He described the incident as ""a joke"", said Hamilton had been ""lucky"" only Verstappen crashed, and used a swear word in expressing his opinion that Hamilton had made a mistake. This weekend's British Grand Prix is the first anniversary of the incident, which was one of a series between the two drivers as they disputed last year's world title - a championship decided in controversial circumstances at the 2021 finale in Abu Dhabi. An F1 statement said: ""Discriminatory or racist language is unacceptable in any form and has no part in society. ""Lewis is an incredible ambassador for our sport and deserves respect."" It added: ""His tireless efforts to increase diversity and inclusion are a lesson to many and something we are committed to at F1."" Piquet, who is the father of Verstappen's partner Kelly Piquet, has a history of making unsavoury and unpleasant statements. During his driving career, he publicly questioned Ayrton Senna's sexuality and called his rival ""the Sao Paulo taxi driver"". He also made offensive comments about Nigel Mansell and the Briton's wife when they were team-mates at Williams. ""We condemn in the strongest terms any use of racist or discriminatory language of any kind,"" said Mercedes. ""Lewis has spearheaded our sport's efforts to combat racism, and he is a true champion of diversity on and off track. ""Together, we share a vision for a diverse and inclusive motorsport, and this incident underlines the fundamental importance of continuing to strive for a brighter future."" The FIA, motorsport's governing body, said: ""The FIA strongly condemns any racist or discriminatory language and behaviour, which have no place in sport or wider society. ""We express our solidarity with Lewis Hamilton and fully support his commitment to equality, diversity and inclusion in motor sport.""

Teachers' pay warning over industrial action,"The action affects a number of duties, including covering for other staff and overseeing exams Teachers in the NASUWT union taking action short of a strike could have pay deducted for breaching their contract. That is according to a letter from the teaching employers to school principals, seen by BBC News NI. Members of the NASUWT in Northern Irelandbegan industrial action short of a strike in May. The action affects a number of duties, including covering for other staff, overseeing exams, lesson plans, inspections and parent meetings. It came after teaching unions in Northern Irelandrejected a pay offer from employers as ""inadequate"". The NASUWT's Justin McCamphill said the letter was ""inflammatory and a naked attempt to intimidate and create anxiety for teachers immediately prior to the start of the summer break"". The NASUWT was the first union to take action in response, but the Irish National Teachers Association (INTO) is also set to ballot its members on industrial action over pay. INTO said some teachers were ""finding it impossible to make ends meet in the face of escalating costs associated with energy and food"". Members of the National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) also recently backed industrial action in an indicative ballot. The letter to school principals said the NASUWT action had implications for ""teachers' contractual obligations"". It came from Sara Long, chair of the Management Side, which is the umbrella body for teaching employers in Northern Ireland - including the Education Authority (EA), the Council for Catholic Maintained Schools (CCMS) and the Department of Education (DE). ""It is Management Side's view that by participating in the action short of strike as directed by the NASUWT its members are not fulfilling the full extent of their contractual obligations and are thereby in breach of contract,"" Ms Long wrote. She said a number of actions NASUWT members were taking were in breach of the Teachers' (Terms and Conditions of Employment) Regulations (NI) 1987. That included things like not submitting lesson plans to school management, limiting attendance at school meetings to once a month, not meeting parents outside teaching time and not co-operating with inspections. Teaching union begins industrial action Teaching unions brand pay offer inadequate ""Management Side cannot accept the partial performance of teachers' contractual duties and we have written to the NASUWT to request that it stands down the actions we consider to be a breach of contract,"" Ms Long's letter continued. ""We have advised that if this cannot be agreed, we will need to consider putting in place arrangements for the appropriate and proportionate deductions of salary from those teachers who are in breach of their contractual obligations."" She also said that Management Side were willing to meet NASUWT again in the coming weeks. The NASUWT said: ""The union will respond robustly to Management Side to advise them that their threats serve little purpose other than to unnecessarily escalate tensions during the trade dispute. ""The NASUWT will not hesitate to take steps to protect our members' interests and if the employers escalate the dispute by attempting to take retaliatory action against our members, then the NASUWT will not hesitate to call strike action.""

"Cut prices, cost of living tsar urges businesses","Businesses are being asked to cut prices for consumers in a new government campaign. Number 10's new cost of living tsar David Buttress asked business leaders on Monday night for their ideas on""how to help"" tackle the cost of living. A government source told the BBC the government will not provide any funding for businesses to cut prices. But a taxpayer-funded ad campaign to promote the initiative will run next month. The campaign would be about recognising the efforts of businesses who are trying to help consumers with the rising cost of living, and ""amplifying and channelling them"" as well as encouraging other businesses to do the same. The BBC has been told businesses will be encouraged to join the campaign by introducing price-cutting measures, and in exchange will add the campaign name and logo to their branding. The government intends to launch the campaign in early July. David Buttress is a former chief executive of Just Eat In a speech to business leaders at the CBI on Monday night, Mr Buttress told them he wanted their ""best ideas on how to help"" to take to the ""heart of government"". Examples he used to demonstrate how private companies could help included ""extending mobile phone company social tariffs"", ""learning from the success of Gregg's breakfast clubs"" - where the chain gives a free breakfast to some school children - or popularising apps that sell off cheap food that would otherwise go to waste. Theformer Just Eat chief executivesaid there were four points in the year that businesses could provide price cuts to help people - summer holidays, children returning to school for the new term, inflation going up in Autumn, and Christmas. The government will be ""rolling out the official name with branding and logos shortly"", Mr Buttress said. It's understood the slogan, which is still being decided, will promote a message about helping out in tough times, which businesses could display to give them ""kudos"", as a government source put it, by cutting their prices for consumers using money they would otherwise use on marketing. In 2020, thegovernment launched the 'Eat Out To Help Out' schemeto support hospitality businesses - where diners got a state-backed 50% discount on meals and soft drinks up to Â£10 each on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays for a limited period. The Eat Out to Help Out campaign gave a discount to diners The government provided funding to the hospitality businesses during this period to fund the discount. It's understood that the proposed campaign will not see the government provide businesses with money to cut costs for consumers. Instead, the taxpayer will fund a public information campaign highlighting the campaign name, logo and what support and deals are available from the private sector. Technology minister Chris Philp told Sky News that there are no ""easy fixes"" to inflation, and said he did not believe pay rises would help. He said: ""If we have a series of across-the-board pay increases for everybody, then what is going to happen is that is just going to see even more inflation."" Mr Philp said the government was doing what it could to support the poorest households and he believed the current inflationary spike is only a ""transitory phenomenon"", driven by the war in Ukraine and the effect of the Covid-19 pandemic.

Defence secretary asks for more military spending,"The UK has donated weapons to Ukraine, including next generation light anti-tank weapons (NLAW) Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has urged the prime minister to increase spending on the UK's armed forces in light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. In a speech, he said funding must react to the ""direct"" threat Russia poses to Europe. The UK currently spends around 2% of its GDP on defence, matching the target Nato sets for its members. But Mr Wallace has reportedly written to the PM asking for an increase to 2.5% by 2028. He later denied the 2.5% figure but at a conference hosted by the Royal United Services Institute think tank (Rusi), said investment needs to continue to grow before it ""becomes too late"". He described Russia as the ""most direct and pressing threat to Europe"" and said it was ""increasingly clear President Putin cannot be deterred by threat of punishment or the costs imposed upon his people"". ""I'm serious when I say there is a very real danger that Russia will lash out against wider Europe,"" Mr Wallace added. Boris Johnson, on his way to a Nato summit in Madrid, said the defence alliance had ""never been of more vital importance"" and described it as the ""indispensable guarantor of European security"". The PM said the UK was the third biggest defence spender in the world, with it allocating 2.3% of its national income. ""We've another Â£24bn going in under the current spending review, the biggest since the end of the Cold War"", he added. The prime minister also defended a decision to break a manifesto promise to raise defence spending by more than inflation every year in this parliament, saying: ""It should be looked at over the life of a parliament, not a single data point."" An assessment by Nato, published this week, indicated that the UK spent an estimated 2.26% of GDP on defence in 2021 and was on course for 2.12% in 2022. BBC political editor Chris Mason said it would have been more surprising if the government had stuck to the commitment given the rate at which prices were rising. Boris Johnson earlier declined to comment when asked about future defence spending levels on the final day of the G7 summit in Germany, but said the UK's commitment to spend 2% of GDP on defence was ""a floor not a ceiling."" New UK Army chief issues Russia rallying cry Defence funding boost 'extends British influence' Ukraine can hit Russia with UK weapons - minister General Sir Patrick Sanders, the new head of the Army, spoke at the same Rusi conference and outlined his plans to mobilise forces to deter Russian escalation of hostilities. He said he had never known such a clear threat ""as the brutal aggression of President Putin"" and likened the current conflict in Ukraine to the build-up to World War Two, describing it as a ""1937 moment"" - when the UK allowedHitler to expand German territory unchecked,external. ""We're living through a period of history as profound as the one our forebears did 80 years ago,"" he said. The mobilisation effort must start now to prevent war, not provoke it, according to the general. Gen Sir Patrick became chief of the Army earlier this month Allies' readiness and spending on defence was already on the agenda at the summit of Nato leaders in Madrid, which runs until Thursday. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg has already made clear he wants a target of members spending at least 2% of their annual national income on defence. Earlier, Nato's former deputy supreme commander, Sir Richard Shirreff, told the BBC the UK and its allies must build up its deterrent presence in order to prevent further Russian escalation. Nato had come a long way since the start of the conflict, he said, and every member state should equip their armed forces so they were ready for an offensive. The UK governmentsaid it was spending Â£1.3bn ($1.6bn) on military support for Ukraine, including sending long-range rocket systems. Anti-tank weapons, short-range missiles, armoured vehicles, drones and air defence systems have also been donated to the country.

Five key challenges for Nato at critical summit,"Canadian Nato troops during a military exercise in Latvia This week's Nato summit in Madrid comes at a critical time in the alliance's 73-year history. Russia's invasion of Ukraine has been described as the biggest strategic shock to the West since the 9/11 attacks of 2001. Nato is the sole military alliance capable of defending Europe from further Russian aggression, but does it have a strategy? Less than three years ago, France's President Macron declared Nato to be ""brain dead"". Yet from the moment Russian tanks rolled across the border into Ukraine, the Western response has been remarkable for its unity, speed and vigour. It has been reinvigorated with renewed purpose - strengthening borders and supplying weapons. On the eve of the summit in Madrid, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced what he called ""a fundamental shift in the alliance's deterrence and defence"", strengthening its defences on its eastern borders and raising its rapid response force to more than 300,000 troops. The alliance faces numerous challenges, from hybrid warfare to the destabilisation of the Balkans to cyber attacks, the militarisation of space and what to do about China's growing military power. For the first time, this Nato summit will address what it calls ""the challenges that Beijing poses to our security, interests and values"", Mr Stoltenberg said. Here are some of the most pressing issues likely to be on the table this week. What is Nato and how do countries join? Nato faces a balancing act. The world's most powerful military alliance, comprising 30 member states, three of them with nuclear weapons (US, UK and France), does not want to go to war with Russia. President Putin has repeatedly reminded the West he has a massive nuclear arsenal and even a low-level cross-border clash could quickly escalate out of control. So the biggest challenge for the last four months has been, and remains now, how to help Ukraine defend itself against this unprovoked invasion without getting drawn into the fighting itself. Nato members have been sending heavy artillery to Ukraine Early Western inhibitions about not upsetting Moscow by sending heavy weapons to Kyiv have been swept aside as gruesome details of alleged Russian war crimes and atrocities have emerged, backed up by satellite data. The Madrid summit will need to set out the extent of military help Nato countries can provide and for how much longer. For now, Moscow is winning in the Donbas, the largely Russian-speaking region of eastern Ukraine, albeit at massive cost in lives and material damage. Expectations are Russia will try to hang on to these territorial gains, perhaps annexing them in the same way it did with Crimea in 2014. In the absence of a peace treaty, Nato will face a new dilemma later. Does it continue to arm the Ukrainians as they try to claw back land Moscow now considers to be legally part of the Russian Federation? The Kremlin has indicated Western weapons striking Russian soil crosses a red line so the risks here of escalation would dramatically increase. If Russia had only attacked the Donbas and not invaded the whole of Ukraine on three sides, then it is possible we would not have seen such extraordinary unity in the West's response. Six rounds of EU sanctions are seriously hurting Russia's economy and Germany has cancelled for now the multi-billion Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would have brought Russian gas to northern Germany. But there are splits in the Western alliance over how far to punish Russia and how much pain Western economies can take. These will likely come to the surface in Madrid. Germany has been accused of dragging its feet over promised weapons deliveries while Hungary, led by a prime minister with close links to President Putin, has refused to stop buying Russian oil. At the other end of the spectrum those nations feeling most threatened by Moscow, namely Poland and the Baltic states, are pushing for the toughest line possible and more Nato reinforcements on their borders. Germany leads Nato's forward presence in Lithuania This region has the potential to be a major flashpoint between Nato and Russia. This month Russia threatened ""practical countermeasures"" after Lithuania blocked some EU-sanctioned goods travelling across its territory en route to Russia's Baltic exclave of Kaliningrad. Estonia's outspoken Prime Minister Kaja Kallas has lambasted Nato for being ill-prepared for a Russian cross-border invasion. The current strategy envisages trying to retake Estonian territory only after Russia has already invaded. ""They could wipe us off the map,"" she says. Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania were all once - involuntarily - part of the Soviet Union. Today, they are independent nations and all in Nato. There are four multinational battle groups stationed in these three countries, along with Poland, as part of what is called the Enhanced Forward Presence. The UK leads the one in Estonia, the US the one in Poland, Germany in Lithuania and Canada the one in Latvia. Yet, Nato planners know all too well these battle groups would only be a tripwire against a future Russian invasion. They are too small to prevent a concerted incursion by a reconstituted Russian army. Baltic leaders now want at least a division of Nato forces stationed in each country as a serious deterrent. This is likely to be a hotly-debated topic in Madrid. Finland and Sweden, both seriously rattled by Russia's full-scale invasion of a sovereign nation, have decided they want to ditch their neutrality and join Nato. The alliance is welcoming them with open arms, but it is not quite that simple. Turkey, a member since 1952, has been blocking their addition on the grounds both these Nordic countries harbour Kurdish separatists who Turkey views as terrorists. But because Finland and Sweden are so important to Nato, every effort will be made to find a way around Turkey's objections. Once they join, the Baltic Sea will effectively become a ""Nato lake,"" bordered by eight member states, with eventually a joined-up air defence and integrated missile system. Will Sweden and Finland go from neutral to Nato? Looking further afield, Nato will need to decide if it ever intends to admit new members such as Georgia and Moldova, with all the associated risks of provoking an already-paranoid Kremlin. Currently, Nato members are obliged to spend 2% of their annual GDP on defence, but not all of them do.Recent figures from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI),externalshow while the US spent 3.5% on defence and Britain spent 2.2%, Germany only spent 1.3% while Italy, Canada, Spain and the Netherlands were all falling well short of the 2% target. Russia spent 4.1% of its GDP on defence. When Donald Trump was US President, he famously threatened to take America out of the alliance if other member states did not pull their weight. This had some effect, but the Ukraine invasion has had more. Just three days after it began, Germany announced it would allocate an additional â¬100bn on defence and finally raise its quota above 2%. This week, the Nato chief announced that nine of the 30 member states have reached or exceeded the 2% target, while 19 have clear plans to reach it by 2024. The 2% figure, said Jens Stoltenberg, ""should be a floor, not a ceiling"". Western military chiefs and analysts are unanimous in calling for an urgent increase in defence spending if Russia is to be deterred from further aggression. But successive defence cuts over recent decades have prompted questions over whether Nato still has sufficient mass to deter a future Russian incursion. British soldiers participate in a Nato military exercise Although UK defence spending was recently boosted, there has also been massive waste in procurement. The current strength of the British Army is 82,000 troops including those in training, but after cuts this is due to fall to 72,500. More worryingly still, both Russia and China are ahead of the West in developing hypersonic missiles that can travel towards their target at more than five times the speed of sound and on an unpredictable flight path. All of this comes at a time of drastic global price rises in food and fuel, hot on the heels of the pandemic, so budgets are already tight. Allocating yet more money for defence may prove unpopular domestically when there are so many other pressing demands on government spending. But military chiefs warn that if Nato does not bolster its security now, then the cost of further Russian aggression in the future will be infinitely greater.

Logan Mwangi: Why did he have to die? asks father,"Ben Mwangi said his lasting memory of Logan was a ""happy little boy that called me Daddy"" The father of a five-year-old boy murdered by his mother, stepfather and a 14-year-old boy has asked why his son had to die in horrific circumstances. Angharad Williamson, 31, John Cole, 40, and the teen, who cannot be named,killed Logan Mwangiin July 2021. He suffered56 ""catastrophic"" injuriesand his body was dumped in a river near his home in Sarn, Bridgend county. ""It really doesn't seem real,"" said Logan's father, Ben Mwangi, in an interview with ITV. His son suffered multiple internal injuries, similar to those found in victims of a fall from a height or in a high-speed car crash. Logan's killers are due to be sentenced later this week after being convicted of murder in April. ""What child has to go through that sort of torture for such a long period of the time?"" asked Mr Mwangi, who had been denied contact with his son since April 2019 - around the time Williamson began her relationship with Cole. ""One of the biggest questions in my whole entire life I'll always be asking myself is, 'Why? Why did this happen? Why did Logan have to die?'"" FM rejects independent review of social services Logan's killers: A 'racist' and stockbroker's girl Angharad Williamson, John Cole and a 14-year-old are due to be sentenced for Logan's murder Friends said Cole told them he did not like Logan, and others said his attitude changed after becoming obsessed with the idea Williamson had cheated on him with Logan's father. ""For the past five years, I've been struggling and trying to fight just to see Logan,"" said Mr Mwangi ""All I've wanted to do was just be a dad."" A month before Logan was killed, social workers in Bridgendremoved him from the Child Protection Register. And the day before police found his body, a social worker spent 20 minutes outside Logan's home speaking to the defendants, but did not see or hear him. Ben Mwangi: ""If I can stop this from happening to anybody else, then that will be the biggest, positive, most positive thing"" Mr Mwangi said he had not been told his son was on the register and he wanted the law changed so social services had a duty to inform estranged parents. ""I probably would have tried to take him away,"" he said. ""If I can stop this from happening to anybody else, then that will be the biggest, positive, most positive thing."" He said his lasting memory of Logan was as a ""happy little boy that called me Daddy"". ""The wonderful memories I have with my son will never be tarnished,"" he said. ""They will forever be in my heart and soul."" Achild practice review,externalhas been launched into Logan's death which includes local councils, police, the probation service and NHS. An ITV documentary, The Murder Of Logan Mwangi, produced in conjunction with South Wales Police, starts on Thursday at 21:00 BST.

"Pilot scheme will pay Welsh care leavers Â£19k a yearMore than 500 people leaving care in Wales will be offered Â£1,600 a month for two years.Wales politics","The money offered by the Welsh government is thought to be the largest amount offered by a basic income pilot scheme A Â£20m experiment offering a basic income to young people leaving care will launch in Wales on Friday. From 1 July, the Welsh government will offer about 500 18-year-olds Â£19,200 a year before tax - no strings attached. One care leaver said the cash would be a ""safety blanket"" and others hope it will help give the 18-year-olds a good start. But the Welsh Conservatives feared the scheme could create more problems than it solves. Officials plan to analyse the scheme to see if the money - roughly in line with the living wage - can help the youngsters settle into independent living.

Rhian said care leavers were often limited in the amount of support they can get: ""It is a big change for us as care leavers from going from loads of support to basic support. ""It will definitely give people turning 18 this year a kickstart to what real life is and give them support around budgeting."" The scheme will run until 2025 - it will cost about Â£20m and will be offered to young people leaving care and turning 18 between 1 July and 30 June.

Mr Drakeford promised that ""advice and guidance"" will be available to the care leavers on the scheme for up to two years and said the programme could save taxpayers money. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that young people leaving care were ""over-represented in the prison population and over-represented in the mental health population"". ""We ended up spending a huge amount of money dealing with the consequences of failures,"" he said.

"Pilot scheme will pay Welsh care leavers Â£19k a yearMore than 500 people leaving care in Wales will be offered Â£1,600 a month for two years.","The money offered by the Welsh government is thought to be the largest amount offered by a basic income pilot scheme A Â£20m experiment offering a basic income to young people leaving care will launch in Wales on Friday. From 1 July, the Welsh government will offer about 500 18-year-olds Â£19,200 a year before tax - no strings attached. One care leaver said the cash would be a ""safety blanket"" and others hope it will help give the 18-year-olds a good start.
