'Millions' join Spanish women's strike,"This video can not be played Spain strike: 'Young women are incredible' Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Unions said 5.3 million women had joined the 24-hour strike, backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Hundreds of thousands of women have joined street protests across Spain, shouting ""if we stop, the world stops"". Events marking the day are being held in dozens of other nations. What is International Women's Day? What is the gender pay gap? Women taking part have stopped working and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. Police were called to stop protesters blocking main roads in Barcelona but some women pickets still brought areas to a standstill. Public transport nationwide is available but at reduced services and flights have also been affected. Evening marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities are leading events in 200 Spanish locations. The Spanish event began with the banging of pots in the early hours ""I lived under the dictatorship, I lived under democracy and we haven't made much headway,"" teacher Concha Noverges told Reuters news agency as she stood on a picket line at a public school in Madrid. ""A lot remains to be done and we, in the education sector, have a big role to play."" Ana Reyes, a 37-year-old PR executive, told AFP news agency she was striking ""in the hope that the importance of half of the population will be recognised and that it will bring about a real change"". Eight moments that make it the Year of the Woman Why Kim K's emojis have sparked a feminist debate Watch: The objects that empower me The 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for ""a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence"" and says: ""We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work."" A poll of 1,500 people for the El Pais daily suggested 82% supported the strike,external, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike to show how important their absence is but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. The two main unions had called for members to stop work for two hours in the morning. This video can not be played Thousands of women rallied in Madrid on Thursday Some have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was ""for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems"". Two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel GarcÃ­a Teresina and the president of the Madrid region, Cristina Cifuentes, said they would work longer hours to show the capacity of women. But well-known female presenters were absent from TV screens and radio airwaves. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on ""domestic"" strike. Thousands poured onto the streets in Barcelona The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. But the National Federation of Self-Employed Workers told El Pais that self-employed women remained overwhelmingly at work. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than men in the public and private sectors respectively,external, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said.

KFC returns to former chicken supplier,"Fast-food chain KFC has returned to its old distributor after suffering chicken shortages that forced the temporary closure of hundreds of outlets. Last month, the chain experienced widespread distribution problems after it decided to switch its logistics contract from Bidvest to DHL. But now Bidvest has signed a new agreement with KFC UK & Ireland to supply up to 350 of its 900 restaurants. Bidvest pledged ""a seamless return"". Until 13 February, all KFC's chicken was delivered by Bidvest. But after the contract switched to DHL, which uses software developed by the firm Quick Service Logistics (QSL), many of the food giant's outlets began running out of chicken products. At the time, DHL blamed ""operational issues"" at a warehouse near Rugby it was using for deliveries nationwide. ""Our focus remains on ensuring our customers can enjoy our chicken without further disruption,"" said a KFC spokesperson. ""With that in mind, the decision has been taken in conjunction with QSL and DHL to revert the distribution contract for up to 350 of our restaurants in the north of the UK back to Bidvest Logistics. ""We've been working hard to resolve the present situation with QSL and DHL. This decision will ease pressure at DHL's Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible."" KFC said more than 97% of its restaurants were now open for business, but there would be ""some limited menus"" before full service was resumed. Paul Whyte of Bidvest said the firm was ""delighted"" to resume its partnership with KFC. He added: ""KFC are a valued customer and we will provide them with a seamless return to our network.""

EU seeks Â£2.4bn customs duties from UK,"The EU says the UK owes uncollected customs duties The European Commission has written to the UK government saying the UK owes â¬2.7bn (Â£2.4bn) in customs duties on shoes and textiles imported from China. The UK is accused of doing too little to prevent fraud after it was warned about the problem by the EU's watchdog Olaf in 2017. It begins a legal process which could end at the European Court of Justice. HM Revenue and Customs said it did not recognise the commission's estimate of what it owed. The Olaf investigation said the UK was a ""significant hub"" for so-called undervaluation fraud - where importers can profit from evading customs duties and related taxes. The investigation found organised crime groups had been using fake invoices to undervalue goods being imported from China - many of which were destined for the black market in other parts of the EU, investigators claimed. Olaf have said they had warned HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) a number of times. But a government spokesman said: ""We do not recognise the European Commission's estimate of alleged duty loss. ""We take customs fraud very seriously, and we continue to evolve our response as new threats emerge. ""We will carefully examine the formal notice from the commission and respond in due course. ""The UK intends to continue to work closely with Olaf and the commission on customs fraud. ""HMRC has a very strong track record for tackling evasion and rule-breaking of all kinds, securing a record Â£28.9bn last year that would otherwise have gone unpaid."" HMRC said the commission's methodology overestimated UK import values and was not suitable to produce an estimate of alleged customs duty undervaluation. It said the estimate was based on EU average prices and failed to take into account the ""substantial growth in the low-value end of the UK clothing market"".

Over 80 but as healthy as a 20-year-old,"Professor Norman Lazarus, aged 82, has the immune system of a 20 year old Doing lots of exercise in older age can prevent the immune system from declining and protect people against infections, scientists say. They followed 125 long-distance cyclists, some now in their 80s, and found they had the immune systems of 20-year-olds. Prof Norman Lazarus, 82, ofKing's College London,,externalwho took part in and co-authored the research, said: ""If exercise was a pill, everyone would be taking it. ""It has wide-ranging benefits for the body, the mind, for our muscles and our immune system."" The research was published in the journalAging Cell.,external Prof Janet Lord, director of theInstitute of Inflammation and Ageing,external, at the University of Birmingham, and co-author of the research, said: ""The immune system declines by about 2-3% a year from our 20s, which is why older people are more susceptible to infections, conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and, potentially, cancer. ""Because the cyclists have the immune system of a 20-year-old rather than a 70- or 80-year-old, it means they have added protection against all these issues."" The researchers looked at markers in the blood for T-cells, which help the immune system respond to new infections. These are produced in the thymus, a gland in the chest, which normally shrinks in size in adulthood. They found that the endurance cyclists were producing the same level of T-cells as adults in their 20s, whereas a group of inactive older adults were producing very few. The researchers believe that being physically active in old age will help people respond better to vaccines, and so be better protected against infections such as flu. Steve Harridge, co-author andprofessor of physiology at King's College London,external, said: ""Being sedentary goes against evolution because humans are designed to be physically active. This video can not be played One elderly cyclist said he had the body fat of a 19-year-old ""You don't need to be a competitive athlete to reap the benefits - or be an endurance cyclist - anything which gets you moving and a little bit out of puff will help."" Prof Harridge and Prof Lazarus believe that highly physically active older people represent the perfect group in which to analyse the true effects of biological ageing. A separate paper in Aging Cell found that the cyclists did not lose muscle mass or strength, and did not see an increase in body fat - which are usually associated with ageing. I met a dozen of the cyclists, on a morning ride in Surrey.  Despite the bitter cold, they were universally cheerful, and clearly used to riding in all weathers. They are members ofAudax,external, a long-distance cycling organisation that organises events ranging from 100km to 300km. The older members - in their 80s - say they do only the ""short"" 100km (62-mile) rides, but this is still highly impressive. Pam Jones, 79, told me: ""I do it for my health, because it's sociable, and because I enjoy the freedom it gives you."" Brian Matkins, 82, said: ""One of the first results I got from the medical study was I was told my body fat was comparable to that of a 19-year-old."" Aged just 64, Jim Woods, is a comparative youngster in the group.  He averages 100 miles a week on his bike, with more during the summer. He said: ""I cycle for a sense of wellbeing and to enjoy our wonderful countryside."" Cycling 60 miles or more may not be your idea of fun, but these riders have found something that gives them pleasure, which is a key reason why they continue.

Island bones 'likely' to be Amelia Earhart's,"Researchers used photographs and clothing to determine that the bones match Bones discovered on a Pacific island in 1940 are ""likely"" to be those of famed pilot Amelia Earhart, according to a US peer reviewed science journal. Earhart, her plane, and her navigator vanished without a trace in 1937 over the Pacific Ocean. Many theories have sought to explain her disappearance. But a new study published in Forensic Anthropology claims these bones prove she died as an island castaway. The report claims they are a 99% match,external, contradicting an earlier conclusion. The study, titled Amelia Earhart and the Nikumaroro Bones, was first published by the University of Florida and conducted by Professor Richard Jantz from the University of Tennessee. It disputes that the remains found on the eastern Pacific island of Nikumaroro - about 1,800 miles (2,900km) southwest of Hawaii - belonged to a man, as a researcher had determined in 1941. Earhart was known to have been near the island when she vanished during her doomed attempt to fly across the globe. Earhart was perhaps the most famous woman in the world when she vanished A British party exploring the island for habitation in 1940 found a human skull, a woman's shoe, a Navy tool used by her navigator Fred Noonan (who also vanished), and a bottle of the herbal liqueur Benedictine -""something Earhart was known to carry"",external. ""There was suspicion at the time that the bones could be the remains of Amelia Earhart,""Dr Jantz wrote in the study,external. The party found a total of 13 bones, which were then sent to Fiji to be analysed by Dr D W Hoodless, who concluded that they had belonged to a male. But Dr Jantz argues that because forensic osteology - the study of bones - was still in its early stages, Dr Hoodless probably reached a wrong conclusion. ""Forensic anthropology was not well developed in the early 20th century,"" the paper states. Consulting Dr Hoodless' measurements of the bones, Dr Jantz used Fordisc, a modern computer programme now widely used by forensic anthropologists, to compare them to Earhart's height and body stature. The bones have unfortunately since been lost, and so cannot be analysed. But the research team used historical photographs, as well as her pilot's and driver's licences, to determine that her body proportions matched the skeletal remains. A ""historical seamstress"" was also consulted to analyse her clothing, including ""the inseam length and waist circumference of Earhart's trousers"". Amelia Earhart's stolen car found in LA Did Amelia Earhart die a Japanese prisoner? In pictures: Amelia Earhart ""This analysis reveals that Earhart is more similar to the Nikumaroro bones than 99% of individuals in a large reference sample,"" the report states. The research found the remains belonged to a taller-than-average woman of European descent, as Earhart was. ""This strongly supports the conclusion that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to Amelia Earhart."" ""Until definitive evidence is presented that the remains are not those of Amelia Earhart,"" Dr Jantz writes in the paper, ""the most convincing argument is that they are hers."" Earhart was the first woman to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, and was considered one of the most famous women in the world when the mystery of her disappearance began. She is still frequently honoured as a pioneer of women's empowerment, and was recently chosenby Mattel to be depicted as a Barbie doll.

Inventor says toxic fumes killed Kim Wall,"Kim Wall boarded Peter Madsen's submarine to interview him Danish inventor Peter Madsen has denied murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine, saying she died in an accident. At his trial in Copenhagen, Mr Madsen said the 30-year-old died of carbon monoxide poisoning when the vessel filled with toxic exhaust fumes. But he has admitted dismembering Ms Wall's body and disposing of it at sea. When asked why he did so, he told the court: ""I don't see how that mattered at that time, as she was dead."" Ms Wall's remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Kim Wall: What we know of macabre case 'Exceptional' journalist remembered Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Ms Wall's death. Kim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He initially denied cutting up her body, but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. Peter Madsen appeared calm on Thursday, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and black glasses. Members of the Wall family were also in the session. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court he denied murder but admitted ""violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse"". Explaining his version of events, Mr Madsen said the air pressure on board his submarine suddenly dropped while he was standing on the deck and Ms Wall was in the engine room. He said the vessel began to fill with exhaust fumes but he was unable to open the hatch and enter. ""When I finally manage to open the hatch, a warm cloud hits my face. I find her lifeless on the floor, and I squat next to her and try to wake her up, slapping her cheeks,"" he said. Asked why he had changed his story several times, Mr Madsen said that he had ""wanted to spare her family"" the ""gruesome details."" Maddy Savage, BBC News, Copenhagen This is a high-profile trial being covered by more than 100 journalists from around the world, with some queuing for hours in the snow to secure a good view from the court or the press room, where reporters are asked to remain silent and banned from making phone calls. During breaks, Danish journalists here have told me Peter Madsen's black T-shirt and jeans combination isn't unusual attire in courtrooms in Denmark, where casual business dress is common. What fluent Danish speakers here say is significant is that while he is able to speak at length about his own actions and his passion for all things nautical, his answers about what specifically happened to Kim Wall on the night she died have been shorter and less clear. He has continued to deny killing the Swedish journalist, repeatedly describing her death as ""terrible"". During the session, the prosecution said: It was not clear how Kim Wall died but there was the suspicion that Mr Madsen had ""psychopathic tendencies"" Pipes and straps discovered in the same bag as the journalist's clothes matched similar items found in his workshop Blood on his nose was the journalist's but there was no evidence of his sperm on her body Films found on his computer showed real women being tortured and mutilated Allow Twitter content?

The trial is expected to last 12 days over seven weeks, with a verdict expected on 25 April. The journalist was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. Kim Wall is seen here on board Peter Madsen's submarine on the evening of 10 August She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the ""Oxbridge of journalism"". She had a long career in journalism, having previously reported from North Korea, the South Pacific, Uganda and Haiti, writing for the New York Times, Guardian, Vice and the South China Morning Post.

Parsons Green victim 'engulfed in flames',"Ahmed Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life A witness to the Parsons Green bombing told the Old Bailey how his head was ""engulfed in flames"" during the attack. Stephen Nash was on the District Line underground train on 15 September 2017 when the device went off. CCTV allegedly shows Ahmed Hassan - who prosecutors said built the bomb and set the timer - leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life, The CCTV footage then showed the moment an orange fireball filled the carriage. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply ""luck"" that the bomb did not fully detonate. Mr Hassan was arrested at the Port of Dover the day after the attack. This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball Mr Nash told the court he was was reading a newspaper, ""oblivious"" to what was going on, when the explosion happened. He said: ""At Parsons Green there was a loud bang. There was a blinding flash to my left and I was engulfed in flames."" He described an ""intense heat"", before adding: ""I thought I had lost my ears. I thought my head was on fire."" Mr Nash said he was knocked out, and when he woke up a few seconds later, he was the last person on the train. ""I called out to the Tube,"" he said. ""Just as I got to the doors, the doors started to close. ""It was a little bit scary and I called out on to the platform."" Mr Nash was among a number of witnesses giving evidence at the trial. The court heard that many of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out. Retired counter-terrorism officer Alex Beavan had boarded the train at Wimbledon and was standing near the doors when the bomb went off. ""I heard a huge popping sound,"" he said. ""Looking towards the direction of the sound, I saw a rolling fireball coming over the ceiling at the back of the train. ""I saw the rolling fireball, wall to wall, slowly coming up the ceiling."" He added: ""Everything goes in slow motion. There was chaos and I was thinking there is going to be a second attack, so I ran across the platform."" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a ""wall of glass"" and flames coming towards her. She said: ""That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire."" Lucinda Glazebrook, who also boarded the train at Parsons Green, told the court she felt the heat from the fireball on her face. ""I kept touching my face and feeling the back of my hair and my hair was coming out in chunks,"" she said. An army officer travelling on the train turned towards the explosion because of his ""instinct"" and training. Craig Palmer told the court that he wanted to know what had happened so began walking towards where the device had partly detonated. He said: ""I had a seen the wall of faces in terror who rushed past me. ""I could see something in the corner of the train, it was burning. He added: ""There was smoke billowing out of it and the carriage was filling up with grey smoke. ""I could smell, at that point, something I categorise as being explosives."" Mr Palmer said he expected to see a ""suicide bomber"" but he discovered the bomb, which he believed to be an ""improvised explosive device"". He then took photos of it to share with special officers who arrived at the scene. A number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly shows him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. Jurors were also shown a replica of the home-made bomb without the explosive, which was held in a Lidl frozen goods bag and contained 2.2kg of shrapnel. The court was told that Mr Hassan's fingerprints were found on the Tube carriage, on a white plastic bucket inside the bag, and on a pair of trousers covering the bucket. His DNA was also found at the scene. Giving evidence, explosives officer Andrew Gee said a test carried out to identify the explosive used was an ""87% hit"" for the chemical compound TATP. On Wednesday, the prosecution said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack. that he had been ""trained to kill"" Ms Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016 where he is alleged to have told them he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The court also heard he had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury, but his asylum claim was still outstanding as he planned the attack. The trial continues.

"Girl, 11, hit by loose car wheel dies","Amelia Wood, a student at Louth Academy, died on Wednesday An 11-year-old girl has died after a wheel came off a passing car and struck her. It is believed that Amelia Wood was walking alongside a road in Manby, Lincolnshire, on Tuesday morning when a wheel fell off a Land Rover Discovery. She was taken to Queens Medical Centre in Nottingham, but died on Wednesday. Lincolnshire Police asked for anyone who saw the white vehicle travelling on the B1200 Manby Road towards Saltfleetby to get in contact. More on this story and others in Lincolnshire It is believed Amelia Wood was walking alongside a road in Manby when a wheel came off a Land Rover Discovery and hit her Officers said they had already spoken to several witnesses. They said they were still investigating how the wheel came off. Amelia was a pupil at Louth Academy, which described her as a ""vibrant, passionate and very determined student"" who was a keen netball player. Martin Brown, executive principal at the academy, said; ""She was a very popular and caring student who always helped and supported her friends. ""We are all devastated by such tragic news. We have a counsellor and pastoral staff to support students and offer help and guidance in the coming days and weeks."" Grimoldby Primary School said Amelia had moved up to secondary school last summer and would be remembered as a ""wonderful young lady"". Head teacher Simon Clark said: ""Amelia's kindness really shone through, and her peers voted her onto the school council when she was in Year 6.

Four in 10 parking ticket appeals succeed,"The RAC said the data was ""frightening"" and many drivers were ""right to appeal"" Almost half of drivers who challenged parking and bus lane fines issued by local authorities were successful, figures obtained by the BBC suggest. Four out of 10 appeals to hundreds of councils across the UK over five years led to fines being cancelled. Motoring group the RAC said the data was ""frightening"" and showed drivers were ""right to appeal."" The Local Government Association said the figures proved councils had an ""effective"" appeal process. Figures released under the Freedom of Information Act revealed that out of almost 4.3 million appeals, 1.8 million succeeded. They show 84 councils accepted more than half of challenges. Basingstoke and Deane council overturned fines in 90% of appeals. Aberdeenshire had the highest rate of successful appeals in Scotland, overturning 70% of challenged fines. Rhondda Cynon Taf in Wales cancelled 67% of challenged fines. The Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure revealed 29% of appeals succeeded. Councils say that fines are not about making money and that income from on-street parking charges and fines goes back into running parking services, with any surplus spent on transport projects. Richard Chaumeton keeps files of challenged parking fines in his company offices Richard Chaumeton runs a roofing and scaffolding business in Kentish Town, north London, but says he has become ""something of an expert"" on appealing against parking tickets. ""The parking attendants in Camden all call me 'Trouble',"" he said. Mr Chaumeton has successfully overturned hundreds of Penalty Charge Notices (PCNs) issued to his firm's vehicles across London - including ""about 1,500"" issued in Camden alone over more than a decade. With builders granted exemptions under the Traffic Management Act 2004 he says many tickets sent to his firm's vehicles should not have been issued, and criticised some authorities in the capital for their approach to appeals. ""They take it to [the Traffic Penalty Tribunal,external] to put as many impediments in your way as they can,"" he said. ""It's a very simple equation: it's all about money. ""They've driven us mad."" Camden Council said that it ""may not always be obvious"" to a parking warden that a vehicle belongs to a builder and is exempt. A spokesman said: ""As with other councils we take a similar approach to errors made in good faith."" He said the council would cancel PCNs the first time a driver incorrectly entered their registration number into a pay for parking machine and that any PCNs issued in error would be withdrawn. Richard Chaumeton's folders full of parking ticket appeals Derek Dishman has helped numerous motorists challenge their parking fines. Under the alias of 'Mr Mustard', he dealt with 345 cases in 2017 and said there were significant differences in how councils handle parking tickets across the UK. He said authorities should be ""lenient"" when drivers have good reasons to ask for a refund, and urged motorists not be to scared of going through the appeals process. ""If I was a parking manager and people write in with a half-decent excuse, I would just let it go,"" he said. ""It's mostly people making innocent errors or failing to understand complicated signs."" Five patients made 8,303 emergency calls Two million to get 'big freeze' payments The fun stopped here: England's derelict theme parks Councillor Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association, said: ""As these figures confirm, people who want to challenge a parking fine have access to a clear and effective appeals process. ""Councils have to strike a difficult balance when setting parking policy, to make sure that there are spaces available for residents, high streets are kept vibrant and traffic is kept moving. They also need to ensure that emergency vehicles can get access to incidents quickly."" RAC spokesman Simon Williams said councils should put right the issues that lead to people being given ""erroneous"" penalties in the first place. He said: ""These figures are frightening because they reveal that in a very high proportion of cases drivers have been right to appeal. Councils should learn from this."" In Derby a ticket issued becausesnow was covering a parking permitwas cancelled, while the Mayor of Leicester said he would cancel a penalty notice sent toa man who pulled into a bus lane to help a homeless man on Christmas Day. Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council overturned one in every four of the penalties it issued. Of the 12,804 fines that were challenged, 11,575 (90%) were cancelled. The council said new parking machines at council-run car parks installed in 2017 had reduced the number of successful appeals. ""This has enabled our car parking enforcement officers to focus more on on-street and inconsiderate parking through both an education and enforcement campaign,"" said Simon Bound, cabinet member for communities and safety. Christchurch Borough Council, which had the second-highest rate of successful appeals over the five-year period, said it saw an increase in successful appeals after the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA) stopped issuing tax discs in 2014, meaning some disabled drivers were erroneously penalised, and when the authority brought in a ""virtual parking permit system"". Jonathan Ross, the authority's car parks manager, said ""initial problems"" with the new system have been ""resolved"" and errors ""very much reduced"". A spokesman for Aberdeenshire Council, which saw 70% of PCN appeals between 2012 and 2017 succeed, said in dealing with first-time offenders ""we generally take the view that the cost of pursuing payment is not the best use of resources"". ""Rates of re-offending are low and the issuing of penalty notices is a useful tool in ensuring effective management of our car parks,"" he added. Waverley Borough Council said about a third of appeals the authority accepted were due to mistakes using its phone payment system and it will often give drivers ""the benefit of the doubt if it's their first mistake"". The BBC sent Freedom of Information requests to every British local authority and the Northern Ireland Department for Infrastructure. We received full data for challenges between 2012 and 2017 from 245 authorities. Data on PCNappeals and cancellations can be viewed here,external.

Paul Newman took pay cut for Sarandon,"This video can not be played Actress and director of documentary, Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story Hollywood actress Susan Sarandon has revealed that the late Paul Newman once gave her part of his salary. It's believed to have happened when they starred together in the 1998 film Twilight, which also featured Gene Hackman. Sarandon told BBC 5 live that she discovered that her two male co-stars were getting paid the same as each other - and more than her. She said Newman stepped in and said: ""Well I'll give you part of mine."" Paul Newman died in 2008 In an interview to mark the release of her new project, Bombshell: The Hedy Lamarr Story, Sarandon told 5 live:  ""Emma Stone once came forward and said she got equal pay, because her male stars insisted upon it and gave up something of theirs. ""That happened to me with Paul Newman at one point, when I did a film with him ages ago."" She continued:  ""They said it was 'favoured nations', but they only meant the two guys. ""He stepped forward and said, 'Well I'll give you part of mine'.  So, yeah, he was a gem."" The term ""favoured nations"" is an agreement between a producer and an actor, which ensures the actors are given the same terms as their co-stars. In Twilight, all three stars were given equal billing on the poster, but Sarandon has now revealed that only Newman and Hackman benefited from the favoured nations arrangement. Susan Sarandon On International Women's Day, Susan Sarandon also told 5 live that there will ""always be a casting couch"" in Hollywood. ""I think what will go away is the unwanted exchange. ""But I think that giving yourself sexually, or being drawn to power and wanting to have sex with someone that's in power, is also a choice. ""What we don't want to have is being exploited and have the Harvey Weinsteins of the world holding it over your head and holding it over your project. ""That is the most despicable.""

Island bones 'likely' Amelia Earhart's,"Researchers used photographs and clothing to determine that the bones match Bones discovered on a Pacific island in 1940 are ""likely"" to be those of famed pilot Amelia Earhart, according to a US peer reviewed science journal. Earhart, her plane, and her navigator vanished without a trace in 1937 over the Pacific Ocean. Many theories have sought to explain her disappearance. But a new study published in Forensic Anthropology claims these bones prove she died as an island castaway. The report claims they are a 99% match,external, contradicting an earlier conclusion. The study, titled Amelia Earhart and the Nikumaroro Bones, was first published by the University of Florida and conducted by Professor Richard Jantz from the University of Tennessee. It disputes that the remains found on the eastern Pacific island of Nikumaroro - about 1,800 miles (2,900km) southwest of Hawaii - belonged to a man, as a researcher had determined in 1941. Earhart was known to have been near the island when she vanished during her doomed attempt to fly across the globe. Earhart was perhaps the most famous woman in the world when she vanished A British party exploring the island for habitation in 1940 found a human skull, a woman's shoe, a Navy tool used by her navigator Fred Noonan (who also vanished), and a bottle of the herbal liqueur Benedictine -""something Earhart was known to carry"",external. ""There was suspicion at the time that the bones could be the remains of Amelia Earhart,""Dr Jantz wrote in the study,external. The party found a total of 13 bones, which were then sent to Fiji to be analysed by Dr D W Hoodless, who concluded that they had belonged to a male. But Dr Jantz argues that because forensic osteology - the study of bones - was still in its early stages, Dr Hoodless probably reached a wrong conclusion. ""Forensic anthropology was not well developed in the early 20th century,"" the paper states. Consulting Dr Hoodless' measurements of the bones, Dr Jantz used Fordisc, a modern computer programme now widely used by forensic anthropologists, to compare them to Earhart's height and body stature. The bones have unfortunately since been lost, and so cannot be analysed. But the research team used historical photographs, as well as her pilot's and driver's licences, to determine that her body proportions matched the skeletal remains. A ""historical seamstress"" was also consulted to analyse her clothing, including ""the inseam length and waist circumference of Earhart's trousers"".

""This strongly supports the conclusion that the Nikumaroro bones belonged to Amelia Earhart."" ""Until definitive evidence is presented that the remains are not those of Amelia Earhart,"" Dr Jantz writes in the paper, ""the most convincing argument is that they are hers.""

'Women of 2037 - this is what I want you to know',"""I hope that someday women will be treated the same as men, that someday women will be paid the same as men. ""I also hope that someday I will be president of the US, even if I have to be the first woman to do it."" These words come from a nine-year-old girl's letter - one of hundreds written in numerous languages to the women of 2037, as part of a global time capsule. To Future Women is collecting letters from people around the world,external, asking them to share their hopes for the generation to come. Georgia Saxelby is the artist behind the collection, hosted at The Phillips Collection in Washington DC. She launched the project on 21 January, a year after the worldwide Women's March, a protest organised largely in response to the inauguration of US President Donald Trump. ""The reason I chose letters is because [writing one] is an activity that instantly generates a process of reflection,"" she says. ""The hand-written nature, the act of sitting down, of slowly considering words, not on a digital screen.

Replying to the nine-year-old girl, who signed her letter with the initials ERK, her grandparents and mother also share their visions for the future. ""Today, women are speaking out about abuse in all its forms,"" writes her grandfather. ""It is my hope, that in the 20 years since this letter was written, those brave female voices will have exposed these injustices and brought about real change. ""It is my hope that you have been, and will be, a part of this important and necessary movement."" Her grandmother writes: ""[I hope] you will succeed based on your merits, not in spite of a rigged system that helps men but represses women. ""[I hope] that you will not doubt that you can do and be anything. ""And I hope you become president. I will vote for you."" Georgia Saxelby says her aim is that women in the future 'will know we were thinking of them' Georgia is gathering letters and putting them on display until July, at which point she will archive the entire collection until 2037, on the 20th anniversary of the Women's March. She's been working with a number of embassies in the US to translate them and to encourage people around the world to participate, as part of International Women's Day. Georgia says ""the sheer numbers"" of people involved in recent protests made her realise the women's movement ""couldn't be ignored"". ""Then with #MeToo, that wasn't a small thing and institutions have responded,"" she says. ""So I decided to use the formal archiving processes of a museum to historicise these gestures, which can seem individual but are actually much larger. ""Despite the leaps and bounds we've taken in the last century with regards to women's rights, still we forget and history forgets."" Georgia points to the centenary of the suffragette movement in the UK and elsewhere as an example of this. ""I'm having to now fill gaps in my knowledge about what the suffragette movement was, who the main players were, how it worked, because I don't know,"" she says. ""I wasn't taught that. ""I want to make sure in 20 years, museums that are going to outlive me are going to revisit these conversations."" Georgia still hasn't written her own letter; it's something she'll do just before she closes the archive. ""Lots of mothers and daughters have come in and written their letters together as an intergenerational activity which has been really beautiful,"" she says. One of the themes that crops up frequently in letters others have written is 'women in leadership.' Like the nine-year-old girl, one 26-year-old female letter writer is also keen to find if there's been a female US president. ""Was it Oprah?"" she asks. This 26-year-old she only realised she was a ""feminist"" in the last year. ""It always seemed like a big word with so many connotations,"" she writes. ""But now, I understand... it's standing up for myself and millions of my sisters."" Time capsules often remain unopened for much longer than 20 years, but Georgia had a reason for picking this duration. ""It's a long enough time that great change can be made,"" she says. ""But it's a short enough time that we can really conceive of revisiting what we're writing now. We want to taste its rewards. ""It's one generation of women. Those women are going to be eating the fruit from the seeds we plant now.""

Why Kim K's emojis have sparked a feminist debate,"Her ""International Woman's Day"" emojis have sparked an online backlash The Kardashians are some of the most divisive figures in popular celebrity culture - spearheaded by Hollywood socialite Kim's rise to fame, the family have become household names. Together they have a reality television show which recently celebrated its 10th anniversary. The programme has spawned multiple spin-offs and an ever-growing family business empire. Love them or loathe them, the Kardashians have made tens of millions by using their celebrity to become powerhouses of the beauty, tech and fashion industries. But Kim Kardashian's decision to launch a ""women's empowerment"" add-on to her personal emoji collection for International Women's Day has received a considerable online backlash. The collection features slogans such as ""nasty woman"", ""my body, my choice"" and ""full time feminist"". Some on social media celebrated the move as positive promotion of ideals of equality. Others accused the personality of hypocrisy because her other products and emojis are provocative and sexualised. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She criticised comments labelling her a ""bad role model"" for the image, and hit out at people bringing up a sex tape that was released without her permission in 2007. ""I am more than something that happened 13 years ago,"" she wrote in 2016. ""I am empowered by my body. I am empowered by my sexuality. I am empowered by feeling comfortable in my skin... I hope that through this platform I have been given, I can encourage the same empowerment for girls and women all over the world."" The family have a combined net worth into the hundreds of millions of dollars The debate around whether nudity has a place in modern-day feminism is not isolated to the Kardashians. When actressEmma Watson, a UN Women Goodwill Ambassador and activist, exposed her breasts in a Vanity Fair photo-shoot last year, it sparked similar comments. She responded angrily, asking what her body had to do with her feminist politics. Eight moments that make it the Year of the Woman Watch: Without women the world stops Watch: The objects that empower me Model Amber Rose, a vocal advocate against ""slut-shaming"" has argued the same,external, writing in Marie Claire that: ""My definition of feminism is simple: EQUALITY. It's not having to base your entire existence around the old school, ultra-oppressive expectations men have for women. ""As an intersectional feminist, I advocate for women from all walks of life and think that all women should be allowed to do whatever they want with their bodies."" This video can not be played Emma Watson responded to claims she is anti-feminist by saying she was ""confused"" by the comments Kathryn Trevenen, associate professor at the University of Ottawa Institute of Feminist and Gender Studies, told the BBC that comments about how celebrities such as Kim Kardashian presented themselves demonstrated how much women's bodies were still ""policed"". ""I worry about the ways in which critiques focus on her femininity, her sex tape and her sexuality,"" she said. ""This is very a common shaming technique. But also, this is very on-brand for her. I'd be more interested [in the emojis] if it was more provocative."" Kim has said that she wants to make sure that her daughter North understands that positive body image comes from having a healthy self-esteem But she pointed to ""much more interesting"" dialogue and work of celebrities such as US rapper Cardi B, who has spoken candidly about her former career in sex work. ""Kim is so famous that she gets the attention - but it's not a big change,"" she told the BBC. ""She's not the best to talk about. There are so many other women - indigenous women, women of colour - in front of important struggles."" Listen: The 'Feminism' word taboo In pictures: International Women's Day McDonalds tribute labelled 'McFeminism' Part of the social media debate about the Kimojis is that Kim previously said she resisted the term ""feminist"" because she did not believe in labels. ""I'll always fight for women's rights. Always,"" she said in a 2016 blog post. ""I support women to the fullest. But, at the end of the day, no one should feel pressured to be labelled as anything just because they believe in certain things and support certain values or ideals."" This video can not be played International Women's Day:  Women discuss the items that empower them People on social media questioned if the emoji launch meant she had changed her mind on the term. Dr Cynthia Carter, who specialises in feminist media studies at Cardiff University, acknowledged that many feminist academics took issue with self-objectification by celebrities such as Kim Kardashian or Beyonce. ""But if someone wants to call themselves a feminist, they should be able to,"" she said. ""Who is to say that there has to be one type of feminist and everyone has to sing from the same hymn sheet?"" she told the BBC, adding that she thought feminism should be a dialogue, and not a hierarchy. Some on social media accused Kim of using feminism and International Women's Day to profit financially with a $2.99 price tag. Prominent women's rights lawyerGloria Allred told news website TooFab the reality star should consider donating the profits to female rights groups,external. One Twitter user replied to her: ""So it's less about empowering women but empowering your bank account."" Another replied: ""You could have and should have offered this one download for free. Feminism is not for sale or your profit."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Carter echoed that concern: ""Where you could critique her is this conflation of capitalism, and all the inherent inequalities that come from that."" She believes the problem is not with individuals like Kim, but with wider society's selection of idols: ""Why not think of role models more widely than just celebrities? Women in business, in academia, or in science? Especially on International Women's Day, we need to broaden our focus here."" Keeping Up with... Kylie's 'secret' baby.

Eight moments that make it the Year of the Woman,"The #MeToo movement against male harassment has empowered women in the US and elsewhere, but it is not the only women's movement to have an impact over the last year. We asked BBC journalists to choose other key triumphs that have made this a momentous year for women around the world. The #MeToo movement to expose harassment has become a worldwide phenomenon, but in a country like China - a one-party state with strict censorship - women have fewer ways to challenge the status quo. That hasn't stopped them from using a combination of two emojis - a bowl of rice and a rabbit - to get round the authorities. In early January, Luo Xixi, a female graduate of a well-known Beijing university wrote an open letter on Chinese social media platform Weibo describing her former professor had tried to pressure her into sex. The university launchedan investigation which found Chen Xiaowu guilty of sexual harassmentand removed him from his post. While this has happened in China before, the issue has for the most part been ignored in public discourse. This time it was different. What followed was a movement spearheaded by Chinese feminists, university students and alumni across China, but soon some universities warned students to tone down their activism. There were reports of open letters being deleted and hashtags censored. ""Rice bunny"" - which in Mandarin Chinese is pronounced ""mi tu"" - became a nickname for the movement. Rice bunnies might sound cute, but they have given Chinese women a tool to discuss their experience of sexual harassment without fear of censorship.

Two female flight attendantssued the major Russian airline Aeroflot for alleged discriminationin September, saying they had been shifted to less lucrative routes because of their body size. While more young female activists talk about the importance of body positive attitude, a lot of people in Russia still believe that in order to be successful a woman should be young, thin and conventionally sexually attractive. Evgenia Magurina and Irina Ierusalimskaya learned this the hard way when, after six and 19 years respectively of working for Aeroflot, their salaries dropped by 30% in summer 2016. When they confronted their bosses they were told they didn't meet the size limit Aeroflot had set for its cabin crew. This was a Russian size 48 - about a UK 14 or US 12. That's why, instead of long-haul flights - to Miami for example -  they had been relegated to shorter night trips around Russia, ""so no-one will see us"" they told the BBC. The two flight attendants lost their first case in court, which angered many on social media, but later won on appeal. The judge ruled that Aeroflot had to pay them their full salaries and also awarded both women compensation for emotional distress. Although the compensation was purely symbolic - 5,000 roubles (Â£65) each - Ms Magurina and Ms Ierusalimskaya were pleased with the outcome as the court also told the airline to eliminate the article in its regulations concerning body size. Reporting by Nina Nazarova, Russia Women's Affairs Journalist This video can not be played Miss Peru contestants highlight violence against women Beauty pageants continue to draw huge audiences in Latin America. That's probably not surprising given that Latin American candidates have won more than 20 of the Miss Universe pageants since they started in 1952. Traditional ideas of female beauty are still held high in Latin American societies where machismo rules and women are meant to, above all, look pretty. That's also why plastic surgery is so popular, not just with the rich, but across society. Pageants are also seen as a chance for young women, who may lack other opportunities, to get highly paid jobs as models, in advertising or in TV - as well as to travel, if not the world, than at least the country. There has been some criticism of their prevalence in the region. In 2012 the then-governor of the Colombian province of Antioquia banned pageants from schools. ""School is for studying, not for runways,"" he said, and promoted science competitions instead. But even so beauty pageants in the region have generally remained politics-free zones, except for the often-expressed desire of contestants for ""world peace"". So it came as a total surprise when participants in Peru's Miss Universe pageant came on stage one by one in October reciting not their bust, waist and hip measurements but statistics of gender violence. ""My measurements are: 2,202 cases of reported murders of women in the last year in my country,"" one contestant said. ""My measurements are: 70% of women have been harassed in the street,"" said another. While the statements had been planned with the organisers of the event, the statistics came as a surprise to viewers, many of whom had tuned in for an evening of light entertainment. Some said that the pageant was not the right forum, but many more supported the move and expressed their solidarity on social media under the hashtag #MisMedidasSon (#MyMeasurementsAre). Reporting by Vanessa Buschschluter, Latin America and Caribbean editor, BBC News website This video can not be played Student Emma Gonzalez to lawmakers: ""Shame on you!"" In the terrible aftermath of the Valentine's Day fatal shooting in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida, a young woman emerged to spit out the collective fury of her fellow students. Tearful but impassioned, 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez crystallised the indignation and grief of her community in an eloquent and rhetorical address. ""I am going to happily ask [US President Trump] how much money he received from the National Rifle Association [NRA],"" she said, adding, ""OK. You want to know something? It doesn't matter because I already know,"" she proclaimed. ""$30 million!"", she went on. ""And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States, in the one and one-half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 [per victim]. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?"" As a Latina, bisexual woman Ms Gonzalez represents many of the communities who have felt victimised ever since President Trump came to power, but her speech was anything but disempowered. ""This is the movement that you're going to read about in a text book one day,"" she told the BBC. ""You're either killing the children or you are saving them."" Reporting by Sarah Buckley, 100 Women Journalist In Afghanistan's largely conservative society, calling and identifying a woman in public by her first name is taboo. Indeed in many parts of Afghanistan it is considered a disgrace for men if their mother, sister, wife or daughter's first name is known to men outside their family. It is not a legal ban, but rather a cultural barrier. On everything from wedding invitations to gravestones, women's names are left off - they are usually referred to simply as 'the daughter of Mr X', or simply, 'Miss'. In public women are simply referred to as 'the wife of', 'the mother of', or 'the daughter of', a man. Last year Afghan women startedan online campaign called #WhereIsMyName, aimed at breaking this taboo and reclaiming women's identities. Laleh Osmani, one of the campaign organisers, was motivated to start the campaign when she came across the death notice of the wife of a famous poet on Facebook. In the notice there was no mention of the name of the deceased, or her female relatives. She realised that even among the intellectual elite, who might be expected to be more open minded, this tradition was being upheld. The women behind the campaign urged clerics and mullahs to help change the culture surrounding women's identities. Reporting by Faranak Amidi, Middle East Women's Affairs Journalist An unusual rebellion took centre stage in India during the hot summer, featuring hundreds of selfies using the middle finger.The Hindi-language film Lipstick Under My Burkha was finally releasedin India, examining the lives and desires of four women from small-town India, after a six-month legal tussle with the film censors. It had initially been refused certification for being too ""lady oriented"" with ""continuous sex scenes"", ""abusive words"" and ""audio pornography"". The Censor Board did not elaborate on these objections but it is not unusual for it to suggest cuts or ban films altogether, and film makers often have to approach higher tribunals to get their films passed. In the recent past, the board has been criticised by the film industry for being irrational and making decisions on an inconsistent basis. It has been asked to edit out scenes involving sex and violence, swear words or even a kiss. The director of Lipstick Under My Burkha, Alankrita Shrivastava, told the BBC, ""The Central Board of Film Certification is outdated and illogical. Its members have no idea about gender issues and gender politics."" Bollywood has traditionally shied away from being very confrontational, but that is changing. For Ms Shrivastava and the makers of her film, just getting the certification (with some cuts) was not enough. They launched a new poster that used lipstick as the middle finger of a woman's hand. The female leads of the film then all posted similar photos, using the hashtag #LipstickRebellion, and the trend caught on. For more than a month, as the film was being shown, both actors and the public - both men and women - posted selfies giving the middle finger to patriarchy. Reporting by Divya Arya, South Asia Women's Affairs Journalist In many communities in Arabic cultures, women who have been raped are seen as a source of shame for their families and so the crime is hidden to avoid a scandal. Women are neither socially nor legally supported to speak up and the rapists who are identified are legally exempt from punishment if they marry their victims. It is not easy to explain how powerful this patriarchal mindset is, but it lives in a context in which sex outside of marriage is not acceptable for women. Indeed in many cultures, being a virgin is a prerequisite for future wives. Last summer, Tunisia, Lebanon and Jordanscrapped the laws which saved rapists from jail if they married their victims.This is something local activists have been pushing for for years. In Lebanon, for example, in one of the campaigns more than 30 white wedding dresses were hung from nooses between the palm trees. Earlier, women dressed in wedding dresses made from bandages to protest against the law. Similarly, Jordanians launched an e-campaign to stress their demands. Egypt was the first Arabic country to scrap the law in 1999, but change is slow, and three countries in one year feels like a watershed moment. Reporting by Alma Hassoun, Arabic Women's Affairs Journalist On 19 July 2017three men were sentenced to death for robbing, stripping, and sexually assaulting a female passengerfor wearing a miniskirt at a public bus stop in Kenya's Githurai district. The case ruling was momentous for women not only in Kenya but all over Africa. This was one of two landmark cases involving the sexual assault and violent robbery of women on public transport in a country where women make up the majority of commuters. For many Kenyan women like Naomi Mwaura, a reproductive health and gender rights activist who helped organise the protest, ""this ruling is the strong message needed to criminalise violence against women and reaffirm the rights of women to live free of violence in public spaces, especially the transport industry"". Three years earlier, in November 2014, hundreds of people came together on the Nairobi streets for a historic march to protest the sexual violence of women in the capital, after a video of the attack surfaced online.  The protest was later coined #MyDressMyChoice and influenced the court's decision and became a global movement. The Kenyan's court pronouncement sent a clear signal to the rest of Africa that women's rights are not to be tampered with. ""I feel honoured to have supported the cause,"" said Ms Mwaura who helped organize the protest, ""and most importantly, to see justice in my lifetime.""

Stories of love amid Eastern Ghouta's bombs,"Friends sitting round a Christmas tree, two long-distance lovers talking on the phone, a man fixing the internet connection for his partner. At first glance, some of Dima Nachawi's illustrations could show couples from almost anywhere in the world - but the rest of the collection tells a very different story; of air strikes, injuries and death. These pictures illustrate how real people live - and love - in Eastern Ghouta,external, an area of Syria where conditions have been described as ""hell on earth"" by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. ""They [the residents] still live their daily lives, they still fall in love and try to protect their beloved ones,"" says Dima. 'On her first Christmas in Ghouta, friends surprised them in the shelter with a smuggled Christmas tree and handmade lights that worked on a generator. They celebrated with her with the few candies that they could find' Dima grew up in Syria, but left the country a number of years ago and now lives in Beirut, where she has a career as an artist. She has worked on a variety of creative projects, looking at the situation in Syria. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? This ""Love is..."" collection, published on social media, shows real people and and the effect the conflict has had on their relationships. Each illustration depicts a different, anonymous couple and Dima only reveals a few details about the people she draws. ""This project was very difficult, especially the one in which the woman died,"" she says, describing the image below. ""I was imagining how the illustration was going to look but at the same time it weighed very heavy on my heart. ""It's very difficult to illustrate something that has an unhappy ending."" 'When the airstrikes hit again they ran toward each other and hugged. He was trying to face where he thought the hit was going to be so he could protect her. He got injured trying to save her. But she passed away from the glass that shattered into her body' ""But I was also grateful that I had this chance to reflect on the other lives of the Syrians, where they survive, they love, they are not victims, they are people that can take action and they have agency. ""This is what I want to reflect through my illustrations."" Residents are reported to be fleeing the rebel-held Eastern Ghouta enclave as the situation there was described as ""beyond critical"". Some aid has been able to reach the rebel-held area but charities say much more is needed. More than 700 people have been killed in recent weeks, many of them children. 'She loves to play Smurfs and Plants vs Zombies, but the siege means he has to go to great effort to ensure the generator is able to charge her phone, and she has an internet signal' Dima is critical of the way the international media portrays the people of Syria. ""On the human level, we are stereotyped as refugees and victims,"" she says. ""I prefer to talk to people [in Syria] to see how they're doing in their daily life and how they are trying to live and survive."" 'She, besieged in Eastern Ghouta, and he, in Idlib [also a rebel area], talk for hours over WhatsApp, drink coffee and share their favourite poems and music. She prays for his safety and he for hers, waiting for the moment they can finally be together' Dima says she finds it ""very difficult"" to watch the conflict from afar. ""Every time I feel bad, I try to do something. I know that I have followers all around the world and I'm conveying a message, telling those people something that they don't know about Syria. ""I try through illustration and art to do something about it and maybe I can't massively change the current situation but I know that my illustrations are preserving something for the cultural memory, for the next generation to see and know what happened.""

Spy attack was 'brazen and reckless',"Specialist officers in protective suits have been examining Salisbury city centre The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a ""brazen and reckless"" act, Amber Rudd has said. Mr Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now ""stable and conscious"", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Wiltshire Police named the officer as Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. Addressing the House of Commons, the home secretary said the attack was ""attempted murder in the most cruel and public way"". Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? State TV anchor warns 'traitors' Ms Rudd told MPs it was an ""outrageous crime"", adding that the government would ""act without hesitation as the facts become clearer"". She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on ""facts, not rumour"". However, she said the government was committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice ""whoever they are and wherever they may be"". Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey is now in a stable condition after being treated in intensive care after the incident Prime Minister Theresa May told ITV News that ""if action needs to be taken then the government will do that"". ""We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is state-sponsored,"" she said. Russia has denied it was involved. This video can not be played Amber Rudd said the attack was an ""outrageous crime"" Meanwhile, a doctor who was one of the first people at the scene has described how she found Ms Skripal slumped unconscious on a bench, vomiting and fitting. She had also lost control of her bodily functions. The woman, who asked not to be named, told the BBC she moved Ms Skripal into the recovery position and opened her airway, as others tended to her father. She said she treated her for almost 30 minutes, saying there was no sign of any chemical agent on Ms Skripal's face or body. The doctor said she had been worried she would be affected by the nerve agent, but added that she ""feels fine"". BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been ""a flurry of activity"" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home on Thursday. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been erected outside the house. Part of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off, while the graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off by police. It comes as police said government scientists have identified the nerve agent used, but will not be making that information public at this stage. A source familiar with the investigation told the BBC the agent was likely to be rarer than theSarin gas thought to have been used in Syriaand in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX -the nerve agent used to kill the half brotherof the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Earlier, Ms Rudd told the BBC the nerve agent used in the poisoning was ""very rare"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an ""ever greater threat"", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. ""Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,"" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is ""very rare"" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko caseshows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny What now for UK-Russia relations? Who is Sergei Skripal? Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Officers said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. This video can not be played Russian spy attack: What we know so far Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. This video can not be played CCTV has emerged of Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Russia has insisted it has ""no information"" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Sergei Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Sergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Mr Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years.

Spain's women in first 'feminist strike',"This video can not be played Spain strike: 'Young women are incredible' Women workers in Spain are marking International Women's Day with an unprecedented strike targeting gender inequality and sexual discrimination. Unions said 5.3 million women had joined the 24-hour strike, backed by 10 unions and some of Spain's top women politicians. Hundreds of thousands of women have joined street protests across Spain, shouting ""if we stop, the world stops"". Events marking the day are being held in dozens of other nations. What is International Women's Day? What is the gender pay gap? Women taking part have stopped working and have been urged by organisers to spend no money and ditch any domestic chores for the day. Police were called to stop protesters blocking main roads in Barcelona but some women pickets still brought areas to a standstill. Public transport nationwide is available but at reduced services and flights have also been affected. Evening marches in Madrid, Barcelona, Bilbao, Valencia and a number of other cities are leading events in 200 Spanish locations. The Spanish event began with the banging of pots in the early hours ""I lived under the dictatorship, I lived under democracy and we haven't made much headway,"" teacher Concha Noverges told Reuters news agency as she stood on a picket line at a public school in Madrid. ""A lot remains to be done and we, in the education sector, have a big role to play."" Ana Reyes, a 37-year-old PR executive, told AFP news agency she was striking ""in the hope that the importance of half of the population will be recognised and that it will bring about a real change"". Eight moments that make it the Year of the Woman Why Kim K's emojis have sparked a feminist debate Watch: The objects that empower me The 8 March Commission is behind the strike. Its manifesto calls for ""a society free of sexist oppression, exploitation and violence"" and says: ""We do not accept worse working conditions, nor being paid less than men for the same work."" A poll of 1,500 people for the El Pais daily suggested 82% supported the strike,external, while 76% thought women in Spain had harder lives than men. Feminist groups only want women to strike to show how important their absence is but Spanish law does not allow for single-gender strikes and men were welcome to support it. The two main unions had called for members to stop work for two hours in the morning. This video can not be played Thousands of women rallied in Madrid on Thursday Some have opposed the strike. The ruling centre-right party, the Partido Popular (PP), said the action was ""for feminist elites and not real women with everyday problems"". Two of the five female ministers in Spain's conservative government, Agriculture Minister Isabel GarcÃ­a Teresina and the president of the Madrid region, Cristina Cifuentes, said they would work longer hours to show the capacity of women. But well-known female presenters were absent from TV screens and radio airwaves. Actress Penelope Cruz cancelled planned public events and said she would go on ""domestic"" strike. Thousands poured onto the streets in Barcelona The mayors of Madrid and Barcelona - Manuela Carmena and Ada Colau - are also backing the strike. But the National Federation of Self-Employed Workers told El Pais that self-employed women remained overwhelmingly at work. In Spain, women were paid 13% and 19% less than men in the public and private sectors respectively,external, data from the European Union's statistical provider Eurostat said.

Snow and ice 'will cause more potholes',"Freezing temperatures will lead to more potholes on UK roads, as snow and ice break up road surfaces, says the RAC. Between Sunday and Tuesday, the RAC received 218 calls for breakdowns relating to potholes, compared with 104 between February and March. It says the extreme cold weather has caused freezing water to get into cracks on already bad road surfaces. The Department for Transport said it was investing Â£23bn on roads in England. Local councils fix a pothole every 19 seconds, according to the Local Government Association. Driving into them can break suspension springs, damage shock absorbers and distort wheels. Parts of Wales and Yorkshire are facingfresh snowfall as schools are closed,flights are disrupted anddrivers advised not to travel. This video can not be played A Devon councillor is on a one-man mission to fill potholes left by atrocious weather The RAC said after-effects from the cold snap could last for years to come as conditions ""wreak havoc"" on the roads. ""Our roads were already in a poor state of repair before the extreme cold weather hit,"" a spokesperson said ""We fear this spring may see the emergence of almost as many potholes as daffodils."" Meanwhile, charity Cycling UK has warned potholes pose a high risk of personal injury or in the worst cases, death. A Department for Transport spokesman said it was investing a ""record"" Â£23bn on roads. ""We know road surfaces are a concern for all road users and that is why we are providing local highway authorities in England, with just under Â£6bn to help improve the condition of our local highway networks. ""We are also giving local authorities a record Â£296m through the pothole action fund - that's enough to fix just under six million potholes."" In Scotland, local authorities were given Â£10.4bn this year and the Scottish government says it is up to them to manage their own budgets. A spokeswoman said the government has said it is open to discussions about the costs linked to the severe weather. Lego admits it made too many bricks Oldest message in a bottle found on beach Two million to get 'big freeze' payments Storm Emma's widespread cold weather alsocaused travel disruption across much of the UK last week.

"KFC returns to former chicken supplierAfter last month's chicken shortages, the chain reverts to its old distributor for some outlets.1h31 minutes agoBusiness","Fast-food chain KFC has returned to its old distributor after suffering chicken shortages that forced the temporary closure of hundreds of outlets. Last month, the chain experienced widespread distribution problems after it decided to switch its logistics contract from Bidvest to DHL. But now Bidvest has signed a new agreement with KFC UK & Ireland to supply up to 350 of its 900 restaurants. Bidvest pledged ""a seamless return"". Until 13 February, all KFC's chicken was delivered by Bidvest. But after the contract switched to DHL, which uses software developed by the firm Quick Service Logistics (QSL), many of the food giant's outlets began running out of chicken products. At the time, DHL blamed ""operational issues"" at a warehouse near Rugby it was using for deliveries nationwide. ""Our focus remains on ensuring our customers can enjoy our chicken without further disruption,"" said a KFC spokesperson. ""With that in mind, the decision has been taken in conjunction with QSL and DHL to revert the distribution contract for up to 350 of our restaurants in the north of the UK back to Bidvest Logistics. ""We've been working hard to resolve the present situation with QSL and DHL. This decision will ease pressure at DHL's Rugby depot, to help get our restaurants back to normal as quickly as possible."" KFC said more than 97% of its restaurants were now open for business, but there would be ""some limited menus"" before full service was resumed. Paul Whyte of Bidvest said the firm was ""delighted"" to resume its partnership with KFC. He added: ""KFC are a valued customer and we will provide them with a seamless return to our network.""

Patients 'left in pain' by surgery delaysSurgeons say those waiting for hip and knee treatment are worst affected by decisions to put off operations.5h5 hours agoHealth,"Thousands of patients in England have been left in ""pain and discomfort"" because of the decision to postpone operations, surgeons say. The Royal College of Surgeons said those waiting for hip and knee surgery had been the worst affected. Operations were put off this winter to free up beds for A&Es - and new figures have shown 40,000 fewer were done this winter than in the previous one. Despite this A&E waits have hit their worst level for over a decade. During the winter, just over 85% of A&E patients have been treated or admitted within four hours, well below the 95% target. This is the worst performance since the target was introduced in 2004.

Royal College of Surgeons president Prof Derek Alderson acknowledged delaying operations was a ""necessary evil"" given the pressure A&Es were under. But he said: ""It also inevitably prevented many patients who are in discomfort or pain from having an operation when they needed it, potentially causing their condition to deteriorate."" As well as hip and knee surgery, the college said patients waiting for brain surgery for benign tumours that can cause sight problems if left and those needing treatment for conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease would also have been affected. ""We urgently need a clear plan to deal with the growing backlog of cancelled operations,"" Prof Alderson said. Hospitals to delay non-urgent operations Hunt sorry as A&Es struggle to cope Did the NHS avert disaster this winter? One of those caught up in the delays is teacher Scott Randolph. He has been waiting for spinal surgery since November - and has already had his surgery cancelled once at the last minute. He said his degenerative condition has left him in ""excruciating pain"" at times. It has affected his ability to work and spend time with his two young children. ""I can't go out to play football with my son and I can't go horse-riding with my daughter. ""It stops everything."" The data published on Thursday by NHS England showed there were 544,000 operations carried out in December and January, down from 585,500 over the same period the year before. It came after NHS bosses ordered hospitals ahead of Christmas to put off routine treatments amid signs A&Es were struggling. NHS England defended the move to delay operations, saying it had helped free up 1,400 beds - the equivalent of two to three hospitals - over the winter months. A spokesman for the organisation also pointed out the number of patients affected was less than was initially feared at one point, but conceded it had been a ""challenging winter"". And British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul warned the pressures were ""far from over"" with hospitals still incredibly busy. ""Patients are continuing to be routinely failed."" Pressures are also being felt elsewhere in the UK. Waiting lists for hospital operations have risen in Scotland and Northern Ireland. And while they remain stable in Wales, the target to see patients within 26 weeks is still being missed.

Inventor says toxic fumes killed Kim WallPeter Madsen denies murdering the Swedish journalist on his self-built submarine last August.,"Kim Wall boarded Peter Madsen's submarine to interview him Danish inventor Peter Madsen has denied murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine, saying she died in an accident. At his trial in Copenhagen, Mr Madsen said the 30-year-old died of carbon monoxide poisoning when the vessel filled with toxic exhaust fumes. But he has admitted dismembering Ms Wall's body and disposing of it at sea. When asked why he did so, he told the court: ""I don't see how that mattered at that time, as she was dead."" Ms Wall's remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Kim Wall: What we know of macabre case 'Exceptional' journalist remembered Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Ms Wall's death. Kim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He initially denied cutting up her body, but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. Peter Madsen appeared calm on Thursday, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and black glasses. Members of the Wall family were also in the session. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court he denied murder but admitted ""violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse"". Explaining his version of events, Mr Madsen said the air pressure on board his submarine suddenly dropped while he was standing on the deck and Ms Wall was in the engine room. He said the vessel began to fill with exhaust fumes but he was unable to open the hatch and enter. ""When I finally manage to open the hatch, a warm cloud hits my face. I find her lifeless on the floor, and I squat next to her and try to wake her up, slapping her cheeks,"" he said. Asked why he had changed his story several times, Mr Madsen said that he had ""wanted to spare her family"" the ""gruesome details."" Maddy Savage, BBC News, Copenhagen This is a high-profile trial being covered by more than 100 journalists from around the world, with some queuing for hours in the snow to secure a good view from the court or the press room, where reporters are asked to remain silent and banned from making phone calls.

What fluent Danish speakers here say is significant is that while he is able to speak at length about his own actions and his passion for all things nautical, his answers about what specifically happened to Kim Wall on the night she died have been shorter and less clear. He has continued to deny killing the Swedish journalist, repeatedly describing her death as ""terrible"". During the session, the prosecution said: It was not clear how Kim Wall died but there was the suspicion that Mr Madsen had ""psychopathic tendencies"" Pipes and straps discovered in the same bag as the journalist's clothes matched similar items found in his workshop Blood on his nose was the journalist's but there was no evidence of his sperm on her body Films found on his computer showed real women being tortured and mutilated Allow Twitter content?

"Over 80 but as healthy as a 20-year-oldHighly active elderly people can boost their immune systems to protect against infection, research suggests.28m28 minutes agoHealth","Professor Norman Lazarus, aged 82, has the immune system of a 20 year old Doing lots of exercise in older age can prevent the immune system from declining and protect people against infections, scientists say. They followed 125 long-distance cyclists, some now in their 80s, and found they had the immune systems of 20-year-olds. Prof Norman Lazarus, 82, ofKing's College London,,externalwho took part in and co-authored the research, said: ""If exercise was a pill, everyone would be taking it. ""It has wide-ranging benefits for the body, the mind, for our muscles and our immune system."" The research was published in the journalAging Cell.,external Prof Janet Lord, director of theInstitute of Inflammation and Ageing,external, at the University of Birmingham, and co-author of the research, said: ""The immune system declines by about 2-3% a year from our 20s, which is why older people are more susceptible to infections, conditions like rheumatoid arthritis and, potentially, cancer. ""Because the cyclists have the immune system of a 20-year-old rather than a 70- or 80-year-old, it means they have added protection against all these issues."" The researchers looked at markers in the blood for T-cells, which help the immune system respond to new infections. These are produced in the thymus, a gland in the chest, which normally shrinks in size in adulthood. They found that the endurance cyclists were producing the same level of T-cells as adults in their 20s, whereas a group of inactive older adults were producing very few. The researchers believe that being physically active in old age will help people respond better to vaccines, and so be better protected against infections such as flu. Steve Harridge, co-author andprofessor of physiology at King's College London,external, said: ""Being sedentary goes against evolution because humans are designed to be physically active. This video can not be played One elderly cyclist said he had the body fat of a 19-year-old ""You don't need to be a competitive athlete to reap the benefits - or be an endurance cyclist - anything which gets you moving and a little bit out of puff will help."" Prof Harridge and Prof Lazarus believe that highly physically active older people represent the perfect group in which to analyse the true effects of biological ageing. A separate paper in Aging Cell found that the cyclists did not lose muscle mass or strength, and did not see an increase in body fat - which are usually associated with ageing. I met a dozen of the cyclists, on a morning ride in Surrey.  Despite the bitter cold, they were universally cheerful, and clearly used to riding in all weathers. They are members ofAudax,external, a long-distance cycling organisation that organises events ranging from 100km to 300km. The older members - in their 80s - say they do only the ""short"" 100km (62-mile) rides, but this is still highly impressive. Pam Jones, 79, told me: ""I do it for my health, because it's sociable, and because I enjoy the freedom it gives you."" Brian Matkins, 82, said: ""One of the first results I got from the medical study was I was told my body fat was comparable to that of a 19-year-old."" Aged just 64, Jim Woods, is a comparative youngster in the group.  He averages 100 miles a week on his bike, with more during the summer. He said: ""I cycle for a sense of wellbeing and to enjoy our wonderful countryside."" Cycling 60 miles or more may not be your idea of fun, but these riders have found something that gives them pleasure, which is a key reason why they continue.

Noel and Liam to headline (separate) Radio 2 gigsNoel and Liam Gallagher will headline Radio 2's Biggest Weekend in May - at separate sites.7h7 hours agoEntertainment & ArtsComments,"Noel (left) and Liam have traded insults ever since Oasis split in 2009 Nine years after Oasis split, Noel and Liam Gallagher will headline Radio 2's stages at the BBC's Biggest Weekend Festival in May. But, perhaps wisely, organisers have booked the brothers to play on different days... at different ends of the UK. Noel will play the Scottish leg of the festival in Perth on Saturday 26 May. A day later, Liam will appear at Coventry's War Memorial Park alongside Paloma Faith, UB40 and Billy Ocean. Speaking to Chris Evans' Radio 2 Breakfast Show, Liam acknowledged the oddity of them headlining the same event. This video can not be played Liam talks to Chris to announce his headline set at Biggest Weekend in May. Chris Evans:So have you ever played a gig in one place, whilst your brother is playing for the same cause on a stage in the nation next door? Liam Gallagher:No, no, no, but we're getting closer and closer to each other, aren't we? Chris Evans:This is what's so intriguing about this, you see. You're like two sperm whales eyeing each other up from miles apart. Liam Gallagher:Yeah that is it, mate. We're getting closer and closer, we're gonna collide, mate, one day and who knows what will happen? The gigs are part of the Biggest Weekend - the largest music event ever attempted by the BBC. The venues in Scotland and England will feature music from Radios 2 and 3, while Radio 1 will take over Swansea's Singleton Park with a bill including Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Craig David and Wolf Alice. Taylor Swift will take a break from her US tour to perform in Swansea And BBC 6 Music will head to the Titanic Quarter in Belfast with artists like Beck, Manic Street Preachers, Courtney Barnett and Breeders. The Radio 1 stages are sold out, but tickets for the other events are still available. Biggest Weekend - official site Taylor Swift to headline Biggest Weekend More acts announced for Biggest Weekend The Gallagher brothers' headline slots come after almost nine years of acrimony. Oasis broke up at a gig in Paris in 2009 after an altercation that began with Liam throwing a plum at his older brother's head. They've barely spoken since but have engaged in a long war of words in the press, on stage and social media. Liam repeatedly called Noel a ""massive potato"" on Twitter and, more seriously, accused him of deliberately avoiding last year's One Love concert in Manchester. Noel responded by saying Liam was a ""village idiot"" who ""needs to see a psychiatrist"". Oasis were one of the biggest-selling acts in UK chart history, shifting more than 70 million records Liam performed at the One Love event, which was held two weeks after the Manchester Arena terror attack in May, while Noel headlined the venue's reopening concert in September. By Christmas, the brothers seemed to have buried the hatchet. Liam tweeted that Noel had ""reached out"" and that they were ""all good again"". They're clearly not at the point where they could appear together on stage yet... but the Biggest Weekend gig would appear to be the first time both brothers have shared such a billing at a festival. As for an Oasis reunion? Even if Liam is keen, don't hold your breath. ""I've been very consistent about it,"" Noel told Q Magazine in 2017. ""I don't need the money, I don't need the glory, I don't need to relive the memories. ""If I was to get Oasis back together tomorrow and then do a tour, I'd have $100m in the bank but I'd have learnt [expletive] all."" ""It would be the death of me as a person.""

"John Lewis staff bonus cut againThe retailer says that 2017 was ""a challenging year"" with ""subdued"" consumer demand.1han hour agoBusinessComments","Bonuses for 84,000 staff at John Lewis and Waitrose have been cut for the fifth year in a row. Employees will get a 5% bonus, down from 6% last year and the lowest since the 4% paid out in 1954. Annual group profit, before the partnership bonus, tax and exceptional items, fell 21.9% to Â£289.2m. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said 2017 had been a ""challenging year"", as expected, with ""subdued"" consumer demand. He said weakness in sterling had led to higher costs, putting pressure on the business's profit margin. The partnership said it had been hit by exceptional costs of Â£111.3m, including Â£72.8m on restructuring and redundancy costs, principally in relation to brand, distribution and retail operations. ""This was why we chose to reduce the proportion of profits paid as partnership bonus last year so as to absorb these impacts while continuing to invest in the future and in strengthening our balance sheet,"" Sir Charlie said. He said the firm remained committed to increasing pay rates for non-management staff, and that the average hourly rate of pay for a non-management workers was Â£8.91. Like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings - at the John Lewis department stores were up 0.4%. At Waitrose, sales returned to growth, with like-for-like sales rising 0.9%. Gross sales for the full-year period were up 2% at Â£11.6bn. ""We expect trading to be volatile in 2018-19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity. We therefore anticipate further pressure on profits,"" the company said. Redundancy payments cost it Â£72.8m in 2017. The partnership said 1,440 members of staff had left the business through redundancy in the past year. John Lewis is owned by its staff and they cherish their annual bonus. It's down for the fifth year in a row but given the challenging conditions on the High Street right now, some partners may be feeling grateful for any extra payout. John Lewis continues to be one of the stronger players. Today's figures show even this household name isn't immune from the forces buffeting the industry. It warned back in January 2017 that it would reduce the bonus in order to prepare for tougher trading conditions ahead. That looks to have been a prudent move. But the relentless pressure on profits shows no sign of easing this year, either. The company said that its John Lewis stores had increased market share in fashion, homewares, electrical goods and home technology, with sales in the latter category up by 2.6%. Fashion sales climbed 3.2%, boosted by a strong performance in womenswear, up 5.0%. Sales of its own-brand womenswear rose 14.9%. But homeware sales were down 0.8%, with soft demand in categories such as fitted furniture, fitted flooring and upholstery. ""These results show that conditions of the High Street are very tricky at the moment,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics. ""Consumer spending generally is a lot softer, while inflation is still near a five-year high."" He said research by his firm showed that consumers were also worried about Brexit and their own low levels of personal savings. ""People's personal finances are under pressure."" Mr Lim said that in the year ahead John Lewis would be looking very closely at its costs and at ways of potentially bringing these down. ""That could mean looking at using their existing spaces more efficiently and innovatively."" The John Lewis group owns Waitrose supermarkets as well as department stores John Lewis has been a partnership since it started 150 years ago Waitrose joined in 1937 Consists of an elected council, a board and a chairman First bonus paid in 1919 First cash bonus in 1970 No bonus paid in First World War, Second World War and early 1950s Company says its business structure allows it to have a longer term outlook as it doesn't have to answer to City shareholders Christmas shopping: the winners and losers Mr Underbed sells out after John Lewis ad John Lewis profits fall by more than half Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Patients 'left in pain' by surgery delays,"Thousands of patients in England have been left in ""pain and discomfort"" because of the decision to postpone operations, surgeons say. The Royal College of Surgeons said those waiting for hip and knee surgery had been the worst affected. Operations were put off this winter to free up beds for A&Es - and new figures have shown 40,000 fewer were done this winter than in the previous one. Despite this A&E waits have hit their worst level for over a decade. During the winter, just over 85% of A&E patients have been treated or admitted within four hours, well below the 95% target. This is the worst performance since the target was introduced in 2004.

Royal College of Surgeons president Prof Derek Alderson acknowledged delaying operations was a ""necessary evil"" given the pressure A&Es were under. But he said: ""It also inevitably prevented many patients who are in discomfort or pain from having an operation when they needed it, potentially causing their condition to deteriorate."" As well as hip and knee surgery, the college said patients waiting for brain surgery for benign tumours that can cause sight problems if left and those needing treatment for conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease and Crohn's disease would also have been affected. ""We urgently need a clear plan to deal with the growing backlog of cancelled operations,"" Prof Alderson said. Hospitals to delay non-urgent operations Hunt sorry as A&Es struggle to cope Did the NHS avert disaster this winter? One of those caught up in the delays is teacher Scott Randolph. He has been waiting for spinal surgery since November - and has already had his surgery cancelled once at the last minute. He said his degenerative condition has left him in ""excruciating pain"" at times. It has affected his ability to work and spend time with his two young children. ""I can't go out to play football with my son and I can't go horse-riding with my daughter. ""It stops everything."" The data published on Thursday by NHS England showed there were 544,000 operations carried out in December and January, down from 585,500 over the same period the year before. It came after NHS bosses ordered hospitals ahead of Christmas to put off routine treatments amid signs A&Es were struggling. NHS England defended the move to delay operations, saying it had helped free up 1,400 beds - the equivalent of two to three hospitals - over the winter months. A spokesman for the organisation also pointed out the number of patients affected was less than was initially feared at one point, but conceded it had been a ""challenging winter"". And British Medical Association leader Dr Chaand Nagpaul warned the pressures were ""far from over"" with hospitals still incredibly busy. ""Patients are continuing to be routinely failed."" Pressures are also being felt elsewhere in the UK. Waiting lists for hospital operations have risen in Scotland and Northern Ireland. And while they remain stable in Wales, the target to see patients within 26 weeks is still being missed.

John Lewis staff bonus cut again,"Bonuses for 84,000 staff at John Lewis and Waitrose have been cut for the fifth year in a row. Employees will get a 5% bonus, down from 6% last year and the lowest since the 4% paid out in 1954. Annual group profit, before the partnership bonus, tax and exceptional items, fell 21.9% to Â£289.2m. John Lewis Partnership chairman Sir Charlie Mayfield said 2017 had been a ""challenging year"", as expected, with ""subdued"" consumer demand. He said weakness in sterling had led to higher costs, putting pressure on the business's profit margin. The partnership said it had been hit by exceptional costs of Â£111.3m, including Â£72.8m on restructuring and redundancy costs, principally in relation to brand, distribution and retail operations. ""This was why we chose to reduce the proportion of profits paid as partnership bonus last year so as to absorb these impacts while continuing to invest in the future and in strengthening our balance sheet,"" Sir Charlie said. He said the firm remained committed to increasing pay rates for non-management staff, and that the average hourly rate of pay for a non-management workers was Â£8.91. Like-for-like sales - which strip out the impact of store openings - at the John Lewis department stores were up 0.4%. At Waitrose, sales returned to growth, with like-for-like sales rising 0.9%. Gross sales for the full-year period were up 2% at Â£11.6bn. ""We expect trading to be volatile in 2018-19, with continuing economic uncertainty and no let up in competitive intensity. We therefore anticipate further pressure on profits,"" the company said. Redundancy payments cost it Â£72.8m in 2017. The partnership said 1,440 members of staff had left the business through redundancy in the past year. John Lewis is owned by its staff and they cherish their annual bonus. It's down for the fifth year in a row but given the challenging conditions on the High Street right now, some partners may be feeling grateful for any extra payout. John Lewis continues to be one of the stronger players. Today's figures show even this household name isn't immune from the forces buffeting the industry. It warned back in January 2017 that it would reduce the bonus in order to prepare for tougher trading conditions ahead. That looks to have been a prudent move. But the relentless pressure on profits shows no sign of easing this year, either. The company said that its John Lewis stores had increased market share in fashion, homewares, electrical goods and home technology, with sales in the latter category up by 2.6%. Fashion sales climbed 3.2%, boosted by a strong performance in womenswear, up 5.0%. Sales of its own-brand womenswear rose 14.9%. But homeware sales were down 0.8%, with soft demand in categories such as fitted furniture, fitted flooring and upholstery. ""These results show that conditions of the High Street are very tricky at the moment,"" said Richard Lim, chief executive of analysts Retail Economics. ""Consumer spending generally is a lot softer, while inflation is still near a five-year high."" He said research by his firm showed that consumers were also worried about Brexit and their own low levels of personal savings. ""People's personal finances are under pressure."" Mr Lim said that in the year ahead John Lewis would be looking very closely at its costs and at ways of potentially bringing these down. ""That could mean looking at using their existing spaces more efficiently and innovatively."" The John Lewis group owns Waitrose supermarkets as well as department stores John Lewis has been a partnership since it started 150 years ago Waitrose joined in 1937 Consists of an elected council, a board and a chairman First bonus paid in 1919 First cash bonus in 1970 No bonus paid in First World War, Second World War and early 1950s Company says its business structure allows it to have a longer term outlook as it doesn't have to answer to City shareholders Christmas shopping: the winners and losers Mr Underbed sells out after John Lewis ad John Lewis profits fall by more than half Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Jupiter's winds run deep into the planet,"The central cyclone at the planet's north pole is encircled by eight other storms We are finally getting a look inside the biggest planet in the Solar System - Jupiter. And it is very strange. The American space agency's Juno probe has been studying the variations in the pull of gravity as it flies across the giant world's banded atmosphere. These measurements betray the movement of mass within Jupiter, and that gives scientists clues to its structure. The latest data reveals the activity of those familiar, colourful, wind-sculpted bands extends 3,000km down. That's on a planet which is 140,000km wide. ""This solves a long-time mystery,"" said Juno scientist Tristan Guillot from the CÃ´te d'Azur Observatory, France. ""For over 40 years we didn't know whether the bands would go all the way to the centre, or whether they were just skin deep. Three thousand km is actually quite deep. It's 1% of the mass of the planet. Jupiter's very big so it's about three Earth masses that are involved in this motion. ""This is all really important for understanding atmospheric dynamics, not just on Jupiter but on other gaseous planets like Saturn, Uranus and Neptune and also the exoplanets we're now discovering,"" he told BBC News. Jupiter Great Red Spot has deep roots Juno peers below Jupiter's clouds Nasa probe arrives in Jupiter orbit Saturn probe Cassini is incinerated Dr Guillot is an author ona slew of papers in the journal Nature,externaldescribing the latest observations from Juno. In particular,he led the study,externalthat examined what may lurk even deeper than the roots of the bands. This is a domain where the predominant gases of hydrogen and helium start to transition under immense pressure into exotic fluid states. And in contrast to the east-west motions that are seen at the surface, the entire interior mass of material appears to rotate in a uniform way - as if a solid body. It is within this body that Jupiter's immense magnetic field is produced. ""It's generated a bit deeper down when hydrogen becomes so highly compressed that it becomes a metal. And then charges can move easily and you can have, with convection, what's called a dynamo effect,"" said Dr Guillot. The jury's still out on whether Jupiter has a rocky core. This determination is one of the key questions Juno was sent to answer. Early investigations suggest it may do, but not in the sense that is easily understandable. It could be quite diffuse; ""diluted"" or ""partially mixed with the interior"", the French scientist says. Artwork: Juno arrived at Jupiter in July 2016 Clarity should come the longer the mission runs. The US space agency will soon need to approve a funded extension to Juno's stay. Scientists would like a minimum coverage of 34 orbits (one orbit around Jupiter takes 53 days), which would take the mission, which arrived in July 2016, through to 2021. It would permit the researchers to fully map the planet's magnetic field and to pursue other questions such as the precise depth of Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Microwave observations indicate the huge, long-lived storm in the southern hemisphere reaches down at least 350km into the atmosphere. Additional gravity measurements may find it descends further still. Juno so far has been a tour de force, bringing a very difference perspective on Jupiter to those spacecraft that have visited the gas giant in the past. The way that the probe flies around the planet, from pole to pole, means, for example, that it can see storms at high latitudes that simply are not visible from Earth-based telescopes. One of the papers published in Nature this week notes the interesting patterns in play. At the north pole, eight cyclones rotate around a single storm, whereas at the south pole, five cyclones encircle the central storm. After decades of debate we now know these banded flows extend 3,000km deep The origins of these cyclones and how they persist without merging, or letting another storm muscle in, remain unknown, however. Alberto Adriani, thelead author on the paper,externalfrom the Institute for Space Astrophysics and Planetology, Italy, said: ""Each one of the northern cyclones is almost as wide as the distance between Naples, Italy, and New York City - and the southern ones are even larger than that. They have very violent winds, reaching, in some cases, speeds as great as 220mph (350km/h). ""Finally, and perhaps most remarkably, they are very close together and enduring. There is nothing else like it that we know of in the Solar System."" Commenting on all the latest work, Leigh Fletcher, from Leicester University, UK, said Juno was really now starting to deliver on its promise. He believes that what we have learned at Jupiter, and at Saturn with Nasa's Cassini probe, will heighten the desire to send missions to the other giants in the Solar System. ""We've been lobbying for years to go to Uranus and Neptune, and we're hoping that in the next few years the Americans will put it right at the top of their agenda, after the next mission to Jupiter's moon Europa. ""That would mean by the late 2020s or early 2030s, we'd have a real mission to head out to those planets."" Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth and 300 times more massive It takes 12 Earth years to orbit the Sun; a ""day"" is 10 hours long In composition, it resembles a star; it's mostly hydrogen and helium Under pressure, the hydrogen assumes a state similar to a metal This ""metallic hydrogen"" is likely the source of the magnetic field Most of the visible cloud tops contain ammonia and hydrogen sulphide Jupiter's low-latitude ""bands"" play host to very strong east-west winds The Great Red Spot is a giant storm vortex wider than planet Earth Jonathan.Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk,externaland follow me on Twitter:@BBCAmos,external Jupiter Great Red Spot has deep roots Juno peers below Jupiter's clouds Nasa probe arrives in Jupiter orbit Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history Moment friends abandon house as Palisades fire closes in 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Man denies stealing McDormand's Oscar,"Terry Bryant carried an Oscar at the Governor's Ball A man has pleaded not guilty to stealing actress Frances McDormand's Oscar after Sunday's ceremony. McDormand was named best actress - but her statuette briefly went missing at the lavish after-show Governor's Ball. Terry Bryant filmed himself holding a statuette and telling other guests he was a winner, before being arrested. His lawyer Daniel Brookman said: ""There's a difference between holding an Oscar and what he is charged with, so that will play out in court."" The 47-year-old had been in police custody on a grand theft charge, but was released without having to pay bail following Wednesday's hearing after the judge ruled he did not pose a flight risk. Judge Deborah Brazil heard testimony from his rabbi Naomi Levy, who described him as a ""sweet, gentle man of faith"". Ms Levy added: ""I think we are living in an unusual time in America. I believe that maybe perhaps his story is a commentary on our whole society and its obsession with its 15 minutes of fame.""

Catholic Church 'an empire of misogyny',"'The Catholic Church is one of the last great bastions of misogyny,' says Mrs McAleese A former president of Ireland has criticised the Catholic Church as ""an empire of misogyny"". Mary McAleese was speaking in Rome ahead of the Voices of Faith conference, which features prominent Catholic women from around the world. They are celebrating International Women's Day by demanding a greater say for women in Church governance. Pope Francis has declined to attend their meeting or to celebrate Mass for those attending. Vatican Radio has censored its reports on their demand for gender equality. ""The Catholic Church is one of the last great bastions of misogyny,"" said Mrs McAleese. ""It's an empire of misogyny. ""There are so few leadership roles currently available to women. Mrs McAleese said women do not have strong role models in the Church they can look up to. A Church hierarchy that is ""homophobic and anti-abortion is not the Church of the future"", she added. ""We don't want to be what the Pope describes as 'the strawberry on the cake', she said. ""Our voices stir the winds of change, so we must speak out,"" she added. In previous years this Catholic women's movement has celebrated International Women's Day by meeting inside the Vatican, but this year their list of 2018 speakers did not meet with official approval. Pope Francis has declined to attend the meeting Senior Vatican officials took objection to the inclusion of a Ugandan woman who champions Lesbian and Gay Catholic rights in her country, where homosexuality is a crime. They also excluded Tina Beattie, an English Catholic professor of theology. Irish-born US cardinal Kevin Farrell, a senior Vatican official, said it was ""not appropriate"" for the women to be taking part in the conference. The meeting is now taking place in the headquarters of the Jesuit religious order just across the road from Vatican City. Pope Francis has said he supports greater inclusion of women in top Vatican jobs, but is not in favour of allowing women to be ordained as priests.

Noel and Liam to headline Radio 2 gig,"Noel (left) and Liam have traded insults ever since Oasis split in 2009 Nine years after Oasis split, Noel and Liam Gallagher will headline Radio 2's stages at the BBC's Biggest Weekend Festival in May. But, perhaps wisely, organisers have booked the brothers to play on different days... at different ends of the UK. Noel will play the Scottish leg of the festival in Perth on Saturday 26 May. A day later, Liam will appear at Coventry's War Memorial Park alongside Paloma Faith, UB40 and Billy Ocean. Speaking to Chris Evans' Radio 2 Breakfast Show, Liam acknowledged the oddity of them headlining the same event. This video can not be played Liam talks to Chris to announce his headline set at Biggest Weekend in May. Chris Evans:So have you ever played a gig in one place, whilst your brother is playing for the same cause on a stage in the nation next door? Liam Gallagher:No, no, no, but we're getting closer and closer to each other, aren't we? Chris Evans:This is what's so intriguing about this, you see. You're like two sperm whales eyeing each other up from miles apart. Liam Gallagher:Yeah that is it, mate. We're getting closer and closer, we're gonna collide, mate, one day and who knows what will happen? The gigs are part of the Biggest Weekend - the largest music event ever attempted by the BBC. The venues in Scotland and England will feature music from Radios 2 and 3, while Radio 1 will take over Swansea's Singleton Park with a bill including Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift, Craig David and Wolf Alice. Taylor Swift will take a break from her US tour to perform in Swansea And BBC 6 Music will head to the Titanic Quarter in Belfast with artists like Beck, Manic Street Preachers, Courtney Barnett and Breeders. The Radio 1 stages are sold out, but tickets for the other events are still available. Biggest Weekend - official site Taylor Swift to headline Biggest Weekend More acts announced for Biggest Weekend The Gallagher brothers' headline slots come after almost nine years of acrimony. Oasis broke up at a gig in Paris in 2009 after an altercation that began with Liam throwing a plum at his older brother's head. They've barely spoken since but have engaged in a long war of words in the press, on stage and social media. Liam repeatedly called Noel a ""massive potato"" on Twitter and, more seriously, accused him of deliberately avoiding last year's One Love concert in Manchester. Noel responded by saying Liam was a ""village idiot"" who ""needs to see a psychiatrist"". Oasis were one of the biggest-selling acts in UK chart history, shifting more than 70 million records Liam performed at the One Love event, which was held two weeks after the Manchester Arena terror attack in May, while Noel headlined the venue's reopening concert in September. By Christmas, the brothers seemed to have buried the hatchet. Liam tweeted that Noel had ""reached out"" and that they were ""all good again"". They're clearly not at the point where they could appear together on stage yet... but the Biggest Weekend gig would appear to be the first time both brothers have shared such a billing at a festival.

Tesco cancels credit cards on fraud scare,"Tesco Bank has cancelled some of its customers' credit cards, after concerns that a number of accounts may have been compromised. Customers may have to wait up to a week before replacement cards are issued. The bank said that only a tiny number of its three million credit card users would be affected, and apologised for the inconvenience. In the meantime, those customers have been told via text that they will not be able to use their cards. ""We take the security of our customers' accounts very seriously and take every measure possible to protect customers from fraudulent activity,"" a spokesperson said. ""As a result of routine industry-wide fraud protection measures, we have reissued a number of credit cards as a precautionary measure."" In 2016, Tesco Bank suffered a large-scale attack on some of its customers' current accounts. 20,000 people had to be refunded.

"Women footballers: Born with talent, held back by prejudice","Laura Pigatin is one of the many girls dreaming of becoming a professional footballer Football is one of the most popular female sports, with about 30 million girls and women playing it worldwide. But in several countries, girls are not allowed to play. In others, they are discriminated against. Even in football-crazy Brazil, women come up against a lot of challenges as Irene Caselli, Claudia Jardim and Mariangela Maturi found when they spoke to well-established and aspiring female footballers in Africa, Europe and Latin America. ""It was just me, a girl in the middle of a lot of boys,"" says Marta Vieira da Silva, the Brazilian football legend who is better known just as Marta. Not only does she hold the record for the most goals scored at the Women's World Cup, she is also the only woman to have been named the world's best female footballer five times. Nevertheless, Marta says she did not have an easy time of it starting out in football. ""My family didn't approve. They didn't accept it because people still thought that girls weren't allowed to play football,"" she recalls. Marta was born in 1986, seven years after a government-imposed ban on women practising sports ""incompatible with their nature"" was lifted. The ban had been in place from 1941 until 1979 and clearly influenced the way even players regarded women. In the year that the ban was lifted, PelÃ© told a local paper that football ""can be a hobby, but not a real sport for women"". It comes as little surprise that prejudice and stereotypes remained even after the ban was lifted. Born in Dois Riachos, a small town in the poor state of Alagoas in north-eastern Brazil, Marta had to struggle to be recognised. Profile: Marta Fighting sexism in sport Brought up by her mother after her parents separated when she was only one, she learned to play football with the boys in the streets of her hometown. If her older brother approached, she would hide, afraid he might punish her for playing a ""men's game"". Marta says playing football makes her happy She eventually joined a club but says that as late as 1999 she was banned from playing in a tournament because she was a girl. ""I was very frustrated at that moment. I looked around, I stopped to think, and I just couldn't understand it,"" she recalls. ""Why is it so hard to accept that a human being was born with a talent, knows how to play, wants to do it and that is what makes her happy?"" Cultural stereotypes are not limited to Brazil either. This video can not be played Gambian footballer tackling marriage And despite women like Marta making it big, young female players in Brazil still struggle. Laura Pigatin, 14, is serious and disciplined and fully dedicated to achieving her dream of becoming a professional footballer. Laura Pigatin was banned from playing with her team because she is a girl She trains several times a week, both in futsal and football. Since there are no female teams of her age group in her hometown of SÃ£o Carlos, she plays in the all-boys team. Two years ago her team qualified for the championship in SÃ£o Paulo state but state officials banned Laura from playing because they said that the tournament was only for boys. The team Laura plays for is made up of boys...and her Eventually the authorities caved in and Laura was allowed to play after a campaign led by her parents gathered momentum. But it proved to be a fleeting victory as Laura was again banned from playing in the second phase of the tournament in 2017. ""I was very sad because I helped the team to be champion in the first phase and I was not going to be able to play the second phase, which was more important,"" Laura says. ""Marta's story is more or less similar to mine. Since then, things should have changed, and it should be allowed for girls to be able to play. It's absurd."" But change has been slow. Since the 1980s, few resources have been dedicated to women's football in Brazil. Several national tournaments were discontinued, and female players earn so little they often have to work another job. Brazil's national women's football league was launched as recently as 2013 and even top teams are severely underfunded. Rio Preto Esporte Club won the national women's league in 2015 and the SÃ£o Paulo championship in 2016 and 2017. Rio Preto Esporte Club's training facilities are basic The ground they train on is full of holes where ants have built their nests. They have no dedicated coach with a senior player taking on coaching duties instead. The players all live in a house provided by the club's owners with five of them to a room as their 1,500-reais monthly scholarships (Â£330, US$460) do not stretch to more. Despite Brazilians' love of football, the best female players move abroad to make their career at foreign clubs. Marta, for example, moved to Sweden at age 18 and now holds dual nationality. Despite her many achievements, in Brazil she is often referred to as ""PelÃ© in a skirt"". Marta plays for Orlando Pride and Brazil's national women's team ""There is always a comparison between her and PelÃ©, even though Marta scored more goals for the national team,"" says Angelica Souza of Dibradoras, a Brazilian website dedicated to women's sport. ""She's a woman so she'll always be compared to a man, she'll always be 'PelÃ© in a skirt', rather than PelÃ© being known as 'Marta in trousers'."" Fifa's chief women's football officer Sarai Bareman says what is needed are more role models. ""In South America, there is a negative perception for young girls trying to get into the game,"" she says. Role models have worked in some countries, such as Denmark where Nadia Nadim is inspiring girls from different ethnic backgrounds to play football. This video can not be played Nadia Nadim is the first immigrant to play for the Danish national team Marta says there is no magic wand to bring about change. ""We have to do it by fighting, doing our job in the best possible way by showing people that women's football is possible,"" she says. ""Women's and men's football are the same thing: the field is the same, the ball is the same, there is the same desire to do your best, setting an example to continue inspiring the children, so that the new generations can accept it in a natural way.""

What now for UK and Russia?,"A video still shows Sergei Skripal being detained by Russian security services in 2004 Britain's relations with Russia are already cool. The attempted murder of a former Russian spy in Salisbury could plunge that relationship even deeper into the diplomatic permafrost. Before the basic facts of the case have been established, both sides have indulged in an early exchange of fire. The Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson, told the House of Commons there were echoes of the death of Alexander Litvinenko, another former Russian spy whose murder on British soil has been blamed on the Kremlin. ""It is clear that Russia is, I am afraid, in many respects now a malign and disruptive force,"" Mr Johnson told MPs. The country was, he said, launching cyber-attacks against British infrastructure which ""I increasingly think that we have to categorise.. as acts of war"". In response, Maria Zakharova, Russia's foreign ministry spokeswoman, accused British politicians and journalists of using the incident to foster anti-Russian sentiment. ""This story was straight away used to boost an anti-Russian campaign in the media,"" she said. ""It is difficult to see anything other than provocations aimed at harming the relations between our two countries."" And of Mr Johnson, she said: ""How can a man charged with foreign affairs, who has no relation to security organs, make such statements?"" Russian spy 'attacked with nerve agent' Russian spy: What we know so far Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny But does this matter? The relationship between London and Moscow could already be characterised as one of steady confrontation. It is certainly more strained than Russia's relations with other mainstream European countries such as Germany or France. Britain strongly opposed Russia's annexation of Crimea and intervention in Ukraine and it backed tough UN and EU sanctions on Russia's economy as a result. Britain also strongly opposed Russia's military support for President Assad's government in Syria that has led to the deaths of thousands of civilians. Britain has voiced its concern about Russia's alleged interference in the elections of western democracies, and what it sees as a threat to the international world order. And Britain is increasingly worried by the cyber-attacks on UK infrastructure emanating from Russian soil. But if it emerges that the Russian state had any involvement in the poisoning of Sergei Skripal and his daughter, then the British government would find it hard to resist taking action that would strain relations further. In such circumstances, Boris Johnson has promised ""appropriate and robust action"". Alexander Litvinenko lies in a hospital bed in London, shortly before his death in 2006 So what could that be? Well, the UK could expel some Russian diplomats, as it did after the former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London in 2006. But that has rarely changed Russia's behaviour. It could impose unilateral sanctions on Russian individuals and businesses. But it is unlikely to get support from European partners for tougher EU-wide sanctions. Brexit makes those kinds of negotiations harder and some EU countries are already trying to soften their approach to Moscow. The UK could make it more difficult for Russians generally to get visas to the UK. This certainly hurts. But it could be self-wounding as such restrictions might also hit Russian dissidents whom the UK welcomes and wealthy businessmen whose laundered cash the UK tolerates to support London's property market. Few analysts believe targeting rich Russians with tougher asset-stripping orders would make much difference. They would just take their money elsewhere. The government could change the law, as some MPs want, to make it easier to target sanctions at Russians who violate human rights. But this would probably affect only a handful of people. And, as Boris Johnson has hinted, the UK could decide that members of the royal family and other dignitaries should not attend the football World Cup in Russia this summer. The risk with any of these options is the scale of any Russian retaliation. British pension funds might get nervous if they have large investments in firms that are over-exposed in Russia. London estate agents might worry about the impact on the housing market if Russian money departed the capital. And Britain would be reluctant to strain diplomatic relations too much. Despite all the hostility, the UK needs to talk to Russia about rebuilding Syria if and when the conflict ends. It needs to talk to Russia about deterring North Korea from producing nuclear weapons. And it needs to talk to Russia about protecting the Iran nuclear deal. The UK could, of course, outsource these issues to other countries: they are all discussed on a multilateral basis. But to do so would run counter to the government's commitment to what it calls ""a global Britain"" foreign policy So for all the huffing and puffing from the Commons and the Kremlin, it is perhaps more likely that any substantial response from the UK would be measured and long term and dependent on a clear outcome to the investigation into what exactly happened in Salisbury. And that might take some time.

Russian TV host warns 'traitors',"Channel One 's presenter warns ""traitors"" from choosing the UK as a place of abode For days, Russia's main national TV channels were practically silent on the attempt to kill former spy Sergei Skripal with a nerve agent, but this changed in Wednesday's main evening bulletins. The comment by Kirill Kleimenov - the presenter on government-controlled Channel One's flagship Vremya news programme - sounded like a veiled, mocking threat to anyone considering becoming a double agent for Britain. ""I don't wish death on anyone, but for purely educational purposes, I have a warning for anyone who dreams of such a career,"" he said. ""The profession of a traitor is one of the most dangerous in the world,"" Kleimenov said, adding that few who had chosen it had lived to a ripe old age. Russian spy: What we know so far Spy nerve gas attack 'brazen and reckless' Alcoholism, drug addiction, stress and depression resulting in heart attacks and even suicide were the ""professional illnesses of a traitor"", according to Kleimenov. He also had a second piece of advice for such ""traitors or those who simply hate their country in their free time"": ""Don't choose Britain as a place to live."" Russian media have made suggestive hints about the involvement of the UK's Porton Down military research facility ""Something is wrong there. Maybe it's the climate, but in recent years there have been too many strange incidents with grave outcomes there."" The remarks stood out from the rest of the evening's coverage, which followed the line often taken by Russian state media in similar circumstances - denial and wry bemusement that anyone should be pointing the finger at Russia. On NTV - ultimately controlled by state gas company Gazprom - a presenter said the Western media were accusing Russia of poisoning Mr Skripal despite the lack of any evidence or any ""expert conclusions"". Its London correspondent, Liza Gerson, mentioned the role of the UK's Porton Down research facility in the investigation, pointing out that it tested chemicals used against German soldiers in World War One. Pro-Kremlin media accuse British counterparts of seeking a ""Russian trace"" in the poisoning She also took a swipe at Boris Johnson's warning to Russia this week, saying the foreign secretary was known for his ""unpredictable antics"" and was ""an infant in a man's suit"". Over on state channel Rossiya 1, the presenter said the British authorities ""didn't even try"" to seek Russia's co-operation in the investigation, ""but have already discovered a Russian trace in the case"". Before the leading TV channels picked up the story, it had been widely covered by newspapers, news websites and niche liberal outlets such as Dozhd TV and Ekho Moskvy radio, as well as the relatively little-watched state news channel Rossiya 24. ""The British media continue to fan anti-Russian hysteria,"" one Rossiya 24 report said, adding that attempts to find a ""Kremlin trace"" were based ""not on facts, but purely on rumours and fabrication"". The channel's UK correspondent reported the ""interesting detail"" that Britain's ""secret"" Porton Down facility manufactures the VX and sarin nerve agents, as well as other ""UK weapons of mass destruction"". News websites widely reported remarks by Andrei Lugovoi - a suspect in the killing of former Russian security officer Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 - dismissing talk of a ""Russian trace"". ""The English suffer from phobias,"" Mr Lugovoi - now a member of the Russian parliament - told the RIA Novosti news agency. Dozhd TV's take was entirely different from the state media. Here, a presenter said that the discovery that Mr Skripal was poisoned by a nerve agent means ""Russia is in for a high-profile criminal investigation"".

Black Panther actor to adopt 'inclusion rider',"Black Panther actor Michael B Jordan will adopt a diversity clause for projects made by his production company. He said he was committing to using the ""inclusion rider"" for all work made by Outlier Society.

Michael B Jordan plays villain Erik Killmonger in the superhero movie Black Panther. The film has been praised for being the first Hollywood superhero movie to have a predominately black cast. Theterm ""inclusion rider""was a big feature at the Oscars after being used by Frances McDormand at the end of her best actress acceptance speech. Frances McDormand used the term in her speech at the Oscars It was invented by media researcher Stacy Smith during a talk in which she came up with ways to show more women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities on screen. According to the University of Southern California, where Dr Smith is a professor, theconcept of an inclusion rider,externalis: ""A-list actors can incorporate a clause in their contracts that stipulates that inclusion, both on camera and behind the scenes for crew members, be reflected in films.

CCTV shows Parsons Green Tube fireballJurors are shown the moment a bomb explodes on an underground train at the trial of Ahmed Hassan.5m5 minutes agoUK,"Ahmed Hassan denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life A witness to the Parsons Green bombing told the Old Bailey how his head was ""engulfed in flames"" during the attack. Stephen Nash was on the District Line underground train on 15 September 2017 when the device went off. CCTV allegedly shows Ahmed Hassan - who prosecutors said built the bomb and set the timer - leaving the train one stop earlier at Putney Bridge station, having left a bag behind. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life, The CCTV footage then showed the moment an orange fireball filled the carriage. Prosecutor Alison Morgan has said experts concluded it was simply ""luck"" that the bomb did not fully detonate. Mr Hassan was arrested at the Port of Dover the day after the attack. This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball Mr Nash told the court he was was reading a newspaper, ""oblivious"" to what was going on, when the explosion happened. He said: ""At Parsons Green there was a loud bang. There was a blinding flash to my left and I was engulfed in flames."" He described an ""intense heat"", before adding: ""I thought I had lost my ears. I thought my head was on fire."" Mr Nash said he was knocked out, and when he woke up a few seconds later, he was the last person on the train. ""I called out to the Tube,"" he said. ""Just as I got to the doors, the doors started to close. ""It was a little bit scary and I called out on to the platform."" Mr Nash was among a number of witnesses giving evidence at the trial. The court heard that many of the 93 people caught in the bombing suffered burns or were crushed in the stampede to get out. Retired counter-terrorism officer Alex Beavan had boarded the train at Wimbledon and was standing near the doors when the bomb went off. ""I heard a huge popping sound,"" he said. ""Looking towards the direction of the sound, I saw a rolling fireball coming over the ceiling at the back of the train. ""I saw the rolling fireball, wall to wall, slowly coming up the ceiling."" He added: ""Everything goes in slow motion. There was chaos and I was thinking there is going to be a second attack, so I ran across the platform."" Aimee Colville, who got on the train at Parsons Green moments before the explosion, said she saw a ""wall of glass"" and flames coming towards her. She said: ""That morning I had curled my hair and I had put hairspray in my hair, so when the flames came over me my hair immediately caught fire."" Lucinda Glazebrook, who also boarded the train at Parsons Green, told the court she felt the heat from the fireball on her face. ""I kept touching my face and feeling the back of my hair and my hair was coming out in chunks,"" she said. An army officer travelling on the train turned towards the explosion because of his ""instinct"" and training. Craig Palmer told the court that he wanted to know what had happened so began walking towards where the device had partly detonated. He said: ""I had a seen the wall of faces in terror who rushed past me. ""I could see something in the corner of the train, it was burning. He added: ""There was smoke billowing out of it and the carriage was filling up with grey smoke. ""I could smell, at that point, something I categorise as being explosives."" Mr Palmer said he expected to see a ""suicide bomber"" but he discovered the bomb, which he believed to be an ""improvised explosive device"". He then took photos of it to share with special officers who arrived at the scene. A number of other videos allegedly showing Mr Hassan's movements on the day of the attack have been shown to the jury by prosecutors. The first video is said by prosecutors to show him leaving his foster home in Sunbury, Surrey, carrying a plastic bag, which they told the court contained the device that exploded on the underground train. A second then allegedly shows Mr Hassan catching a train to Wimbledon. And CCTV from the platform allegedly shows him going into the station toilets - where prosecutors said he set the timer on the device - and emerging 13 minutes later carrying the bag and heading towards the District Line platforms. Further footage was also shown, which prosecutors said showed Mr Hassan from a day before the attack going to two supermarkets - an Asda and an Aldi in Feltham - buying matches, batteries, a screw driver and screw driver bit sets, allegedly used to construct the device. Jurors were also shown a replica of the home-made bomb without the explosive, which was held in a Lidl frozen goods bag and contained 2.2kg of shrapnel. The court was told that Mr Hassan's fingerprints were found on the Tube carriage, on a white plastic bucket inside the bag, and on a pair of trousers covering the bucket. His DNA was also found at the scene. Giving evidence, explosives officer Andrew Gee said a test carried out to identify the explosive used was an ""87% hit"" for the chemical compound TATP. On Wednesday, the prosecution said that Mr Hassan had told Home Office officials, 20 months before the Parsons Green attack. that he had been ""trained to kill"" Ms Morgan said he was interviewed in Croydon in January 2016 where he is alleged to have told them he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. The court also heard he had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury, but his asylum claim was still outstanding as he planned the attack. The trial continues.

"Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids'Parents whose adult children move back home suffer a decline in quality of life, research suggests.10h10 hours agoFamily & Education","""Don't look so worried Dad, it won't be for long"" Adults who move back home after moving away are causing their parents stress and conflict, a study suggests. Parents whose adult children move back into the family home saw a decline in their quality of life and wellbeing, researchers at the London School of Economics and Political Science found. The research analysed data from people aged between 50 and 75 from 17 European countries, not including the UK. They found parents' quality of life fell when an adult child ""boomeranged."" The study -Returns home by children and changes in parents' well-being in Europe,external- found that this slump in wellbeing happened only when there were no other children still at home - there was no impact on parents if other children were already living in the family home. Researchers measured quality of life and wellbeing across four areas: control autonomy pleasure self-realisation Higher scores indicated a better quality of life. But the study found that when a child returned home to an ""empty-nest"",  there was a significant drop in scores. It said such a drop had a substantial effect on quality of life and was similar to developing an age-related disability, such as difficulties with walking or getting dressed. From boomers to stay-at-home boomerang generation Graduates boosting 'boomerang generation' The research paper, published in the journal Social Science & Medicine, says: ""Over the past half century, intergenerational co-residence has declined dramatically in Western countries. ""However, this pattern has recently altered, and in some countries multigenerational co-residence has increased; a shift interpreted as a family response to high unemployment rates, poor job prospects and financial hardship among young adults."" The paper explores the effects of different reasons for returning home, such as unemployment and partnership breakdown, saying these are, in themselves, distressing to parents. But after controlling for this, the researchers found the return of a child still caused a significant decline in parents' wellbeing. The researchers analysed the wellbeing scores of 99,000 parents taken from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2007-2015) and found 1,070 had ""boomerang"" children. They only assessed adults up to the age of 75, to reduce the chance that returning home was driven by parents' need for support. The paper says: ""The findings show that returning home was correlated with a decline in parent's quality of life when there were no other children in the parental home. ""Parents enjoy their independence when their children leave the home, and refilling an empty nest may be regarded as a violation of this life-course stage."" Study author Dr Marco Tosi said:  ""Our work shows that in contexts where family orientations and welfare institutions foster individuals' independence, returns home by adult children have negative implications for parents' well-being. ""Across Europe, this effect is greater in Protestant than in Catholic countries, but we see it in all countries. ""When children leave the parental home, marital relationships improve and parents find a new equilibrium. ""They enjoy this stage in life, finding new hobbies and activities. When adult children move back, it is a violation of that equilibrium."" Although the study did not cover the UK, it was highly likely that the trends would be very similar, Dr Tosi added, particularly as the UK was a predominantly Protestant country. The 17 countries covered by the research were: France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Estonia and Poland.

'No joint Korean march' at Paralympics,"The North's Paralympic team has arrived in Pyeongchang The two Koreas will not march together at the opening ceremony of the Winter Paralympics in Pyeongchang on Friday, officials in the South have said. The North had wanted disputed islands to be put on a unified flag but the South disagreed. The two nations marched together under an agreed unified flag at the opening of the Winter Olympics on 9 February. That had been seen as part of a gradual rapprochement in bilateral ties and the nations later agreed a leaders' summit. The summit is expected to discuss how to reduce tension on the peninsula. Are North and South Korea friends again? North Korea crisis in 300 words Is North Korea just playing the US? ""After discussion with the North, the two Koreas decided not to march together at the opening ceremony,"" the South's Yonhap news agency quoted the South Korean Paralympic Committee (KPC) as saying on Thursday. The unified flag shows the Korean peninsula in blue on a white background. The KPC said the North wanted the South's Dokdo (called Takeshima by Japan) islands, which Japan claims, on the flag, saying the omission hurt Koreans. The South said inclusion would run counter to the International Paralympic Committee's  recommendation not to politicise sports events. Profile: Dokdo/Takeshima islands The KPC said the two Koreas had decided to respect each other's stance and march separately. The nations marched under the unified lag at the opening of the Winter Olympics The apparent rapprochement over the Winter Olympics had seen the selection of a joint women's ice hockey team, the deployment of a squad of North Korean cheerleaders and most significantly a high-level Northern delegation that included Kim Yo-jong - the sister of North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The charm offensive was hailed by some as a breakthrough in relations but conservatives in the South issued warnings and the US was unmoved in its tough diplomatic stance. In the wake of the Games, the two Koreas held a landmark diplomatic meeting in the North's capital, Pyongyang, earlier this week. A South Korean delegation is now en route to the US and is expected to pass on a message from the North's leader, Kim Jong-un. South Koreans had an apparently cordial meeting with Kim Jong-un (centre) in Pyongyang this week The US, which only this week increased its sanctions on Pyongyang over the death in Malaysia of Mr Kim's brother,Kim Jong-nam, has said it is open to talking to North Korea but only if it commits to denuclearisation. China has welcomed the forthcoming talks but warned it was too early to assume they would bring a lasting breakthrough on the central nuclear issue. What missiles does North Korea have? What did North Korea's nuclear tests achieve? Is North Korea just playing the US? The past year has seen a rising war of words between the US and North Korea, with the North test-firing increasingly powerful missiles. The last time major international talks were held to persuade North Korea to disarm were the Six-Party Talks involving North and South Korea, the US, China Japan, and Russia. North Korea agreed to shut down its nuclear and weapons programme in exchange for aid and reduced sanctions. But the talks broke down in 2008 after failing to agree on how to verify the North's commitments, and in 2009 North Korea conducted its second nuclear weapons test.

"Sick baby Isaiah Haastrup diesThe baby's parents, who fought a court battle over his treatment, say their son ""fought bravely"".3h3 hours agoLondon","This video can not be played Isaiah Haastrup's parents say his son 'fought bravely' Isaiah Haastrup, a baby at the centre of a legal row over his treatment, has died, his parents have confirmed. An appeal by the parents of the 12-month-old to continue his life-support treatmentwas dismissed by European judgeson Tuesday. Isaiah suffered ""catastrophic"" brain damage due to being deprived of oxygen at birth. His parents fought a lengthy legal battle with King's College Hospital to allow further care for their son. Isaiah's father said he was ""so proud"" of his ""brave"" son as he died at 19:50 GMT on Wednesday - hours after his life-support was withdrawn. Talking to the BBC, Isaiah's mother Takesha Thomas said her son had ""a little cheekiness about him, which I will miss."" ""But right now all I can feel is just pure anger. All I know is justice wasn't served - at all."" Lanre Haastrup and Takesha Thomas did not want their son's life-support treatment to be stopped Ms Thomas and Lanre Haastrup had asked the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to intervene afterlosing two court battles in the UK, but the case was again dismissed by judges. An ECHR spokesman said the application had been declared ""inadmissible"". Doctors said Isaiah was in a low level of consciousness, could not move or breathe independently and was connected to a ventilator. King's College Hospital in London said providing further intensive care treatment was not in his best interests. A spokesman for the hospital said: ""The trust always provided Isaiah with the very best care, and the decision to apply to the courts to withdraw treatment was only made after careful consideration and after consultation with the family. ""We recognise that this has been an extremely difficult time for Isaiah's family as well as those involved in his care since birth.""

Tagging plan to curb domestic violence,"Suspected domestic abusers could be electronically tagged under government proposals for England and Wales. Thedraft Domestic Abuse Bill will also propose tougher sentences where children are involved,externaland more support for victims who testify in court. There is a new definition of economic abuse - if people are denied access to jobs or money, or forced to take loans. Prime Minister Theresa May said the bill could ""completely transform the way we tackle domestic abuse"". Proposed Domestic Abuse Protection Orders (DAPOs) would allow police and courts to intervene earlier where abuse is suspected. The orders would allow courts to electronically monitor suspects' whereabouts before they have been found guilty of - or even committed - a crime. The appalling cost of domestic abuse Tougher sentences for domestic abuse DAPOs would bring together elements from existing protective orders, while giving courts the power to set a wider range of restrictions and for longer periods than the current 28 days. Other measures being considered include: The creation of an independent domestic abuse commissioner Giving domestic abuse victims the same status in court as those who have suffered modern slavery or sex offences Putting into law the scheme where police can disclose information about previous violent offending by a new or existing partner It is estimated that almost two million adults in England and Wales have been victims of domestic abuse in the past year while 95 women and men were killed by current or former partners in 2016-17. This video can not be played Domestic abuse 'not just physical attacks' Home Secretary Amber Rudd said: ""It is appalling that in 21st-Century Britain, nearly two million people every year - the majority of them women - suffer abuse at the hands of those closest to them."" Speaking to Radio 4's Today programme Ms Rudd said the new definition of economic abuse would help prosecute perpetrators of domestic violence, who raid their victims' bank accounts or force them to take out loans. She added that judges prescribing ""early intervention initiatives"" such as alcohol treatment programmes for abusers could stop ""behaviour early on"". On International Women's Day she said: ""If we want to be really ambitious about equality, ambitious about protecting women, this is exactly the sort of change we need to take head on."" Euleen Hope suffered abuse at the hands of her former partner for more than decade, until he was jailed in 2015 Euleen Hope suffered physical and emotional abuse from her partner for more than a decade. She said she required hospital treatment more than a dozen times and would grow her fringe to cover the black eyes. ""He already said to me he'll say when it's over, and then he told me he'd organise to have someone throw acid in my face [if I left]."" Her former partner was eventually jailed in 2015 for GBH and assault after her sister got in contact with the police. Women's Aid chief executive Katie Ghose welcomed ""the spotlight and recognition"" of economic abuse. She said domestic abuse was about ""power and control"" She added: ""It can take all forms, it can be everything from taking charge of someone's wages, restricting their movements, right through to committing benefit fraud in their name."" Ms Ghose said financial control can sometimes be a precursor to physical and sexual violence. But she cautioned the ""ambition will be undermined if there is not a long-term, sustainable funding plan for refuges in place"". Suzanne Jacob, chief executive of domestic abuse charity SafeLives, said: ""We welcome the focus on the urgent need to hold perpetrators to account and to prioritise the needs and safety of women and girls. ""The time for piecemeal sticking plasters is over, we need radical change."" The consultation period for the draft bill will run until 31 May.

Trump wins order to gag porn actress,"Stormy Daniels says she began a relationship with Mr Trump in 2006 US President Donald Trump obtained a restraining order against an adult film actress to prevent her from speaking publicly about their alleged affair, legal documents show. Mr Trump's personal lawyer obtained the order against Stormy Daniels in private arbitration proceedings last month. It bars her from sharing ""confidential information"" about their alleged relationship, US media report. Mr Trump says allegations against him are all false. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on Wednesday that the president had won arbitration proceedings against the actress, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford. ""This case has already been won in arbitration and anything beyond that, I would refer you to the president's outside counsel,"" she said. A porn star scandal Trump can't shake But the attorney representing Ms Clifford told CBS News that he was ""dumbfounded"" by the White House's comment. ""For the White House spokesperson to stand up and claim that Trump won the case in arbitration is ludicrous,"" Michael Avenatti said. ""How do you win something when the other side is not even invited?"" he said. Mr Trump's lawyer, Michael Cohen, emailed the restraining order to Ms Clifford's legal team on 28 February, according to NBC News.,external ""The document itself is to remain confidential and not to be disclosed to anyone as per the terms of the judge's order,"" the email said. Details of the restraining order have emerged a day after Ms Clifford filed a lawsuit against Mr Trump, alleging that a non-disclosure contract she signed was invalid. She said the agreement, drawn up before the 2016 election, was ""void"" because he had not signed it. The civil lawsuit, filed in Los Angeles on Tuesday, says that only days before the election, Ms Clifford and Mr Cohen signed a ""hush agreement"" but Mr Trump did not, ""thus rendering it legally null and void and of no consequence"". It also refers to last month's ""bogus arbitration proceeding"" where the restraining order was obtained by Mr Cohen. The order, issued on 27 February, bars Ms Clifford from sharing any information related to the non-disclosure agreement. Mr Cohen confirmed last month that he had privately paid Ms Clifford $130,000 (Â£95,000) but did not say what it was for. He said neither the Trump Organization nor the Trump campaign was a party to this transaction.

Inventor on trial over submarine murder,"Kim Wall boarded Peter Madsen's submarine to interview him Danish inventor Peter Madsen has denied murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine, saying she died in an accident. At his trial in Copenhagen, Mr Madsen said the 30-year-old died of carbon monoxide poisoning when the vessel filled with toxic exhaust fumes. But he has admitted dismembering Ms Wall's body and disposing of it at sea. When asked why he did so, he told the court: ""I don't see how that mattered at that time, as she was dead."" Ms Wall's remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Kim Wall: What we know of macabre case 'Exceptional' journalist remembered Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Ms Wall's death. Kim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He initially denied cutting up her body, but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. Peter Madsen appeared calm on Thursday, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and black glasses. Members of the Wall family were also in the session. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court he denied murder but admitted ""violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse"". Explaining his version of events, Mr Madsen said the air pressure on board his submarine suddenly dropped while he was standing on the deck and Ms Wall was in the engine room. He said the vessel began to fill with exhaust fumes but he was unable to open the hatch and enter. ""When I finally manage to open the hatch, a warm cloud hits my face. I find her lifeless on the floor, and I squat next to her and try to wake her up, slapping her cheeks,"" he said. Asked why he had changed his story several times, Mr Madsen said that he had ""wanted to spare her family"" the ""gruesome details."" Maddy Savage, BBC News, Copenhagen This is a high-profile trial being covered by more than 100 journalists from around the world, with some queuing for hours in the snow to secure a good view from the court or the press room, where reporters are asked to remain silent and banned from making phone calls. During breaks, Danish journalists here have told me Peter Madsen's black T-shirt and jeans combination isn't unusual attire in courtrooms in Denmark, where casual business dress is common. What fluent Danish speakers here say is significant is that while he is able to speak at length about his own actions and his passion for all things nautical, his answers about what specifically happened to Kim Wall on the night she died have been shorter and less clear. He has continued to deny killing the Swedish journalist, repeatedly describing her death as ""terrible"". During the session, the prosecution said: It was not clear how Kim Wall died but there was the suspicion that Mr Madsen had ""psychopathic tendencies"" Pipes and straps discovered in the same bag as the journalist's clothes matched similar items found in his workshop Blood on his nose was the journalist's but there was no evidence of his sperm on her body Films found on his computer showed real women being tortured and mutilated Allow Twitter content?

The trial is expected to last 12 days over seven weeks, with a verdict expected on 25 April. The journalist was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden.

Florida gun law moves step closer,"Protesters have lobbied Florida's politicians over gun control since the shooting New gun control measures for Florida have passed another legal hurdle, weeks after one of the worst school shootings in US history. The state's House of Representatives passed a bill raising the age to buy a gun from 18 to 21 and imposing a three-day waiting period on all gun sales. The bill, already passed by the Senate, now goes to the state governor. Seventeen people were killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, on 14 February. One mother, two school shootings Trump clashes with Republicans on guns Guns banned on dating app Bumble Expelled former student Nikolas Cruz, 19, has been charged in the attack. He was formally indicted by a grand jury on Wednesday on 34 counts, including 17 counts of premeditated first-degree murder and 17 counts of attempted first-degree murder. He is suspected of using a legally bought AR-15 semi-automatic rifle to carry out the 10-minute attack, gunning down teachers and students. In addition to raising the age and bringing in the three-day waiting period, the legislation: Introduces a voluntary armed ""guardian programme"" for schools, named after Aaron Feis, a coach who died in the Parkland shooting. It allows school personnel to be armed, subject to school district approval and specialist training Classroom teachers are excluded from carrying arms unless they have a security forces background Bans devices, such as bump stocks, that modify a semi-automatic weapon to fully automatic Raises mental health funding and increases the power to seize or ban guns under mental health concerns The legislation does not include a ban on the sale of assault-style weapons like the AR-15, despite it being a key demand of Parkland students and their parents. Florida law already mandates a three-day waiting period for the purchase of a handgun but a person as young as 18 can buy a rifle with no waiting period. This video can not be played America's gun laws explained The Republican-controlled House debated the bill for about eight hours on Wednesday before voting 67-50 in favour. Ryan Petty, whose daughter was among those killed, hailed the House's vote in a tweet. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He said: ""We know that when it comes to preventing future acts of school violence, today's vote is just the beginning of our journey."" State Democratic Party legislators who backed the bill said it was necessary despite the ""poison pill"" of allowing more guns in schools under the guardian programme. Florida now joins at least six other states in allowing school employees to carry firearms. Following the Parkland shooting,many surviving students had lobbied politicians for greater gun control. Gun control activists will hope the Florida measures will be a turning point in their battle with the powerful National Rifle Association and others who defend firearms ownership under the Second Amendment of the US constitution. On the day the vote passed, a 17-year-old woman student was killed in a suspected accidental shooting at a high school in Alabama. Governor Rick Scott will need to sign the bill, known as the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Act, into law. It will automatically become law within 15 days unless he vetoes it. Mr Scott has not yet said he will back it, telling reporters he would ""review the bill line by line"" and consult victims' families. He has previously said he opposes US President Donald Trump's call to arm teachers. He had also previously opposed increasing the purchase age from 18 to 21.

What are nerve agents?,"Officials in protective suits examine the area where Mr Skripal and his daughter were found Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were poisoned with a military-grade nerve agent of a type developed by Russia, known as Novichok, Theresa May has told MPs. The former Russian spy and his daughter are critically ill after their attempted murder in Salisbury, Wiltshire, on 4 March. A police officer also remains in hospital after attending the scene. The chemical was identified by experts at the defence and science laboratory at Porton Down, Mrs May said. So what are nerve agents and what do they do? They are highly toxic chemicals that prevent the nervous system from working properly, and can be fatal. Nerve agents take different forms - including powder and gas - but they tend to be a liquid, which can seep through the skin. The name Novichok means 'newcomer' in Russian and applies to a group of advanced nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. One of the chemicals - called A-230 - is reportedly five to eight times more toxic than VX nerve agent, which can kill a person within minutes. A number of variants of this chemical have been manufactured, and one of them was reportedly approved for use by the Russian military as a chemical weapon. Some of the agents are also reported to be 'binary weapons', meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemicals. When they are mixed together, they react to produce the more toxic agent. Novichok agents are one of three classes of nerve agents - the other two are G-Agents and V-Agents. G-agents include sarin while V-agents include VX, an oily amber-coloured liquid. This video can not be played Dr Richard Guthrie explains how the nerve agent might have been used The half-brother of North Korean President Kim Jong-un was killed by a nerve agent in an attack in Malaysia last year. Kim Jong-nam died in less than 20 minutes after two women smeared his face with VX nerve agent ingredients at Kuala Lumpur airport in 2017. Kim Jong-nam, on the left, was killed by a nerve agent - his half brother, the North Korean leader, is on the right The UN says the nerve agent sarin has been used by the Syrian government - in an attack on Ghouta, near Damascus, in 2013 and again in Khan Sheikhoun in the north-west of the country in April 2017, killing hundreds. In an attack on Tokyo's subway system in 1995, which killed 13 people, liquid sarin was placed in plastic bags that were pierced by umbrellas with sharpened tips. When Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko was poisoned in London in 2006, a radioactive substance - not a nerve agent - called polonium 210 was used in a cup of tea. VX nerve agent: The chemical that may have killed Kim Jong-nam What is sarin? Nerve agents disrupt normal messaging from the nerves to the muscles. This causes muscles to become paralysed and can lead to the loss of many bodily functions. Agents will act within seconds or minutes if inhaled and slightly more slowly if exposure is the result of skin contamination. Symptoms include white eyes, as the pupils become constricted, convulsions, drooling and in the worse cases - coma, respiratory failure and death. If you have ever sprayed insect repellent at a fly, you might have seen it drop to the ground and lie on its back, legs twitching. This is the result of nerve agents taking hold. The nerve agent needs to be ingested, inhaled or to penetrate through the skin, so it usually requires the person delivering it to get very close to the people they are targeting. Only tiny amounts are required for it to take effect. It is so toxic that it would usually be transported in something tightly sealed and those who apply it will need protective clothing. Dr Andrea Sella, professor of inorganic chemistry at University College London, said because of the extreme toxicity of the nerve agents it would be ""very dangerous"" to the person who delivered the poisoning. A Zizzi restaurant close to the poisoning incident has been closed as a precaution Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, said the risk of harm in the Salisbury case was ""low"". However, up to 500 people who went to the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury city centre on Sunday afternoon and Monday have been told to wash their clothes and wipe possessions. Dame Sally said there was some concern that prolonged exposure over weeks and months could cause health problems but it was ""not a subject for panic"" and the advice was a ""belt and braces"" measure. ""The risk to the general public remains low and I am confident none of these customers or staff will have suffered harm,"" she said. Alastair Hay, professor emeritus of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, said if no one has had physical symptoms suggestive of nerve agent contact a week on, it was unlikely that they were at risk. But washing provided the extra guarantee of safety, he added. There are antidotes to help reverse the effect of nerve agents, which the emergency services hold. But the sooner the treatment is delivered the better the chance of recovery. Knowing the exact substance enables more targeted treatment. Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology, said the people affected may well have been treated with atropine, which is one of the chemicals used to treat individuals with this type of poisoning. ""The problem occurs if the treatment is not provided quickly,"" Prof Hay said. ""There is paralysis of the nerves and the muscles, and that inhibits breathing and leads to some damage in the brain. At this stage we don't know if that is a problem. ""Many people appear to recover without too many long-term problems but we won't know until we know the severity of their symptoms."" Public Health England has not revealed what the substance used in Salisbury was Nerve agents are not materials that can be made at home. Their level of toxicity is such that they are only allowed to be manufactured in specialised facilities, such as a university or industrial laboratory. Discovered by accident in the 1930s by scientists trying to find a cost-effective pesticide, they proved to be highly toxic chemicals that eventually ended up in the hands of the German military. Russia, the US and the UK also started to experiment on chemical agents after World War Two and it was British scientists who developed the VX nerve agent at the Porton Down research facility in the early 1950s. The authorities would have been looking for the container used to deliver the material, as the chemical contents would be a ""goldmine"", Dr Sella said. ""With this information it might well be possible to trace the origin of the substance, just as has been done for the Khan Sheikhoun attack in Syria."" Chemical weapons expert Hamish de Bretton-Gordon said each country made chemical weapons ""slightly differently"" which might help scientists determine where this attack had come from. ""There is a footprint, there are markers,"" he said. Spy attack was 'brazen and reckless' Ex-Russian spy collapsed with daughter Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Who is Sergei Skripal?

Charity admits 'unsafe behaviour' towards staff,"Save the Children failed to deal adequately with inappropriate behaviour complaints and there was evidence of ""unsafe behaviour"" towards staff at the charity, two reviews have said. Reviews in 2015 found ""significant omissions and failures"" in their response to harassment complaints. The charity said progress had since been made in its workplace culture. Save the Children published its recommendations on Wednesday after the BBCrevealed the failures. Staff complaints prompted the reviews in 2015. ""We have chosen to make both sets of recommendations public to ensure there is a full picture of the situation at the time and the actions taken since,"" Save the Children said. The BBC reported on Wednesday that the documents said the charity failed adequately to deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth. One of the 2015 reports, leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, referred to concerns that the then chairman Sir Alan Parker's ""very close"" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. Aid organisations 'truly sorry' for sector's failings Murdered MP's widower quits charities Aid groups report 80 harm cases A leaked email from the time cautioned that Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken ""responsibility"" for his mistakes ""many years ago"", but did ""not accept as accurate much of what has been reported today, either in tone or fact"". He said he ""strongly refutes a number of the claims"" and added that he had not seen the leaked 2015 report. The review in relation to historical complaints found a management culture existed that ""did not sufficiently adhere to established and published policies and procedures"". There were ""significant omissions and failures"" in the HR response to historical informal complaints around behaviour and the charity ""failed in its obligation to adequately deal with issues raised in respect of inappropriate behaviour through its disciplinary procedures"". But its policies and procedures were fit for purpose and the omissions and failures ""did not necessarily alter the outcome"", it said. The review on its culture found there were ""significant employee engagement issues"". ""There was evidence of uncomfortable and/or unsafe behaviour towards colleagues,"" the report said. But the charity, overall, had ""a positive workplace culture"". On Tuesday, protesters from the Women's Equality Party interrupted the charity's board meeting tocall for Sir Alan's resignation,externalas Chairman of Save the Children International. In the leaked report, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. ""They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,"" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. Justin Forsyth with Samantha Cameron in Lebanon in 2013 In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were ""not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness"" and that ""he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff"" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had ""made a deliberate choiceâ¦not to fully investigate these allegations"" and as a result had a ""conflict of interest"" in relation to the review. In the review's recommendations, now published by the charity, it was advised to implement department plans to ""strengthen culture"". It said there should be annual interactive group training for staff, training for the HR department and an anonymous whistle-blowing hotline introduced. Since 2015, Save the Children said every staff member received training in ""respect in the workplace"" and a hotline has been set up. Senior leadership workshops have taken place specifically addressing standards of good, acceptable behaviour and culture in the workplace, the charity said. New recruits also now receive coaching and advice on the values of the organisation. Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt ""cannot be repeated"". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading the independent review for the charity, said she ""acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration"". Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth facedthree complaints of inappropriate behaviourtowards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsythresigned from his roleas deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities.

Pregnant modern slaves in 'shocking' danger,"The charity operates safe houses for women rescued from traffickers A quarter of women rescued from modern slavery in the UK are pregnant and facing ""shocking"" levels of danger and deprivation, says a charity. Hestia, which runs safe houses, says pregnant women can escape or be abandoned by traffickers and left to sleep rough without any healthcare. ""Many contemplate suicide. All are isolated and long for contact with their mothers,"" says the study. The charity says ""urgent action"" is needed to help such vulnerable women. Hestia, one of the UK's biggest providers of support for victims of slavery, says there is insufficient help for the security, health and psychological needs of trafficked and often traumatised women who are pregnant or have recently given birth. The women are ""isolated and long for their mothers,"" says the report The charity, which last year worked with almost 900 adults, is to publish a report highlighting the ""harrowing"" risks facing enslaved pregnant women who have been living in ""constant fear"". The report says that a ""disproportionately high number of women who have been victims of modern slavery present into our service pregnant, often very late in their pregnancy"". These women, who could be held as sex workers or in domestic servitude, have often had no access to healthcare. The report says some of the pregnancies were the result of rape, and women's health can be seriously damaged by being ""forced to consume alcohol or take drugs whilst they were being exploited"". Safe houses provide places for women who might also have children Becoming pregnant could have been the trigger to end their servitude - either because they wanted to protect their child or because they have lost their value to their captors. A spokeswoman for the charity said that families keeping women in domestic servitude might not want to support a mother and baby. In one case, a woman was driven to a park and abandoned there, until she was helped by local people who found her. Women have often been trafficked through different countries and can be completely disorientated about their location, says the charity. ""When Issy became pregnant, she tried to conceal it from her captors. ""When they found out, she was forcibly taken to an abortion clinic. Issy was desperate to let one of the health professionals know she did not want to go through with the abortion, but she did not speak their language and was terrified of the consequences if she was seen attracting attention. ""However, the clinic refused to perform the abortion without a medical certificate as Issy was in the second trimester of her pregnancy (13th to 27th week of pregnancy). ""Issy was returned to the flat where she was being kept and was ordered to continue having sex with her clients until they no longer wanted her. ""She overheard her captors say that they would wait until Issy's baby was born and then they would take it from her so she could continue working. ""Issy knew she had to escape. She chose a moment when her captors were distracted and ran out of the house. An older woman saw Issy visibly distressed and took her to a police station."" Issy is a real person, but her name has been changed. Women who have been tricked by promises of work, or brought illegally into the UK, might have no documents or have anyone they can ask for help. Among such pregnant women who had left slavery, 16% became rough sleepers, others relied for food and clothes on foodbanks and charities. Albania is among the biggest countries of origin of modern slaves in the UK The report says the way that women had been mistreated raises ""questions about the human capacity for evil"". But it also says that the women's stories show ""great kindness on the part of strangers"". There were ""everyday citizens"" who had to helped to rescue women, by calling the police or intervening when they were in hospital or even ""providing a distraction for traffickers"". The most common countries of origin for women rescued by the charity are Albania, Nigeria, Vietnam and the Philippines. Albania and Nigeria together accounted for almost 60% of the victims. Among trafficked women helped by the charity, almost 70% had been brought to the UK for ""sexual exploitation"", including prostitution, strip clubs and pornography. ""Domestic servitude"", where women were held as domestic workers, accounted for 25% of women rescued. A further 6% were involved in ""forced labour"", such as working in nail bars. The National Crime Agency says the most frequent agencies involved in finding modern slavery victims are the police, voluntary groups (particularly the Salvation Army) and local authorities. There were referrals from over 60 different local authorities. National Crime Agency figures show ""sexual exploitation"" as biggest form of modern slavery for women, while for men ""labour exploitation"" is the most frequent. A spokeswoman for the charity says there needs to be greater recognition of the needs of pregnant women - such as appropriate accommodation and access to health care and support for mental health problems. But there is also another emotional gap in the ""lack of family"" when women are feeling most isolated and anxious. ""It's heartbreaking. You need your mum more than ever at that point,"" she says.

Black Panther actor to adopt 'inclusion rider'He says will include the commitment to diversity in projects made by his production company.,"Black Panther actor Michael B Jordan will adopt a diversity clause for projects made by his production company. He said he was committing to using the ""inclusion rider"" for all work made by Outlier Society. It's a clause in an actor's contract in which they ask or demand that projects have a diverse cast and crew. In an Instagram post he said he was doing it ""in support of the women and men who are leading this fight."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Michael B Jordan plays villain Erik Killmonger in the superhero movie Black Panther. The film has been praised for being the first Hollywood superhero movie to have a predominately black cast. Theterm ""inclusion rider""was a big feature at the Oscars after being used by Frances McDormand at the end of her best actress acceptance speech. Frances McDormand used the term in her speech at the Oscars It was invented by media researcher Stacy Smith during a talk in which she came up with ways to show more women, ethnic minorities and people with disabilities on screen. According to the University of Southern California, where Dr Smith is a professor, theconcept of an inclusion rider,externalis: ""A-list actors can incorporate a clause in their contracts that stipulates that inclusion, both on camera and behind the scenes for crew members, be reflected in films. ""The rider states that women, people of colour, people with disabilities, and members of LGBT and marginalised communities who are traditionally under-represented be depicted on screen in proportion to their representation in the population.""

Eight moments that make it the year of the woman,"The #MeToo movement against male harassment has empowered women in the US and elsewhere, but it is not the only women's movement to have an impact over the last year. We asked BBC journalists to choose other key triumphs that have made this a momentous year for women around the world. The #MeToo movement to expose harassment has become a worldwide phenomenon, but in a country like China - a one-party state with strict censorship - women have fewer ways to challenge the status quo. That hasn't stopped them from using a combination of two emojis - a bowl of rice and a rabbit - to get round the authorities. In early January, Luo Xixi, a female graduate of a well-known Beijing university wrote an open letter on Chinese social media platform Weibo describing her former professor had tried to pressure her into sex. The university launchedan investigation which found Chen Xiaowu guilty of sexual harassmentand removed him from his post. While this has happened in China before, the issue has for the most part been ignored in public discourse. This time it was different. What followed was a movement spearheaded by Chinese feminists, university students and alumni across China, but soon some universities warned students to tone down their activism. There were reports of open letters being deleted and hashtags censored. ""Rice bunny"" - which in Mandarin Chinese is pronounced ""mi tu"" - became a nickname for the movement. Rice bunnies might sound cute, but they have given Chinese women a tool to discuss their experience of sexual harassment without fear of censorship. Reporting by Lara Owen, East Asia Women's Affairs Journalist BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. We create documentaries, features and interviews about their lives, giving more space for stories that put women at the centre. On 8 March, BBC 100 Women will be showcasing inspirational stories from women in the UK and across the world. Follow BBC 100 Women onInstagram,externalandFacebook,externaland join the conversation. Two female flight attendantssued the major Russian airline Aeroflot for alleged discriminationin September, saying they had been shifted to less lucrative routes because of their body size. While more young female activists talk about the importance of body positive attitude, a lot of people in Russia still believe that in order to be successful a woman should be young, thin and conventionally sexually attractive. Evgenia Magurina and Irina Ierusalimskaya learned this the hard way when, after six and 19 years respectively of working for Aeroflot, their salaries dropped by 30% in summer 2016. When they confronted their bosses they were told they didn't meet the size limit Aeroflot had set for its cabin crew. This was a Russian size 48 - about a UK 14 or US 12. That's why, instead of long-haul flights - to Miami for example -  they had been relegated to shorter night trips around Russia, ""so no-one will see us"" they told the BBC. The two flight attendants lost their first case in court, which angered many on social media, but later won on appeal. The judge ruled that Aeroflot had to pay them their full salaries and also awarded both women compensation for emotional distress. Although the compensation was purely symbolic - 5,000 roubles (Â£65) each - Ms Magurina and Ms Ierusalimskaya were pleased with the outcome as the court also told the airline to eliminate the article in its regulations concerning body size. Reporting by Nina Nazarova, Russia Women's Affairs Journalist This video can not be played Miss Peru contestants highlight violence against women Beauty pageants continue to draw huge audiences in Latin America. That's probably not surprising given that Latin American candidates have won more than 20 of the Miss Universe pageants since they started in 1952. Traditional ideas of female beauty are still held high in Latin American societies where machismo rules and women are meant to, above all, look pretty. That's also why plastic surgery is so popular, not just with the rich, but across society. Pageants are also seen as a chance for young women, who may lack other opportunities, to get highly paid jobs as models, in advertising or in TV - as well as to travel, if not the world, than at least the country. There has been some criticism of their prevalence in the region. In 2012 the then-governor of the Colombian province of Antioquia banned pageants from schools. ""School is for studying, not for runways,"" he said, and promoted science competitions instead. But even so beauty pageants in the region have generally remained politics-free zones, except for the often-expressed desire of contestants for ""world peace"". So it came as a total surprise when participants in Peru's Miss Universe pageant came on stage one by one in October reciting not their bust, waist and hip measurements but statistics of gender violence. ""My measurements are: 2,202 cases of reported murders of women in the last year in my country,"" one contestant said. ""My measurements are: 70% of women have been harassed in the street,"" said another. While the statements had been planned with the organisers of the event, the statistics came as a surprise to viewers, many of whom had tuned in for an evening of light entertainment. Some said that the pageant was not the right forum, but many more supported the move and expressed their solidarity on social media under the hashtag #MisMedidasSon (#MyMeasurementsAre). Reporting by Vanessa Buschschluter, Latin America and Caribbean editor, BBC News website This video can not be played Student Emma Gonzalez to lawmakers: ""Shame on you!"" In the terrible aftermath of the Valentine's Day fatal shooting in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida, a young woman emerged to spit out the collective fury of her fellow students. Tearful but impassioned, 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez crystallised the indignation and grief of her community in an eloquent and rhetorical address. ""I am going to happily ask [US President Trump] how much money he received from the National Rifle Association [NRA],"" she said, adding, ""OK. You want to know something? It doesn't matter because I already know,"" she proclaimed. ""$30 million!"", she went on. ""And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States, in the one and one-half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 [per victim]. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?"" As a Latina, bisexual woman Ms Gonzalez represents many of the communities who have felt victimised ever since President Trump came to power, but her speech was anything but disempowered. ""This is the movement that you're going to read about in a text book one day,"" she told the BBC. ""You're either killing the children or you are saving them."" Reporting by Sarah Buckley, 100 Women Journalist In Afghanistan's largely conservative society, calling and identifying a woman in public by her first name is taboo. Indeed in many parts of Afghanistan it is considered a disgrace for men if their mother, sister, wife or daughter's first name is known to men outside their family. It is not a legal ban, but rather a cultural barrier. On everything from wedding invitations to gravestones, women's names are left off - they are usually referred to simply as 'the daughter of Mr X', or simply, 'Miss'. In public women are simply referred to as 'the wife of', 'the mother of', or 'the daughter of', a man. Last year Afghan women startedan online campaign called #WhereIsMyName, aimed at breaking this taboo and reclaiming women's identities. Laleh Osmani, one of the campaign organisers, was motivated to start the campaign when she came across the death notice of the wife of a famous poet on Facebook. In the notice there was no mention of the name of the deceased, or her female relatives. She realised that even among the intellectual elite, who might be expected to be more open minded, this tradition was being upheld. The women behind the campaign urged clerics and mullahs to help change the culture surrounding women's identities. Reporting by Faranak Amidi, Middle East Women's Affairs Journalist An unusual rebellion took centre stage in India during the hot summer, featuring hundreds of selfies using the middle finger.The Hindi-language film Lipstick Under My Burkha was finally releasedin India, examining the lives and desires of four women from small-town India, after a six-month legal tussle with the film censors. It had initially been refused certification for being too ""lady oriented"" with ""continuous sex scenes"", ""abusive words"" and ""audio pornography"". The Censor Board did not elaborate on these objections but it is not unusual for it to suggest cuts or ban films altogether, and film makers often have to approach higher tribunals to get their films passed. In the recent past, the board has been criticised by the film industry for being irrational and making decisions on an inconsistent basis. It has been asked to edit out scenes involving sex and violence, swear words or even a kiss. The director of Lipstick Under My Burkha, Alankrita Shrivastava, told the BBC, ""The Central Board of Film Certification is outdated and illogical. Its members have no idea about gender issues and gender politics."" Bollywood has traditionally shied away from being very confrontational, but that is changing. For Ms Shrivastava and the makers of her film, just getting the certification (with some cuts) was not enough. They launched a new poster that used lipstick as the middle finger of a woman's hand. The female leads of the film then all posted similar photos, using the hashtag #LipstickRebellion, and the trend caught on. For more than a month, as the film was being shown, both actors and the public - both men and women - posted selfies giving the middle finger to patriarchy. Reporting by Divya Arya, South Asia Women's Affairs Journalist In many communities in Arabic cultures, women who have been raped are seen as a source of shame for their families and so the crime is hidden to avoid a scandal. Women are neither socially nor legally supported to speak up and the rapists who are identified are legally exempt from punishment if they marry their victims. It is not easy to explain how powerful this patriarchal mindset is, but it lives in a context in which sex outside of marriage is not acceptable for women. Indeed in many cultures, being a virgin is a prerequisite for future wives. Last summer, Tunisia, Lebanon and Jordanscrapped the laws which saved rapists from jail if they married their victims.This is something local activists have been pushing for for years. In Lebanon, for example, in one of the campaigns more than 30 white wedding dresses were hung from nooses between the palm trees. Earlier, women dressed in wedding dresses made from bandages to protest against the law. Similarly, Jordanians launched an e-campaign to stress their demands. Egypt was the first Arabic country to scrap the law in 1999, but change is slow, and three countries in one year feels like a watershed moment. Reporting by Alma Hassoun, Arabic Women's Affairs Journalist On 19 July 2017three men were sentenced to death for robbing, stripping, and sexually assaulting a female passengerfor wearing a miniskirt at a public bus stop in Kenya's Githurai district. The case ruling was momentous for women not only in Kenya but all over Africa. This was one of two landmark cases involving the sexual assault and violent robbery of women on public transport in a country where women make up the majority of commuters. For many Kenyan women like Naomi Mwaura, a reproductive health and gender rights activist who helped organise the protest, ""this ruling is the strong message needed to criminalise violence against women and reaffirm the rights of women to live free of violence in public spaces, especially the transport industry"". Three years earlier, in November 2014, hundreds of people came together on the Nairobi streets for a historic march to protest the sexual violence of women in the capital, after a video of the attack surfaced online.  The protest was later coined #MyDressMyChoice and influenced the court's decision and became a global movement. The Kenyan's court pronouncement sent a clear signal to the rest of Africa that women's rights are not to be tampered with. ""I feel honoured to have supported the cause,"" said Ms Mwaura who helped organize the protest, ""and most importantly, to see justice in my lifetime.""

"Sick baby Isaiah Haastrup diesThe baby's parents, who fought a court battle over his treatment, say their son ""fought bravely"".6m7 minutes agoLondon","This video can not be played Isaiah Haastrup's parents say his son 'fought bravely' Isaiah Haastrup, a baby at the centre of a legal row over his treatment, has died, his parents have confirmed. An appeal by the parents of the 12-month-old to continue his life-support treatmentwas dismissed by European judgeson Tuesday. Isaiah suffered ""catastrophic"" brain damage due to being deprived of oxygen at birth. His parents fought a lengthy legal battle with King's College Hospital to allow further care for their son. Isaiah's father said he was ""so proud"" of his ""brave"" son as he died at 19:50 GMT on Wednesday - hours after his life-support was withdrawn. Talking to the BBC, Isaiah's mother Takesha Thomas said her son had ""a little cheekiness about him, which I will miss."" ""But right now all I can feel is just pure anger. All I know is justice wasn't served - at all."" Lanre Haastrup and Takesha Thomas did not want their son's life-support treatment to be stopped Ms Thomas and Lanre Haastrup had asked the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) to intervene afterlosing two court battles in the UK, but the case was again dismissed by judges. An ECHR spokesman said the application had been declared ""inadmissible"". Doctors said Isaiah was in a low level of consciousness, could not move or breathe independently and was connected to a ventilator. King's College Hospital in London said providing further intensive care treatment was not in his best interests. A spokesman for the hospital said: ""The trust always provided Isaiah with the very best care, and the decision to apply to the courts to withdraw treatment was only made after careful consideration and after consultation with the family. ""We recognise that this has been an extremely difficult time for Isaiah's family as well as those involved in his care since birth.""

US softens stance on trade tariffsThe White House says it could exclude some countries from a plan to impose tariffs on metals for a time.17m17 minutes agoUS & Canada,"The US is planning tariffs on metals - but may be hit in kind by other countries Some countries may be exempt from US plans to impose tariffs on metal imports, the White House has announced. The exemptions - on national security grounds - included Canada and Mexico, spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said. Reports, however, suggested the apparent softening of the US stance would last for only 30 days. US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. He is expected to sign the plan on Thursday. Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday morning that he was ""looking forward"" to a meeting later in the day on the matter. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, China threatened an ""appropriate and necessary response"" in any trade war with the US. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and the US should strive to be partners rather than rivals. The EU has proposed retaliatory measuresagainst a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter. Why Trump is hanging tough on trade Five reasons Why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Despite opposition at home and abroad,  Ms Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week. But she added: ""There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis."" President Trump has previously suggested that planned tariffs for Canada and Mexico could be abandoned if a ""new and fair"" North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is signed. White House trade policy adviser Peter Navarro said on Wednesday that the tariffs would start in 15 to 30 days' time and there would be ""a clause that does not impose these tariffs immediately on Canada and Mexico"". Both countries knew the president was not ""messing around in this"", he added. Mr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been ""taking advantage of"" the US for decades. One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular cheap Chinese imports.

Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying ""trade wars are good"" and were something the US would easily win. Mr Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mexico and Canada are among the main suppliers of steel to the US. The US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets. Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers. More than 100 Republicans on Wednesday signed a letter addressed to the president, expressing their ""deep concern"" about the tariffs. The letter referenced a sweeping tax cuts bill Congress and the White House worked to pass last year, arguing that ""adding new taxes in the form of broad tariffs would undermine the remarkable progress"". International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned ""nobody wins"" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth. The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries are also considering retaliatory steps. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were ""more surgical and more targeted"".

Climate change 'hurts women more',"Over 70% of those displaced by flooding in Pakistan in 2010 were women and children Women are more likely than men to be affected by climate change, studies show. UN figures indicate that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. Roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make them more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. The 2015 Paris Agreement has made specific provision for the empowerment of women, recognising that they are disproportionately impacted. Millions in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and the Central African Republic rely on Lake Chad In central Africa,where up to 90% of Lake Chad has disappeared, nomadic indigenous groups are particularly at risk. As the lake's shoreline recedes, women have to walk much further to collect water. ""In the dry season, men go to the towns... leaving women to look after the community,"" explains Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, coordinator of the Association of Indigenous Women and People of Chad (AFPAT). With dry seasons now becoming longer, women are working harder to feed and care for their families without support. ""They become more vulnerable... it's very hard work,"" Ibrahim recently told theBBC's 100 Womeninitiative. It is not just women in rural areas who are affected. Globally, women aremore likely to experience poverty,external, and to have less socioeconomic power than men. This makes it difficult to recover from disasters which affect infrastructure, jobs and housing. Shanika Reaux with her baby Tatiana were displaced by Hurricane Katrina After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, African American women were among the worst affected by flooding in Louisiana. As sea levels rise, low-lying cities like New Orleans will beincreasingly at risk. ""In New Orleans, there was much higher poverty among the African American population before Katrina,"" says Jacquelyn Litt, professor of women's and gender studies at Rutgers University. ""More than half the poor families in the city were headed by single mothers,"" she told BBC News. ""[They] are reliant on interdependent community networks for their everyday survival and resources. The displacement that happened after Katrina essentially eroded those networks. It places women and their children at much greater risk."" In the immediate aftermath of extreme events, emergency shelters can be inadequately equipped to support women. The Superdome, in which evacuees were temporarily housed after Hurricane Katrina, didn't have enough sanitary products for the women accommodated there. Katrina impact: Women and children waiting to be evacuated outside the New Orleans Superdome Increased incidences of violence against women, including sexual assault and rape, have also been documented in the wake of disasters. Much as climate change is accelerated by human behaviours, the impact of weather and climate events is influenced by societal structures. Disasters do not affect all people equally. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, an Oxfam report found that surviving men outnumbered women by almost 3:1 in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India. While no one cause was clear, there were similar patterns across the region. Men were more likely to be able to swim, and women lost precious evacuation time trying to look after children and other relatives. Another study spanning 20 years noted that catastrophic events lowered women's life expectancy more than men; more women were being killed, or they were being killed younger.  In countries where women had greater socioeconomic power, the difference reduced. In recognition of this vast disparity, governments and organisations working on climate change are gradually moving to include women's voices in policy and planning. Women farmers in Durban protesting the impact of climate change on their livelihoods The UN has highlighted the need for gender sensitive responses to the impacts of climate change, yet the average representation of women in national and global climate negotiating bodies is below 30%. The numbers don't improve at the local level. ""Women are often not involved in the decisions made about the responses to climate change, so the money ends up going to the men rather than the women,"" environmental scientist Diana Liverman told the BBC'sScience in Actionprogramme on the World Service this week. As an author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose reports influence climate change policy, Liverman has been monitoring the numbers of women involved. Twenty-five percent of those nominated to participate in the next report are women. ""IPCC has been very receptive to this and is actually discussing how they can support women better,"" explains Liverman. ""Women are half the world. It's important they participate in all major decisions,"" ""Climate change is not a fight for power,"" points out Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, ""it's a fight for survival.""

Reports, however, suggested the apparent softening of the US stance would last for only 30 days. US President Donald Trump has said steel products will face a 25% tariff, with 10% on aluminium goods. He is expected to sign the plan on Thursday. Mr Trump tweeted on Thursday morning that he was ""looking forward"" to a meeting later in the day on the matter. Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, China threatened an ""appropriate and necessary response"" in any trade war with the US. Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China and the US should strive to be partners rather than rivals. The EU has proposed retaliatory measuresagainst a number of US goods including bourbon and peanut butter. Why Trump is hanging tough on trade Five reasons Why trade wars aren't easy to win Steel tariffs: What impact will they really have? Despite opposition at home and abroad,  Ms Sanders said the US president would sign the measures in by the end of the week. But she added: ""There are potential carve-outs for Mexico and Canada based on national security, and possibly other countries as well based on that process. That would be [on] a case-by-case and country by country basis."" President Trump has previously suggested that planned tariffs for Canada and Mexico could be abandoned if a ""new and fair"" North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) is signed. White House trade policy adviser Peter Navarro said on Wednesday that the tariffs would start in 15 to 30 days' time and there would be ""a clause that does not impose these tariffs immediately on Canada and Mexico"". Both countries knew the president was not ""messing around in this"", he added. Mr Trump has railed against the US trade deficit, arguing that other countries have been ""taking advantage of"" the US for decades. One of his campaign promises was to rebuild the US steel and aluminium industries which he said has suffered ""disgraceful"" treatment from other countries, in particular cheap Chinese imports.

Last week he dismissed concerns he could trigger a trade war, instead saying ""trade wars are good"" and were something the US would easily win. Mr Trump has already hinted he could drop plans to impose tariffs on Mexican and Canadian metals but linked it to the US getting a better deal in the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta). Mexico and Canada are among the main suppliers of steel to the US. The US plans have sparked worldwide alarm and jolted stock markets. Critics argue that the tariffs would fail to protect American jobs and would ultimately raise prices for consumers. More than 100 Republicans on Wednesday signed a letter addressed to the president, expressing their ""deep concern"" about the tariffs. The letter referenced a sweeping tax cuts bill Congress and the White House worked to pass last year, arguing that ""adding new taxes in the form of broad tariffs would undermine the remarkable progress"". International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde warned ""nobody wins"" in a trade war, saying it would harm global economic growth. The EU has set out tit-for-tat plans to impose import duties on bourbon, peanut butter, cranberries, orange juice, steel, and industrial products. Other countries are also considering retaliatory steps. Members of Mr Trump's Republican party are concerned too, with House Speaker Paul Ryan saying he wanted to see tariffs that were ""more surgical and more targeted"".

Inventor on trial over Kim Wall murder,"Kim Wall boarded Peter Madsen's submarine to interview him Danish inventor Peter Madsen has denied murdering Swedish journalist Kim Wall on his homemade submarine, saying she died in an accident. At his trial in Copenhagen, Mr Madsen said the 30-year-old died of carbon monoxide poisoning when the vessel filled with toxic exhaust fumes. But he has admitted dismembering Ms Wall's body and disposing of it at sea. When asked why he did so, he told the court: ""I don't see how that mattered at that time, as she was dead."" Ms Wall's remains were found by a passing cyclist, 11 days after she interviewed the inventor last August. Mr Madsen is charged with murder, dismemberment and aggravated sexual assault. He faces a life sentence if convicted, which typically means 15 to 17 years in prison without parole. Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? Kim Wall: What we know of macabre case 'Exceptional' journalist remembered Around 40 witnesses are set to give evidence, as prosecutors attempt to shed light on the circumstances of Ms Wall's death. Kim Wall, a freelance journalist, boarded Peter Madsen's UC3 Nautilus on the evening of 10 August 2017 to interview him for a story. She had left her boyfriend at a going-away party the couple were having ahead of a planned move to Beijing. When she did not return, her boyfriend alerted the police. Peter Madsen was rescued the next morning as his vessel was sinking. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. But he later said she died when a heavy hatch on the submarine fell on her head. Eleven days later, a cyclist found the remains of the journalist's headless torso on a nearby beach. Weeks later, police divers discovered other parts of her body in plastic bags weighed down with metal. The 47-year-old Dane - the skipper and designer of the Nautilus, a 17m- (56ft) long privately-owned submarine - changed his version of events several times. After saying a hatch fell on her head, he maintained instead that she had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He initially denied cutting up her body, but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. Peter Madsen appeared calm on Thursday, wearing a black T-shirt, jeans and black glasses. Members of the Wall family were also in the session. His lawyer Betina Hald Engmark told the court he denied murder but admitted ""violating the law about indecent handling of a corpse"". Explaining his version of events, Mr Madsen said the air pressure on board his submarine suddenly dropped while he was standing on the deck and Ms Wall was in the engine room. He said the vessel began to fill with exhaust fumes but he was unable to open the hatch and enter. ""When I finally manage to open the hatch, a warm cloud hits my face. I find her lifeless on the floor, and I squat next to her and try to wake her up, slapping her cheeks,"" he said. Asked why he had changed his story several times, Mr Madsen said that he had ""wanted to spare her family"" the ""gruesome details."" Maddy Savage, BBC News, Copenhagen This is a high-profile trial being covered by more than 100 journalists from around the world, with some queuing for hours in the snow to secure a good view from the court or the press room, where reporters are asked to remain silent and banned from making phone calls. During breaks, Danish journalists here have told me Peter Madsen's black T-shirt and jeans combination isn't unusual attire in courtrooms in Denmark, where casual business dress is common. What fluent Danish speakers here say is significant is that while he is able to speak at length about his own actions and his passion for all things nautical, his answers about what specifically happened to Kim Wall on the night she died have been shorter and less clear. He has continued to deny killing the Swedish journalist, repeatedly describing her death as ""terrible"". During the session, the prosecution said: It was not clear how Kim Wall died but there was the suspicion that Mr Madsen had ""psychopathic tendencies"" Pipes and straps discovered in the same bag as the journalist's clothes matched similar items found in his workshop Blood on his nose was the journalist's but there was no evidence of his sperm on her body Films found on his computer showed real women being tortured and mutilated Allow Twitter content?

The trial is expected to last 12 days over seven weeks, with a verdict expected on 25 April. The journalist was born in 1987 and grew up in a close-knit community in the small town of Trelleborg in southern Sweden, just across the strait dividing Denmark from Sweden. Kim Wall is seen here on board Peter Madsen's submarine on the evening of 10 August She studied international relations at London School of Economics and went on to gain a place on the rigorous masters programme of Columbia University's School of Journalism - described as the ""Oxbridge of journalism"". She had a long career in journalism, having previously reported from North Korea, the South Pacific, Uganda and Haiti, writing for the New York Times, Guardian, Vice and the South China Morning Post.

"Charity admits 'unsafe behaviour' towards staffTwo reviews in 2015 found Save the Children had ""significant failures"" in the response to complaints.6h6 hours agoUK","Save the Children failed to deal adequately with inappropriate behaviour complaints and there was evidence of ""unsafe behaviour"" towards staff at the charity, two reviews have said. Reviews in 2015 found ""significant omissions and failures"" in their response to harassment complaints. The charity said progress had since been made in its workplace culture. Save the Children published its recommendations on Wednesday after the BBCrevealed the failures. Staff complaints prompted the reviews in 2015. ""We have chosen to make both sets of recommendations public to ensure there is a full picture of the situation at the time and the actions taken since,"" Save the Children said. The BBC reported on Wednesday that the documents said the charity failed adequately to deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth. One of the 2015 reports, leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, referred to concerns that the then chairman Sir Alan Parker's ""very close"" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. Aid organisations 'truly sorry' for sector's failings Murdered MP's widower quits charities Aid groups report 80 harm cases A leaked email from the time cautioned that Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken ""responsibility"" for his mistakes ""many years ago"", but did ""not accept as accurate much of what has been reported today, either in tone or fact"". He said he ""strongly refutes a number of the claims"" and added that he had not seen the leaked 2015 report. The review in relation to historical complaints found a management culture existed that ""did not sufficiently adhere to established and published policies and procedures"". There were ""significant omissions and failures"" in the HR response to historical informal complaints around behaviour and the charity ""failed in its obligation to adequately deal with issues raised in respect of inappropriate behaviour through its disciplinary procedures"". But its policies and procedures were fit for purpose and the omissions and failures ""did not necessarily alter the outcome"", it said. The review on its culture found there were ""significant employee engagement issues"". ""There was evidence of uncomfortable and/or unsafe behaviour towards colleagues,"" the report said. But the charity, overall, had ""a positive workplace culture"". On Tuesday, protesters from the Women's Equality Party interrupted the charity's board meeting tocall for Sir Alan's resignation,externalas Chairman of Save the Children International. In the leaked report, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. ""They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,"" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. Justin Forsyth with Samantha Cameron in Lebanon in 2013 In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were ""not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness"" and that ""he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff"" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had ""made a deliberate choiceâ¦not to fully investigate these allegations"" and as a result had a ""conflict of interest"" in relation to the review. In the review's recommendations, now published by the charity, it was advised to implement department plans to ""strengthen culture"". It said there should be annual interactive group training for staff, training for the HR department and an anonymous whistle-blowing hotline introduced. Since 2015, Save the Children said every staff member received training in ""respect in the workplace"" and a hotline has been set up. Senior leadership workshops have taken place specifically addressing standards of good, acceptable behaviour and culture in the workplace, the charity said. New recruits also now receive coaching and advice on the values of the organisation. Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt ""cannot be repeated"". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading the independent review for the charity, said she ""acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration"". Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth facedthree complaints of inappropriate behaviourtowards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsythresigned from his roleas deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities.

"Empty-nesters 'resent boomerang kids'Parents' whose adult children move back home suffer a decline in quality of life, research suggests.","""Don't look so worried Dad, it won't be for long"" Adults who move back home after moving away are causing their parents stress and conflict, a study suggests. Parents whose adult children move back into the family home saw a decline in their quality of life and wellbeing, researchers at the London School of Economics and Political Science found. The research analysed data from people aged between 50 and 75 from 17 European countries, not including the UK. They found parents' quality of life fell when an adult child ""boomeranged."" The study -Returns home by children and changes in parents' well-being in Europe,external- found that this slump in wellbeing happened only when there were no other children still at home - there was no impact on parents if other children were already living in the family home. Researchers measured quality of life and wellbeing across four areas: control autonomy pleasure self-realisation Higher scores indicated a better quality of life. But the study found that when a child returned home to an ""empty-nest"",  there was a significant drop in scores. It said such a drop had a substantial effect on quality of life and was similar to developing an age-related disability, such as difficulties with walking or getting dressed. From boomers to stay-at-home boomerang generation Graduates boosting 'boomerang generation' The research paper, published in the journal Social Science & Medicine, says: ""Over the past half century, intergenerational co-residence has declined dramatically in Western countries. ""However, this pattern has recently altered, and in some countries multigenerational co-residence has increased; a shift interpreted as a family response to high unemployment rates, poor job prospects and financial hardship among young adults."" The paper explores the effects of different reasons for returning home, such as unemployment and partnership breakdown, saying these are, in themselves, distressing to parents. But after controlling for this, the researchers found the return of a child still caused a significant decline in parents' wellbeing. The researchers analysed the wellbeing scores of 99,000 parents taken from the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement in Europe (2007-2015) and found 1,070 had ""boomerang"" children. They only assessed adults up to the age of 75, to reduce the chance that returning home was driven by parents' need for support. The paper says: ""The findings show that returning home was correlated with a decline in parent's quality of life when there were no other children in the parental home. ""Parents enjoy their independence when their children leave the home, and refilling an empty nest may be regarded as a violation of this life-course stage."" Study author Dr Marco Tosi said:  ""Our work shows that in contexts where family orientations and welfare institutions foster individuals' independence, returns home by adult children have negative implications for parents' well-being. ""Across Europe, this effect is greater in Protestant than in Catholic countries, but we see it in all countries. ""When children leave the parental home, marital relationships improve and parents find a new equilibrium. ""They enjoy this stage in life, finding new hobbies and activities. When adult children move back, it is a violation of that equilibrium."" Although the study did not cover the UK, it was highly likely that the trends would be very similar, Dr Tosi added, particularly as the UK was a predominantly Protestant country. The 17 countries covered by the research were: France, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, Belgium, Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Estonia and Poland.

Assad's forces push deeper into enclave,"Syrian government armed vehicles has been on the move towards the enclave Forces loyal to the Syrian government have reportedly taken half of the Eastern Ghouta - the last rebel-held enclave close to the capital Damascus. ""Regime forces control more than 50% of Ghouta,"" Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, told AFP news agency. Aerial bombing killed at least 20 people as troops and tanks advanced. In New York, the UN Security Council gathered to discuss the failure of a ceasefire it had demanded last week. It passed a resolution on 24 February demanding a 30-day truce across Syria but the government and its key ally Russia say it does not apply to some of the rebel groups holding the enclave. This video can not be played Footage shows an aid convoy reaching ""hell on earth"", the Eastern Ghouta A UN convoy was allowed to deliver aid to the enclave on Monday but left without unloading all of its trucks as shells fell. At least 850 people are believed to have been killed since an offensive against the Eastern Ghouta, which is home to about 393,000 people, began on 18 February. Many victims are children. Eastern Ghouta devastation seen from space Why is there a war in Syria? According to the Observatory, 62 people were killed in Wednesday's bombardments. The Ghouta Media Centre reported at least 20 deaths. Syrian soldiers and their allies could be seen on the move on the edge of the enclave on Wednesday while, in the distance, smoke trails from air strikes rose over the rebel-held town of Misraba. Another village in the enclave, Beit Sawa, is reportedly now under full government control, with dozens of residents fleeing to Douma, the enclave's largest town. ""We escaped Beit Sawa to come here, under the bombs,"" one of them, Abu Qassem, told AFP. ""The situation is completely dead. Finished. We've got no clothes. Nothing to change into. No food."" Smoke over Misraba Adnan, 30, a Douma resident who has been sheltering below ground with his wife and two-year-old daughter, told Reuters news agency by telephone: ""It's bad in the basement but it's better than the bombing."" Rebel factions in Ghouta denied Beit Sawa had been seized, according to the Kumait news agency, which is affiliated with Jaysh al-Islam Islamist fighters. Ali al-Za'tari, the UN humanitarian co-ordinator in Syria, appealed to the government in a letter to observe the ceasefire and allow medical supplies to be delivered, Reuters reports.

Russian spy 'attacked with nerve agent',"This video can not be played The victims were ""targeted specifically"" - Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley A nerve agent was used to try to murder a former Russian spy and his daughter, police have said. Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found unconscious in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon and remain critically ill. A police officer who was the first to attend the scene is now in a serious condition in hospital, Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley said. Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. Russian spy: What we know so far The 'quintessentially English' home of a Russian spy Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny What now for UK-Russia relations? Mr Rowley, head of Counter Terrorism Policing, said government scientists had identified the agent used, but would not make that information public at this stage. ""This is being treated as a major incident involving attempted murder, by administration of a nerve agent,"" he said. ""Having established that a nerve agent is the cause of the symptoms... I can also confirm that we believe that the two people who became unwell were targeted specifically."" He said there was no evidence of a widespread health risk to the public. Two other police officers who attended the scene were treated in hospital for minor symptoms, before they were given the all clear. It is understood their symptoms included itchy eyes and wheezing. By Richard Galpin, BBC News correspondent - formerly based in Moscow The announcement by the police that Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia are the victims of an attack in which a nerve agent was used makes the parallel with the poisoning of former Russian spy Alexander Litvinenko in London in 2006 even stronger. Like the radioactive polonium used to kill Litvinenko, a nerve agent is not normally something criminal gangs or terrorist groups can make. Instead, it is usually manufactured by specialist laboratories under the control of governments - and that inevitably means suspicion will now be very much focused on Russia. Not only does it have a track record of using poisons to assassinate its enemies, there is also a motive in the case of Sergei Skripal. As a military intelligence officer in Russia, he betrayed his country by providing information to MI6, reportedly revealing the identities of Russian agents in Europe. And Russian President Vladimir Putin has in the past indicated that traitors deserve to die. Although the question remains, why would Mr Skripal be attacked now when he has been living in Britain for eight years and came here originally as part of a spy swap? Mr Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter were found slumped on a bench outside the Maltings shopping centre. Police want to speak to anyone who was in the city centre on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in The Bishop's Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both of those locations remain closed to the public. There is also a cordon in place outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home. A yellow forensic tent has been erected and police have been seen carrying equipment into the building. This video can not be played CCTV has emerged of Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Rowley said hundreds of detectives, forensic specialists, analysts and intelligence officers were working round the clock on the case. The investigation in Salisbury may take several more days, he added. Prof Malcolm Sperrin, fellow of the Institute of Physics and Engineering in Medicine, said: ""Symptoms of exposure to nerve agents may include respiratory arrest, heart failure, twitching or spasms - anything where the nerve control is degraded. ""Nerve agents can cause death, but not necessarily at low-level exposure or with a minor dose."" Alastair Hay, emeritus professor of environmental toxicology at the University of Leeds, added: ""These are very difficult and dangerous chemicals to make."" Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre A public inquiry concludedthe killing of the Russian dissident Alexander Litvinenko in 2006 was probably carried out with the approval of President Putin. On Tuesday,Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson told MPsthe UK would respond ""robustly"" to any evidence of Russian ""state responsibility"" in the Skripal case. Russia has insisted it has ""no information"" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the incident as part of an anti-Russian campaign. ""It's a traditional campaign. The tradition is to make things up. We can only see it as a provocation,"" she said. Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal, a retired Russian military intelligence officer, was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Col Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years. Read more about Sergei Skripal's background here.

Spy probe police seek nerve agent source,"Specialist officers in protective suits have been examining Salisbury city centre The attempted murder of ex-Russian spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter, Yulia, using a nerve agent was a ""brazen and reckless"" act, Amber Rudd has said. Mr Skripal and his daughter are still critically ill after being found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury city centre on Sunday. Counter-terrorism officers are working to find the origin of the nerve agent. A police officer, who was in intensive care, is now ""stable and conscious"", Wiltshire's chief constable said. Wiltshire Police named the officer as Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey. Addressing the House of Commons, the home secretary said the attack was ""attempted murder in the most cruel and public way"". Russian spy: What we know so far What are nerve agents? State TV anchor warns 'traitors' Ms Rudd told MPs it was an ""outrageous crime"", adding that the government would ""act without hesitation as the facts become clearer"". She refused to speculate on whether the Russian state might have been involved in the attack, saying the police investigation should be based on ""facts, not rumour"". However, she said the government was committed to bringing the perpetrators to justice ""whoever they are and wherever they may be"". Detective Sergeant Nick Bailey is now in a stable condition after being treated in intensive care after the incident Prime Minister Theresa May told ITV News that ""if action needs to be taken then the government will do that"". ""We will do what is appropriate, we will do what is right, if it is proved to be the case that this is state-sponsored,"" she said. Russia has denied it was involved. This video can not be played Amber Rudd said the attack was an ""outrageous crime"" Meanwhile, a doctor who was one of the first people at the scene has described how she found Ms Skripal slumped unconscious on a bench, vomiting and fitting. She had also lost control of her bodily functions. The woman, who asked not to be named, told the BBC she moved Ms Skripal into the recovery position and opened her airway, as others tended to her father. She said she treated her for almost 30 minutes, saying there was no sign of any chemical agent on Ms Skripal's face or body. The doctor said she had been worried she would be affected by the nerve agent, but added that she ""feels fine"". BBC correspondent Leila Nathoo said there had been ""a flurry of activity"" outside Mr Skripal's Salisbury home on Thursday. She said ambulances and an incident response team were in attendance and a police tent had been erected outside the house. Part of a business park in nearby Amesbury also remains cordoned off, while the graves of Mr Skripal's wife and son at a Salisbury cemetery have also been taped off by police. It comes as police said government scientists have identified the nerve agent used, but will not be making that information public at this stage. A source familiar with the investigation told the BBC the agent was likely to be rarer than theSarin gas thought to have been used in Syriaand in an attack on the Tokyo subway in 1995. And it was said not to be VX -the nerve agent used to kill the half brotherof the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un in Malaysia last year. Earlier, Ms Rudd told the BBC the nerve agent used in the poisoning was ""very rare"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said Russia was becoming an ""ever greater threat"", amid speculation the attack could have some element of state involvement. ""Russia's being assertive, Russia's being more aggressive, and we have to change the way that we deal with it because we can't be in a situation in these areas of conflict where we are being pushed around by another nation,"" he told ITV's Good Morning Britain. Mr Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, were found unconscious By Gordon Corera, BBC security correspondent The fact the nerve agent is ""very rare"" will help the investigation narrow its focus. Making nerve agents and delivering them requires considerable infrastructure and the more unusual the agent the easier it will be to locate which country, even which laboratory, might be involved. That combined with police leads on who delivered the agent will form the basis for a determination of responsibility, along with any other intelligence that can be gathered. It may take days - even weeks - for the government to be confident enough to make a public statement, because it will not want to risk getting any details wrong. But if suspicions about Russia are confirmed, then some kind of action seems inevitable. The legacy of the 2006 Litvinenko caseshows that expelling diplomats alone may not be regarded as much of a deterrent to future acts. Economic sanctions on the Russian elite may have more bite, but would require greater political will. Mr Skripal, 66, was convicted of passing secrets to MI6 but was given refuge in the UK in 2010 as part of a ""spy swap"". It is known that he and his 33-year-old daughter had visited the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury on Sunday afternoon, before they were found collapsed on a bench near the Maltings shopping centre. Sergei Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny What now for UK-Russia relations? Who is Sergei Skripal? Police have yet to say if they know how and where the poison was administered. Officers said they wanted to speak to anyone who was in the centre of Salisbury on Sunday afternoon. They are particularly keen to hear from people who ate at Zizzi or drank in the Mill pub between 13:00 and 16:00 GMT. Both sites remain closed to the public. This video can not be played Russian spy attack: What we know so far Nerve agents are highly toxic chemicals that stop the nervous system working and shut down bodily functions. They normally enter the body through the mouth or nose, but can also be absorbed through the eyes or skin. This video can not be played CCTV has emerged of Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Russia has insisted it has ""no information"" about what could have led to the incident, but is open to co-operating with British police if requested. Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said foreign media had used the case as part of an anti-Russian campaign. Sergei Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Sergei Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence colonel who was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. He was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. After a Cold War-style spy swap at Austria's Vienna airport, Mr Skripal moved to Salisbury, where he kept a low profile for eight years.

Charity admits 'unsafe behaviour' at work,"Save the Children failed to deal adequately with inappropriate behaviour complaints and there was evidence of ""unsafe behaviour"" towards staff at the charity, two reviews have said. Reviews in 2015 found ""significant omissions and failures"" in their response to harassment complaints. The charity said progress had since been made in its workplace culture. Save the Children published its recommendations on Wednesday after the BBCrevealed the failures. Staff complaints prompted the reviews in 2015. ""We have chosen to make both sets of recommendations public to ensure there is a full picture of the situation at the time and the actions taken since,"" Save the Children said. The BBC reported on Wednesday that the documents said the charity failed adequately to deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth. One of the 2015 reports, leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, referred to concerns that the then chairman Sir Alan Parker's ""very close"" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. Aid organisations 'truly sorry' for sector's failings Murdered MP's widower quits charities Aid groups report 80 harm cases A leaked email from the time cautioned that Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken ""responsibility"" for his mistakes ""many years ago"", but did ""not accept as accurate much of what has been reported today, either in tone or fact"". He said he ""strongly refutes a number of the claims"" and added that he had not seen the leaked 2015 report. The review in relation to historical complaints found a management culture existed that ""did not sufficiently adhere to established and published policies and procedures"". There were ""significant omissions and failures"" in the HR response to historical informal complaints around behaviour and the charity ""failed in its obligation to adequately deal with issues raised in respect of inappropriate behaviour through its disciplinary procedures"". But its policies and procedures were fit for purpose and the omissions and failures ""did not necessarily alter the outcome"", it said. The review on its culture found there were ""significant employee engagement issues"". ""There was evidence of uncomfortable and/or unsafe behaviour towards colleagues,"" the report said. But the charity, overall, had ""a positive workplace culture"". On Tuesday, protesters from the Women's Equality Party interrupted the charity's board meeting tocall for Sir Alan's resignation,externalas Chairman of Save the Children International. In the leaked report, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. ""They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,"" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. Justin Forsyth with Samantha Cameron in Lebanon in 2013 In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were ""not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness"" and that ""he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff"" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had ""made a deliberate choiceâ¦not to fully investigate these allegations"" and as a result had a ""conflict of interest"" in relation to the review. In the review's recommendations, now published by the charity, it was advised to implement department plans to ""strengthen culture"". It said there should be annual interactive group training for staff, training for the HR department and an anonymous whistle-blowing hotline introduced. Since 2015, Save the Children said every staff member received training in ""respect in the workplace"" and a hotline has been set up. Senior leadership workshops have taken place specifically addressing standards of good, acceptable behaviour and culture in the workplace, the charity said. New recruits also now receive coaching and advice on the values of the organisation. Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt ""cannot be repeated"". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading the independent review for the charity, said she ""acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration"". Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth facedthree complaints of inappropriate behaviourtowards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsythresigned from his roleas deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities.

Tube bomb accused 'trained by IS',"Ahmed Hassan, 18, denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life The man accused of the Parsons Green Tube bombing told officials months before the attack that he had been ""trained to kill"", a court has heard. Jurors heard that asylum seeker Ahmed Hassan spoke to Home Office officials in January 2016 - 20 months before the bombing that injured 30 people. In an interview, Mr Hassan said he had been taken by force by the Islamic State group in Iraq and given training. He denies attempted murder and causing an explosion likely to endanger life. The Old Bailey jury heard that Mr Hassan originally told police he was responsible for the bombing. They also heard graphic descriptions by victims of the explosion on the District Line on 15 September, 2017. One spoke of ""a furnace engulfed in flames"" when the device - made with materials partly sourced from Asda and Aldi - exploded at Parsons Green station during London's rush hour. This video can not be played CCTV allegedly showing Ahmed Hassan, 18, carrying hydrogen peroxide, a component for his homemade bomb Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told jurors that during a Home Office immigration interview in Croydon in January 2016, Mr Hassan was asked if he was, or had been part of a terror group in Iraq before he sought asylum in the UK. The jury heard he told officials that he had been taken by force by Isis (the Islamic State group), who had threatened to kill his uncle and brother if he resisted. Asked in the Home Office interview whether he had had any training from the Islamic State group Mr Hassan allegedly said: ""They trained us on how to kill. It was all religious based"". But he denied the Islamic State group had sent him to Europe to work for them. The court also heard that a worker for the charity Barnardos, who spoke Arabic, allegedly caught him listening to a ""call-to-arms"" song. The lyrics translated as: ""We are coming with you to the slaughter in your home/country."" Describing the attack on 15 September, one passenger, Aimee Colville, spoke of ""shards of glass flying through the air and then flames"". Jurors heard she could ""smell herself burning and saw her hair was on fire"". Thirty people were injured in the incident: some badly burned and others injured in the ""stampede"" as they fled in fear and panic, the Old Bailey was told. Alison Morgan, prosecuting, told the jurors that Mr Hassan packed a bomb with screwdrivers, knives and nails to cause ""maximum carnage"" on the rush-hour Tube. Jurors heard he bought metal items from Asda and Aldi supermarkets the day before the bombing. The court heard how Mr Hassan also researched the ingredients for TATP explosives and bought sulphuric acid on Amazon. To avoid suspicion, he allegedly used a friend's address for the delivery of the largest component - hydrogen peroxide. The device, which was on a timer, partially exploded very shortly after the crowded train arrived at Parsons Green Station during rush hour. Ms Morgan said: ""There were approximately 93 people in the carriage when the device detonated. ""The partial explosion created a large fireball. Some in the carriage were caught by the flames and sustained significant burns. ""Many ran in fear and panic. They were fortunate. Had the device fully detonated, it is inevitable that serious injury and significant damage would have been caused within the carriage."" Thirty people were injured when the device exploded on the train The court heard that, after the explosion, hundreds of people in the station tried to escape down a narrow staircase. Mr Hassan had got off the carriage at Putney Bridge Station before the bomb went off. He was arrested at the Port of Dover the next day. Ms Morgan told the jury that when first arrested and questioned by police, Mr Hassan accepted that he was ""responsible for the device"" and told them there ""may be a few milligrams traces"" of explosives at his home address. She said the device was made from the volatile chemical explosive TATP and contained 2.2kg of sockets, screws, bolts, nails, knives and screwdrivers. Jurors were told that Mr Hassan had arrived in Britain in the back of a lorry via the Channel Tunnel in October 2015. He told authorities he was born in June 1999 in Iraq, but had no identity documents. He gave his name as Ahmed Hassan Mohammed Ali. He claimed asylum, and from 2016 lived with foster parents in Cavendish Road, Sunbury in Surrey. At the time he allegedly planned his attack, his asylum claim was still outstanding, the court heard. The court heard that on the day of the attack Mr Hassan left his home shortly before 7am and took the train from Sunbury to Wimbledon. In a toilet on the concourse, he set the timer on the device before boarding the District Line, four stops from Parsons Green. Ms Morgan told jurors: ""At any point, should he have wanted to, he could have stopped the timer. He could have pulled the wires out of the device. He could have stopped the detonation. ""The CCTV footage from inside the carriage shows that at no stage did the defendant reach inside the bag to do anything."" The court heard that after ""calmly"" walking away from Putney Bridge station, Mr Hassan boarded a bus towards Earl's Court where sat on the top deck at the front. CCTV footage allegedly shows him glancing out of the window as he passes Parsons Green station. He is seen to remove the SD card from his mobile phone, chew on it and stuff it down the side of the bus seat, where it was later discovered by police in a destroyed state. Mr Hassan bought a backpack and clothes and was seen on CCTV at Ashford, wearing a blue Chelsea football shirt, the court heard. He boarded a train and arrived at Dover at around 14.30 BST where he is said to have bought a mobile phone and viewed the BBC News website which showed images of the scene he had left behind at Parsons Green.

Britain First bosses jailed for hate crime,"Jayda Fransen (left) and Paul Golding (right) had denied religiously-aggravated harassment The leader and deputy leader of far-right group Britain First have been found guilty of religiously aggravated harassment. Paul Golding, 36, and Jayda Fransen, 32, were arrested over the distribution of leaflets and posting of online videos during a gang-rape trial. Fransen was convicted of three counts of religiously aggravated harassment. Golding was found guilty of one charge. Both were jailed at Folkestone Magistrates' Court. Fransen was handed a 36-week sentence and Golding 18 weeks. During their trial in January, the court heard they had targeted homes and people in Kent whom they believed were connected to a rape trial at Canterbury Crown Court where three Muslim men and a teenager were convicted of rape and jailed. The pair, both from Penge in south-east London, were arrested in May last year. They denied a total of seven counts of harassment. Judge Justin Barron threw out three of the charges, while Fransen was found guilty of three and Golding of one. He told the court the pair were ""well-known"", ""controversial"" and ""generate their own publicity"", but his verdict was based ""solely on admissible evidence heard in court"". He said their words and actions ""demonstrated hostility"" towards Muslims and the Muslim faith. ""I have no doubt it was their joint intention to use the facts of the case [in Canterbury] for their own political ends. ""It was a campaign to draw attention to the race, religion and immigrant background of the defendants."" Both Fransen and Golding were convicted on a joint charge of religiously aggravated harassment after an incident last May at 555 Pizza takeaway in Ramsgate, when Fransen banged on the windows and doors of the shop and screamed ""paedophile"" and ""foreigner"". However, in each case, they instead targeted innocent members of the public. They filmed the abuse and then released it on social media and through the Britain First website. They also posted offensive leaflets through the letterboxes of houses in the area where the defendants lived. Paul Golding and Jayda Fransen arrived at the court with Britain First supporters Giving evidence, Fransen had denied being a racist and said she had carried out campaigns against people accused of sex offences, while Mr Golding told the court he had often acted as her cameraman. Fransen was convicted of abuse after visiting a house she wrongly believed to be the current address of Sershah Muslimyar, a defendant in the trial. She was also convicted ofvisiting the Kent home of another defendant, Tamin Rahmani, and shouting racist abuse through the front door while his pregnant partner Kelli Best was there. During sentencing Fransen spoke over the judge, saying: ""This is a very sad day for British justice. Everything I did was for the children of this country and they are worth it."" As Britain First supporters left the courtroom they hurled abuse at court staff and members of the press, shouting ""no surrender"".

"Women footballers: Born with talent, held back by prejudiceEight moments that make it the year of the womanVideoVideoHertha Ayrton: The woman who tamed lightningVideoVideo'The object that empowers me'","Laura Pigatin is one of the many girls dreaming of becoming a professional footballer Football is one of the most popular female sports, with about 30 million girls and women playing it worldwide. But in several countries, girls are not allowed to play. In others, they are discriminated against. Even in football-crazy Brazil, women come up against a lot of challenges as Irene Caselli, Claudia Jardim and Mariangela Maturi found when they spoke to well-established and aspiring female footballers in Africa, Europe and Latin America. ""It was just me, a girl in the middle of a lot of boys,"" says Marta Vieira da Silva, the Brazilian football legend who is better known just as Marta. Not only does she hold the record for the most goals scored at the Women's World Cup, she is also the only woman to have been named the world's best female footballer five times. Nevertheless, Marta says she did not have an easy time of it starting out in football. ""My family didn't approve. They didn't accept it because people still thought that girls weren't allowed to play football,"" she recalls. Marta was born in 1986, seven years after a government-imposed ban on women practising sports ""incompatible with their nature"" was lifted. The ban had been in place from 1941 until 1979 and clearly influenced the way even players regarded women. In the year that the ban was lifted, PelÃ© told a local paper that football ""can be a hobby, but not a real sport for women"". It comes as little surprise that prejudice and stereotypes remained even after the ban was lifted. Born in Dois Riachos, a small town in the poor state of Alagoas in north-eastern Brazil, Marta had to struggle to be recognised. Profile: Marta Fighting sexism in sport Brought up by her mother after her parents separated when she was only one, she learned to play football with the boys in the streets of her hometown. If her older brother approached, she would hide, afraid he might punish her for playing a ""men's game"". Marta says playing football makes her happy She eventually joined a club but says that as late as 1999 she was banned from playing in a tournament because she was a girl. ""I was very frustrated at that moment. I looked around, I stopped to think, and I just couldn't understand it,"" she recalls. ""Why is it so hard to accept that a human being was born with a talent, knows how to play, wants to do it and that is what makes her happy?"" Cultural stereotypes are not limited to Brazil either. This video can not be played Gambian footballer tackling marriage And despite women like Marta making it big, young female players in Brazil still struggle. Laura Pigatin, 14, is serious and disciplined and fully dedicated to achieving her dream of becoming a professional footballer. Laura Pigatin was banned from playing with her team because she is a girl She trains several times a week, both in futsal and football. Since there are no female teams of her age group in her hometown of SÃ£o Carlos, she plays in the all-boys team. Two years ago her team qualified for the championship in SÃ£o Paulo state but state officials banned Laura from playing because they said that the tournament was only for boys. The team Laura plays for is made up of boys...and her Eventually the authorities caved in and Laura was allowed to play after a campaign led by her parents gathered momentum. But it proved to be a fleeting victory as Laura was again banned from playing in the second phase of the tournament in 2017. ""I was very sad because I helped the team to be champion in the first phase and I was not going to be able to play the second phase, which was more important,"" Laura says. ""Marta's story is more or less similar to mine. Since then, things should have changed, and it should be allowed for girls to be able to play. It's absurd."" But change has been slow. Since the 1980s, few resources have been dedicated to women's football in Brazil. Several national tournaments were discontinued, and female players earn so little they often have to work another job. Brazil's national women's football league was launched as recently as 2013 and even top teams are severely underfunded. Rio Preto Esporte Club won the national women's league in 2015 and the SÃ£o Paulo championship in 2016 and 2017. Rio Preto Esporte Club's training facilities are basic The ground they train on is full of holes where ants have built their nests. They have no dedicated coach with a senior player taking on coaching duties instead. The players all live in a house provided by the club's owners with five of them to a room as their 1,500-reais monthly scholarships (Â£330, US$460) do not stretch to more. Despite Brazilians' love of football, the best female players move abroad to make their career at foreign clubs. Marta, for example, moved to Sweden at age 18 and now holds dual nationality. Despite her many achievements, in Brazil she is often referred to as ""PelÃ© in a skirt"". Marta plays for Orlando Pride and Brazil's national women's team ""There is always a comparison between her and PelÃ©, even though Marta scored more goals for the national team,"" says Angelica Souza of Dibradoras, a Brazilian website dedicated to women's sport. ""She's a woman so she'll always be compared to a man, she'll always be 'PelÃ© in a skirt', rather than PelÃ© being known as 'Marta in trousers'.""

Eight moments that make it the year of the womanVideoVideoHertha Ayrton: The woman who tamed lightningVideoVideo'The object that empowers me',"The #MeToo movement against male harassment has empowered women in the US and elsewhere, but it is not the only women's movement to have an impact over the last year. We asked BBC journalists to choose other key triumphs that have made this a momentous year for women around the world. The #MeToo movement to expose harassment has become a worldwide phenomenon, but in a country like China - a one-party state with strict censorship - women have fewer ways to challenge the status quo. That hasn't stopped them from using a combination of two emojis - a bowl of rice and a rabbit - to get round the authorities. In early January, Luo Xixi, a female graduate of a well-known Beijing university wrote an open letter on Chinese social media platform Weibo describing her former professor had tried to pressure her into sex. The university launchedan investigation which found Chen Xiaowu guilty of sexual harassmentand removed him from his post. While this has happened in China before, the issue has for the most part been ignored in public discourse. This time it was different. What followed was a movement spearheaded by Chinese feminists, university students and alumni across China, but soon some universities warned students to tone down their activism. There were reports of open letters being deleted and hashtags censored. ""Rice bunny"" - which in Mandarin Chinese is pronounced ""mi tu"" - became a nickname for the movement. Rice bunnies might sound cute, but they have given Chinese women a tool to discuss their experience of sexual harassment without fear of censorship.

Two female flight attendantssued the major Russian airline Aeroflot for alleged discriminationin September, saying they had been shifted to less lucrative routes because of their body size. While more young female activists talk about the importance of body positive attitude, a lot of people in Russia still believe that in order to be successful a woman should be young, thin and conventionally sexually attractive. Evgenia Magurina and Irina Ierusalimskaya learned this the hard way when, after six and 19 years respectively of working for Aeroflot, their salaries dropped by 30% in summer 2016. When they confronted their bosses they were told they didn't meet the size limit Aeroflot had set for its cabin crew. This was a Russian size 48 - about a UK 14 or US 12. That's why, instead of long-haul flights - to Miami for example -  they had been relegated to shorter night trips around Russia, ""so no-one will see us"" they told the BBC. The two flight attendants lost their first case in court, which angered many on social media, but later won on appeal. The judge ruled that Aeroflot had to pay them their full salaries and also awarded both women compensation for emotional distress. Although the compensation was purely symbolic - 5,000 roubles (Â£65) each - Ms Magurina and Ms Ierusalimskaya were pleased with the outcome as the court also told the airline to eliminate the article in its regulations concerning body size. Reporting by Nina Nazarova, Russia Women's Affairs Journalist This video can not be played Miss Peru contestants highlight violence against women Beauty pageants continue to draw huge audiences in Latin America. That's probably not surprising given that Latin American candidates have won more than 20 of the Miss Universe pageants since they started in 1952. Traditional ideas of female beauty are still held high in Latin American societies where machismo rules and women are meant to, above all, look pretty. That's also why plastic surgery is so popular, not just with the rich, but across society. Pageants are also seen as a chance for young women, who may lack other opportunities, to get highly paid jobs as models, in advertising or in TV - as well as to travel, if not the world, than at least the country. There has been some criticism of their prevalence in the region. In 2012 the then-governor of the Colombian province of Antioquia banned pageants from schools. ""School is for studying, not for runways,"" he said, and promoted science competitions instead. But even so beauty pageants in the region have generally remained politics-free zones, except for the often-expressed desire of contestants for ""world peace"". So it came as a total surprise when participants in Peru's Miss Universe pageant came on stage one by one in October reciting not their bust, waist and hip measurements but statistics of gender violence. ""My measurements are: 2,202 cases of reported murders of women in the last year in my country,"" one contestant said. ""My measurements are: 70% of women have been harassed in the street,"" said another. While the statements had been planned with the organisers of the event, the statistics came as a surprise to viewers, many of whom had tuned in for an evening of light entertainment. Some said that the pageant was not the right forum, but many more supported the move and expressed their solidarity on social media under the hashtag #MisMedidasSon (#MyMeasurementsAre). Reporting by Vanessa Buschschluter, Latin America and Caribbean editor, BBC News website This video can not be played Student Emma Gonzalez to lawmakers: ""Shame on you!"" In the terrible aftermath of the Valentine's Day fatal shooting in Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Florida, a young woman emerged to spit out the collective fury of her fellow students. Tearful but impassioned, 18-year-old Emma Gonzalez crystallised the indignation and grief of her community in an eloquent and rhetorical address. ""I am going to happily ask [US President Trump] how much money he received from the National Rifle Association [NRA],"" she said, adding, ""OK. You want to know something? It doesn't matter because I already know,"" she proclaimed. ""$30 million!"", she went on. ""And divided by the number of gunshot victims in the United States, in the one and one-half months in 2018 alone, that comes out to being $5,800 [per victim]. Is that how much these people are worth to you, Trump?"" As a Latina, bisexual woman Ms Gonzalez represents many of the communities who have felt victimised ever since President Trump came to power, but her speech was anything but disempowered. ""This is the movement that you're going to read about in a text book one day,"" she told the BBC. ""You're either killing the children or you are saving them."" Reporting by Sarah Buckley, 100 Women Journalist In Afghanistan's largely conservative society, calling and identifying a woman in public by her first name is taboo. Indeed in many parts of Afghanistan it is considered a disgrace for men if their mother, sister, wife or daughter's first name is known to men outside their family. It is not a legal ban, but rather a cultural barrier. On everything from wedding invitations to gravestones, women's names are left off - they are usually referred to simply as 'the daughter of Mr X', or simply, 'Miss'. In public women are simply referred to as 'the wife of', 'the mother of', or 'the daughter of', a man. Last year Afghan women startedan online campaign called #WhereIsMyName, aimed at breaking this taboo and reclaiming women's identities. Laleh Osmani, one of the campaign organisers, was motivated to start the campaign when she came across the death notice of the wife of a famous poet on Facebook. In the notice there was no mention of the name of the deceased, or her female relatives. She realised that even among the intellectual elite, who might be expected to be more open minded, this tradition was being upheld. The women behind the campaign urged clerics and mullahs to help change the culture surrounding women's identities. Reporting by Faranak Amidi, Middle East Women's Affairs Journalist An unusual rebellion took centre stage in India during the hot summer, featuring hundreds of selfies using the middle finger.The Hindi-language film Lipstick Under My Burkha was finally releasedin India, examining the lives and desires of four women from small-town India, after a six-month legal tussle with the film censors. It had initially been refused certification for being too ""lady oriented"" with ""continuous sex scenes"", ""abusive words"" and ""audio pornography"". The Censor Board did not elaborate on these objections but it is not unusual for it to suggest cuts or ban films altogether, and film makers often have to approach higher tribunals to get their films passed. In the recent past, the board has been criticised by the film industry for being irrational and making decisions on an inconsistent basis. It has been asked to edit out scenes involving sex and violence, swear words or even a kiss. The director of Lipstick Under My Burkha, Alankrita Shrivastava, told the BBC, ""The Central Board of Film Certification is outdated and illogical. Its members have no idea about gender issues and gender politics."" Bollywood has traditionally shied away from being very confrontational, but that is changing. For Ms Shrivastava and the makers of her film, just getting the certification (with some cuts) was not enough. They launched a new poster that used lipstick as the middle finger of a woman's hand. The female leads of the film then all posted similar photos, using the hashtag #LipstickRebellion, and the trend caught on. For more than a month, as the film was being shown, both actors and the public - both men and women - posted selfies giving the middle finger to patriarchy. Reporting by Divya Arya, South Asia Women's Affairs Journalist In many communities in Arabic cultures, women who have been raped are seen as a source of shame for their families and so the crime is hidden to avoid a scandal. Women are neither socially nor legally supported to speak up and the rapists who are identified are legally exempt from punishment if they marry their victims. It is not easy to explain how powerful this patriarchal mindset is, but it lives in a context in which sex outside of marriage is not acceptable for women. Indeed in many cultures, being a virgin is a prerequisite for future wives. Last summer, Tunisia, Lebanon and Jordanscrapped the laws which saved rapists from jail if they married their victims.This is something local activists have been pushing for for years. In Lebanon, for example, in one of the campaigns more than 30 white wedding dresses were hung from nooses between the palm trees. Earlier, women dressed in wedding dresses made from bandages to protest against the law. Similarly, Jordanians launched an e-campaign to stress their demands. Egypt was the first Arabic country to scrap the law in 1999, but change is slow, and three countries in one year feels like a watershed moment. Reporting by Alma Hassoun, Arabic Women's Affairs Journalist On 19 July 2017three men were sentenced to death for robbing, stripping, and sexually assaulting a female passengerfor wearing a miniskirt at a public bus stop in Kenya's Githurai district. The case ruling was momentous for women not only in Kenya but all over Africa. This was one of two landmark cases involving the sexual assault and violent robbery of women on public transport in a country where women make up the majority of commuters. For many Kenyan women like Naomi Mwaura, a reproductive health and gender rights activist who helped organise the protest, ""this ruling is the strong message needed to criminalise violence against women and reaffirm the rights of women to live free of violence in public spaces, especially the transport industry"". Three years earlier, in November 2014, hundreds of people came together on the Nairobi streets for a historic march to protest the sexual violence of women in the capital, after a video of the attack surfaced online.  The protest was later coined #MyDressMyChoice and influenced the court's decision and became a global movement. The Kenyan's court pronouncement sent a clear signal to the rest of Africa that women's rights are not to be tampered with. ""I feel honoured to have supported the cause,"" said Ms Mwaura who helped organize the protest, ""and most importantly, to see justice in my lifetime.""

"M1 death crash trucker cleared of chargeDavid Wagstaff was on a hands-free call when his lorry hit a minibus, killing eight people.","Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash on the M1 last August A second lorry driver involved in a crash on the M1 that killed eight people has been cleared of causing death by dangerous driving. David Wagstaff had previously admitted eight counts of the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. Wagstaff, 54, was on a hands-free call when his lorry forced a minibus under a stationary lorry in lane one. The driver of the other lorry involved, Ryszard Masierak, 31, was convicted on Tuesday of dangerous driving charges. 'There is no life for me now' - minibus driver's wife The pair are due to be sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court on 23 March. This video can not be played CCTV captured the fatal M1 minibus crash Ch Insp Andy Storey, from Thames Valley Police, revealed outside court that Masierak's professional driving licence had been revoked prior to the crash and he ""should not have been driving at all that day"". Fed Ex driver Wagstaff, who described his own actions as a ""lack of concentration"", was also cleared of four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving by the jury at Reading Crown Court,charges that Masierak had also been found guilty of. Judge Francis Sheridan paid tribute to the jury in what he described as a ""very emotional and heartbreaking"" case. Louise Atrill, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said outside court: ""Both men showed flagrant disregard for the safety of other road users that morning, leaving five families mourning their loved ones. ""It's unimaginable to think of the consequences this incident will have on the family and friends of the deceased and those injured."" Ryszard Masierak and David Wagstaff are due to be sentenced on 23 March Mathew John, spokesman for the family of minibus driver Mr Joseph, said they were disappointed by the verdict on Wagstaff. He said motorway information systems had failed to alert other road users to the fact Masierak had been stationary for more than 10 minutes. ""I think there should [also] be monitoring cameras in the [lorry] cabin to see what actually these drivers are doing,"" he added. The court heardAIM Logistics driver Masierak was at twice the drink-drive limitwhen he stopped his vehicle in the carriageway near Newport Pagnell, on 26 August last year. Just after 03:00 BST, a minibus being driven by Cyriac Joseph carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London on their way to Disneyland Paris pulled up behind Masierak's vehicle with its hazard lights on, waiting to go around it. Seconds later Wagstaff, who had been on a hands-free call for an hour, ploughed into the back of the minibus, without swerving or braking, and forced it into and under Masierak's vehicle, the court heard. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, told police he spoke to fellow driver Elliot Brough frequently and on the night in question they were talking about ""rubbish"", including Everton and Donald Trump. During the trial, Wagstaff, who has since been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder, said he ""cannot remember anything at all"" about the collision. His lawyer said he had""vivid memories"" of the bodies in the aftermath of the crashover the August Bank Holiday weekend. The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph The eight people killed - six men and two women - were Mr Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. The four other people in the minibus - including a four-year-old girl left orphaned by the tragedy - spent weeks in hospital following the crash. The court was told AIM Logistics driver Masierak stopped in the carriageway at about 02:57 BST, despite there being miles of hard shoulder available. Prosecutor Oliver Saxby QC called the Polish national's behaviour ""as flagrant as it was dangerous"". The front of David Wagstaff's Fed Ex lorry was severely damaged in the crash He admitted he had consumed alcohol but said this had nothing to do with the crash. Instead, he said he stopped becausehe was sweating, felt weak and had a headacheand had attempted to get onto the hard shoulder. Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, then said he lost consciousness, only to be woken from what he described as a ""small coma"" when the crash happened. After Wagstaff's verdict was given, Judge Francis Sheridan praised the families of the deceased for their ""constant dignity in a dreadful case with very sad, tragic consequences"".

Save the Children 'failed' on harassment claims,"Save the Children ""failed"" to adequately deal with allegations against its ex-chief executive Justin Forsyth, according to leaked documents. A 2015 report seen by the BBC contains evidence suggesting then chairman Sir Alan Parker's ""very close"" relationship with Mr Forsyth may have affected how he responded to complaints. Three women employees accused Mr Forsyth of inappropriate behaviour, for which he said he had apologised. Sir Alan said he had nothing to add. A leaked email from the time recommended that Mr Forsyth should not be alone with female employees. Mr Forsyth said that he had taken ""responsibility"" for his mistakes ""many years ago"", but did ""not accept as accurate much of what has been reported today, either in tone or fact"". He said he ""strongly refutes a number of the claims"" and added that he had not seen the 2015 report. On Tuesday, protesters from the Women's Equality Party interrupted the charity's board meeting to call for Sir Alan's resignation as Chairman of Save the Children International.

Alexia Pepper de Caires, a former Save the Children employee and Women's Equality Party member, was invited to meet the board on Wednesday following the protest. ""The board now has the information it needs to make decisions on the future of (Sir Alan's) leadership,"" she said. Save the Children UK said a new review of workplace ethics would ensure that what caused previous claimants hurt ""cannot be repeated"". It said the charity's ""new leadership"" and its trustees are ""committed to respect in the workplace"". Ethics expert Dr Suzanne Shale, who is leading a new independent review for the charity, said she ""acknowledges that past events may have caused distress to staff, and disquiet amongst those who support the work of the charity. We will listen to those accounts very carefully and with utmost consideration"". Last month, the BBC revealed Mr Forsyth facedthree complaints of inappropriate behaviourtowards female staff before leaving Save the Children in 2015. Days later, Mr Forsythresigned from his roleas deputy director of UNICEF, saying he did not want coverage of his past to ""damage"" the charities. Now a report leaked to Radio 4's PM programme, which has never been made public by the charity, exposes failures in how these complaints were handled. Aid organisations 'truly sorry' for sector's failings Murdered MP's widower quits charities Aid groups report 80 harm cases What's gone wrong with the foreign aid sector? In it, a complainant claims Save the Children told her not to tell anyone about her case and that both her and Mr Forsyth's reputations were at risk. ""They weren't trying to protect me or safeguard any other women. It was just about covering this up as quickly as they could,"" she said. The report - by law firm Lewis Silkin - was commissioned as part of a review of how Save the Children had handled complaints of inappropriate behaviour. It was written in October 2015. Months later, Save the Children provided a reference for Mr Forsyth when he applied for a job at UNICEF, which made no mention of the complaints. The report was leaked to Radio 4's PM programme In a separate leaked email in 2015, a senior staff member said that allegations of sexual harassment made against Mr Forsyth were ""not being treated with the appropriate degree of seriousness"" and that ""he should not be unaccompanied with female members of staff"" until they could be sure his behaviour would not be repeated. The senior staff member wrote that they had no confidence in Sir Alan Parker's handling of the complaints, saying he had ""made a deliberate choiceâ¦not to fully investigate these allegations"" and as a result had a ""conflict of interest"" in relation to the review. As well as being the international chairman of Save the Children, Sir Alan is the founder and chairman of the PR firm Brunswick and counts former prime ministers among his friends. Gordon Brown is godfather to his youngest son, and when David Cameron left Number 10, it was Sir Alan's west London mansion that became the Camerons' temporary home. More than 240 people have signed a petition calling for Sir Alan, who was chair of Save the Children UK at the time of the complaints against Mr Forsyth, to be held accountable and removed from his current role. The petition claims ""his abuse of that power to dampen the situation is widely known"" and signatories include current and former Save the Children staff. Justin Forsyth with Samantha Cameron in Lebanon in 2013 The first case was reported in 2012. The victim described receiving numerous inappropriate text messages from Mr Forsyth, who was her boss. When she made it clear to Mr Forsyth that these texts were unwelcome and made her feel uncomfortable, he persisted in sending them. When she complained again, she alleges that he took her phone when he saw it had been left on her desk and deleted some of the texts. She then lodged an official complaint. The head of HR at the time is quoted in the report as saying: ""I thought the deleting of the texts was intimidating."" Because Save The Children never formally questioned Mr Forsyth about the allegations, the report does not reflect his account of events. His lawyers say he categorically denies that he deleted any texts. The report is clear that a disciplinary investigation should have been held but states: ""no adequate investigation took place"". Instead, Sir Alan instructed a trustee to meet the complainant for a chat. In the evidence, the trustee claims that Sir Alan briefed him in advance that he believed she may have ""overreacted"". The complainant for her part described feeling ""just so scared"" when she would see Mr Forsyth. Sir Alan wrote a formal warning to Mr Forsyth. This letter no longer exists although the report says it should have remained on Mr Forsyth's record. A draft of that letter in the report warned that ""this type of conduct can amount to unlawful harassment"". In the report, Mr Forsyth insists the complaint was dealt with appropriately, adding that he had given up his bonus - worth Â£20,000 - that year. Sir Alan was on the Performance and Remuneration Committee that awarded that bonus in 2012. The complainant said she was assured the formal warning would remain on Mr Forsyth's record and that ""if this ever happened again, Alan will walk (Mr Forsyth) out of the door."" Both failed to happen and in 2015, two more women came forward with complaints. This video can not be played Ex-Save the Children worker: 'A really toxic culture grew' The second complainant was an employee who would often go on business trips with Mr Forsyth to where Save the Children operated in the field. During these trips, according to the leaked report, she received late night text messages from him, complimenting her on her work performance and asking her out for a drink. She declined but - according to her - the messages became ""more demanding"". Between trips, Mr Forsyth invited her for ""career chats"" after work. On one occasion, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have said: ""Look, I fancy you, you fancy me. Why don't we just stop pretending?"" She says she made it clear she wasn't interested and subsequently made excuses to avoid business trips with him. He sent her emails asking if she was avoiding him and she said that since then, she felt marginalised at work. The third complainant's account set out in the report describes how one night on a business trip ""they continued their work discussion, stopping outside (Mr Forsyth's) room... and (he) invited her into his room for a glass of wine. ""She sat on the table and he invited her to sit on the bed. She declined. She went to the bathroom and when she returned, he was reclining on his bed."" On another evening, Mr Forsyth is alleged to have announced he was ""not CEO for the night"" and asked her about her love life. He began to talk about his sex life and told her she was ""beautiful and talented"". The complainant says she made it clear she was not interested and refused his advances. In a statement issued by his legal representatives, Mr Forsyth admitted ""personal mistakes during my time at Save The Children"". ""I recognise that on a few occasions I had unsuitable and thoughtless conversations with colleagues, which I subsequently discovered caused offence and hurt,"" he said. ""When this was brought to my attention on two separate occasions, I apologised unreservedly to the three colleagues involved.  The concerns were handled through a process of mediation."" After the two later complaints, Save the Children's head of HR alerted Sir Alan, but evidence in the report shows he claimed he received a ""less than supportive response"". Recalling a conversation with Sir Alan, he said it was ""along the lines of 'Justin Forsyth is very important to the organisation; people behave differently when they're abroad; they would have been tired; they would have needed some mutual support; what were the complainants doing by agreeing to go to his hotel room in the first place."" The account goes on to record that the head of HR was ""frustrated"" by Sir Alan's response, ""which he feared was as a result of Sir Alan Parker and Justin Forsyth being very close"". One complainant is quoted in the report saying: ""It's more about who Alan is and having Alan and his best mate Justin sort of talking to each other about how best to handle these girls."" The husband of murdered MP Jo Cox, Brendan Cox, admitted to ""inappropriate"" behaviour while working for Save the Children. According to the report, Sir Alan said he didn't think there had been any ""serious misconduct"" or ""predatory behaviour"". He also rejected suggestions there should be any work done to look at the ""leadership culture"" at Save the Children in light of these complaints and ""generalised complaints of sexual advances and bullying"" by Brendan Cox, the widower of the MP Jo Cox, who was accused of sexual assault by a member of staff at the charity a couple of months later. Mr Cox says he does not accept the allegations, but acknowledges he ""made mistakes"" while working for Save the Children. Sir Alan is described as saying, ""the best way to protect the organisation from reputational risk is not to let the organisational response become disproportionate"".
