"Cost-of-renting: Young, struggling and short of cash","Manchester university student Jess had to check everyday to secure a house as many were snapped up What's it like being young and facing higher rent while your pay stays the same? Figures seen by the BBC showpeople under 30 face a growing cost-of-renting crisis, with worrying numbers spending more than 30% of their pay on rent. Experts say spending this level of income on rental costs is unaffordable. We've been speaking to people experiencing this, as well as hearing what it is like for landlords. For Manchester University student Jess Walmsley, the scarcity of housing has been a major challenge. The 21-year-old said she and her friends began looking for a house for their third year of study back in January and February but ""there were hardly any places left this year"". ""You really have to be on it and look every day,"" she said. ""We were left with expensive or bad quality houses but luckily a student dropped out so we got a good deal."" Ms Walmsley pays Â£87 a week per person for a four-bedroom house, excluding bills. She said it was now common for people to start looking for houses for the next academic year as early as October - just a month into term. Her housemates have also been cutting down on using the tumble dryer and shopping a lot more at Iceland to reduce costs. ""It's a tough process, I've been working all of the summer but I feel lucky to be eligible for the maximum loan because otherwise, it would be so hard to manage,"" Ms Walmsley added. Data seen by the BBC, supplied by property market consultancy Dataloft, suggests that people under 30 are spending more of their earnings on rent than other working-age groups. London has the highest rents, according to the data. However, many of the places where affordability has worsened since the pandemic are in locations such as Rotherham, Bolton and Dudley. Shannon Waine, 31, and Oliver Kimber, 28, have had to move 45 minutes outside of Cheltenham with their 10-month-old baby Mhairi, to find affordable rental accommodation. Although Ms Waine is a little older than the people examined in our data, her experience shows life isn't getting any easier for this cohort. Shannon Waine and her family are now paying Â£175 more each month After applying for 20 different houses in their price range in Cheltenham, Ms Waine said she had to look further afield. After six weeks, she found a house in Bidford-on-Avon in Warwickshire for Â£825 a month - Â£175 higher than their previous house. ""We used to pay Â£650 a month but there was no longer anything in that price bracket as there is just so much demand for two beds in Cheltenham now,"" she told the BBC. The family have moved in with relatives twice during their search. ""It's been incredibly stressful, not knowing where we'll be and with a 10-month-old daughter has not been easy through no fault of our own,"" she said. ""Unless you have family support I don't know how people can cope - there's nowhere near enough council houses and it feels like it's all backwards."" The family has also had to borrow money to afford the cost of moving house in six trips from Cheltenham to Warwickshire. Colin Hayman, a private landlord from Norwich, says he does have sympathy for tenants facing spiralling rents. But Mr Hayman, who's 61, says he's also frustrated at how landlords are ""always painted as the bad guy"". Colin Hayman says landlords have good reasons for increasing rents. ""Of course I have sympathy for renters, don't get me wrong,"" he told the BBC. ""But from a landlord's perspective there are good reasons for increasing rents which are being ignored, including changes in tax laws in respect of buy-to-let mortgage payments."" Mr Hayman, who has a small portfolio of properties in north-east England, says there are also changes coming in which make it increasingly difficult to make an income from being a landlord. These include new regulations to make properties more energy efficient. ""It's expensive to achieve the new standards,"" he says. ""For many landlords, it's simply not viable to keep their properties as it's costing too much."" Mr Hayman says many landlords are being forced out of the market. ""They are selling up now whilst property prices are high, thus reducing supply of rental stock and pushing prices up further,"" ""The government likes to show it is pro-tenant but everything they are doing is anti-landlord.""

Michael Gove backs Rishi Sunak leadership bid,"Rishi Sunak is trailing behind Liz Truss in the polls Michael Gove has said he will back Rishi Sunak to be the next Conservative Party leader, saying he has what the job requires. The ex-levelling up secretarywrote in The Times,externalrival Liz Truss's tax policies would put business executives before the poorest in society, calling the plans a ""holiday from reality"". He also said he himself did not expect to return to frontbench politics. It comes as Mr Sunak unveils plans he says will help British motorists. The former chancellor is battling it out with Foreign Secretary Ms Truss to replace outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson as the leader of the Tories. The result will be announced on 5 September. A number of cabinet members have publicly backed Ms Truss, who is also the bookmakers' favourite. What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? How accurate are Tory leadership polls? What are policy flashpoints for the next PM? Mr Gove backed Kemi Badenoch earlier in the contest, but writing on Saturday he said he was now in favour of Mr Sunak, raising doubts over Ms Truss's plans to deal with soaring prices and living costs. He said: ""Proposed cuts to national insurance would favour the wealthy, and changes to corporation tax apply to big businesses, not small entrepreneurs. I cannot see how safeguarding the stock options of FTSE 100 executives should ever take precedence over supporting the poorest in our society, but at a time of want it cannot be the right priority."" He went on: ""And here I am deeply concerned that the framing of the leadership debate by many has been a holiday from reality. The answer to the cost-of-living crisis cannot be simply to reject further 'handouts' and cut tax."" Mr Gove said the tax hikes brought in by Mr Sunak as chancellor had been ""a consequence of Covid, not Rishi's inner preferences"". ""I know what the job requires. And Rishi has it,"" he said. Mr Gove added he did not plan to return to frontbench politics himself, writing: ""I do not expect to be in government again. But it was the privilege of my life to spend 11 years in the cabinet under three prime ministers."" Mr Gove missed out in his own leadership bids in 2016 and 2019 and was most recently sacked as Levelling Up Secretary after publicly telling Mr Johnson to quit as prime minister ahead of his ultimate resignation. The Sunak campaign welcomed Mr Gove's backing, with a spokeswoman saying: ""Delighted to have the support of a party and Cabinet veteran who has intellectual heft and shown the radical reforming zeal in every job he has had, that we now so desperately need."" Meanwhile, Mr Sunak promised to tackle the ""war on motorists"" if he became prime minister - describing smart motorways as ""unsafe"" and pledging to stop any new ones being built. He also said he would clamp down on rogue parking fines and review some of the neighbourhoods that have been designated as ""low traffic areas"" in recent years. Mr Sunak pledged to introduce a transition to electric vehicles without punishing drivers, while also delivering a ""rural rollout action plan"" to ensure countryside communities were not left behind. Liz Truss received criticism from Mr Gove over her plans to cut tax Ms Truss appears to be the frontrunner in the polls and has been backed by senior Conservatives colleagues including Nadhim Zahawi, ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey, Sajid Javid, Jacob Rees-Mogg, Nadine Dorries, along with former leadership candidates Suella Braverman and Tom Tugendhat. Mr Sunak was recently questioned during a recent Sky interview as to why he was unable to win the public support of close colleagues, other than his main backer, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps. The two leadership candidates appeared at a hustings in Manchester on Friday evening - answering questions in front of party members. Ms Truss spoke about her plan to lift the ban on new grammar schools, saying she wanted everyone ""right across the country"" to have the choice to enlist their children at one. She went on to criticise the Mayor of Greater Manchester, calling Andy Burnham the ""miserabilist mayor... who doesn't want opportunities"" for people in the city. Mr Sunak used the event to share his plans on rolling out private-sector style ""surgical hubs"" across the country in the NHS and he also criticised the UK's foreign policy.

Kobe Bryant widow 'blindsided' by crash photo leak,"Vanessa Bryant arrives at the federal courthouse in Los Angeles on Friday Kobe Bryant's widow has testified that she had panic attacks after learning that photos of the helicopter crash that killed her husband and daughter were taken and shared. Vanessa Bryant is suing Los Angeles County after first responders allegedly circulated pictures from the accident. ""I expected them to have more compassion,"" she told jurors at her invasion of privacy trial. Mrs Bryant, 40, is seeking unspecified millions for her emotional distress. Her husband, basketball legend Kobe Bryant, 41, daughter Gianna, 13, and six family friends died when their helicopter crashed in California in January 2020. A report by the Los Angeles Times claiming county employees took photos at the crash site and shared them with others has enraged the victims' families. Last November, the county agreed to pay $2.5m (Â£2.1m) over the emotional distress caused to two families who lost relatives in the crash - but Mrs Bryant refused to settle. Her federal lawsuit was made alongside Chris Chester, who lost his wife Sarah and daughter Payton in the crash. Sobbing on the witness stand on Friday, Mrs Bryant recalled being at home with her other children when she read the LA Times story. ""I bolted out of the house and I ran to the side of the house so the girls couldn't see me. I wanted to runâ¦ down the block and just scream,"" she said. Mrs Bryant said she had felt ""blindsided, devastated, hurt and betrayed"" by news of the leak and ""[lives] in fear every day of... having these images pop up"" on social media. ""I don't ever want to see these photographs,"" she said. ""I want to remember my husband and my daughter the way they were."" LA officers took Kobe Bryant crash photos - sheriff Bryant widow sues LA police over 'graphic images' Kobe Bryant's wife first heard of his death online Jurors at the trial have heard how sheriff's deputies and firefighters took gruesome cell phone photos at the accident site and showed them to others, including at a bar and a gala event. These employees ""poured salt in an open wound and rubbed it in"" with their actions, Mrs Bryant's lawyer Luis Li said during opening statements last week. But a lawyer for the county pushed back, saying ""site photography is essential"" and that the photos had not been posted anywhere publicly. ""They're not online, they're not in the media, they've never even been seen by the plaintiffs themselves,"" J Mira Hashmall said. Mrs Bryant was the final witness for the prosecution and the defence will argue its case next.

Nicky Campbell school was 'cesspit of sadism',"Kenneth attended all levels of the school, including the senior school A former pupil of Edinburgh Academy has told the BBC that the school was ""a cesspit of sadism and paedophilia"". Kenneth said he was targeted for frequent, vicious beatings ""usually with a sporting implement called a clacken which is like a large wooden bat"". He described his time at the private school as ""hell on earth"". Kenneth said he had decided to speak out after broadcaster Nicky Campbell told how he too was abused there. An 83-year old retired teacher from the school is currently fighting extradition from South Africa but, according to court documents, has admitted abusing schoolboys in Edinburgh. Nicky Campbell teacher admits abusing schoolboys Nicky Campbell's former teacher fights extradition Nicky Campbell: School abuse still haunts me Nicky Campbell: Abuse would have crushed my parents Nicky Campbell is one of a number of former pupils who have made allegations about the man who taught at Fettes College and Edinburgh Academy in the 1970s. Kenneth, 62, was at Edinburgh Academy from 1965 to 1978. He described how his beatings started when he was aged 10 or 11. At first he said the ""sadistic and brutal treatment"" was meted out by one particular teacher in the prep school. ""We all lived in fear,"" he said. When he moved to the upper school he found there were several more teachers and staff members who physically and sexually assaulted pupils. Once, after having thrown a snowball, he was punched so hard in the kidneys by a teacher that he had to go home from school. On another occasion, he said, a groundsman had stroked his leg in a changing room before inviting him back to his home. Kenneth said he refused and made a complaint after which the groundsman was simply moved to a different part of the school. ""I'm grateful to Nicky Campbell because he opened up the door for me, allowed me to step through into the light, or towards the light at least, and put some of that darkness behind me,"" Kenneth said. Campbell told listeners to BBC Radio 5 Live that the abuse he endured at Edinburgh Academy had had a ""profound effect"" on his life. This video can not be played For the first time Nicky Campbell discusses the abuse he received at school The broadcaster decided to speak out after hearing another BBC podcast, In Dark Corners, which investigated abuse at Britain's private schools. Kenneth said there was a ""culture of violence"" at Edinburgh Academy and that he was routinely singled out to be assaulted. He said the violence was far more extreme and regular than would have been expected under the law which allowed corporal punishment in Scottish state schools until 1987 and private schools until 1998. Things were so bad, he said, that he took to wearing five or six pairs of underpants to protect himself. ""Eventually they found out and I started to get beaten on the bare buttocks,"" he added. ""I can't ever remember receiving detention or 100 lines. It was always straight to maximum punishment."" Kenneth was at Edinburgh Academy from 1965 to 1978 The worst days, Kenneth said, were when he was told early on in the class that he was going to be beaten at the end of the lesson. ""I remember my legs quaking, I remember shaking and just knowing it was coming,"" he said. Kenneth also spoke about a teacher who insisted it was school policy for the boys not to wear underpants under their rugby shorts. ""He would march down the row of boys and pull forward the underpants to look and see,"" he said. ""If we did have underpants on we had to go and get changed and come back. I was certainly very disturbed by that."" Eventually, in his mid-teens, Kenneth said he attempted to take his own life. ""A key part of that was the fear of school,"" he said. He said he left the school with ""zero self-confidence, zero self-worth"" and still suffers from ""stress and anxiety."" He added that he had spent much of his adult life avoiding Edinburgh because of the traumatic memories it stirred up. ""Whenever I saw an Edinburgh Academy school uniform or passed the school, I found that after that I had a series of sleepless nights, nightmares,"" he explained. Nicky Campbell (pictured as a child) has spoken about his experience of abuse at school in the 1970s Kenneth has been contacted in recent weeks by several other former Edinburgh Academy pupils who witnessed or suffered abuse, several of whom have described how they recalled him being targeted. He said the school was due for a reckoning. ""It's like a company now that's vastly wealthy that made all its fortune from the slave trade. They can't simply deny that past and say, no, no, we didn't do anything,"" he said. ""They need to make reparations. They need to seek forgiveness. ""I think the floodgates may open soon,"" he added, explaining that he wants a personal apology, compensation and to ensure that such abuse is never repeated. ""It's nonsense to suggest just a sorry letter is going to make things all right,"" he said. ""I mean, they blighted my life. It's cost me many relationships. ""I was a precocious, happy little child until the beatings started. And I turned into this terrified little boy. Home was my refuge and school was just this hell."" Kenneth added: ""I urge anybody, not just those at the academy, but other private schools and indeed any state schools to come forward when you're ready and tell your story. ""You will be believed now. Don't be afraid of that, because we all have to act together to ensure that this kind of thing can never, ever happen again."" In relation to the extradition of the former teacher, South Africa approved the move in 2020. However,he lodged an appeal which is due to be heard in October. The South African court documents reveal that the original warrant for his extradition related to seven Scottish charges - six of lewd, indecent and libidinous practices and behaviour and one of indecent assault. He is alleged to have sexually assaulted four boys at Edinburgh Academy between 1969 and 1973 and to have sexually assaulted three boys at Fettes College between 1974 and 1976. The ages of the boys mentioned range from seven to 14. The man is now living in a gated retirement community in Cape Town. Kenneth's lawyer, Laura Connor of Thompsons Solicitors, said her client's bravery along with that of other former Edinburgh Academy pupils, had ""exposed a shameful regime of extreme violence and sexual abuse meted out to children."" Ms Connor said her firm intended to pursue legal action against the school and urged the management ""to deal with the cases, act honourably and accept responsibility for this shameful situation"". In a statement, Edinburgh Academy said it was ""appalled by such behaviour"" and apologised ""wholeheartedly"" to those concerned. ""We deeply regret what has happened in the past and would encourage anyone who has been the victim of abuse to contact Police Scotland,"" it said. The school reiterated a previous reassurance that things had changed since the 1970s, insisting it now had robust safeguarding measures in place ""with child protection absolutely core to the ethos of the academy."" The statement added that the school had worked closely with relevant authorities including Police Scotland and the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry and would continue to do so. Fettes previously said it would be inappropriate to comment on a live case. It has also offered a ""full and unreserved apology"" to those who suffered abuse while at the school. Kenneth's name has been changed to protect his identity. Information and support for those affected by abuseis available at BBC Action Line.

Breakthrough over potentially harmful chemicals used in make-up,"PFAS are used in makeup and pharmaceutical products because of their water-resistant properties Chemists have identified how to destroy ""forever chemicals"" in a low-cost way for the first time, new research says. Scientists have linked exposure to the substances, known as PFAS, at certain levels toserious health risks,external, including cancer and birth defects. Their resistance to water, oil and stains make them highly useful. PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday objects from frying pans to make-up. But it is these properties that make them so difficult to destroy. PFAS stands for poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances. There are around 4,500 of these fluorine-based compounds and they are found in almost every dwelling on Earth in products including food packaging, non-stick cookware, rain gear, adhesives, paper and paints. They have been identifiedin low levels in rainwaterglobally - but if they infiltrate water or soil in high level, they can become a serious concern. Research remains ongoing,externalto determine how different levels of exposure can lead to various health effects. ""There is an association between exposure and adverse outcomes in every major organ system in the human body,"" Elsie Sunderland, professor of environmental chemistry at Harvard University, tells BBC News. Existing methods to destroy PFAS, such as incineration, have not been very successful - they can be prohibitively expensive or have been associated with local contamination. New research, from scientists at Northwestern University, US claims to have done the ""seemingly impossible"" and destroyed PFAS using low temperature and cheap products. This could be very useful in helping communities suffering from high-level contamination, according to Prof Sunderland, who is not part of the research team. The reason PFAS have historically been so difficult to destroy is because they contain many carbon and fluorine bonds - the strongest bonds in organic chemistry. But it is these bonds which means they can repel liquids - known as omniphobic - and makes them very useful for the pharmaceutical and food industries. The chemicals that linger for decades in your blood PFAS in rainwater exceed safe levels The race to replace persistent chemicals in our homes The research team, led by Brittany Trang, identified a new mechanism to break down the PFAS by using a common chemical called sodium hydroxide - which is used to make household products like soap or painkillers. They targeted a group of weaker charged oxygen atoms which sit at the end of the long tail of carbon-fluorine bonds. The process effectively ""decapitated the head group from the tail"" and the PFAS began to fall apart, leaving only harmless products. Ms Trang says the results are ""exciting because of how simple â yet unrecognized â our solution is"". ""This could be a breakthrough if it is low cost,"" chemicals policy lead and fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Camilla Alexander-White, tells BBC News. PFAS are in hundreds of household items The team of scientists hope that with further research PFAS could be filtered from drinking water and this new method applied to destroy the contaminants. However, treatment of high concentrations of PFAS is only one part of the solution. With PFAS remaining in production it can continue tobuild up at low levels,externalin fish and other wildlife as it cannot be broken down naturally very easily. Dr Alexander-White says that PFAS should only be used in products and processes that are vital for society and for which there is no alternative. This new method was applied to the 10 most prominent types of PFAS, but theUS Environment Protection Agency has identified,externalmore than 12,000. William Dichtel, one of the co-authors and professor of chemistry at Northwestern remains hopeful: ""There are other classes that don't have the same Achilles' heel, but each one will have its own weakness.""

Growing share of under-30s pay unaffordable rent,"Megan Stephens and Richard Stranks had their rent increased to 66% of their London wages People under 30 are facing a growing cost-of-renting crisis, new figures seen by the BBC suggest. Four in 10 of this age group are now spending more than 30% of their pay on rent, according to the data - a five-year high. Experts say spending this level of income on rental costs is unaffordable. While London has the highest rents, affordability has worsened in towns such as Rotherham and Bolton for young people since the pandemic. The data suggests under-30s spend more of their earnings on rent than other working-age groups. The figures cover 150,000 young people and were supplied by property market consultancy Dataloft. Number of holiday-let homes up 40% in three years Prices rising faster than wages Megan Stephens and Richard Stranks, from London, had their rent put up from half their wages to two-thirds of them. ""We were not expecting such a big increase... that was the real punch in the gut,"" said Mr Stranks. It comes as younger people's finances are being squeezed, amid rapidly rising living and rental costs, anda fall in real incomes. Under-30s are less likely to have dependents and are sometimes more willing to move around, so could feel able to pay higher rents, experts told the BBC. But Nick Gallent, a professor of housing and planning at University College London, warned that young people being locked into expensive renting now could cause future problems. Young renters faced a difficult winter, he said, amid rising inflation and energy bills, describing the situation as ""horrendous"". ""Despite all the economic problems, house prices and rents continue to nudge upwards,"" he said. What is inflation and why are prices rising so quickly? In one in six local authorities across England, Wales and Scotland for which there was enough data, the majority of young renters were spending more than 30% of their earnings on their housing, according to analysis of Dataloft figures for the year to the end of June. The least affordable areas for young people are concentrated in London. However, many of the places where rent affordability has dropped the most since the Covid pandemic are in locations such as Rotherham, Bolton, Salford, Walsall and Dudley. Elton Papri, a lettings manager at a Dudley-based branch of estate agent Shipways, said under 30s were ""struggling at the moment"" as there were not enough homes on the market. Renters were being pushed to offer over the asking price as people were bidding more than the listed price just to secure a property. ""They shouldn't be offering Â£100 more if they cannot meet that requirement, but then if they don't they are going to miss out on that property so it's a hard situation,"" said Mr Papri. Lettings manager Elton Papri, 30, found it difficult to find somewhere to rent for himself The trade body for estate agents, Propertymark, said rents were increasing due to fewer houses being on the market. This was because many landlords have decided to sell properties because of rising taxes, charges and maintenance costs, it said. Chris Norris, director of policy and campaigns at the National Residential Landlords Association, told BBC Radio 5 Live his members' costs had increased ""exponentially"". He said an increase in available housing was needed to relieve pressures on renters, adding: ""Above all we need to make sure we're getting more housing out there."" Shortage of homes to rent leads to bidding wars Danisha Kazi, senior economist at research and campaign group Positive Money, said underlying structural features in the market were also to blame. ""Supply shortage is not a good enough explanation because it's a long-term trend - rent as a proportion of income has been rising since the 1980s for all age groups, with younger cohorts particularly hit hard,"" she said. She said housing policy reforms since the 1980s, including an end to rent controls, making evictions easier and the introduction of Right-to-Buy, had significantly shifted the balance of power from tenants to landlords. ""We also don't have alternatives and people are heavily dependent on the private rental sector, which hasdoubled in size since the early 2000s,external,"" she said. London couple Ms Stephens and Mr Stranks decided to move out of their house-share last June, as they felt like they had no alternative. ""My income did grow a little bit, but not by as much as the landlord increased the price,"" said Ms Stephens. The couple have now found cheaper accommodation as property guardians of a former local authority office block in Newham, east London. They may have to move out with a month's notice, but they said the move was an easy decision. ""It means that I can save, and that's a big thing for me"" says Ms Stephens. Property guardians move with the times to save cash Housing campaigners Generation Rent warned the situation for younger renters was ""dire"" and called for the government to freeze rents and pause evictions. The Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities said it recognised people were facing cost-of-living pressures and that paying rent was likely to be a tenant's biggest monthly expense. ""That is why we have taken action through our Â£37bn support package to help households with rising costs,"" it said. The government also said thatits plans announced in Junewould provide renters with a ""fairer deal"". The proposals would ban landlords from evicting tenants in England without giving them a reason, and give renters more power to challenge unjustified rent increases and poor conditions. The analysis of renters under 30 years old for the year to the end of June 2022 is based on records from 150,000 tenants collected by major tenant referencing companies and aggregated by Dataloft. It excludes income outliers, including those earning less than Â£10,000 because they are likely to be supported by other sources of income or by guarantors. Across all the age groups, Dataloft has data for over 400,000 records for the year to the end of June and estimates it covers 40% of the rental market in England, Scotland and Wales. Many housing organisations regard spending more than 30% of gross income to be unaffordable and theOffice for National Statistics has also used the benchmark,externalin its affordability analysis.

Russia has ""no moral right to sit at the G20 while its
aggression in Ukraine persists"", a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office has said. ""We welcome Indonesia's efforts to ensure that the impacts
of Russia's war are considered in G20 meetings, as well as
indications that Ukraine may be represented by President
(Volodymyr) Zelensky,"" they added. As we reported earlier, Indonesian president Joko Widodo hassaid that Russia's Vladimir Putin plans to attend the G20 summitin Bali in on 15 and 16 November. Throughout the war, photographers have been capturing images showing the realities of the conflict and attempts to live everyday life while the fighting goes on. Here is a selection of images taken today in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian soldiers near the frontline in Zaporizhzhia Region A woman was killed when a building of the Kharkiv National Technical University was heavily damaged by a Russian missile strike United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres meets politicians and members of the public on a visit to the Ukrainian port city Odesa Russia has put weaponry and equipment it says it has seized in Ukraine on show at an exhibition in the city of Rostov In a moment of respite from the war, Ukrainians in the western city of Lviv have been celebrating Saviour of the Apple Feast Day The director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has welcomed recent statements that both Ukraine and Russia support a potential IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia power plant. ""There is an urgent need to lower the tension"" between the two parties,"" Grossisaid in a statement,external. The agency said he would lead the mission himself, and that it was ""in active consultations with all parties"". The IAEA has not been able to visit the power plant since before the conflict began half a year ago. The agency said two of the plant's six reactors were still operating, and added that Ukraine had informed it that two other reactors would be maintained in cold shutdown. Ukrainian forces are inflicting losses on their Russian enemies in ""all directions where active hostilities continue"", according to the regular evening update from the Ukrainian armed forces. The dispatch says Russian attacks were repelled in a number of places, including around Bakhmut. It says the Kremlin's troops ""suffered losses and ran away"" following a failed effort to break through Ukrainian defences in areas near the city of Slovyansk. It also accuses Russia of strikes on civilian infrastructure in the Kharkiv region, where local authorities have reported at least 20 deaths in recent days. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the information in the report. Hostilities remain concentrated in the east Rafael Grossi, from Argentina, has been director general of the IAEA since 2019 We've been reporting that Russia's President Putin and France's President Macron have agreed on the need for inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But what is the IAEA? It was set up in 1957 as an autonomous body of the United Nations and is based in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Over the past few years, the IAEA has shifted its emphasis from the promotion of atomic energy to aiming to ensure nuclear safety - though that has long been one of its roles. The IAEA was given the specific role of defining and inspecting safeguards when the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons - a landmark deal aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology - came into force in 1970, signed by 188 states. Hans Blix was head of the IAEA between 1981 and 1997 before becoming the UN's chief weapon's inspector in Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction When the Chernobyl nuclear power disaster happened in the USSR in 1986, it was the IAEA that investigated and reported on both the immediate consequences and the long-term effects. Since the 1990s the IAEA has inspected - or been prevented from doing so - nuclear facilities in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and North Korea, and investigated the core meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, which followed an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Russian gas supplies to the European Union look set to be disrupted later this month, following an announcement that the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline is to be closed for maintenance for three days. The conduit will close from 31 August to 2 September, says Russian state-controlled energy firm Gazprom. The pipeline has already been running at just 20% capacity during an energy standoff between Moscow and Europe, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Western nations have repeatedly accused the Kremlin of using fuel supplies as a political weapon. The latest round of maintenance was unscheduled, Reuters news agency reported. Read more:Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Our Europe editor, Paul Kirby, has been speaking to nuclear safety experts to gauge just how dangerous the situation at Zaporizhzhia is. Modern nuclear power plants are designed to withstand shocks of all kinds - from earthquakes to airliners crashing into them. One of the experts' chief concerns is that Ukrainian staff - which have carried on working despite the Russian army's takeover of the power plant in early March - could eventually succumb to stress and fatigue. A letter signed by dozens of employees at the plant on Thursday made a reference to this possibility. ""We can professionally control nuclear fission,"" it said, ""but we are helpless in the face of people's irresponsibility and madness."" Read the piecehere. Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk defends his world heavyweight titles against Britain's Anthony Joshua tomorrow - and will then return to defending his country, his team says. The Ukrainian beat Joshua in London last September to take his world titles but any basking in the glory was interrupted five months later when Russia invaded his country. Usyk was in London taking part in negotiations over the rematch with Joshua when the attacks on his home city of Kyiv began. His family were at home celebrating his daughter's birthday and cancellation of international flights into Ukraine meant it took him three days to get back. Like most Ukrainian men, the 35-year-old started to help with the war campaign, joining a community self-defence organisation. But he returned to boxing with the blessing of President Volodymyr Zelensky, keen for the Ukrainian people to see their flag on the international sporting stage. And Usyk's promoter, Alexander Krassyuk, tells BBC Sport that after this weekend's fight ""he will return to territorial defence, there is no hesitation about it"". You can read more here Hugo BachegaBBC News, Odesa UN secretary-general AntÃ³nio Guterres says the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, is ""very confusing"", as Russia and Ukraine blame each other for shelling the site, tensions that have raised fears of a catastrophe. Guterres' call for the creation of a demilitarised zone around the complex has been rejected by Moscow, which claims it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"". He responded in a BBC interview in Odesa by saying ""there's a long way for serious discussion"", without getting into detail. Similarly, there has been no deal to give access to monitors from the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But Guterres hinted at ""discreet diplomacy"" and referenced the deal that allowed Ukraine to resume its grain exports. The agreement, brokered by the UN and Turkey, came after a months-long blockade imposed by Russia that worsened a global food crisis, and is the only diplomatic breakthrough in this conflict so far. Read more here. The UN chief, who's visiting Ukraine, has warned Russia against redirecting power from the Zaporizhzhia plant Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Let's have a quick look back at what's been happening today. Russia has submitted a letter to the UN Security Council detailing the ""provocations"" that it accuses Ukraine of plotting at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Both sides have been accused of planning a ""false flag"" incident there: a staged disaster which could be blamed on the enemy in an attempt to raise the stakes of the war. The Russian mission to the UN alleges that the Ukrainians want to cause ""what they believe to be a minor accident"", consisting of a radiation leak, which could see Russia accused of ""nuclear terrorism"". The letter denies that Russian troops are storing weapons on site. It repeats an allegation that the Ukrainians have been shelling the plant. Kyiv accuses Russia of doing the same thing. Dominic BaileyBBC News Visual Journalism Team Satellite images show a long queue of traffic in Crimea heading towards Russia, just a few days after explosions struck a military airbase on the peninsula. The high resolution images captured on 12 August by the US-based Planet Labs, do not show the full extent of the tailback, but clearly shows dozens of lorries and cars queuing for about a mile on the eastbound carriageway near Kerch. The road leads to the bridge built across the Kerch Strait after the Russian annexation. There were several explosions at the Saky military base near Novofedorivka on the peninsula's western coast on 9 August. Videos on social media appeared to show visitors fleeing from a beach as smoke rose in the distance. Despite the war, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014 has continued to be a popular destination with Russian tourists. We've got a bit more information now on the latest package of military aid being promised to Ukraine by Washington. The US Defense Department's $775m (Â£656m) package will include high-mobility artillery rocket systems, artillery and mine-clearing equipment. ""We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that's what we're doing with this package,"" AFP reports a senior official as saying. He also says Russian forces are showing a ""total lack of progress on the battlefield in Ukraine. The US has made regular pledges of financial and military aid for Ukraine since Russia's invasion began. Today's announcement is significantly smaller than some have been - on 19 May, for example, the Senate approved a package worth $40bn. Putin is expected to appear in person, as is China's President Xi, says the Indonesian leader Russia's President Putin and China's President Xi will both attend the G20 meeting of world leaders in November, says the leader of host nation Indonesia. It was not known whether the pair would attend the summit in Bali, due to international tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and efforts by China's President Xi to limit trips as a Covid-19 measure. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo told Bloomberg he's expecting both men to appear in person. A White House spokesperson declined to confirm the travel plans of President Biden, but said if Putin appeared, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky should take up his invitation to attend, too. The US is providing a $775m military aid package to Ukraine, the Pentagon announces. It will include funding for rocket systems and howitzers, a spokesman says. Paul Myers and the BBC Disinformation Team Footage has

of the invasion of Ukraine. Moscow insists it's working to protect the facility. Russian military vehicles bearing the Z invasion symbol are seen parked at the left During his visit to the city of Odesa, UN chief AntÃ³nio Guterres also said a lot needed to be done to guarantee that the world had access to Ukrainian grain, and Russian food products and fertilisers. ""This is an agreement between two parties locked in bitter conflict. It is unprecedented in scope and scale. But there is still a long way to go on many fronts,"" he said. He asked rich countries to help those most in need during the food crisis. ""It is time for massive and generous support, so developing countries can purchase the food from this and other ports - and people can buy it."" Guterres said developing countries needed help to purchase such grain and called for unimpeded access to global markets for Russian food and fertilisers which are not subject to sanctions. He also warned that without enough fertilisers this year, there may not be enough food next year. Without fertiliser in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023 AntÃ³nio Guterres, UN Secretary General Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have spoken over the phone and discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. In a statement following the call, the Kremlin said that Putin ""stressed that the systematic shelling by the Ukrainian military"" of the power plant ""creates the danger of a sizeable disaster"". Both presidents agreed on the need to send a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the power station to assess the real state of affairs and the Kremlin said the Russian side would ""provide the inspectors of the agency with the necessary assistance"". The Elysee Palace also put out a statement, saying that Macron had ""once again underlined his concern at the risks posed by the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant"". The two presidents are set to talk to each other again in the coming days after discussions between the technical teams have taken place, and ahead of the deployment of the mission. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Growing share of under-30s pay unaffordable rentThe proportion of under-30s spending a third of their pay on rent is at a five-year high, data suggests.","Megan Stephens and Richard Stranks had their rent increased to 66% of their London wages People under 30 are facing a growing cost-of-renting crisis, new figures seen by the BBC suggest. Four in 10 of this age group are now spending more than 30% of their pay on rent, according to the data - a five-year high. Experts say spending this level of income on rental costs is unaffordable. While London has the highest rents, affordability has worsened in towns such as Rotherham and Bolton for young people since the pandemic. The data suggests under-30s spend more of their earnings on rent than other working-age groups. The figures cover 150,000 young people and were supplied by property market consultancy Dataloft. Number of holiday-let homes up 40% in three years Prices rising faster than wages Megan Stephens and Richard Stranks, from London, had their rent put up from half their wages to two-thirds of them. ""We were not expecting such a big increase... that was the real punch in the gut,"" said Mr Stranks. It comes as younger people's finances are being squeezed, amid rapidly rising living and rental costs, anda fall in real incomes. Under-30s are less likely to have dependents and are sometimes more willing to move around, so could feel able to pay higher rents, experts told the BBC. But Nick Gallent, a professor of housing and planning at University College London, warned that young people being locked into expensive renting now could cause future problems. Young renters faced a difficult winter, he said, amid rising inflation and energy bills, describing the situation as ""horrendous"". ""Despite all the economic problems, house prices and rents continue to nudge upwards,"" he said. What is inflation and why are prices rising so quickly? In one in six local authorities across England, Wales and Scotland for which there was enough data, the majority of young renters were spending more than 30% of their earnings on their housing, according to analysis of Dataloft figures for the year to the end of June. The least affordable areas for young people are concentrated in London. However, many of the places where rent affordability has dropped the most since the Covid pandemic are in locations such as Rotherham, Bolton, Salford, Walsall and Dudley. Elton Papri, a lettings manager at a Dudley-based branch of estate agent Shipways, said under 30s were ""struggling at the moment"" as there were not enough homes on the market. Renters were being pushed to offer over the asking price as people were bidding more than the listed price just to secure a property. ""They shouldn't be offering Â£100 more if they cannot meet that requirement, but then if they don't they are going to miss out on that property so it's a hard situation,"" said Mr Papri. Lettings manager Elton Papri, 30, found it difficult to find somewhere to rent for himself The trade body for estate agents, Propertymark, said rents were increasing due to fewer houses being on the market. This was because many landlords have decided to sell properties because of rising taxes, charges and maintenance costs, it said. Chris Norris, director of policy and campaigns at the National Residential Landlords Association, told BBC Radio 5 Live his members' costs had increased ""exponentially"". He said an increase in available housing was needed to relieve pressures on renters, adding: ""Above all we need to make sure we're getting more housing out there."" Shortage of homes to rent leads to bidding wars Danisha Kazi, senior economist at research and campaign group Positive Money, said underlying structural features in the market were also to blame. ""Supply shortage is not a good enough explanation because it's a long-term trend - rent as a proportion of income has been rising since the 1980s for all age groups, with younger cohorts particularly hit hard,"" she said. She said housing policy reforms since the 1980s, including an end to rent controls, making evictions easier and the introduction of Right-to-Buy, had significantly shifted the balance of power from tenants to landlords. ""We also don't have alternatives and people are heavily dependent on the private rental sector, which hasdoubled in size since the early 2000s,external,"" she said. London couple Ms Stephens and Mr Stranks decided to move out of their house-share last June, as they felt like they had no alternative. ""My income did grow a little bit, but not by as much as the landlord increased the price,"" said Ms Stephens. The couple have now found cheaper accommodation as property guardians of a former local authority office block in Newham, east London. They may have to move out with a month's notice, but they said the move was an easy decision. ""It means that I can save, and that's a big thing for me"" says Ms Stephens. Property guardians move with the times to save cash Housing campaigners Generation Rent warned the situation for younger renters was ""dire"" and called for the government to freeze rents and pause evictions. The Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities said it recognised people were facing cost-of-living pressures and that paying rent was likely to be a tenant's biggest monthly expense. ""That is why we have taken action through our Â£37bn support package to help households with rising costs,"" it said. The government also said thatits plans announced in Junewould provide renters with a ""fairer deal"". The proposals would ban landlords from evicting tenants in England without giving them a reason, and give renters more power to challenge unjustified rent increases and poor conditions. The analysis of renters under 30 years old for the year to the end of June 2022 is based on records from 150,000 tenants collected by major tenant referencing companies and aggregated by Dataloft. It excludes income outliers, including those earning less than Â£10,000 because they are likely to be supported by other sources of income or by guarantors. Across all the age groups, Dataloft has data for over 400,000 records for the year to the end of June and estimates it covers 40% of the rental market in England, Scotland and Wales. Many housing organisations regard spending more than 30% of gross income to be unaffordable and theOffice for National Statistics has also used the benchmark,externalin its affordability analysis.

of Russia's war are considered in G20 meetings, as well as
indications that Ukraine may be represented by President
(Volodymyr) Zelensky,"" they added. As we reported earlier, Indonesian president Joko Widodo hassaid that Russia's Vladimir Putin plans to attend the G20 summitin Bali in on 15 and 16 November. Throughout the war, photographers have been capturing images showing the realities of the conflict and attempts to live everyday life while the fighting goes on. Here is a selection of images taken today in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian soldiers near the frontline in Zaporizhzhia Region A woman was killed when a building of the Kharkiv National Technical University was heavily damaged by a Russian missile strike United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres meets politicians and members of the public on a visit to the Ukrainian port city Odesa Russia has put weaponry and equipment it says it has seized in Ukraine on show at an exhibition in the city of Rostov In a moment of respite from the war, Ukrainians in the western city of Lviv have been celebrating Saviour of the Apple Feast Day The director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has welcomed recent statements that both Ukraine and Russia support a potential IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia power plant. ""There is an urgent need to lower the tension"" between the two parties,"" Grossisaid in a statement,external. The agency said he would lead the mission himself, and that it was ""in active consultations with all parties"". The IAEA has not been able to visit the power plant since before the conflict began half a year ago. The agency said two of the plant's six reactors were still operating, and added that Ukraine had informed it that two other reactors would be maintained in cold shutdown. Ukrainian forces are inflicting losses on their Russian enemies in ""all directions where active hostilities continue"", according to the regular evening update from the Ukrainian armed forces. The dispatch says Russian attacks were repelled in a number of places, including around Bakhmut. It says the Kremlin's troops ""suffered losses and ran away"" following a failed effort to break through Ukrainian defences in areas near the city of Slovyansk. It also accuses Russia of strikes on civilian infrastructure in the Kharkiv region, where local authorities have reported at least 20 deaths in recent days. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the information in the report. Hostilities remain concentrated in the east Rafael Grossi, from Argentina, has been director general of the IAEA since 2019 We've been reporting that Russia's President Putin and France's President Macron have agreed on the need for inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But what is the IAEA? It was set up in 1957 as an autonomous body of the United Nations and is based in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Over the past few years, the IAEA has shifted its emphasis from the promotion of atomic energy to aiming to ensure nuclear safety - though that has long been one of its roles. The IAEA was given the specific role of defining and inspecting safeguards when the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons - a landmark deal aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology - came into force in 1970, signed by 188 states. Hans Blix was head of the IAEA between 1981 and 1997 before becoming the UN's chief weapon's inspector in Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction When the Chernobyl nuclear power disaster happened in the USSR in 1986, it was the IAEA that investigated and reported on both the immediate consequences and the long-term effects. Since the 1990s the IAEA has inspected - or been prevented from doing so - nuclear facilities in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and North Korea, and investigated the core meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, which followed an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Russian gas supplies to the European Union look set to be disrupted later this month, following an announcement that the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline is to be closed for maintenance for three days. The conduit will close from 31 August to 2 September, says Russian state-controlled energy firm Gazprom. The pipeline has already been running at just 20% capacity during an energy standoff between Moscow and Europe, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Western nations have repeatedly accused the Kremlin of using fuel supplies as a political weapon. The latest round of maintenance was unscheduled, Reuters news agency reported. Read more:Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Our Europe editor, Paul Kirby, has been speaking to nuclear safety experts to gauge just how dangerous the situation at Zaporizhzhia is. Modern nuclear power plants are designed to withstand shocks of all kinds - from earthquakes to airliners crashing into them. One of the experts' chief concerns is that Ukrainian staff - which have carried on working despite the Russian army's takeover of the power plant in early March - could eventually succumb to stress and fatigue. A letter signed by dozens of employees at the plant on Thursday made a reference to this possibility. ""We can professionally control nuclear fission,"" it said, ""but we are helpless in the face of people's irresponsibility and madness."" Read the piecehere. Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk defends his world heavyweight titles against Britain's Anthony Joshua tomorrow - and will then return to defending his country, his team says. The Ukrainian beat Joshua in London last September to take his world titles but any basking in the glory was interrupted five months later when Russia invaded his country. Usyk was in London taking part in negotiations over the rematch with Joshua when the attacks on his home city of Kyiv began. His family were at home celebrating his daughter's birthday and cancellation of international flights into Ukraine meant it took him three days to get back. Like most Ukrainian men, the 35-year-old started to help with the war campaign, joining a community self-defence organisation. But he returned to boxing with the blessing of President Volodymyr Zelensky, keen for the Ukrainian people to see their flag on the international sporting stage. And Usyk's promoter, Alexander Krassyuk, tells BBC Sport that after this weekend's fight ""he will return to territorial defence, there is no hesitation about it"". You can read more here Hugo BachegaBBC News, Odesa UN secretary-general AntÃ³nio Guterres says the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, is ""very confusing"", as Russia and Ukraine blame each other for shelling the site, tensions that have raised fears of a catastrophe. Guterres' call for the creation of a demilitarised zone around the complex has been rejected by Moscow, which claims it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"". He responded in a BBC interview in Odesa by saying ""there's a long way for serious discussion"", without getting into detail. Similarly, there has been no deal to give access to monitors from the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But Guterres hinted at ""discreet diplomacy"" and referenced the deal that allowed Ukraine to resume its grain exports. The agreement, brokered by the UN and Turkey, came after a months-long blockade imposed by Russia that worsened a global food crisis, and is the only diplomatic breakthrough in this conflict so far. Read more here. The UN chief, who's visiting Ukraine, has warned Russia against redirecting power from the Zaporizhzhia plant Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Let's have a quick look back at what's been happening today. Russia has submitted a letter to the UN Security Council detailing the ""provocations"" that it accuses Ukraine of plotting at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Both sides have been accused of planning a ""false flag"" incident there: a staged disaster which could be blamed on the enemy in an attempt to raise the stakes of the war. The Russian mission to the UN alleges that the Ukrainians want to cause ""what they believe to be a minor accident"", consisting of a radiation leak, which could see Russia accused of ""nuclear terrorism"". The letter denies that Russian troops are storing weapons on site. It repeats an allegation that the Ukrainians have been shelling the plant. Kyiv accuses Russia of doing the same thing. Dominic BaileyBBC News Visual Journalism Team Satellite images show a long queue of traffic in Crimea heading towards Russia, just a few days after explosions struck a military airbase on the peninsula. The high resolution images captured on 12 August by the US-based Planet Labs, do not show the full extent of the tailback, but clearly shows dozens of lorries and cars queuing for about a mile on the eastbound carriageway near Kerch. The road leads to the bridge built across the Kerch Strait after the Russian annexation. There were several explosions at the Saky military base near Novofedorivka on the peninsula's western coast on 9 August. Videos on social media appeared to show visitors fleeing from a beach as smoke rose in the distance. Despite the war, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014 has continued to be a popular destination with Russian tourists. We've got a bit more information now on the latest package of military aid being promised to Ukraine by Washington. The US Defense Department's $775m (Â£656m) package will include high-mobility artillery rocket systems, artillery and mine-clearing equipment. ""We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that's what we're doing with this package,"" AFP reports a senior official as saying. He also says Russian forces are showing a ""total lack of progress on the battlefield in Ukraine. The US has made regular pledges of financial and military aid for Ukraine since Russia's invasion began. Today's announcement is significantly smaller than some have been - on 19 May, for example, the Senate approved a package worth $40bn. Putin is expected to appear in person, as is China's President Xi, says the Indonesian leader Russia's President Putin and China's President Xi will both attend the G20 meeting of world leaders in November, says the leader of host nation Indonesia. It was not known whether the pair would attend the summit in Bali, due to international tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and efforts by China's President Xi to limit trips as a Covid-19 measure. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo told Bloomberg he's expecting both men to appear in person. A White House spokesperson declined to confirm the travel plans of President Biden, but said if Putin appeared, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky should take up his invitation to attend, too. The US is providing a $775m military aid package to Ukraine, the Pentagon announces. It will include funding for rocket systems and howitzers, a spokesman says. Paul Myers and the BBC Disinformation Team Footage has
emerged,externalwhich shows the interior of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after
Russian troops moved in with their vehicles. Itâs not clear
who filmed the video, or exactly when. The BBC and other journalists have verified the location in which it was
taken, with the help ofanother
video from 2019,external, shot in 3D, which provides a tour of the facility. The older video
is available on a YouTube account connected to the power plant. NPR journalist Geoff Brumfiel shareda string of images,externalwhich show features seen in both
videos, and can be used to confirm the location. Brumfiel says certain details appear in the new footageâ¦ â¦ Which also appeared in the 2019 video giving a tour of the plant. The Russian presence is signalled in the footage with vehicles marked with the letter Z â a symbol
of the invasion of Ukraine. Moscow insists it's working to protect the facility. Russian military vehicles bearing the Z invasion symbol are seen parked at the left During his visit to the city of Odesa, UN chief AntÃ³nio Guterres also said a lot needed to be done to guarantee that the world had access to Ukrainian grain, and Russian food products and fertilisers. ""This is an agreement between two parties locked in bitter conflict. It is unprecedented in scope and scale. But there is still a long way to go on many fronts,"" he said. He asked rich countries to help those most in need during the food crisis. ""It is time for massive and generous support, so developing countries can purchase the food from this and other ports - and people can buy it."" Guterres said developing countries needed help to purchase such grain and called for unimpeded access to global markets for Russian food and fertilisers which are not subject to sanctions. He also warned that without enough fertilisers this year, there may not be enough food next year. Without fertiliser in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023 AntÃ³nio Guterres, UN Secretary General Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have spoken over the phone and discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. In a statement following the call, the Kremlin said that Putin ""stressed that the systematic shelling by the Ukrainian military"" of the power plant ""creates the danger of a sizeable disaster"". Both presidents agreed on the need to send a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the power station to assess the real state of affairs and the Kremlin said the Russian side would ""provide the inspectors of the agency with the necessary assistance"". The Elysee Palace also put out a statement, saying that Macron had ""once again underlined his concern at the risks posed by the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant"". The two presidents are set to talk to each other again in the coming days after discussions between the technical teams have taken place, and ahead of the deployment of the mission. Â© 2025 BBC.

Cineworld shares plunge on bankruptcy fears,"Shares in Cineworld have fallen more than 60% as concerns mount that the world's second largest cinema chain is about to file for bankruptcy. The company, which also owns the Picturehouse chain in the UK, is struggling under $5bn worth of debt. Like other cinema chains, Cineworld was hit hard by the pandemic. Cineworld recently said post-Covid customers levels were lower than expected and blamed ""limited"" film releases. The Wall Street Journal reported,externalthat Cineworld is preparing to file for bankruptcy, sending its share price tumbling. Cineworld has been contacted for comment. The firm had hoped blockbusters such as the latest Bond film, Top Gun: Maverick and Thor: Love And Thunder would draw audiences back after Covid restrictions. But it said earlier this week: ""Despite a gradual recovery of demand since reopening in April 2021, recent admission levels have been below expectations. ""These lower levels of admissions are due to a limited film slate that is anticipated to continue until November 2022 and are expected to negatively impact trading and the group's liquidity position in the near term."" Cineworld has 9,189 screens across more than 750 sites. It operates in 10 countries, including the UK, the US, Poland and Israel, and employs more than 28,000 people. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Cineworld had ""failed to lure back enough movie goers to help pay back its enormous debts"". ""Hopes had been raised that first spies, then superheroes, then fighter pilots would prove to be the magic bullets for the company but there simply haven't been enough blockbusters coming through to to break the spell of misfortune,"" she said. But Peter Williams, a former non-executive director at Cineworld, told the BBC he thought cinema ticket prices were ""too low"". ""I've always felt that the ticket price or headline ticket price is almost too low really. I mean, it is still a very cheap night out,"" he said. He added that while Cineworld is likely to face a major restructure, he believed that it would emerge as ""a viable business"". ""This is a big business and people still want to go out and go to the cinema."" The cinema industry was one of the worst hit sectors during the height of the pandemic with many theatres closed for extended periods or operating at reduced capacity. Cineworld reported a huge loss for the first six months of 2020 after it was forced to temporarily close some cinemas, and movie studios delayed the release of some blockbusters. The cinema giant warned in September 2020 that it might need to raise more money in the event of further coronavirus restrictions or film delays due to Covid-19. Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter Jurassic World Dominion, Top Gun: Maverick, Doctor Strange, Elvis and Minions: The Rise of Gru are among the major releases that have kept audiences coming through the doors at a time when cinemas are desperate to bounce back from their Covid losses. Jurassic World Dominion is one of the biggest box office hits of the year so far But Cineworld's owner argues there still haven't been enough to keep them afloat. They say their admissions are down because Hollywood has released fewer major films than would have been typical in a pre-pandemic summer. Total box office takings this year are down a third, or 32%, compared with the equivalent period in 2019. The number of releases isn't the only factor. Streaming services have posed a threat to cinemas for many years, and the battle for content has become even more aggressive recently. Netflix has spent hundreds of millions of pounds making films like The Gray Man and Red Notice, and releasing them straight into subscribers' homes. As a result, cinemas have had to fight harder to convince customers that leaving their couch to see a movie is worthwhile. The autumn and winter release schedule provides some hope - sequels to the hugely successful Black Panther and the even more successful Avatar will be released between now Christmas. But it's telling that many other big releases are going straight to streaming services. In 2019, Disney released two successful live action remakes: The Lion King and Aladdin.

'Four hours with the militant who murdered my son',"Diane Foley (right) met with Alexanda Kotey (left), one of the members of the Islamic State responsible for her son's death Two men who helped murder American journalist James Foley as part of the Islamic State group's campaign of terror are facing justice in the US. One of themwas sentenced for terror crimes on 19 August. James's mother sat face-to-face with the other. It was a cold morning in Virginia last year when Diane Foley sat opposite the man who kidnapped and helped murder her son, looking him fully in the face as they sat in a nondescript room in the courthouse where he would later be sentenced to life in prison. When she entered the room, Alexanda Kotey was already there, seated amid a flurry of activity and noise from FBI agents and defence lawyers and minders. But when she sat down, ""it felt like it was just me and him. We looked at each other and said 'hello'"". Thoughtful and measured, the weight of emotions from her experience lent a weariness to her voice as she recounted the moment and all that it encapsulated. ""It was not an easy thing to do, but it was important,"" she said. ""Jim would've wanted me to do this."" ""Jim"" was her son, the American journalist James Foley. His murder in 2014 at the hands of a terror cell known as the 'Isis Beatles' reverberated around the world, announcing the barbarity of the group known as Islamic State. The group terrorised large swathes of Iraq and Syria, forcing millions to live under its brutal rule. At the height of its dominance between 2014-2017 it became the most feared terror group in the world. James' death, broadcast on Twitter on 19 August, 2014, has become one of the most enduring and recognisable images in modern times: A young man kneeling in an orange jumpsuit in the desert. A man in a full black mask standing menacingly beside him holding a knife. A beheading carried out on camera. The video was titled ""Message to America."" Seven years on, two ex-Britons - Elshafee El Sheikh, 33, and Kotey, 38 - have been convicted in a US court for their involvement in his murder as part of the Isis terror cell. El Sheikh was sentenced in Virginia on Friday. In April, Kotey was jailed for life, and Diane met him. The four hours she spent with him were, for her, an affirmation of faith, forgiveness and a commitment to what has now become her life's work after the trauma of her son's death - freeing hostages around the world. Who were the jihadists nicknamed the Islamic State 'Beatles'? Islamic State 'Beatle' Alexanda Kotey pleads guilty over US hostage deaths It is not a life Diane, now 72, envisioned for herself. Before James went missing in Syria in 2012, she had been working as a nurse, but in the weeks after his disappearance, she quit her job. It was not the first time he had been kidnapped while reporting. In March 2011 James and other colleagues were kidnapped in Libya by Colonel Muammar Gadaffi's regime, but would be released 44 days later. This time, it would end differently. James left for Syria in October 2012 to report on the growing conflict. Aware of the potential dangers, he kept in regular touch with his family. But by November, Thanksgiving had passed and Diane hadn't heard from her son. It wasn't until later that month that an email appeared in her inbox. It was from James' captors. The terror group said that if the family wanted James back, they had to get the US government to release prominent Muslim prisoners or deliver 100 million Euros. Similar demands were also made to the families of other American hostages the terror cell would kidnap - human rights activists Kayla Mueller and Peter Kassig, and journalist Steven Sotloff. Weeks and months followed but the family were still hopeful James would ""come home by Christmas"", Diane said. The Foleys were told by the US government not to negotiate. According to Diane, they were even threatened with prosecution if they attempted to raise the ransom themselves, though the US State department denied this. Months went by before the Foleys received another message threatening them with James's death in the wake of US airstrikes.  ""He will be executed as a direct result of your country's transgressions towards us,"" it said. She would learn of James's murder from a journalist. ""I thought it was some cruel joke,"" she recalled. In the weeks after James' killing, the terror cell would go on to torture, beat, starve and murder Peter and Steven. Kayla died in 2015 - her murder was never filmed. That year, a US drone strike killed Mohammed Emwazi, the militant seen as the group's ringleader. But it took until 2018 for the two others, Elsheikh and Kotey, to be captured by an American backed Kurdish militia in Syria, and later taken into US custody. Families of those kidnapped pushed for the pair to be extradited to the US and tried in a federal court instead of being sent to the military prison at Guantanamo Bay. ""It was very important to us that these men were tried in America and for them to have a fair trial,"" Diane said. The road to justice has been fraught and difficult, she said. ""It's [taken] nearly 10 years to get to this moment."" ""I wish our countries had worked together and brought our sons and daughters home instead of having to spend so much time on bringing accountability after their murders... [but] it's better than nothing,"" she said. James Foley, Diane's son, was a journalist Kotey's case, unlike El Sheikh's, did not go to trial. Instead, he pleaded guilty to eight charges relating to the abduction, torture and beheading of IS hostages in Syria, and agreed to meet the victims' families as part of the deal. Diane accepted. In that small room as she stared at him, she felt more ""even"", with the man convicted of helping to kill her son, Diane said. ""He was still rather frightening to me, but of course, since I knew I was safe, and he could harm me no longer, I had some power,"" she said. ""He'd already done the worst and taken away my loved one."" It was during their four hours together, she said, that she came to pity the terrorist who now faces spending his life in jail. ""I wanted Kotey to be confronted with the horror of what he did,"" she said, telling him about the man he murdered, the eldest of her five children. ""For him to understand the goodness he destroyed and why people like James were in Syria. It's because they cared and wanted to report the truth to the world. Kotey listened quietly and then also talked about his own family. ""He said had been praying to his God for forgiveness. He shared a picture of his family, he has some young children whom he will probably never see again. It made me realise how much he's lost by following hatred and propaganda. It made me pity him."" But he never told Diane where the bodies of the hostages he and his conspirators murdered are buried. Even today, they have never been found. ""And he never said sorry. He was sombre and respectful towards me and talked about remorse"", but never apologised, she said. When she turned to leave for the last time, she made a parting comment. ""I said to him that I hope at some point we could both forgive one another,"" she recalled. She remembers he looked at her confused and said: ""I don't have to forgive you for anything."" Her plea, she explained, is grounded in her Catholic faith - the foundation of her strength and what has kept her going. ""I know he doesn't have to forgive me anything, but in that momentâ¦I don't know."" She paused, searching for the words. ""I just feel like, as people, none of us are perfect. We all do things we regret."" ""If I hate them, they have won. They will continue to hold me captive because I am not willing to be different to the way they were to my loved one. We have to pray for the courage to be the opposite."" ""It's a hard journey to forgiveness, and it's not a done deal but it's what I aspire to."" In the three weeks after James' murder, Diane set up something which, she says now gives her life purpose: The James W Foley Legacy Foundation. It advocates for the government to do more to help Americans held hostage abroad. Her work has made her a political force - other hostage families have described Diane as ""unstoppable"". ""Governments should have the backs of our citizens when they travel internationally,"" she said. ""They need to be shrewd and have many tools to use: sanctions, humanitarian aid, vaccines or visas, anything to open up humanitarian channels so that we can stop the horror of international hostage taking."" But for all that, the suffering has not stopped for her or her family, she admitted. ""It's been very hard on Jim's brothers and sister, and my husband. We will probably forever pay the toll for all that we went through. All of us families have a lot of post-traumatic stress."" Other victims' family members have said they will not take Diane's approach. ""I will never forgive them and I have made my peace with that,"" Bethany Haines, the daughter of David, told BBC in April as El Sheikh was tried in court. This video can not be played Watch: Daughter of ISIS 'Beatles' victim: 'I will never forgive' As part of the condition of their extraditions from British authority, neither Kotey nor Elsheikh will face the death penalty. ""I'm glad about that,"" Diane said. ""They have the rest of their lives to think about what they've done. ""They've lost their freedom, their citizenship, their families. Their hatred did not win.""

Police do not want hosepipe ban breach reports,"Six water companies have announced hosepipe bans this summer People have been urged not to call the police to report hosepipe ban breaches. Some forces said they had received 999 calls on the matter before restrictions were put in place. Devon and Cornwall Police said any reports should be directed to South West Water and not emergency services. Cornwall and north Devon will see a ban from Tuesday, with Thames Water on Wednesday, joining Welsh Water, Southern Water, South East Water and Yorkshire Water. South West Water advised that ""if you feel someone is breaking the ban, you can report it to us and we will investigate further"". Those using hosepipes during bans could face fines of up to Â£1,000 if taken to court, although water companies say they preferred ""education over enforcement"". People have been encouraged to report neighbours if they spotted them repeatedly breaching bans. Southern Water, which imposed a ban on 5 August, said: ""We believe peer pressure is influencing behaviour as no-one wants to be the person on the street with a green lawn and shiny car. ""Our approach is to engage and educate customers when we are approached about people failing to follow the rules."" Devon and Cornwall Police said they have already seen ""unprecedented demand"" on their phone lines this summer, receiving more than 1,000 calls a day. Assistant Chief Constable Nikki Leaper said: ""We are also already getting calls from people reporting breaches of the hosepipe ban due to come in next week - which should be directed to the water company."" A National Police Chiefs' Council spokesman said: ""Breaches of hosepipe bans are a civil matter and should not be reported to the police.

Asher-Smith calls for more period sports science,"This video can not be played 'If it was a men's issue we'd have a million different ways to combat things' Dina Asher-Smith has called for more research into the effect of periods on performance after her cycle caused her to pull up with cramp at Munich 2022. Defending champion Asher-Smith initially thought her recovery strategy or hydration may be to blameafter she limped out of Tuesday's 100m final. But, after qualifying fastest for Friday's 200m final, Asher-Smith said ""girls' stuff"" caused her calf cramp. ""It is a huge topic for women in sport,"" the Briton told BBC Sport.

This video can not be played GB's Daryll Neita wins bronze as Dina Asher-Smith pulls up with cramp in women's 100m final The end of Asher-Smith's 100m title defence was the latest in a run of bad luck. Her Tokyo Olympics campaign was badly hampered by a hamstring injury, and she was forced out of this year's Commonwealth Games with a muscle strain sustained while competing in the relay at July's World Championships. However, the world bronze medallist looked in impressive form as she powered to a comfortable 22.53-second victory in her 200m semi-final in Germany. Switzerland's Mujinga Kambundji, the only other European to make the final in Oregon, won her heat in 22.76secs. Britain's Jodie Williams also made the final, qualifying fifth fastest. ""I just want to retain my European title, so the aim was to come out here and qualify and run fast tomorrow,"" Asher-Smith added. Speaking on BBC TV, Britain's former world and European medallist Jenny Meadows said she agreed with Asher-Smith's comments. ""It's something most parents ask me about - menstrual cycles and how do you manage that as a young girl, and then as a woman?"" Meadows said. ""We have never seen Dina affected by that before but she shared with us that it was just the wrong time of the month for her. ""It's important to see a global superstar like Dina saying 'this is normal, it affects me too'. ""It affects every single female and having people at the top of the sport like Dina.

Breakthrough over harmful chemicals used in make-up,"PFAS are used in makeup and pharmaceutical products because of their water-resistant properties Chemists have identified how to destroy ""forever chemicals"" in a low-cost way for the first time, new research says. Scientists have linked exposure to the substances, known as PFAS, at certain levels toserious health risks,external, including cancer and birth defects. Their resistance to water, oil and stains make them highly useful. PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday objects from frying pans to make-up. But it is these properties that make them so difficult to destroy. PFAS stands for poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances. There are around 4,500 of these fluorine-based compounds and they are found in almost every dwelling on Earth in products including food packaging, non-stick cookware, rain gear, adhesives, paper and paints. They have been identifiedin low levels in rainwaterglobally - but if they infiltrate water or soil in high level, they can become a serious concern. Research remains ongoing,externalto determine how different levels of exposure can lead to various health effects. ""There is an association between exposure and adverse outcomes in every major organ system in the human body,"" Elsie Sunderland, professor of environmental chemistry at Harvard University, tells BBC News. Existing methods to destroy PFAS, such as incineration, have not been very successful - they can be prohibitively expensive or have been associated with local contamination. New research, from scientists at Northwestern University, US claims to have done the ""seemingly impossible"" and destroyed PFAS using low temperature and cheap products. This could be very useful in helping communities suffering from high-level contamination, according to Prof Sunderland, who is not part of the research team. The reason PFAS have historically been so difficult to destroy is because they contain many carbon and fluorine bonds - the strongest bonds in organic chemistry. But it is these bonds which means they can repel liquids - known as omniphobic - and makes them very useful for the pharmaceutical and food industries. The chemicals that linger for decades in your blood PFAS in rainwater exceed safe levels The race to replace persistent chemicals in our homes The research team, led by Brittany Trang, identified a new mechanism to break down the PFAS by using a common chemical called sodium hydroxide - which is used to make household products like soap or painkillers. They targeted a group of weaker charged oxygen atoms which sit at the end of the long tail of carbon-fluorine bonds. The process effectively ""decapitated the head group from the tail"" and the PFAS began to fall apart, leaving only harmless products. Ms Trang says the results are ""exciting because of how simple â yet unrecognized â our solution is"". ""This could be a breakthrough if it is low cost,"" chemicals policy lead and fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Camilla Alexander-White, tells BBC News. PFAS are in hundreds of household items The team of scientists hope that with further research PFAS could be filtered from drinking water and this new method applied to destroy the contaminants. However, treatment of high concentrations of PFAS is only one part of the solution. With PFAS remaining in production it can continue tobuild up at low levels,externalin fish and other wildlife as it cannot be broken down naturally very easily. Dr Alexander-White says that PFAS should only be used in products and processes that are vital for society and for which there is no alternative. This new method was applied to the 10 most prominent types of PFAS, but theUS Environment Protection Agency has identified,externalmore than 12,000.

Possible breakthrough to destroy 'forever chemicals'US scientists have discovered a low-cost method for destroying chemicals associated with cancer.Science & EnvironmentComments,"PFAS are used in makeup and pharmaceutical products because of their water-resistant properties Chemists have identified how to destroy ""forever chemicals"" in a low-cost way for the first time, new research says. Scientists have linked exposure to the substances, known as PFAS, at certain levels toserious health risks,external, including cancer and birth defects. Their resistance to water, oil and stains make them highly useful. PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday objects from frying pans to make-up. But it is these properties that make them so difficult to destroy. PFAS stands for poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances. There are around 4,500 of these fluorine-based compounds and they are found in almost every dwelling on Earth in products including food packaging, non-stick cookware, rain gear, adhesives, paper and paints. They have been identifiedin low levels in rainwaterglobally - but if they infiltrate water or soil in high level, they can become a serious concern. Research remains ongoing,externalto determine how different levels of exposure can lead to various health effects. ""There is an association between exposure and adverse outcomes in every major organ system in the human body,"" Elsie Sunderland, professor of environmental chemistry at Harvard University, tells BBC News. Existing methods to destroy PFAS, such as incineration, have not been very successful - they can be prohibitively expensive or have been associated with local contamination. New research, from scientists at Northwestern University, US claims to have done the ""seemingly impossible"" and destroyed PFAS using low temperature and cheap products. This could be very useful in helping communities suffering from high-level contamination, according to Prof Sunderland, who is not part of the research team. The reason PFAS have historically been so difficult to destroy is because they contain many carbon and fluorine bonds - the strongest bonds in organic chemistry. But it is these bonds which means they can repel liquids - known as omniphobic - and makes them very useful for the pharmaceutical and food industries. The chemicals that linger for decades in your blood PFAS in rainwater exceed safe levels The race to replace persistent chemicals in our homes The research team, led by Brittany Trang, identified a new mechanism to break down the PFAS by using a common chemical called sodium hydroxide - which is used to make household products like soap or painkillers. They targeted a group of weaker charged oxygen atoms which sit at the end of the long tail of carbon-fluorine bonds. The process effectively ""decapitated the head group from the tail"" and the PFAS began to fall apart, leaving only harmless products. Ms Trang says the results are ""exciting because of how simple â yet unrecognized â our solution is"". ""This could be a breakthrough if it is low cost,"" chemicals policy lead and fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Camilla Alexander-White, tells BBC News. PFAS are in hundreds of household items The team of scientists hope that with further research PFAS could be filtered from drinking water and this new method applied to destroy the contaminants. However, treatment of high concentrations of PFAS is only one part of the solution. With PFAS remaining in production it can continue tobuild up at low levels,externalin fish and other wildlife as it cannot be broken down naturally very easily. Dr Alexander-White says that PFAS should only be used in products and processes that are vital for society and for which there is no alternative. This new method was applied to the 10 most prominent types of PFAS, but theUS Environment Protection Agency has identified,externalmore than 12,000.

Everard killer charged with indecent exposure,"Wayne Couzens is serving a whole-life sentence for the murder, kidnap and rape of Sarah Everard Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens has been charged with two further counts of indecent exposure. The alleged offences are said to have taken place on 9 June 2015 and 13 November 2020, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said Couzens, 49, was a police officer at the time. Couzens has already denied four separate counts of indecent exposure after being charged earlier this year. He will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 2 September. The Metropolitan Police said the latest alleged offences took place in Kent - in Dover in June 2015 and in Deal in November 2020. Couzens is serving a whole-life tariff for the abduction, rape and murder of 33-year-old London marketing executive Ms Everard, crimes he committed in March 2021 while he was a PC with the Metropolitan Police. Rosemary Ainslie, head of the CPS Special Crime Division, said: ""The function of the CPS is not to decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence, but to make fair, independent and objective assessments about whether it is appropriate to present charges to a court to consider. ""The CPS reminds all concerned that criminal proceedings against Wayne Couzens are active and that he has the right to a fair trial."" In May, Couzens pleaded not guilty at the Old Bailey to four counts of indecent exposure in relation to crimes allegedly committed in Swanley, Kent, in January and February 2021. He stands accused of ""intentionally exposing his genitals intending that someone would see them and be caused alarm and distress"".

Injured 90-year-old in 40-hour wait for ambulanceAfter the ambulance arrived she was in the vehicle for 20 hours outside hospital.Cornwall,"South Western Ambulance Service said it was ""sorry and upset"" it did not provide a ""timely response"" A 90-year-old woman waited 40 hours for an ambulance after a serious fall. Stephen Syms said his mother, from Cornwall, fell on Sunday evening and an ambulance arrived on Tuesday afternoon. She was then in the vehicle for 20 hours at the Royal Cornwall Hospital. It comes as an ambulance trust warnslives are at risk because of delays in patient handovers. It was also reported a man, 87, who fell, was left under amakeshift shelter waiting for an ambulance.,external A makeshift shelter was made to cover a man as he waited 15 hours for an ambulance South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said it was ""sorry"" for its response to both incidents. Mr Syms, from St Stephen, told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""We are literally heartbroken to see a 90-year-old woman in such distress, waiting and not knowing if she had broken anything. ""The system is totally broken."" He said it took nine minutes before his 999 call was answered. ""If that was a cardiac arrest, nine minutes is much too long, it's the end of somebody's life,"" he said. Mr Syms said paramedics were ""absolutely incredible people"". He added: ""The system is not deteriorating, it's totally broken and needs to be urgently reviewed."" The average time it took an ambulance to reach a 999 call for something like a heart attack or stroke was nearly one hour in July in England. That's more than three times longer than the 18-minute target. The problem has been getting steadily worse over the past year, but the delays aren't confined to ambulance waits. Many people across the UK have also spent hours waiting outside emergency departments after arriving in ambulances, because there is no room for them to be treated in the hospital itself. That's linked to patients staying in hospital much longer than usual after they've recovered because of issues providing the social care they need at home. Delays at every stage are causing harm to patients, experts say. The NHS is under intense pressure but health chiefs say plans are in place to create thousands of extra beds and recruit more 999 call handlers ahead of this winter. The government says it has invested millions into ambulance services and is setting up a taskforce to look at ways of making sure patients are only in hospital for as long as they need to be. A spokesperson for the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are sorry and upset that we were unable to provide Ms Syms with the timely response and care that she needed. ""Our ambulance clinicians strive every day to give their best to patients. ""Health and social care services are under enormous pressure. ""We are working with our partners in the NHS and social care in Cornwall, to do all we can to improve the service that patients receive."" Ms Syms was in an ambulance at the Royal Cornwall Hospital for a further 20 hours before being admitted Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth Cherilyn Mackrory said she had written to the health secretary to urge him to visit and address the issue. She said NHS managers, the local authority and government needed to work together to fix it. She also said a lack of ongoing home care was the ""crux"" of the problem. Speaking on BBC Radio Cornwall, Ms Mackrory said: ""We don't have proper staffing of domiciliary care or safe places for people to be discharged to. ""Now, it's much more complex than that, but that is the crux of it, and we need to make sure that we do this so that we can safely discharge patients out of the hospital."" Former Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives and current Cornwall councillor Andrew George disagreed with Ms Mackrory. He said he thought it was wrong for MPs to be ""attempting to shift the blame to local managers and providers of service"". ""This is a policy failure which starts at the top,"" Mr George said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We absolutely recognise the pressures ambulance services are facing - with call handlers answering nearly one million calls nationwide in July alone - and we are taking action to support them. ""This includes the NHS investing Â£150m to help ambulance services meet pressures and Â£20m this year to upgrade the ambulance fleet, while we have also grown the ambulance and support staff workforce by almost 40% since April 2010. ""We continue to work closely with the NHS to improve care for patients, tackle delayed discharge and speed up handovers to get ambulances back on the road.""

Throughout the war, photographers have been capturing images showing the realities of the conflict and attempts to live everyday life while the fighting goes on. Here is a selection of images taken today in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian soldiers near the frontline in Zaporizhzhia Region A woman was killed when a building of the Kharkiv National Technical University was heavily damaged by a Russian missile strike United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres meets politicians and members of the public on a visit to the Ukrainian port city Odesa Russia has put weaponry and equipment it says it has seized in Ukraine on show at an exhibition in the city of Rostov In a moment of respite from the war, Ukrainians in the western city of Lviv have been celebrating Saviour of the Apple Feast Day The director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has welcomed recent statements that both Ukraine and Russia support a potential IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia power plant. ""There is an urgent need to lower the tension"" between the two parties,"" Grossisaid in a statement,external. The agency said he would lead the mission himself, and that it was ""in active consultations with all parties"". The IAEA has not been able to visit the power plant since before the conflict began half a year ago. The agency said two of the plant's six reactors were still operating, and added that Ukraine had informed it that two other reactors would be maintained in cold shutdown. Ukrainian forces are inflicting losses on their Russian enemies in ""all directions where active hostilities continue"", according to the regular evening update from the Ukrainian armed forces. The dispatch says Russian attacks were repelled in a number of places, including around Bakhmut. It says the Kremlin's troops ""suffered losses and ran away"" following a failed effort to break through Ukrainian defences in areas near the city of Slovyansk. It also accuses Russia of strikes on civilian infrastructure in the Kharkiv region, where local authorities have reported at least 20 deaths in recent days. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the information in the report. Hostilities remain concentrated in the east Rafael Grossi, from Argentina, has been director general of the IAEA since 2019 We've been reporting that Russia's President Putin and France's President Macron have agreed on the need for inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But what is the IAEA? It was set up in 1957 as an autonomous body of the United Nations and is based in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Over the past few years, the IAEA has shifted its emphasis from the promotion of atomic energy to aiming to ensure nuclear safety - though that has long been one of its roles. The IAEA was given the specific role of defining and inspecting safeguards when the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons - a landmark deal aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology - came into force in 1970, signed by 188 states. Hans Blix was head of the IAEA between 1981 and 1997 before becoming the UN's chief weapon's inspector in Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction When the Chernobyl nuclear power disaster happened in the USSR in 1986, it was the IAEA that investigated and reported on both the immediate consequences and the long-term effects. Since the 1990s the IAEA has inspected - or been prevented from doing so - nuclear facilities in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and North Korea, and investigated the core meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, which followed an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Russian gas supplies to the European Union look set to be disrupted later this month, following an announcement that the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline is to be closed for maintenance for three days. The conduit will close from 31 August to 2 September, says Russian state-controlled energy firm Gazprom.

Usyk was in London taking part in negotiations over the rematch with Joshua when the attacks on his home city of Kyiv began.

Guterres' call for the creation of a demilitarised zone around the complex has been rejected by Moscow, which claims it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"".

Read more here. The UN chief, who's visiting Ukraine, has warned Russia against redirecting power from the Zaporizhzhia plant Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Let's have a quick look back at what's been happening today. Russia has submitted a letter to the UN Security Council detailing the ""provocations"" that it accuses Ukraine of plotting at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Both sides have been accused of planning a ""false flag"" incident there: a staged disaster which could be blamed on the enemy in an attempt to raise the stakes of the war. The Russian mission to the UN alleges that the Ukrainians want to cause ""what they believe to be a minor accident"", consisting of a radiation leak, which could see Russia accused of ""nuclear terrorism"". The letter denies that Russian troops are storing weapons on site. It repeats an allegation that the Ukrainians have been shelling the plant. Kyiv accuses Russia of doing the same thing. Dominic BaileyBBC News Visual Journalism Team Satellite images show a long queue of traffic in Crimea heading towards Russia, just a few days after explosions struck a military airbase on the peninsula. The high resolution images captured on 12 August by the US-based Planet Labs, do not show the full extent of the tailback, but clearly shows dozens of lorries and cars queuing for about a mile on the eastbound carriageway near Kerch. The road leads to the bridge built across the Kerch Strait after the Russian annexation. There were several explosions at the Saky military base near Novofedorivka on the peninsula's western coast on 9 August. Videos on social media appeared to show visitors fleeing from a beach as smoke rose in the distance. Despite the war, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014 has continued to be a popular destination with Russian tourists. We've got a bit more information now on the latest package of military aid being promised to Ukraine by Washington. The US Defense Department's $775m (Â£656m) package will include high-mobility artillery rocket systems, artillery and mine-clearing equipment. ""We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that's what we're doing with this package,"" AFP reports a senior official as saying. He also says Russian forces are showing a ""total lack of progress on the battlefield in Ukraine. The US has made regular pledges of financial and military aid for Ukraine since Russia's invasion began. Today's announcement is significantly smaller than some have been - on 19 May, for example, the Senate approved a package worth $40bn. Putin is expected to appear in person, as is China's President Xi, says the Indonesian leader Russia's President Putin and China's President Xi will both attend the G20 meeting of world leaders in November, says the leader of host nation Indonesia. It was not known whether the pair would attend the summit in Bali, due to international tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and efforts by China's President Xi to limit trips as a Covid-19 measure. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo told Bloomberg he's expecting both men to appear in person. A White House spokesperson declined to confirm the travel plans of President Biden, but said if Putin appeared, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky should take up his invitation to attend, too. The US is providing a $775m military aid package to Ukraine, the Pentagon announces. It will include funding for rocket systems and howitzers, a spokesman says.

""This is an agreement between two parties locked in bitter conflict. It is unprecedented in scope and scale. But there is still a long way to go on many fronts,"" he said. He asked rich countries to help those most in need during the food crisis. ""It is time for massive and generous support, so developing countries can purchase the food from this and other ports - and people can buy it."" Guterres said developing countries needed help to purchase such grain and called for unimpeded access to global markets for Russian food and fertilisers which are not subject to sanctions. He also warned that without enough fertilisers this year, there may not be enough food next year.

Throughout the war, photographers have been capturing images showing the realities of the conflict and attempts to live everyday life while the fighting goes on. Here is a selection of images taken today in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian soldiers near the frontline in Zaporizhzhia Region A woman was killed when a building of the Kharkiv National Technical University was heavily damaged by a Russian missile strike United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres meets politicians and members of the public on a visit to the Ukrainian port city Odesa Russia has put weaponry and equipment it says it has seized in Ukraine on show at an exhibition in the city of Rostov In a moment of respite from the war, Ukrainians in the western city of Lviv have been celebrating Saviour of the Apple Feast Day The director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has welcomed recent statements that both Ukraine and Russia support a potential IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia power plant. ""There is an urgent need to lower the tension"" between the two parties,"" Grossisaid in a statement,external. The agency said he would lead the mission himself, and that it was ""in active consultations with all parties"". The IAEA has not been able to visit the power plant since before the conflict began half a year ago. The agency said two of the plant's six reactors were still operating, and added that Ukraine had informed it that two other reactors would be maintained in cold shutdown. Ukrainian forces are inflicting losses on their Russian enemies in ""all directions where active hostilities continue"", according to the regular evening update from the Ukrainian armed forces. The dispatch says Russian attacks were repelled in a number of places, including around Bakhmut. It says the Kremlin's troops ""suffered losses and ran away"" following a failed effort to break through Ukrainian defences in areas near the city of Slovyansk. It also accuses Russia of strikes on civilian infrastructure in the Kharkiv region, where local authorities have reported at least 20 deaths in recent days. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the information in the report. Hostilities remain concentrated in the east Rafael Grossi, from Argentina, has been director general of the IAEA since 2019 We've been reporting that Russia's President Putin and France's President Macron have agreed on the need for inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But what is the IAEA? It was set up in 1957 as an autonomous body of the United Nations and is based in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Over the past few years, the IAEA has shifted its emphasis from the promotion of atomic energy to aiming to ensure nuclear safety - though that has long been one of its roles. The IAEA was given the specific role of defining and inspecting safeguards when the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons - a landmark deal aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology - came into force in 1970, signed by 188 states. Hans Blix was head of the IAEA between 1981 and 1997 before becoming the UN's chief weapon's inspector in Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction When the Chernobyl nuclear power disaster happened in the USSR in 1986, it was the IAEA that investigated and reported on both the immediate consequences and the long-term effects. Since the 1990s the IAEA has inspected - or been prevented from doing so - nuclear facilities in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and North Korea, and investigated the core meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, which followed an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Russian gas supplies to the European Union look set to be disrupted later this month, following an announcement that the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline is to be closed for maintenance for three days. The conduit will close from 31 August to 2 September, says Russian state-controlled energy firm Gazprom. The pipeline has already been running at just 20% capacity during an energy standoff between Moscow and Europe, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Western nations have repeatedly accused the Kremlin of using fuel supplies as a political weapon. The latest round of maintenance was unscheduled, Reuters news agency reported.

Despite the war, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014 has continued to be a popular destination with Russian tourists. We've got a bit more information now on the latest package of military aid being promised to Ukraine by Washington. The US Defense Department's $775m (Â£656m) package will include high-mobility artillery rocket systems, artillery and mine-clearing equipment. ""We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that's what we're doing with this package,"" AFP reports a senior official as saying. He also says Russian forces are showing a ""total lack of progress on the battlefield in Ukraine. The US has made regular pledges of financial and military aid for Ukraine since Russia's invasion began. Today's announcement is significantly smaller than some have been - on 19 May, for example, the Senate approved a package worth $40bn. Putin is expected to appear in person, as is China's President Xi, says the Indonesian leader Russia's President Putin and China's President Xi will both attend the G20 meeting of world leaders in November, says the leader of host nation Indonesia. It was not known whether the pair would attend the summit in Bali, due to international tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and efforts by China's President Xi to limit trips as a Covid-19 measure. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo told Bloomberg he's expecting both men to appear in person. A White House spokesperson declined to confirm the travel plans of President Biden, but said if Putin appeared, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky should take up his invitation to attend, too. The US is providing a $775m military aid package to Ukraine, the Pentagon announces. It will include funding for rocket systems and howitzers, a spokesman says. Paul Myers and the BBC Disinformation Team Footage has
emerged,externalwhich shows the interior of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after
Russian troops moved in with their vehicles. Itâs not clear
who filmed the video, or exactly when. The BBC and other journalists have verified the location in which it was
taken, with the help ofanother
video from 2019,external, shot in 3D, which provides a tour of the facility. The older video
is available on a YouTube account connected to the power plant. NPR journalist Geoff Brumfiel shareda string of images,externalwhich show features seen in both
videos, and can be used to confirm the location. Brumfiel says certain details appear in the new footageâ¦ â¦ Which also appeared in the 2019 video giving a tour of the plant. The Russian presence is signalled in the footage with vehicles marked with the letter Z â a symbol
of the invasion of Ukraine. Moscow insists it's working to protect the facility. Russian military vehicles bearing the Z invasion symbol are seen parked at the left During his visit to the city of Odesa, UN chief AntÃ³nio Guterres also said a lot needed to be done to guarantee that the world had access to Ukrainian grain, and Russian food products and fertilisers. ""This is an agreement between two parties locked in bitter conflict. It is unprecedented in scope and scale. But there is still a long way to go on many fronts,"" he said. He asked rich countries to help those most in need during the food crisis. ""It is time for massive and generous support, so developing countries can purchase the food from this and other ports - and people can buy it."" Guterres said developing countries needed help to purchase such grain and called for unimpeded access to global markets for Russian food and fertilisers which are not subject to sanctions. He also warned that without enough fertilisers this year, there may not be enough food next year. Without fertiliser in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023 AntÃ³nio Guterres, UN Secretary General Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have spoken over the phone and discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. In a statement following the call, the Kremlin said that Putin ""stressed that the systematic shelling by the Ukrainian military"" of the power plant ""creates the danger of a sizeable disaster"". Both presidents agreed on the need to send a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the power station to assess the real state of affairs and the Kremlin said the Russian side would ""provide the inspectors of the agency with the necessary assistance"". The Elysee Palace also put out a statement, saying that Macron had ""once again underlined his concern at the risks posed by the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant"". The two presidents are set to talk to each other again in the coming days after discussions between the technical teams have taken place, and ahead of the deployment of the mission. Â© 2025 BBC.

Injured 90-year-old in 40-hour wait for ambulanceAfter the ambulance arrived she was in the vehicle for 20 hours outside hospital.,"South Western Ambulance Service said it was ""sorry and upset"" it did not provide a ""timely response"" A 90-year-old woman waited 40 hours for an ambulance after a serious fall. Stephen Syms said his mother, from Cornwall, fell on Sunday evening and an ambulance arrived on Tuesday afternoon. She was then in the vehicle for 20 hours at the Royal Cornwall Hospital. It comes as an ambulance trust warnslives are at risk because of delays in patient handovers. It was also reported a man, 87, who fell, was left under amakeshift shelter waiting for an ambulance.,external A makeshift shelter was made to cover a man as he waited 15 hours for an ambulance South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said it was ""sorry"" for its response to both incidents. Mr Syms, from St Stephen, told BBC Radio Cornwall: ""We are literally heartbroken to see a 90-year-old woman in such distress, waiting and not knowing if she had broken anything. ""The system is totally broken."" He said it took nine minutes before his 999 call was answered. ""If that was a cardiac arrest, nine minutes is much too long, it's the end of somebody's life,"" he said. Mr Syms said paramedics were ""absolutely incredible people"". He added: ""The system is not deteriorating, it's totally broken and needs to be urgently reviewed."" The average time it took an ambulance to reach a 999 call for something like a heart attack or stroke was nearly one hour in July in England. That's more than three times longer than the 18-minute target. The problem has been getting steadily worse over the past year, but the delays aren't confined to ambulance waits. Many people across the UK have also spent hours waiting outside emergency departments after arriving in ambulances, because there is no room for them to be treated in the hospital itself. That's linked to patients staying in hospital much longer than usual after they've recovered because of issues providing the social care they need at home. Delays at every stage are causing harm to patients, experts say. The NHS is under intense pressure but health chiefs say plans are in place to create thousands of extra beds and recruit more 999 call handlers ahead of this winter. The government says it has invested millions into ambulance services and is setting up a taskforce to look at ways of making sure patients are only in hospital for as long as they need to be. A spokesperson for the South Western Ambulance Service NHS Foundation Trust said: ""We are sorry and upset that we were unable to provide Ms Syms with the timely response and care that she needed. ""Our ambulance clinicians strive every day to give their best to patients. ""Health and social care services are under enormous pressure. ""We are working with our partners in the NHS and social care in Cornwall, to do all we can to improve the service that patients receive."" Ms Syms was in an ambulance at the Royal Cornwall Hospital for a further 20 hours before being admitted Conservative MP for Truro and Falmouth Cherilyn Mackrory said she had written to the health secretary to urge him to visit and address the issue. She said NHS managers, the local authority and government needed to work together to fix it. She also said a lack of ongoing home care was the ""crux"" of the problem. Speaking on BBC Radio Cornwall, Ms Mackrory said: ""We don't have proper staffing of domiciliary care or safe places for people to be discharged to. ""Now, it's much more complex than that, but that is the crux of it, and we need to make sure that we do this so that we can safely discharge patients out of the hospital."" Former Liberal Democrat MP for St Ives and current Cornwall councillor Andrew George disagreed with Ms Mackrory. He said he thought it was wrong for MPs to be ""attempting to shift the blame to local managers and providers of service"". ""This is a policy failure which starts at the top,"" Mr George said. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said: ""We absolutely recognise the pressures ambulance services are facing - with call handlers answering nearly one million calls nationwide in July alone - and we are taking action to support them. ""This includes the NHS investing Â£150m to help ambulance services meet pressures and Â£20m this year to upgrade the ambulance fleet, while we have also grown the ambulance and support staff workforce by almost 40% since April 2010. ""We continue to work closely with the NHS to improve care for patients, tackle delayed discharge and speed up handovers to get ambulances back on the road.""

Possible breakthrough to destroy 'forever chemicals'US scientists have discovered a low-cost method for destroying chemicals associated with cancer.,"PFAS are used in makeup and pharmaceutical products because of their water-resistant properties Chemists have identified how to destroy ""forever chemicals"" in a low-cost way for the first time, new research says. Scientists have linked exposure to the substances, known as PFAS, at certain levels toserious health risks,external, including cancer and birth defects. Their resistance to water, oil and stains make them highly useful. PFAS are used in hundreds of everyday objects from frying pans to make-up. But it is these properties that make them so difficult to destroy. PFAS stands for poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances. There are around 4,500 of these fluorine-based compounds and they are found in almost every dwelling on Earth in products including food packaging, non-stick cookware, rain gear, adhesives, paper and paints. They have been identifiedin low levels in rainwaterglobally - but if they infiltrate water or soil in high level, they can become a serious concern. Research remains ongoing,externalto determine how different levels of exposure can lead to various health effects. ""There is an association between exposure and adverse outcomes in every major organ system in the human body,"" Elsie Sunderland, professor of environmental chemistry at Harvard University, tells BBC News. Existing methods to destroy PFAS, such as incineration, have not been very successful - they can be prohibitively expensive or have been associated with local contamination. New research, from scientists at Northwestern University, US claims to have done the ""seemingly impossible"" and destroyed PFAS using low temperature and cheap products. This could be very useful in helping communities suffering from high-level contamination, according to Prof Sunderland, who is not part of the research team. The reason PFAS have historically been so difficult to destroy is because they contain many carbon and fluorine bonds - the strongest bonds in organic chemistry. But it is these bonds which means they can repel liquids - known as omniphobic - and makes them very useful for the pharmaceutical and food industries. The chemicals that linger for decades in your blood PFAS in rainwater exceed safe levels The race to replace persistent chemicals in our homes The research team, led by Brittany Trang, identified a new mechanism to break down the PFAS by using a common chemical called sodium hydroxide - which is used to make household products like soap or painkillers. They targeted a group of weaker charged oxygen atoms which sit at the end of the long tail of carbon-fluorine bonds. The process effectively ""decapitated the head group from the tail"" and the PFAS began to fall apart, leaving only harmless products. Ms Trang says the results are ""exciting because of how simple â yet unrecognized â our solution is"". ""This could be a breakthrough if it is low cost,"" chemicals policy lead and fellow of the Royal Society of Chemistry, Camilla Alexander-White, tells BBC News. PFAS are in hundreds of household items The team of scientists hope that with further research PFAS could be filtered from drinking water and this new method applied to destroy the contaminants. However, treatment of high concentrations of PFAS is only one part of the solution. With PFAS remaining in production it can continue tobuild up at low levels,externalin fish and other wildlife as it cannot be broken down naturally very easily. Dr Alexander-White says that PFAS should only be used in products and processes that are vital for society and for which there is no alternative. This new method was applied to the 10 most prominent types of PFAS, but theUS Environment Protection Agency has identified,externalmore than 12,000. William Dichtel, one of the co-authors and professor of chemistry at Northwestern remains hopeful: ""There are other classes that don't have the same Achilles' heel, but each one will have its own weakness.""

"Medieval monks were riddled with worms, study findsThe monks' infection rate was twice that of the townspeople, research reveals.","The Augustinian friars of Cambridge were twice as likely to suffer from worms than the townsfolk Medieval monks ""appear to have been riddled with parasites"" despite having access to hand-washing facilities and latrine blocks, a study has found. The discovery was made during an analysis of adult skeletons found in excavations in Cambridge. It revealed the friars were twice as likely to suffer from parasitic worms than the townsfolk. The difference may be due to monks manuring crops in friary gardens with their own faeces, the study suggests. Most Augustinian monasteries of the period had access to latrine blocks and hand-washing facilities, unlike the houses of ordinary working people Cambridge University,externalresearcher Tianyi Wang said roundworm was the most common infection, but whipworm infection was also found. ""These are both spread by poor sanitation,"" she added. Sanitation in medieval towns relied on cesspits - holes in the ground used for faeces and household waste. In contrast, monasteries commonly had running water systems, including to rinse out latrine blocks, and hand-washing facilities. The researchers tested samples of soil around the pelvises of remains of 19 monks and 25 locals. Medieval pointy-toed shoes led to bunion surge Face of 13th Century patient recreated Cambridge skeletons Black Death study This showed 58% of the friars tested were infected, compared to 32% of the general townspeople. The latter finding is in line with other studies of medieval burials - suggesting infection rates in the monastery were remarkably high. Dr Piers Mitchell, fromthe university's Department of Archaeology,external, said: ""One possibility is that the friars manured their vegetable gardens with human faeces - not unusual in the medieval period, and this may have led to repeated infection with the worms."" Researchers believe the infection rate could be even higher than these findings, as some traces of worm eggs would have been destroyed over time by fungi and insects The monks were interred in the Augustinian Friary from the 1280s, while the locals were buried in the former cemetery at All Saints by the Castle church between the 12th and 14th centuries. The town's medical practitioners were aware of the parasites. A manuscript left to Peterhouse College by local doctor John Stockton, who died in 1361, believed the worms were generated by various forms of mucus and prescribed ""bitter medicinal plants"" such as aloe and wormwood to sufferers. Dr Mitchell said this was the first time anyone had attempted to work out how common parasites were in people following different lifestyles in the same medieval town. ""The friars of medieval Cambridge appear to have been riddled with parasites,"" he said. An earlier study revealedmany town monks also suffered from bunions.

Mr Clark said he was also establishing a ""strategic futures"" advisory panel to ""plan for Liverpool's revival as a city"", which will be chaired by regional mayor Steve Rotheram. It is believed to be the first time such a panel has been created to advise a council. The panel will also include former Leeds City Council leader Baroness Judith Blake and Sir Howard Bernstein, the former chief executive of Manchester City Council. Mr Rotheram denied claims the panel would run the council, saying it would ""advise and offer support in setting strategic longer-term plans and priorities"". Liverpool city mayor Joanne Anderson says the council had been affected by ""years of government cuts"" Joanne Anderson, mayor of the city of Liverpool,said in a social media thread that further intervention would will not solve the issues"",externalat the council, as they were ""being experienced right across local government"".

She added the council had ""lost Â£465m in funding since this government came to power in 2010, so it is not surprising that there are areas where we can improve performance"". Today's report reveals the council's failings are not just limited to a few departments - but include the overall way in which public money is managed. It highlights ""systematic and whole-council weaknesses"", and argues ""immediate further intervention is required to tackle this continued failure."" That intervention means a Whitehall-appointed official will effectively be making decisions over where public money in Liverpool is spent. Mayor Joanne Anderson says she accepts the problems outlined in the report, but questions the solution. She claims, by next March, the commissioners' intervention will have cost the council Â£6.7m and has questioned whether that money could be better spent on transforming services. But lead commissioner Mike Cunningham says these powers are used ""only in extraordinary circumstances"". Richard Kemp, the leader of Liverpool's Liberal Democrat group, said the appointment of commissioners meant unelected government officials were effectively taking control of the city's council. He called for ""a totally new lot of people"" to oversee the authority, adding that ""at the moment democracy is largely suspended in the city of Liverpool"". Mike Cunningham, who leads the team of commissioners, said the intervention's duration was not expected to continue beyond 2024. ""The commissioners believe that it will be possible for Liverpool City Council to make the required improvements within the next two years, as initially envisaged.

LiveLiveStrikes bring much of London transport to a halt6 minutes ago,"Passengers in London are facing severe disruption as Tube workers and some bus drivers go on strike Transport for London (TfL) is advising people to avoid travelling today, with services also affected tomorrow morning It is the fifth time RMT members on London Underground have walked out for 24 hours this year in a dispute over job cuts Bus drivers from the Unite union employed by London United are striking for 48 hours, affecting services in west and south-west London and parts of Surrey People are also being warned that rail services will be slow to recover this morning after the latest national strike on Thursday Today's action comes ahead of another UK-wide rail strike on Saturday Edited by Nathan Williams That's it for our coverage of today's transport strikes in London. The page was written by Marita Moloney, Thomas Macintosh and Andre Rhoden-Paul. It was edited by Nathan Williams and Chirag Trivedi. We'll shortly be stopping our live coverage of the transport strikes in London. Here's a round-up of what's been happening today: Yes. Unite'sLondon bus strikecontinues fora second day. Plus, there will be morewidespread disruption to the UK rail network on Saturday, as the RMT and TSSA go walk out again. The effect on services is expected to be the same as 18 August, although some services will run on one of the days but not the other. Disruption is likely to continue into Sunday morning. Read more details about the strikes here Rail workers aren't the only group joining the picket line as the cost
of living soars. Unions members from several industries are set to go on strike in the
coming months, as Alan Jones, Industrial Relations Correspondent at the Press
Association, explains. Among those who could potentially strike are refuse workers in Windsor,
members of the Royal College of Nursing, barristers and workers at the Port of
Felixstowe. He says: A lot of these people worked through the pandemic: post office workers, Royal Mail workers, train workers, delivery drivers, refuse collectors - many of them hailed at the time as being the kind of heroes of the pandemic.""  Inflation is ""definitely what is driving a lot of these disputes"", he tells BBC Radio 4's World at One, with autumn expected to bring even more industrial unrest. ""It's possible that teachers and nurses and even doctors and other health workers will be taking some form of industrial action,"" Jones says. ""People were talking about a summer of discontent... but the autumn and the winter could be much bigger in terms of industrial action than what we've seen in recent weeks. ""We're as near now to a general strike as we've been for decades."" Rob OxleyBBC Radio London A very limited service continues to run on only three Underground lines. TheCentral Lineisn't running through Central London with no
service from White City to Liverpool Street. A limited service is operating at
the ends of the line in the suburbs. TheDistrict Lineis only running between West Ham and Upminster. Whilst theNorthern Linehas a reduced service Golders Green to

Some more political reaction to bring you as the former shadow chancellor has now waded in on how the strikes and cost of living crisis go hand-in-hand. Speaking on Radio 4's World at One (WATO) programme Labour's John McDonnell called for wage rises in line with inflation adding it is the only way to protect people from ""sinking in to poverty"". He rejected that this would embed inflation saying that the dominant thrust of inflation rising wasn't coming from wages but from profits, and called for an excess profit tax. He also criticised city bonuses which he claimed had gone up 30%. Asked about whether the UK is facing a ""winter of discontent"" of strike action he said there is a build-up of workers prepared to go on strike ""many of whom have never been on strike before"". Harry LowBBC London News With no Tube service at a station which would ordinarily serve six
London Underground lines, there is extra pressure on Thameslink. Thameslink trains connect north and south of the city via central London
â as well as Luton and Gatwick airports and various counties beyond. There has been a
constant stream of passengers leaving this part of the station all afternoon. Elsewhere in the land of transport, only one train an hour is running between London and Manchester. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps seemed unaware of how many trains were running along that route. Avanti West Coast is running a reduced timetable of one direct train an hour because of ""severe staff shortages"". Transport secretary under fire for train timetable mistake  Allow Twitter content?

Wendy HurrellBBC London One London restaurant owner says both staff and customers are adapting to this week's transport disruption. Ed Thaw, who owns Leroy restaurant in Shoreditch, says they were busier on Wednesday because customers knew that three days of reduced services due to strikes were ahead of them. He adds that he is sympathetic to the strikes - for now. ""It's kind of swings and roundabouts but by and large we're kind of getting to where we want to be across the week,"" he says. ""I think our customers are adapting and we're kind of adapting. It's a lack of staff, it's energy bills going up and this is one of the lesser pains to deal with. ""It's not ideal, if it keeps on happening then at some point it's going to be a problem."" Harry LowBBC London News Like many people outside Tube stations across London, I find Salani Bandaranayake (right) tapping directions into her phone outside Euston. She is travelling back to Leicester with her mum having visited family in Watford for the past fortnight. In their case, it's a relatively short walk to King's Cross St Pancras. ""We actually booked a ticket a week ago... Now we'll have to walk to catch our train on time."" She says she is ""neutral"" on supporting London's fifth Tube strike this year. ""They're fighting for their rights as well,"" she adds. Katy AustinTransport Correspondent Network Rail says about 70% of usual train services are running today. This is because of starting late following yesterdayâs national rail strike. On Sunday, about 85% of usual services are expected to run following the next national strike day on Saturday. Today's Tube strike is the fifth to happen in London this year but the first to take place at the height of the school summer holidays. While most of the Underground network is down and some bus routes aren't operating, there are still other methods for Londoners and tourists to battle their way around the capital. Trains can offer sneaky routes across the city, more river bus services are operating for the day and there's always the option of a rented bike or e-scooter, depending on which borough you're in. Discover other waysto survive the day in the city here. Harry LowBBC London News Although
London Underground workersreceived an 8.4% pay risein April, prices
are rising at 10.1% - their fastest rate for more than 40 years. It
means the gap between pay growth and inflation is thebiggest since records beganmore than 20 years ago. However,
a four-year deal with unions guarantees 15,000 Tube workers an annual pay
increase of RPI+0.2%, which will cost TfL Â£100m. Elsewhere
in the public sector,police have received 5% pay rise, teachers were awarded between 5% and 8.9% and the Armed Forces, who
cannot strike, got 3.75%. NHS workers received at least Â£1,400, backdated to
April, with porters and cleaners getting a 9.3% increase. Eligible doctors and
dentists received a 4.5% rise. This video can not be played As transport workers in London go on strike today, the Mayor of London has told BBC London he thinks the government is ""anti-London"". He says if Transport for London wasn't still in discussions with the government, it could resolve this industrial dispute amicably with trade unions. The government and TfL are still in negotiations about the conditions of a long-term funding deal, something which Khan says is hampering discussions with the RMT and other trade unions. TheRMT has previously saidthis latest strike was prompted by TfL's ""refusal"" to share details of a draft government proposal it received regarding funding of the transport system in London. But Khan said the deal wasn't final and that its contents were ""sensitive"". Here is a midday catch-up of everything we know so far about today's Tube strike. Harry LowBBC London News It's not just Tube stations which have the shutters down. Seven shops are shut inside Euston station this morning, even though train services are running. Although none of them has anything to indicate the reason for the closures, it seems a good bet that the Tube and bus strikes are a factor. There is another Mexican outfit outside the station which is closed - but that is due to ""routine maintenance"". This video can not be played As well as London Underground workers, bus drivers who are members of the Unite union are also walking out today in a dispute over pay. Some 63 bus routes are affected, with services disrupted in west and south-west London and parts of Surrey today. Drivers will also strike on Saturday. Unite regional officer John Murphy says the pay offer offered to members is ""insulting"" as wage increase offered over a two-year period ""doesn't get close to inflation"". Drivers deserve to be treated better and with respect, he tells the BBC. Harry LowBBC London News It's day three of the first Test between England and South Africa at
Lord's and there are fewer fans in place for the start of the action than
normal. The nearest station - St John's Wood (the only Tube station which
doesn't contain the letters of the word ""mackerel"") - would
ordinarily bring thousands of supporters to the home of cricket. ""I do hope that people can manage to get here today,"" Jonathan
Agnew tells listeners on Test Match Special. ""It's all a bit chaotic today with Tube strikes and a bus strike as
well. ""Well done to
those how have made it but looking around there are still rather more empty
seats than there would rather be for the first ball of a Lord's Test match but
hopefully people will be able to get here and see, more or less, the start of
the action."" Liz Truss, who is currently bookies' favourite to become the next PM,
has vowed to ""crackdown"" on strikes if she is selected as Tory Party
leader. The foreign secretary has outlined her plans to tackle strikes, which
include introducing minimum service levels to keep transport links running. ""Once again we're seeing militant trade unionists holding our
country to ransom,"" she told theDaily Express,external. ""As prime
minister, I'll crackdown on the debilitating strikes that cripple the vital
services that hard-working people rely on."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Medieval monks were riddled with worms, study finds","The Augustinian friars of Cambridge were twice as likely to suffer from worms than the townsfolk Medieval monks ""appear to have been riddled with parasites"" despite having access to hand-washing facilities and latrine blocks, a study has found. The discovery was made during an analysis of adult skeletons found in excavations in Cambridge. It revealed the friars were twice as likely to suffer from parasitic worms than the townsfolk. The difference may be due to monks manuring crops in friary gardens with their own faeces, the study suggests. Most Augustinian monasteries of the period had access to latrine blocks and hand-washing facilities, unlike the houses of ordinary working people Cambridge University,externalresearcher Tianyi Wang said roundworm was the most common infection, but whipworm infection was also found. ""These are both spread by poor sanitation,"" she added. Sanitation in medieval towns relied on cesspits - holes in the ground used for faeces and household waste. In contrast, monasteries commonly had running water systems, including to rinse out latrine blocks, and hand-washing facilities. The researchers tested samples of soil around the pelvises of remains of 19 monks and 25 locals. Medieval pointy-toed shoes led to bunion surge Face of 13th Century patient recreated Cambridge skeletons Black Death study This showed 58% of the friars tested were infected, compared to 32% of the general townspeople. The latter finding is in line with other studies of medieval burials - suggesting infection rates in the monastery were remarkably high. Dr Piers Mitchell, fromthe university's Department of Archaeology,external, said: ""One possibility is that the friars manured their vegetable gardens with human faeces - not unusual in the medieval period, and this may have led to repeated infection with the worms."" Researchers believe the infection rate could be even higher than these findings, as some traces of worm eggs would have been destroyed over time by fungi and insects The monks were interred in the Augustinian Friary from the 1280s, while the locals were buried in the former cemetery at All Saints by the Castle church between the 12th and 14th centuries. The town's medical practitioners were aware of the parasites. A manuscript left to Peterhouse College by local doctor John Stockton, who died in 1361, believed the worms were generated by various forms of mucus and prescribed ""bitter medicinal plants"" such as aloe and wormwood to sufferers. Dr Mitchell said this was the first time anyone had attempted to work out how common parasites were in people following different lifestyles in the same medieval town. ""The friars of medieval Cambridge appear to have been riddled with parasites,"" he said. An earlier study revealedmany town monks also suffered from bunions.

Government plans to increase Liverpool intervention,"Liverpool has seen a series of council failures over its finances The government has said it will expand its role in running Liverpool City Council to cover financial decisions, governance and recruitment, after expensive errors by the authority. The council's past failure to renew some contracts could lead to losses of millions of pounds,a report revealed. In 2021, the governmentappointed four commissionersto oversee some functions after a local governance ""breakdown"". It will now appoint a fifth to deal with finance. It comes after a report suggested the council had not made enough progress and there were serious concerns about financial decision-making.

Russia has ""no moral right to sit at the G20 while its
aggression in Ukraine persists"", a spokesperson for the British Foreign Office has said. ""We welcome Indonesia's efforts to ensure that the impacts
of Russia's war are considered in G20 meetings, as well as
indications that Ukraine may be represented by President
(Volodymyr) Zelensky,"" they added. As we reported earlier, Indonesian president Joko Widodo hassaid that Russia's Vladimir Putin plans to attend the G20 summitin Bali in on 15 and 16 November. Throughout the war, photographers have been capturing images showing the realities of the conflict and attempts to live everyday life while the fighting goes on. Here is a selection of images taken today in Ukraine and Russia. Ukrainian soldiers near the frontline in Zaporizhzhia Region A woman was killed when a building of the Kharkiv National Technical University was heavily damaged by a Russian missile strike United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres meets politicians and members of the public on a visit to the Ukrainian port city Odesa Russia has put weaponry and equipment it says it has seized in Ukraine on show at an exhibition in the city of Rostov In a moment of respite from the war, Ukrainians in the western city of Lviv have been celebrating Saviour of the Apple Feast Day The director-general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Rafael Grossi, has welcomed recent statements that both Ukraine and Russia support a potential IAEA mission to the Zaporizhzhia power plant. ""There is an urgent need to lower the tension"" between the two parties,"" Grossisaid in a statement,external. The agency said he would lead the mission himself, and that it was ""in active consultations with all parties"". The IAEA has not been able to visit the power plant since before the conflict began half a year ago. The agency said two of the plant's six reactors were still operating, and added that Ukraine had informed it that two other reactors would be maintained in cold shutdown. Ukrainian forces are inflicting losses on their Russian enemies in ""all directions where active hostilities continue"", according to the regular evening update from the Ukrainian armed forces. The dispatch says Russian attacks were repelled in a number of places, including around Bakhmut. It says the Kremlin's troops ""suffered losses and ran away"" following a failed effort to break through Ukrainian defences in areas near the city of Slovyansk. It also accuses Russia of strikes on civilian infrastructure in the Kharkiv region, where local authorities have reported at least 20 deaths in recent days. It was not possible for the BBC to independently verify the information in the report. Hostilities remain concentrated in the east Rafael Grossi, from Argentina, has been director general of the IAEA since 2019 We've been reporting that Russia's President Putin and France's President Macron have agreed on the need for inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. But what is the IAEA? It was set up in 1957 as an autonomous body of the United Nations and is based in the Austrian capital, Vienna. Over the past few years, the IAEA has shifted its emphasis from the promotion of atomic energy to aiming to ensure nuclear safety - though that has long been one of its roles. The IAEA was given the specific role of defining and inspecting safeguards when the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons - a landmark deal aimed at preventing the spread of nuclear weapons and weapons technology - came into force in 1970, signed by 188 states. Hans Blix was head of the IAEA between 1981 and 1997 before becoming the UN's chief weapon's inspector in Iraq, searching for weapons of mass destruction When the Chernobyl nuclear power disaster happened in the USSR in 1986, it was the IAEA that investigated and reported on both the immediate consequences and the long-term effects. Since the 1990s the IAEA has inspected - or been prevented from doing so - nuclear facilities in countries such as Iraq, Iran, Syria and North Korea, and investigated the core meltdown at the Fukushima nuclear plant in Japan, which followed an earthquake and tsunami in 2011. Russian gas supplies to the European Union look set to be disrupted later this month, following an announcement that the Nord Stream 1 gas pipeline is to be closed for maintenance for three days. The conduit will close from 31 August to 2 September, says Russian state-controlled energy firm Gazprom. The pipeline has already been running at just 20% capacity during an energy standoff between Moscow and Europe, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Western nations have repeatedly accused the Kremlin of using fuel supplies as a political weapon. The latest round of maintenance was unscheduled, Reuters news agency reported. Read more:Can the world cope without Russian oil and gas? Our Europe editor, Paul Kirby, has been speaking to nuclear safety experts to gauge just how dangerous the situation at Zaporizhzhia is. Modern nuclear power plants are designed to withstand shocks of all kinds - from earthquakes to airliners crashing into them. One of the experts' chief concerns is that Ukrainian staff - which have carried on working despite the Russian army's takeover of the power plant in early March - could eventually succumb to stress and fatigue. A letter signed by dozens of employees at the plant on Thursday made a reference to this possibility. ""We can professionally control nuclear fission,"" it said, ""but we are helpless in the face of people's irresponsibility and madness."" Read the piecehere. Ukrainian boxer Oleksandr Usyk defends his world heavyweight titles against Britain's Anthony Joshua tomorrow - and will then return to defending his country, his team says. The Ukrainian beat Joshua in London last September to take his world titles but any basking in the glory was interrupted five months later when Russia invaded his country. Usyk was in London taking part in negotiations over the rematch with Joshua when the attacks on his home city of Kyiv began. His family were at home celebrating his daughter's birthday and cancellation of international flights into Ukraine meant it took him three days to get back. Like most Ukrainian men, the 35-year-old started to help with the war campaign, joining a community self-defence organisation. But he returned to boxing with the blessing of President Volodymyr Zelensky, keen for the Ukrainian people to see their flag on the international sporting stage. And Usyk's promoter, Alexander Krassyuk, tells BBC Sport that after this weekend's fight ""he will return to territorial defence, there is no hesitation about it"". You can read more here Hugo BachegaBBC News, Odesa UN secretary-general AntÃ³nio Guterres says the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, Europe's largest, is ""very confusing"", as Russia and Ukraine blame each other for shelling the site, tensions that have raised fears of a catastrophe. Guterres' call for the creation of a demilitarised zone around the complex has been rejected by Moscow, which claims it would make the facility ""more vulnerable"". He responded in a BBC interview in Odesa by saying ""there's a long way for serious discussion"", without getting into detail. Similarly, there has been no deal to give access to monitors from the UN's nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). But Guterres hinted at ""discreet diplomacy"" and referenced the deal that allowed Ukraine to resume its grain exports. The agreement, brokered by the UN and Turkey, came after a months-long blockade imposed by Russia that worsened a global food crisis, and is the only diplomatic breakthrough in this conflict so far. Read more here. The UN chief, who's visiting Ukraine, has warned Russia against redirecting power from the Zaporizhzhia plant Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Let's have a quick look back at what's been happening today. Russia has submitted a letter to the UN Security Council detailing the ""provocations"" that it accuses Ukraine of plotting at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. Both sides have been accused of planning a ""false flag"" incident there: a staged disaster which could be blamed on the enemy in an attempt to raise the stakes of the war. The Russian mission to the UN alleges that the Ukrainians want to cause ""what they believe to be a minor accident"", consisting of a radiation leak, which could see Russia accused of ""nuclear terrorism"". The letter denies that Russian troops are storing weapons on site. It repeats an allegation that the Ukrainians have been shelling the plant. Kyiv accuses Russia of doing the same thing. Dominic BaileyBBC News Visual Journalism Team Satellite images show a long queue of traffic in Crimea heading towards Russia, just a few days after explosions struck a military airbase on the peninsula. The high resolution images captured on 12 August by the US-based Planet Labs, do not show the full extent of the tailback, but clearly shows dozens of lorries and cars queuing for about a mile on the eastbound carriageway near Kerch. The road leads to the bridge built across the Kerch Strait after the Russian annexation. There were several explosions at the Saky military base near Novofedorivka on the peninsula's western coast on 9 August. Videos on social media appeared to show visitors fleeing from a beach as smoke rose in the distance. Despite the war, the Ukrainian peninsula that Moscow annexed in 2014 has continued to be a popular destination with Russian tourists. We've got a bit more information now on the latest package of military aid being promised to Ukraine by Washington. The US Defense Department's $775m (Â£656m) package will include high-mobility artillery rocket systems, artillery and mine-clearing equipment. ""We want to make sure that Ukraine has a steady stream of ammunition to meet its needs, and that's what we're doing with this package,"" AFP reports a senior official as saying. He also says Russian forces are showing a ""total lack of progress on the battlefield in Ukraine. The US has made regular pledges of financial and military aid for Ukraine since Russia's invasion began. Today's announcement is significantly smaller than some have been - on 19 May, for example, the Senate approved a package worth $40bn. Putin is expected to appear in person, as is China's President Xi, says the Indonesian leader Russia's President Putin and China's President Xi will both attend the G20 meeting of world leaders in November, says the leader of host nation Indonesia. It was not known whether the pair would attend the summit in Bali, due to international tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and efforts by China's President Xi to limit trips as a Covid-19 measure. But Indonesian President Joko Widodo told Bloomberg he's expecting both men to appear in person. A White House spokesperson declined to confirm the travel plans of President Biden, but said if Putin appeared, the Ukrainian leader Volodymyr Zelensky should take up his invitation to attend, too. The US is providing a $775m military aid package to Ukraine, the Pentagon announces. It will include funding for rocket systems and howitzers, a spokesman says. Paul Myers and the BBC Disinformation Team Footage has
emerged,externalwhich shows the interior of Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant after
Russian troops moved in with their vehicles. Itâs not clear
who filmed the video, or exactly when. The BBC and other journalists have verified the location in which it was
taken, with the help ofanother
video from 2019,external, shot in 3D, which provides a tour of the facility. The older video
is available on a YouTube account connected to the power plant. NPR journalist Geoff Brumfiel shareda string of images,externalwhich show features seen in both
videos, and can be used to confirm the location. Brumfiel says certain details appear in the new footageâ¦ â¦ Which also appeared in the 2019 video giving a tour of the plant. The Russian presence is signalled in the footage with vehicles marked with the letter Z â a symbol
of the invasion of Ukraine. Moscow insists it's working to protect the facility. Russian military vehicles bearing the Z invasion symbol are seen parked at the left During his visit to the city of Odesa, UN chief AntÃ³nio Guterres also said a lot needed to be done to guarantee that the world had access to Ukrainian grain, and Russian food products and fertilisers. ""This is an agreement between two parties locked in bitter conflict. It is unprecedented in scope and scale. But there is still a long way to go on many fronts,"" he said. He asked rich countries to help those most in need during the food crisis. ""It is time for massive and generous support, so developing countries can purchase the food from this and other ports - and people can buy it."" Guterres said developing countries needed help to purchase such grain and called for unimpeded access to global markets for Russian food and fertilisers which are not subject to sanctions. He also warned that without enough fertilisers this year, there may not be enough food next year. Without fertiliser in 2022, there may not be enough food in 2023 AntÃ³nio Guterres, UN Secretary General Vladimir Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have spoken over the phone and discussed the situation at the Zaporizhzhia plant. In a statement following the call, the Kremlin said that Putin ""stressed that the systematic shelling by the Ukrainian military"" of the power plant ""creates the danger of a sizeable disaster"". Both presidents agreed on the need to send a mission of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to the power station to assess the real state of affairs and the Kremlin said the Russian side would ""provide the inspectors of the agency with the necessary assistance"". The Elysee Palace also put out a statement, saying that Macron had ""once again underlined his concern at the risks posed by the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant"". The two presidents are set to talk to each other again in the coming days after discussions between the technical teams have taken place, and ahead of the deployment of the mission. Â© 2025 BBC.

Consumer confidence hits record low as prices soar,"UK consumer confidence in the future hit a record low in August due to the soaring cost-of-living and bleak economic prospects. A ""sense of exasperation"" about the economy was the biggest driver behind the fall, according to GfK's Consumer Confidence index. Recent data showed that prices rose at the fastest pace 40 years in July and the UK is heading for recession. Meanwhile, retail sales volumes fell by 1.2% in the three months to July. The Office for National Statistics (ONS) said people were continuing to cut back on non-essential spending, in particular clothing and household goods. Rachel Barber, legal partner and retail specialist at accountancy firm Deloitte said that because people are pessimistic about the state of the economy, many people ""are now postponing major purchases such as electricals and furniture"". Fuel sales also declined in July as people cut down on travel, deterred by petrol and diesel prices as well as the recent hot weather. Sales volumes nudged up slightly in July, by 0.3%, after a small fall in June, but overall figures show sales have been on a downward trend since summer 2021. However, overall retail sales were still above pre-Covid levels, the ONS said. Why are prices rising so quickly? Energy costs risk humanitarian crisis - NHS chiefs The GfK consumer confidence barometer, which surveys the public about their opinion of the economy, was at its the lowest level this month since records began in 1974. ""These findings point to a sense of capitulation, of financial events moving far beyond the control of ordinary people"", said Joe Staton, GfK's client strategy director. ""With headline after headline revealing record inflation eroding household buying power, the strain on the personal finances of many in the UK is alarming,"" he added. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium, said that the summer sunshine was responsible for the slight uplift in sales in July: ""But most retailers will still be seeing falling volumes in the face of rising inflation."" Inflation - which measures the rate of price rises - hit 10.1% in July and is expected to soar to more than 13% later this year when the latest energy price cap on household bills comes into force in October. The Bank of England now expects the UK economy to fall into recession later this year and forecasts the downturn will last for 15 months. Clothing stores sales volumes declined by 1.2% in July and household goods stores sales volumes were down by 0.4%, mainly because of falls in furniture and lighting stores. The ONS said that feedback from retailers suggested that consumers were cutting back on spending because of ""increased prices and affordability concerns"". Deloitte's Rachel Barber said: ""Consumer confidence in the state of the economy has plummeted so you're finding that one in five people are now postponing major purchases such as electricals and furniture and you can see that in the statistics today, that they're down about 1.5%. ""You're also seeing one in three consumers buying their main food shop at a discounter which is up from 28% a year ago, so there are definite changes happening in the consumer's mind in everything they are spending,"" Ms Barber told the BBC. One retailer which has been on the receiving end of the downturn in sales, is Joules the clothing and homeware retailer with a rural vibe. The brand, which has its roots in country and equestrian shows, issued a profits warning on Friday. In a statement it said trading in the five weeks to 14 August had ""softened materially"" because of the extremely warm and dry weather, which hit sales of outerwear, rainwear, knitwear and wellies. This had ""compounded the ongoing subdued consumer demand due to the well-documented cost-of living crisis"". At the same time it confirmed ""positive discussions"" were continuing with rival retailer Next about the latter taking a stake worth about Â£15m in it. However, Joules said there could be ""no certainty that these discussions will lead to any agreement"". The cost-of-living crisis is being driven by higher fuel, energy and food prices. These increases are putting a squeeze on people's finances, as wages fail to keep up. Energy and fuel prices had been rising even before Russia's invasion of Ukraine as economies started to recover from the coronavirus pandemic, and the conflict has pushed up prices further.

'Our rent increased to two-thirds of our wages',"Megan Stephens and Richard Stranks had their rent increased to 66% of their London wages People under 30 are facing a growing cost-of-renting crisis, new figures seen by the BBC suggest. Four in 10 of this age group are now spending more than 30% of their pay on rent, according to the data - a five-year high. Experts say spending this level of income on rental costs is unaffordable. While London has the highest rents, affordability has worsened in towns such as Rotherham and Bolton for young people since the pandemic. The data suggests under-30s spend more of their earnings on rent than other working-age groups. The figures cover 150,000 young people and were supplied by property market consultancy Dataloft. Number of holiday-let homes up 40% in three years Prices rising faster than wages Megan Stephens and Richard Stranks, from London, had their rent put up from half their wages to two-thirds of them. ""We were not expecting such a big increase... that was the real punch in the gut,"" said Mr Stranks. It comes as younger people's finances are being squeezed, amid rapidly rising living and rental costs, anda fall in real incomes. Under-30s are less likely to have dependents and are sometimes more willing to move around, so could feel able to pay higher rents, experts told the BBC. But Nick Gallent, a professor of housing and planning at University College London, warned that young people being locked into expensive renting now could cause future problems. Young renters faced a difficult winter, he said, amid rising inflation and energy bills, describing the situation as ""horrendous"". ""Despite all the economic problems, house prices and rents continue to nudge upwards,"" he said. What is inflation and why are prices rising so quickly? In one in six local authorities across England, Wales and Scotland for which there was enough data, the majority of young renters were spending more than 30% of their earnings on their housing, according to analysis of Dataloft figures for the year to the end of June. The least affordable areas for young people are concentrated in London. However, many of the places where rent affordability has dropped the most since the Covid pandemic are in locations such as Rotherham, Bolton, Salford, Walsall and Dudley. Elton Papri, a lettings manager at a Dudley-based branch of estate agent Shipways, said under 30s were ""struggling at the moment"" as there were not enough homes on the market. Renters were being pushed to offer over the asking price as people were bidding more than the listed price just to secure a property. ""They shouldn't be offering Â£100 more if they cannot meet that requirement, but then if they don't they are going to miss out on that property so it's a hard situation,"" said Mr Papri. Lettings manager Elton Papri, 30, found it difficult to find somewhere to rent for himself The trade body for estate agents, Propertymark, said rents were increasing due to fewer houses being on the market. This was because many landlords have decided to sell properties because of rising taxes, charges and maintenance costs, it said. Chris Norris, director of policy and campaigns at the National Residential Landlords Association, told BBC Radio 5 Live his members' costs had increased ""exponentially"". He said an increase in available housing was needed to relieve pressures on renters, adding: ""Above all we need to make sure we're getting more housing out there."" Shortage of homes to rent leads to bidding wars Danisha Kazi, senior economist at research and campaign group Positive Money, said underlying structural features in the market were also to blame. ""Supply shortage is not a good enough explanation because it's a long-term trend - rent as a proportion of income has been rising since the 1980s for all age groups, with younger cohorts particularly hit hard,"" she said. She said housing policy reforms since the 1980s, including an end to rent controls, making evictions easier and the introduction of Right-to-Buy, had significantly shifted the balance of power from tenants to landlords. ""We also don't have alternatives and people are heavily dependent on the private rental sector, which hasdoubled in size since the early 2000s,external,"" she said. London couple Ms Stephens and Mr Stranks decided to move out of their house-share last June, as they felt like they had no alternative. ""My income did grow a little bit, but not by as much as the landlord increased the price,"" said Ms Stephens. The couple have now found cheaper accommodation as property guardians of a former local authority office block in Newham, east London. They may have to move out with a month's notice, but they said the move was an easy decision. ""It means that I can save, and that's a big thing for me"" says Ms Stephens. Property guardians move with the times to save cash Housing campaigners Generation Rent warned the situation for younger renters was ""dire"" and called for the government to freeze rents and pause evictions. The Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities said it recognised people were facing cost-of-living pressures and that paying rent was likely to be a tenant's biggest monthly expense. ""That is why we have taken action through our Â£37bn support package to help households with rising costs,"" it said. The government also said thatits plans announced in Junewould provide renters with a ""fairer deal"". The proposals would ban landlords from evicting tenants in England without giving them a reason, and give renters more power to challenge unjustified rent increases and poor conditions. The analysis of renters under 30 years old for the year to the end of June 2022 is based on records from 150,000 tenants collected by major tenant referencing companies and aggregated by Dataloft. It excludes income outliers, including those earning less than Â£10,000 because they are likely to be supported by other sources of income or by guarantors. Across all the age groups, Dataloft has data for over 400,000 records for the year to the end of June and estimates it covers 40% of the rental market in England, Scotland and Wales. Many housing organisations regard spending more than 30% of gross income to be unaffordable and theOffice for National Statistics has also used the benchmark,externalin its affordability analysis.

What can I do if I can't afford my bill?,"Energy prices have fallen from 1 April, but many households will still struggle to pay their bills. Some will need to repay debt to suppliers and many will worry about future levels of financial support. From April, energy bills fell by more than 12% for most people in England, Scotland and Wales. Energy regulator Ofgem announced the average household paying for dual fuel by direct debit would nowpay Â£1,690 a year. That's a drop of Â£238 (or about Â£20 a month) from the previousenergy price cap,external- the maximum amount suppliers can charge for each unit of gas and electricity used. It's the lowest level in more than two years, a period when energy prices soared due to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. What is the Ofgem energy price cap and how much are bills going down? About5.3m people in Great Britain are in debt to their energy supplier,external, research by Citizens Advice suggests. The charity says 1.7m people lost connection at least once a month in 2023 because they couldn't afford to top up their prepayment meter. Its survey found that 800,000 people went more than 24 hours without gas and electricity because they couldn't afford to top up. It estimated that 2m people would lose their power supply for the same reason between January and March 2024. Under Ofgem rules, your supplier must work with you to agree a payment plan. If you don't agree one, they might try to force you to have prepayment meter installed orswitch an existing smart meter to prepayment mode. In very rare cases, if you haven't paid a bill after 28 days, you might be threatened with disconnection. If you've reached state pension age, your supplier can't disconnect you between 1 October and 31 March if you either: live alone live only with pensioners, or under-18s Suppliers can pass your details to a debt collection agency - and you might be charged more to cover the cost of this. Many suppliers also charge extra fees for late payments. Non-payment could also damage your credit rating and make it harder to borrow money in the future. Suppliers can install a prepayment meter without a household's permission - but only if they meet certain requirements. These were brought in after aninvestigation by The Times,externalfound debt agents acting for British Gaswrongly broke into vulnerable people's homes to fit meters. Therules,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts, contacting them at least 10 times before installing a meter. They also have to conduct a ""site welfare visit"". Meters cannot be fitted for: customers over 75, without someone else in the home, or anyone with a terminal illness people with health conditions that could be worsened by a cold home those with children under the age of two those who need a continuous energy supply for health reasons households where no-one can top up the meter due to physical or mental incapacity About four million households had a prepayment meter in July 2023, according to Ofgem. Prepayment meters used to be more expensive than paying by direct debit but the charges are now the same. If you are struggling to pay your energy bills, you need to contact your supplier. You can ask for a review of your payments anddebt repayments,external, payment breaks or reductions, more time to pay andaccess to hardship funds,external. If eligible you could be added to a list of households entitled to extra support,the Priority Services Register,external. It doesn't cancel your debts but it does show that you are vulnerable, which your supplier should take into account. Ofgem also recommends asking your supplier to add you to the Network Operator Register, if you rely on energy for medical reasons. Make sure you are claiming relevant benefits and government help. You can check theMoneyHelper benefits guide,externalor use theEntitledto,externalandTurn2us,externalbenefits calculators.

"Recall Parliament over cost of living, Labour says","MPs are not due to return from summer recess until 5 September Labour has called for MPs to return to Parliament early to deal with the cost-of-living crisis. Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow leader of the House of Commons, has written to the prime minister asking him to recall MPs two weeks early on 22 August. She said new policies were needed before a rise in the energy price cap in October. But the government said it was already supporting people now - and new fiscal decisions would be for the next PM. A spokesperson said the government was focused on ""delivering for the public"" and was continuing to provide financial support, including a Â£400 discount on energy bills. Experts expect the energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge their customers in England, Scotland and Wales - to hit Â£3,582 in October. How high will my energy bill go? Why are prices rising so quickly? What are the policies of final two hoping to be PM? The average bill was Â£1,400 a year in October 2021. And by January 2023, the next time the cap is due to be changed, energy industry analysts Cornwall Insight predict it will go up again to Â£4,266. In her letter, Ms Debbonaire told Mr Johnson the country faced an ""urgent choice"". She said: ""Across Britain, people are having to make unthinkable choices about how to pay their bills, causing endless worry for households and businesses. ""That is why I am writing to you today to urge you to bring Parliament back early on Monday 22 August so that we can freeze the energy price cap now ahead of winter. ""Families deserve a government that is on their side, and is ready to take the action needed now to meet the scale of this national emergency."" Labour is calling for theenergy price cap to be frozen for six months, funded partly by an increased windfall tax - and has claimed the proposals would save the average household Â£1,000. But economists have said it would be a very expensive plan. The two contenders for Conservative Party leader, Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak, have indicated they are not keen on extending the windfall tax on oil and gas companies - or freezing the price cap - meaning it is unlikely to happen unless they have a change of heart. Ms Truss says she will tackle the crisis by reversing the National Insurance rise, suspending the green levy part of energy bills and cancelling a planned rise in corporation tax. Mr Sunak says getting control of inflation is the most pressing issue. He has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero and to cut 3p off income tax by 2029. Conservative leadership contenders Rishi Sunak and Liz Truss have different approaches to tackling the cost of living crisis The increase in the cost of living is putting a squeeze on people's finances, as wages fail to keep up. This week figures showedUK inflation rose above 10%in July for the first time in 40 years. The Bank of England's governor Andrew Bailey has said ""the Russia shock is now the largest contributor to UK inflation"". But pay increases for many are not keeping up with rising prices, sparking thefastest fall in real pay on record. This comes asconsumer confidence has hit a record low, according to market research company GfK. Its long-running Consumer Confidence Index fell three points in August to -44, its lowest figure since records began in 1974. The index provides a snapshot of how UK consumers view their finance and the economy.

members of the Royal College of Nursing, barristers and workers at the Port of

London Underground workersreceived an 8.4% pay risein April, prices
are rising at 10.1% - their fastest rate for more than 40 years. It
means the gap between pay growth and inflation is thebiggest since records beganmore than 20 years ago. However,
a four-year deal with unions guarantees 15,000 Tube workers an annual pay
increase of RPI+0.2%, which will cost TfL Â£100m. Elsewhere
in the public sector,police have received 5% pay rise, teachers were awarded between 5% and 8.9% and the Armed Forces, who
cannot strike, got 3.75%. NHS workers received at least Â£1,400, backdated to

There is another Mexican outfit outside the station which is closed - but that is due to ""routine maintenance"". This video can not be played As well as London Underground workers, bus drivers who are members of the Unite union are also walking out today in a dispute over pay. Some 63 bus routes are affected, with services disrupted in west and south-west London and parts of Surrey today. Drivers will also strike on Saturday. Unite regional officer John Murphy says the pay offer offered to members is ""insulting"" as wage increase offered over a two-year period ""doesn't get close to inflation"".

"No easy answers on driverless car safety - reportIt might not be enough for self-driving cars to be safer than usual cars as people expect more, experts say.Technology","There is no easy answer as to how safe self-driving cars should be, an adviser to a new government-backed report has told the BBC. The report, from the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, warns that it might not be enough for self-driving cars to be safer than normal cars. It says the public may have little tolerance for driverless car crashes - even if they are safer on average. It comes as the government sets out its plans for self-driving cars. No self-driving cars are currently allowed on UK roads, but the government has now said the first such vehicles could be on UK roads by 2025. Some cars, coaches and lorries with self-driving features could even be operating on motorways in the next year, the Department for Transport said. The government's plans include a ""safety ambition"" for vehicles: that they should be as safe as a competent human driver. It says this will inform standards that need to be reached in order to be allowed to self-drive on the roads - and manufacturers could face sanctions if they are not met. But the CDEI, a government expert body that leads its work on trustworthy innovation using data and AI, says the question of how safe autonomous vehicles should be is not one science alone can answer. It says the public may have little tolerance for crashes that are seen as the fault of ""faceless technology companies or lax regulation"" even if, it adds, on average driverless cars are safer than humans. And if the public expect self-driving cars to be as safe as trains or planes, it would require a 100-fold increase in average safety over manually driven cars, it warns. ""What we wanted to do was say there's not an easy answer to this question"" said Professor Jack Stilgoe of University College London who advised the CDEI. He suggested that establishing how safe they should be was a democratic decision. The CDEI says it is also important to consider how risk is distributed between different groups. Even if there are improvements in overall safety, ""some groups may see substantial safety improvements while others see none or even face new hazards"". The report advises that other risks will need scrutiny as the technology is rolled out. One is the potential for bias in algorithms controlling the cars. It warns that some groups, such as wheelchair users, may be underrepresented in data used to train the software algorithms which control the cars - potentially causing bias. The report also says that self-driving cars should be clearly identified, and that ""people have a right to know what sort of agents they are sharing the road with"".

"No easy answers on driverless car safety - reportIt might not be enough for self-driving cars to be safer than usual cars as people expect more, experts say.","There is no easy answer as to how safe self-driving cars should be, an adviser to a new government-backed report has told the BBC. The report, from the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, warns that it might not be enough for self-driving cars to be safer than normal cars. It says the public may have little tolerance for driverless car crashes - even if they are safer on average. It comes as the government sets out its plans for self-driving cars. No self-driving cars are currently allowed on UK roads, but the government has now said the first such vehicles could be on UK roads by 2025. Some cars, coaches and lorries with self-driving features could even be operating on motorways in the next year, the Department for Transport said. The government's plans include a ""safety ambition"" for vehicles: that they should be as safe as a competent human driver. It says this will inform standards that need to be reached in order to be allowed to self-drive on the roads - and manufacturers could face sanctions if they are not met. But the CDEI, a government expert body that leads its work on trustworthy innovation using data and AI, says the question of how safe autonomous vehicles should be is not one science alone can answer. It says the public may have little tolerance for crashes that are seen as the fault of ""faceless technology companies or lax regulation"" even if, it adds, on average driverless cars are safer than humans. And if the public expect self-driving cars to be as safe as trains or planes, it would require a 100-fold increase in average safety over manually driven cars, it warns. ""What we wanted to do was say there's not an easy answer to this question"" said Professor Jack Stilgoe of University College London who advised the CDEI. He suggested that establishing how safe they should be was a democratic decision. The CDEI says it is also important to consider how risk is distributed between different groups. Even if there are improvements in overall safety, ""some groups may see substantial safety improvements while others see none or even face new hazards"". The report advises that other risks will need scrutiny as the technology is rolled out. One is the potential for bias in algorithms controlling the cars. It warns that some groups, such as wheelchair users, may be underrepresented in data used to train the software algorithms which control the cars - potentially causing bias. The report also says that self-driving cars should be clearly identified, and that ""people have a right to know what sort of agents they are sharing the road with"".

'Our rent increased to two-thirds of earningsâ,"Megan Stephens and Richard Stranks had their rent increased to 66% of their London wages People under 30 are facing a growing cost-of-renting crisis, new figures seen by the BBC suggest. Four in 10 of this age group are now spending more than 30% of their pay on rent, according to the data - a five-year high. Experts say spending this level of income on rental costs is unaffordable. While London has the highest rents, affordability has worsened in towns such as Rotherham and Bolton for young people since the pandemic. The data suggests under-30s spend more of their earnings on rent than other working-age groups. The figures cover 150,000 young people and were supplied by property market consultancy Dataloft. Number of holiday-let homes up 40% in three years Prices rising faster than wages Megan Stephens and Richard Stranks, from London, had their rent put up from half their wages to two-thirds of them. ""We were not expecting such a big increase... that was the real punch in the gut,"" said Mr Stranks. It comes as younger people's finances are being squeezed, amid rapidly rising living and rental costs, anda fall in real incomes. Under-30s are less likely to have dependents and are sometimes more willing to move around, so could feel able to pay higher rents, experts told the BBC. But Nick Gallent, a professor of housing and planning at University College London, warned that young people being locked into expensive renting now could cause future problems. Young renters faced a difficult winter, he said, amid rising inflation and energy bills, describing the situation as ""horrendous"". ""Despite all the economic problems, house prices and rents continue to nudge upwards,"" he said. What is inflation and why are prices rising so quickly? In one in six local authorities across England, Wales and Scotland for which there was enough data, the majority of young renters were spending more than 30% of their earnings on their housing, according to analysis of Dataloft figures for the year to the end of June. The least affordable areas for young people are concentrated in London. However, many of the places where rent affordability has dropped the most since the Covid pandemic are in locations such as Rotherham, Bolton, Salford, Walsall and Dudley. Elton Papri, a lettings manager at a Dudley-based branch of estate agent Shipways, said under 30s were ""struggling at the moment"" as there were not enough homes on the market. Renters were being pushed to offer over the asking price as people were bidding more than the listed price just to secure a property. ""They shouldn't be offering Â£100 more if they cannot meet that requirement, but then if they don't they are going to miss out on that property so it's a hard situation,"" said Mr Papri. Lettings manager Elton Papri, 30, found it difficult to find somewhere to rent for himself The trade body for estate agents, Propertymark, said rents were increasing due to fewer houses being on the market. This was because many landlords have decided to sell properties because of rising taxes, charges and maintenance costs, it said. Chris Norris, director of policy and campaigns at the National Residential Landlords Association, told BBC Radio 5 Live his members' costs had increased ""exponentially"". He said an increase in available housing was needed to relieve pressures on renters, adding: ""Above all we need to make sure we're getting more housing out there."" Shortage of homes to rent leads to bidding wars Danisha Kazi, senior economist at research and campaign group Positive Money, said underlying structural features in the market were also to blame. ""Supply shortage is not a good enough explanation because it's a long-term trend - rent as a proportion of income has been rising since the 1980s for all age groups, with younger cohorts particularly hit hard,"" she said. She said housing policy reforms since the 1980s, including an end to rent controls, making evictions easier and the introduction of Right-to-Buy, had significantly shifted the balance of power from tenants to landlords. ""We also don't have alternatives and people are heavily dependent on the private rental sector, which hasdoubled in size since the early 2000s,external,"" she said. London couple Ms Stephens and Mr Stranks decided to move out of their house-share last June, as they felt like they had no alternative. ""My income did grow a little bit, but not by as much as the landlord increased the price,"" said Ms Stephens. The couple have now found cheaper accommodation as property guardians of a former local authority office block in Newham, east London. They may have to move out with a month's notice, but they said the move was an easy decision. ""It means that I can save, and that's a big thing for me"" says Ms Stephens. Property guardians move with the times to save cash Housing campaigners Generation Rent warned the situation for younger renters was ""dire"" and called for the government to freeze rents and pause evictions. The Department for Levelling up, Housing and Communities said it recognised people were facing cost-of-living pressures and that paying rent was likely to be a tenant's biggest monthly expense. ""That is why we have taken action through our Â£37bn support package to help households with rising costs,"" it said. The government also said thatits plans announced in Junewould provide renters with a ""fairer deal"". The proposals would ban landlords from evicting tenants in England without giving them a reason, and give renters more power to challenge unjustified rent increases and poor conditions. The analysis of renters under 30 years old for the year to the end of June 2022 is based on records from 150,000 tenants collected by major tenant referencing companies and aggregated by Dataloft. It excludes income outliers, including those earning less than Â£10,000 because they are likely to be supported by other sources of income or by guarantors. Across all the age groups, Dataloft has data for over 400,000 records for the year to the end of June and estimates it covers 40% of the rental market in England, Scotland and Wales. Many housing organisations regard spending more than 30% of gross income to be unaffordable and theOffice for National Statistics has also used the benchmark,externalin its affordability analysis.
