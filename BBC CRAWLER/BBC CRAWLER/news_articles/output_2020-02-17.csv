"Clean-up under way after 'devastating' floodsNew severe flood warnings are in place after ""unprecedented"" flooding from Storm Dennis.WalesComments","This video can not be played Home owners are trying to clean up the substantial damage left in the wake of Storm Dennis. Residents are counting the cost of ""unprecedented"" flooding after Storm Dennis left parts of Wales under water. There are cancellations and significant delays on trains after a month's worth of rain fell in 48 hours. Roads across south and mid Wales remain blocked by floods and landslips. Meanwhile, homes were evacuated in Monmouth on Monday night after two severe flood warnings for the River Wye were declared. The river's water levels are predicted to reach 7.2m (23ft) between 03:00 and 07:00 on Tuesday. And more rain has been forecast with aMet Office yellow warning for rain,externalissued from 18:00 GMT on Wednesday until 15:00 on Thursday in areas of south, mid and north Wales. Inside a flooded kitchen in Nantgarw People living in areas at immediate risk in Monmouth have been evacuated and other properties nearby have been provided with sandbags and support. The Wye Bridge has been closed, with pedestrians and motorists warned to keep away. Anyone affected by the bridge closure or flooding is asked to use a rest centre set up at the Shire Hall. Natural Resources Wales still hadeight flood warnings in place,externalat 21:10 GMT, meaning flooding is expected. It said 163mm (6.5in) of rain had fallen in the 48 hours between lunchtime on Friday and Sunday and described the scale of flooding as ""unprecedented"". Meanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has defended the Welsh Government's investment into flood defences following the widespread damage after Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it ""clearly isn't adequate"". First Minister Mark Drakeford meets householder Caroline Jones in her flood-affected house in Pontypridd Mr Drakeford said the impact of the weekend's events would have been ""even worse"" if there had not been major investment in flood defences, adding a Â£350m programme was ongoing over this assembly term. ""The impact of global warming is real and there for anyone to see, the science tells us we will have to face in greater frequency these intense weather events in future,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government would work with local authorities to repair infrastructure damage by flooding including bridges, roads and existing flood defences and explore whether there are funds available to help flood victims, local authorities and emergency services. ""For individuals our first focus will be on those families who don't have any form of insurance who lost everything and have no way of replacing it,"" he said.

What should you do now? This football pitch in Cwmbran turned into a boating lake for this canoeist A roof was carried into her garden from about 400m away Taff Street in Pontypridd was left underwater after heavy rain on Saturday and Sunday Clearing up in the centre of Pontypridd on Monday At the peak of the flooding on Sunday, we had 900 tonnes of water per second flowing down the River Taff. That's not just a massive amount of water flowing very fast, it's the damage it can bring, especially when debris is carried along in such a torrent. Well over a month's rainfall came in just 48 hours. This product of Storm Dennis came hot on the heels of Storm Ciara - drenching land that was already soaked through and filling rivers fast. Monitoring sites on rivers and streams flowing down from the mountains through the south Wales valleys started reporting record-breaking levels of water. We saw the highest levels ever recorded on the rivers Taff, Tawe, Neath, Rhondda, Cynon, Usk and the Wye. This shows river Taff levels at Pontypridd over the last month up until 1500 on Monday If we look at the NRW monitoring site at Pontypridd in isolation over the last month, the level surges to well over 5m on Sunday at the peak of Storm Dennis. Even down in Cardiff, river levels were 80cm higher than the previous record set in 1979. Since then, there has been widespread investment in flood defences across south Wales, which has played a big part in saving tens of thousands of homes from damage this time around. That will be no comfort to those people closest to rivers, who have still been affected, All the science around climate change is suggesting that weather events like this will become more frequent and more extreme. So the questions that are sure to be asked over the coming weeks and months is how we cope with that.

Tory MPs warn No 10 against conflict with BBC,"The BBC is governed by a Royal Charter, which protects the licence fee until at least 2027 Two senior Tory MPs have warned Downing Street not to pick a fight with the BBC amid reports it wants the broadcaster ""massively pruned back"". The Sunday Times,externalsuggested No 10 believed the current licence fee should be replaced by a subscription service and certain channels sold. Former Tory cabinet minister Damian Green said it would be ""foolish"" to put public service broadcasting at risk. He added that the plans were not part of his party's election manifesto. Huw Merriman, the MP for Bexhill and Battle who is chairman of the all-party parliamentary group on the BBC, warned No 10 against ""ramping up an unedifying vendetta"" against the BBC, saying the corporation should ""not be a target"". ""This is not a fight the BBC is picking nor a contest my party promised if we got elected,"" he wrote in the Daily Telegraph. ""If the BBC ends up in decline, it will be the government which will be accused by the very people we will rely on for support at the next election."" TV licence fee consultation opens BBC chairman warns over subscription fee What is the TV licence? Asked about the government's plans at a press briefing on Monday, a No 10 spokesman said individual services were a matter for the BBC but the PM was on the record as saying the future of licence fee needed ""looking at"". During the election campaign Boris Johnson questioned whether the BBC's long-standing funding model still ""made sense"" given the growing popularity of on-demand streaming services like Netflix. The PM, who worked for many years as a journalist for rival organisations such as The Telegraph Group and The Spectator, said it remained to be seen whether requiring people to pay a flat fee for a single's broadcaster's output was ""justified"". Ministers recently launched a consultation on whether non-payment of the licence fee should remain a criminal offence. About 95% of the UK's 27 million households pay the licence fee Referring to sources quoted in the Sunday Times piece, Mr Green said: ""The unattributed source was quoted as saying, 'we're going to have a consultation and then we're going to whack the BBC.' That tells me the consultation isn't a real one and there are legal implications about that."" He added that his views are shared by MPs ""across the House of Commons"", saying that while many are ""permanently irritated with the BBC and accept that the BBC does things that are stupid and is occasionally arrogant,"" they agree ""that nevertheless, it's an institution worth defending"". Many MPs say those who are unwilling or unable to pay the compulsory fee - which from April will rise by Â£3 to Â£157.50 a year - should not be prosecuted. The BBC has warned such a change could have a significant impact on its finances and potentially put some of its output at risk. The Conservatives' election victory has triggered a wider debate about how the BBC should be funded in future and whether the licence fee, which is protected in law until 2027 when the BBC's current Royal Charter ends, is still the best model. During the campaign Boris Johnson, who worked for the Daily Telegraph, Spectator and other titles during a 30-year career in journalism, said the licence fee looked outmoded and its abolition needed ""looking at"". The Sunday Times reported senior aides as saying the PM was ""really strident"" about the need for major changes at the BBC. It said there was support in No 10 for the broadcaster being downsized and to sell off the majority of its 61 national and local radio stations. BBC chairman Sir David Clementi has warned that putting the broadcaster's services behind a paywall would lessen its ability to ""bring the country together"". More than 100,000 people have signed a petition calling for an end to ""political attacks"" on the BBC and for politicians to support the role the BBC ""plays in independently holding the government to account"". But other Conservatives said the BBC must ""get its house in order"" if it wanted to continue in its current form. Simon Hoare, chairman of the Northern Ireland select committee, said the broadcaster must immediately reverse its decision toremove free TV licence from millions of over-75s.from this June.

And Jonathan Gullis, the MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, described the licence fee as ""outmoded"" and said there were alternative models including funding services through advertising. He told BBC Radio Stoke that while he was a big supporter of local radio, the taxpayer should ""not necessarily have to fund it all"". Asked on Monday whether the broadcaster would be told to shut down some of its channels, a Downing Street spokesman said: ""How the BBC is run is a matter for the BBC."" He added: ""I would point you to what the prime minister has said on this before, which was 'at this stage we are not planning to get rid of all licence fees, though I am certainly looking at it'."" Labour's shadow culture secretary Tracy Brabin called on new Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden, who was appointed in last week's reshuffle, to ""speak up for"" public service broadcasting and ensure the BBC remained ""fit for the future"".

Forbes appointed new Scottish finance secretary,"Kate Forbes was formerly public finance minister, but has now been promoted Kate Forbes has been appointed as the Scottish government's new finance secretary following the resignation of Derek Mackay. The 29-year-old became the first woman to set out a budget at Holyrood or Westminster when she stepped in for Mr Mackay earlier this month. In a reshuffle of Nicola Sturgeon's cabinet, Fiona Hyslop will now take on extra responsibility for the economy. Jenny Gilruth has joined the government as Europe minister. Ms Sturgeon said the appointments ""bring new talent into government and deliver a real focus, not only on driving forward our economy, but also on addressing the challenges of Brexit, increasing our population and ending Scotland's contribution to the climate crisis"". The appointments of Ms Forbes and Ms Gilruth will be confirmed in a vote by MSPs on Tuesday. Scots finance secretary quits over messages to boy No extra cash for budget deals Ms Forbes was praised by both SNP colleagues and opposition MSPs after stepping in due to Mr Mackay's resignation on the eve of the budget. Mr Mackay quit on 5 February after saying he had ""behaved foolishly"" by sending hundreds of social media messages to a 16-year-old boy. He was subsequently suspended from the SNP pending investigation, and Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that he ""is receiving some medical assessment and treatment and won't be in parliament over the next few days"". Ms Forbes set out the government's tax and spending plans in his place, and defended them during a scrutiny session with Holyrood's finance committee. MSPs are due to debate the plans on 27 February, giving her only a few weeks to secure a budget deal with opposition parties. Ms Sturgeon said she was pleased to promote ""two incredibly talented colleagues"" The reshuffle of the cabinet sees the finance and economy portfolios split up, with Ms Forbes taking the finance role and Fiona Hyslop adding economy and fair work to her previous job of culture secretary. Ms Hyslop's responsibilities for external affairs and tourism are being taken on by Constitution Secretary Mike Russell and Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing respectively. In the junior ministerial team, Ben Macpherson takes on Ms Forbes' old job of public finance minister, while Ms Gilruth has entered government to replace him as Europe and international development minister. Ms Sturgeon said she was ""pleased to be able to put Scotland's finances and economy into the hands of two incredibly talented colleagues"". She said Ms Forbes and Ms Hyslop would ""continue to drive forward our economy, support our key industries and maintain Scotland's long tradition as an outward-looking, dynamic and enterprising nation"". Meanwhile Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said Ms Forbes' promotion was ""well-deserved"", but said that ""no shuffling of personnel can disguise the fact that the SNP's time in government is up"". After 18 months as a junior minister, Ms Forbes has now replaced Derek Mackay as finance secretary Having become a full cabinet secretary during her first term in parliament and still shy of her 30th birthday, Ms Forbes is one of the SNP's fastest-rising stars. Born in Dingwall, she was raised in Glasgow and India - where her father worked to provide healthcare to those unable to afford it - before studying history at the University of Cambridge. She worked as an accountant in the banking industry and as an assistant to MSP Dave Thompson, before being nominated to succeed him as SNP candidate for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch in the 2016 Holyrood election. Ms Forbes held the seat witha comfortable 24.8% majority. As a backbencher, she campaigned to ban plastic straws and once gave a speech in the Holyrood chamber entirely in Gaelic. She entered government as minister for public finance and the digital economy in June 2018, working alongside Mr Mackay - and has now replaced him as both finance secretary and as the favourite with many bookmakers to eventually succeed Ms Sturgeon as first minister.

Jeff Bezos pledges $10bn to fight climate change,"Amazon boss Jeff Bezos has pledged $10bn (Â£7.7bn) to help fight climate change. The world's richest man said the money would finance work by scientists, activists and other groups. He said: ""I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change."" Writing on his Instagram account, Mr Bezos said the fund would begin distributing money this summer. Mr Bezos has an estimated net worth of more than $130bn, so the pledge represents almost 8% of his fortune. Some Amazon employees have urged him to do more to fight climate change. There have been walkouts and some staff have spoken publicly. Also, Mr Bezos is financing the Blue Origin space programme. Compared to some multi-billionaires, Mr Bezos had done only limited philanthropy. His biggest donation before Monday's pledge is thought to have been $2bn in September 2018 to help homeless families and fund schools. He has also been criticised for not signing the Giving Pledge, under which the super-rich promise to give away half of their wealth during their lifetimes. The Seattle-based company is a neighbour of Microsoft, which in January unveiled a plan to become carbon negative by 2030. Mr Bezos's full Instagram post read: ""Today, I'm thrilled to announce I am launching the Bezos Earth Fund.â£â£â£ â£â£â£""Climate change is the biggest threat to our planet. I want to work alongside others both to amplify known ways and to explore new ways of fighting the devastating impact of climate change on this planet we all share. This global initiative will fund scientists, activists, NGOs - any effort that offers a real possibility to help preserve and protect the natural world. ""We can save Earth. It's going to take collective action from big companies, small companies, nation states, global organisations, and individuals. â£â£â£ â£â£â£""I'm committing $10bn to start and will begin issuing grants this summer.

David Lloyd Club facing prosecution over death,"Rocco Wright died in the David Lloyd Leisure pool in Leeds in April 2018 A leisure group is facing prosecution after a three-year-old boy drowned in one of its swimming pools. Rocco Wright died after being found in the pool at the David Lloyd Leisure centre in Moortown, Leeds, in 2018. Earlier on Monday a jury inquest at Wakefield Coroner's Court ruled his death was accidental. After the inquest Leeds City Council said it believed the group had breached health and safety laws and intended to ""prosecute in the near future"". In a statement, the council said: ""The death of a child in any circumstances is tragic, and we continue to offer the Wright family our sincerest sympathy. ""We will keep in regular contact with the family and ensure they are informed and supported throughout this next stage."" The inquest previously heard how Rocco had to be pulled from the water by his father Steven Wright in April 2018. Mr Wright described how his panic grew as he searched for Rocco before he spotted him at the bottom of the main pool. He said his son had never got into the pool by himself and the inquest heard there were no witnesses or CCTV evidence that could explain how Rocco ended up in the water. The jury found that the youngster had probably been under the 1.2m (4ft) deep water for more than two minutes. Police said there were no witnesses or CCTV to help determine how Rocco got into the pool Jurors were told that at the time of the drowning, there had only been one 17-year-old lifeguard on duty. David Lloyd Leisure's operations director Stephen Brown denied in the inquest there had been cuts to the lifeguard budget at the pool. He told the hearing the company's policy was that a maximum of 50 people in a pool could be supervised by a single lifeguard. Mr Brown also denied David Lloyd Leisure had a policy of employing young lifeguards because they were cheaper and added lifeguard staffing levels were for local managers to decide. Outside the coroner's court, Natalie Marrison - representing Catharine and Steven Wright - said Rocco's parents supported Leeds City Council's investigation and planned prosecution. Ms Marrison said: ""At the heart of this is a three-year-old boy who has lost his life. ""The family remain devastated by the loss."" Mr Wright said that the family had ""lost the fun from our lives"" following Rocco's death. ""We're definitely going to fight for further law and guidelines in this field, just to make sure it can't happen to anyone else,"" he said. ""No-one should lose a child at a family swim session."" In a statement after the inquest, David Lloyd Leisure said it wanted ""to express our deepest sympathies to Rocco's family"". ""David Lloyd Leisure never places profit above safety,"" the company said. ""Subsequent evidence given by David Lloyd Leisure at the inquest showed no evidence of budget cuts to lifeguarding at the Leeds Club at the time of the accident, on the contrary lifeguarding had in fact received increased investment."" The firm added that safety was its ""number one priority"" and it was ""unaware on what basis Leeds City Council intend to prosecute"". The jury returned its conclusion after coroner Jonathan Leach told jurors that accident was the only one available to them.

Rescue plan 'considered' for virus cruise Britons,"About 3,700 people are quarantined on board the Diamond Princess The Foreign Office is ""considering all options"" for Britons trapped on a quarantined cruise liner in Japan struck by coronavirus - including flying them home. Some of the 74 UK passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess said they felt ""forgotten"", asother countries flew citizens home. The ship was quarantined on 3 February. Meanwhile, a hotel at Heathrow Airport has been block-booked to isolate arrivals suspected of having the virus. On Monday, Japanese officials said there were 99 new cases of infections on board the ship, bringing the total to 454 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. It emerged that about 3,700 passengers and crew could be stuck in quarantine beyond the initial 19 February deadline. How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? Coronavirus: What you need to know Are coronavirus tests flawed? A Number 10 spokesman said: ""We sympathise with all those caught up in this extremely difficult situation. ""The Foreign Office is in contact with all British people on the Diamond Princess, including to establish interest in a possible repatriation flight."" He said the government is ""urgently considering all options to guarantee the health and safety of those on board"". Earlier,passenger David Abel called for the government to evacuate the British citizens on board, saying: ""It feels that we have been forgotten."" David Abel said he had little confidence the UK government would rescue him and his wife Mr Abel's son, Steve, said in a message posted on YouTube his parents were beginning to feel the effects of ""stress"" and ""confinement"" after 28 days on the ship. ""I want my mum and dad to wake up in the morning and actually have some information sent to them - they need to be communicated with,"" he wrote. All rooms at the Holiday Inn Heathrow Ariel hotel have been booked by the government to quarantine passengers displaying symptoms of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. The move is expected mostly to apply to foreign nationals from the most affected countries who arrive in the UK showing symptoms, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. The rooms will be used to isolate suspected cases while test results are awaited. Meanwhile, Chinese nationals in the UK whose visas are close to expiring will have their stay automatically extended, the government announced. The Home Office said it recognised that some may be facing uncertainty over their visas due to travel restrictions imposed after the outbreak. The new guidance issued to Chinese nationals advises that if their visa is due to expire between January 24 and March 30, it will be automatically extended until March 31. Airlines have cancelled flights and the Foreign Office updated its guidance at the end of January to advise ""against all but essential"" travel to mainland China. The number of people tested for the coronavirus in the UK has risen sharply, with an additional 1,392 tests carried out on Sunday alone. It brings the total number of tests to 4,501 as of 14:00 GMT on Monday, with nine confirmed positive. NHS leaders said they believed the health service was able to cope. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals and other trusts, said ""the system is under enormous pressure"" but the NHS is ""very used to dealing with emergencies of all kinds"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are contingency plans if things get worse."" Eight of those who contracted the virushave since been discharged from hospitalafter two negative tests showed they were now clear of the infection. This video can not be played ""I think it will be fine,"" says NHS Confederation chief Niall Dickson All 94 people who had been in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral have also been released, NHS England said on Saturday. They had been kept in isolation at the hospital after returning to the UK from Wuhan in China, the centre of the outbreak. More than 100 people remain in isolation in Milton Keynes after being repatriated back to the UK on a later rescue flight. However, schools are being told by they do not need to close or send staff or pupils home if there is only a suspected case of coronavirus, rather than a positive test. If tests are positive, health protection teams will speak to the head teacher and action will be taken. The advice from Public Health England comes after some schools in Brighton told concerned parents they can choose to keep their children away from school as an authorised absence, even if a coronavirus case is only suspected. PHE says that it will continue to advise people who have been in close contact with a confirmed case to self-isolate. It is believed to have advised at least seven schools in Brighton, Hove and Eastbourne that a member of staff or pupil should stay at home for 14 days. The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent handwashing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service. The main focus is on rapidly identifying people with the disease and taking them to specialist hospitals for treatment in isolation. They are then tracing anybody who has come into close contact with the patient to make sure they know the signs of the disease and what to do. The coronavirus death toll in mainland China rose by 105 to 1,770, in figures announced early on Monday morning. Chinese authorities also reported the number of new cases had increased slightly on the previous day's figure after falling for three consecutive days. A total of 2,048 new cases were reported across the country on Monday - 1,933 of which were from Hubei. More than 70,500 people nationwide have already been infected.

Brexit negotiator: UK must be able to set own laws,"David Frost set out the UK's stance ahead of post-Brexit trade talks The UK ""must have the ability to set laws that suit us,"" the PM's chief Brexit negotiator has said in a speech in Brussels. David Frost has set out the UK's stance ahead of post-Brexit trade negotiations, due to start next month. He dismissed the idea an EU court would have a role in future trade disputes, saying: ""We only want what other independent countries have."" It comes as France warns Britain to expect a bruising battle during talks. Acting Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey said: ""Boris Johnson should listen to the views of British businesses who want to maintain the closest possible alignment with the European Union."" France warns UK of bitter post-Brexit trade talks What does the UK sell to the rest of the world? What happens after Brexit? What is the transition period? Addressing students and academics at the UniversitÃ© libre de Bruxelles, Mr Frost said: ""It is central to our vision that we must have the ability to set laws that suit us - to claim the right that every other non-EU country in the world has. ""So to think that we might accept EU supervision on so-called level playing field issues simply fails to see the point of what we are doing."" He said this was not a ""a simple negotiating position which might move under pressure - it is the point of the whole project"". The UK wants aCanada-type free trade agreementwith the EU, Mr Frost said. If this cannot be agreed, then Britain will trade on the basic international terms it currently follows with Australia. He said the UK will set out more details of its vision for the future relationship with the EU next week. Mr Frost also reiterated the government's insistence that it will not extend the transition period beyond the end of this year. The transition period runs until 31 December 2020, during which time the UK continues follow EU rules - including freedom of movement. It is intended to allow time for the UK and the EU to agree a post-Brexit trade agreement. What is a level playing field? Brexit: Will it be a Canadian or an Australian ending? Britain 'will not be aligning with EU rules' - Raab One of the key sticking points could be the idea of ensuring a level playing field - which was referred to by Mr Frost in his speech. The EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition - known as level-playing-field guarantees - so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. The EU has repeatedly warned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy continued ""high-quality"" market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards. It also wants the European Court of Justice to have a legal role in policing any free trade agreement reached. But in his speech, Mr Frost asked: ""How would you feel if the UK demanded that, to protect ourselves, the EU dynamically harmonise with our national laws set in Westminster and the decisions of our own regulators and courts? ""The more thoughtful would say that such an approach would compromise the EU's sovereign legal order."" This was a rare public appearance by the man who'll run Boris Johnson's negotiations with the EU. David Frost told the audience at a university in Brussels that the whole point of the UK's departure was so it could set its own laws for its own benefit. And that's why Britain couldn't accept the continued application of European rules or the involvement of Brussels in competition policy as the conditions for an ambitious free trade agreement. The question is whether that can be reconciled with the EU's position that it has to apply more stringent safeguards to its neighbour than it does to Canada, Japan or South Korea. This carefully controlled event in front of some students, a few diplomats and a lot fewer journalists was designed to show the post-Brexit politics of Britain, not to spell out the government's opening negotiating position in detail. That'll come next week, when the EU is expected to do the same. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has previously cast doubt on Boris Johnson's aim to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year Speaking on Sunday, French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian predicted the two sides would ""rip each other apart"" as they strove for advantage in the negotiations. ""But that is part of negotiations, everyone will defend their own interests,"" he added. He also said it would be tough for the UK to achieve its aim of agreeing a free trade deal by the end of the year. Speaking at a security conference in Munich, Mr Le Drian said the two sides were far apart on a range of issues.

Love Island's tribute to 'much-loved' Flack,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Love Island narrator Iain Stirling has said he is ""absolutely devastated"" at the death of his colleague Caroline Flack, in a tribute on the ITV2 show. The message in Monday's episode came after the TV host, 40, wasfound dead in her north London home on Saturday. ""You were a true friend to me,"" Stirling said. He added that Flack's ""warmth and infectious enthusiasm"" were ""crucial"" to the show's success. A lawyer for Flack's family said she had taken her own life. The Love Island episode was the first to air after her death. ITV had cancelled two episodes as a mark of respect for the presenter. Flack was replaced as host of the dating show after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend last year. Speaking at the opening of the show, Stirling said: ""We are absolutely devastated by the tragic news that Caroline, a much-loved member of our Love Island family, has passed away. ""Our thoughts are with her family and friends at this dreadful time. ""Caroline and me were together from the very start of Love Island and her passion, warmth and infectious enthusiasm were a crucial part of what made the show connect with millions of viewers."" If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. Stirling's message was broadcast to images of the ocean, in keeping with the usual opening shots at the beginning of each episode - but to mark the tribute there was no background music. Stirling's voice broke as he added: ""Caroline, I want to thank you for all the fun times we had making our favourite show. You were a true friend to me. I'm going to miss you, Caz."" The tribute ended with a photo of Flack on screen. The image was repeated at the end of the episode. Looking back at Caroline Flack's career Presenter attacks trolls over Flack death Flack's boyfriend: 'My heart is broken' In a statement released on Monday, ITV's director of televisionKevin Lygo said staff at the TV station were ""devastated""and ""still trying to process this tragic news"". He said Flack had been part of the dating show ""from the very beginning"", was ""very vocal"" in her support of the show, and that viewers ""could relate to her and she to them"". Lygo stressed that ITV ""made it clear that the door was left open for her to return and the Love Island production team remained in regular contact with her and continued to offer support over the last few months"". It was confirmed on Tuesday that the inquest into the death of the presenter is due open on Wednesday morning at Poplar Coroner's Court in east London. ITV cancelled Monday night's episode of Love Island: Aftersun and said it would not be releasing a Love Island: The Morning After podcast on Tuesday morning.

That includes asking how serious the offence is, the harm caused to the victim and whether prosecution is a proportionate response. Former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said his impression was that the case had been determined to be a serious case, and one which the CPS felt it should proceed with ""regardless of what the victim thought"".

"David Lloyd Club facing prosecution over deathRocco Wright, three, drowned in a David Lloyd Leisure pool in the Moortown area of Leeds in 2018.Leeds & West Yorkshire","Rocco Wright died in the David Lloyd Leisure pool in Leeds in April 2018 A leisure group is facing prosecution after a three-year-old boy drowned in one of its swimming pools. Rocco Wright died after being found in the pool at the David Lloyd Leisure centre in Moortown, Leeds, in 2018. Earlier on Monday a jury inquest at Wakefield Coroner's Court ruled his death was accidental. After the inquest Leeds City Council said it believed the group had breached health and safety laws and intended to ""prosecute in the near future"". In a statement, the council said: ""The death of a child in any circumstances is tragic, and we continue to offer the Wright family our sincerest sympathy. ""We will keep in regular contact with the family and ensure they are informed and supported throughout this next stage."" The inquest previously heard how Rocco had to be pulled from the water by his father Steven Wright in April 2018. Mr Wright described how his panic grew as he searched for Rocco before he spotted him at the bottom of the main pool. He said his son had never got into the pool by himself and the inquest heard there were no witnesses or CCTV evidence that could explain how Rocco ended up in the water. The jury found that the youngster had probably been under the 1.2m (4ft) deep water for more than two minutes. Police said there were no witnesses or CCTV to help determine how Rocco got into the pool Jurors were told that at the time of the drowning, there had only been one 17-year-old lifeguard on duty. David Lloyd Leisure's operations director Stephen Brown denied in the inquest there had been cuts to the lifeguard budget at the pool. He told the hearing the company's policy was that a maximum of 50 people in a pool could be supervised by a single lifeguard. Mr Brown also denied David Lloyd Leisure had a policy of employing young lifeguards because they were cheaper and added lifeguard staffing levels were for local managers to decide. Outside the coroner's court, Natalie Marrison - representing Catharine and Steven Wright - said Rocco's parents supported Leeds City Council's investigation and planned prosecution. Ms Marrison said: ""At the heart of this is a three-year-old boy who has lost his life. ""The family remain devastated by the loss."" Mr Wright said that the family had ""lost the fun from our lives"" following Rocco's death. ""We're definitely going to fight for further law and guidelines in this field, just to make sure it can't happen to anyone else,"" he said. ""No-one should lose a child at a family swim session."" In a statement after the inquest, David Lloyd Leisure said it wanted ""to express our deepest sympathies to Rocco's family"". ""David Lloyd Leisure never places profit above safety,"" the company said. ""Subsequent evidence given by David Lloyd Leisure at the inquest showed no evidence of budget cuts to lifeguarding at the Leeds Club at the time of the accident, on the contrary lifeguarding had in fact received increased investment."" The firm added that safety was its ""number one priority"" and it was ""unaware on what basis Leeds City Council intend to prosecute"". The jury returned its conclusion after coroner Jonathan Leach told jurors that accident was the only one available to them.

No 10 refuses to condemn adviser's remarks,"Labour is calling for Andrew Sabisky to be sacked from his adviser position Downing Street has refused to condemn controversial past remarks on pregnancies, eugenics and race reportedly made by a new adviser. Labour said Andrew Sabisky should be sacked for suggesting black people had lower average IQs than white people and compulsory contraception could prevent ""creating a permanent underclass"". No 10 did not officially confirm his appointment or any role he may have. The SNP and Liberal Democrats also said Mr Sabisky should go. PM's aide Cummings calls for civil service changes Mr Sabisky, appointed after the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings called for ""misfits and weirdos"" to apply for jobs in Downing Street, has been contacted by the BBC for comment. When asked on Monday, Downing Street did not comment on the remarks attributed to Mr Sabisky. Boris Johnson's spokesman added: ""The prime minister's views on a range of subjects are well publicised and documented."" Lobby briefings see journalists pile into a room to ask the Prime Minister's official spokesman whatever they like. It doesn't mean that the spokesman - or in today's case the deputy - will give a fulsome answer. And certainly, today, one was not forthcoming. The spokesman was asked about the PM's views on eugenics. On race. On women's sport. Repeatedly. Rather than explicitly condemn Andrew Sabisky's reported remarks the response was to point to Boris Johnson ""well documented"" views. But it proved to be an inadequate effort to deflect the story; adding fuel to the fire rather than dampening it down. And, of course, Boris Johnson has been known to attract criticism for some of his own controversial comments - on a variety of subjects - in the past. The normal laws of politics might dictate that Andrew Sabisky is in line to lose the job he's so recently attained. But this Downing Street operation has shown that it isn't afraid of a bit of controversy. It doesn't necessarily feel bound by the 'rules'. And Dominic Cummings has, at times, appeared to enjoy outraging the establishment. That isn't to say the views apparently expressed by Andrew Sabisky are in anyway shared by his new colleagues at Number 10.  And it may be that today's hesitant and tight-lipped response was a clumsy effort to buy time rather than a decisive show of defiance. However if they don't sack Andrew Sabisky, that is exactly what it will be. In response,Conservative MP Caroline Nokes tweeted:,external""Cannot believe No 10 has refused to comment on Andrew Sabisky. I don't know him from a bar of soap, but don't think we'd get on... must be no place in government for the views he's expressed."" In a comment on a 2014 blog post,externalon Mr Cummings' website, made by a user called ""Andrew Sabisky"" that used the same picture as his Twitter page, it is suggested that compulsory contraception could be used to stop a ""permanent underclass"". ""One way to get around the problems of unplanned pregnancies creating a permanent underclass would be to legally enforce universal uptake of long-term contraception at the onset of puberty,"" says the post. Dominic Cummings has sought to bring advisers into No 10 from outside the normal channels ""Vaccination laws give it a precedent, I would argue."" In a comment on another blog post,externalon a different website in 2014, what appears to be the same user suggested black Americans had a lower average IQ than white Americans. In a comment on a different blog,externalthat same year, a user with his name said: ""There are excellent reasons to think the very real racial differences in intelligence are significantly - even mostly - genetic in origin, though the degree is of course a very serious subject of scholarly debate."" Mr Sabiskyalso suggested to Schools Week in July 2016,externalthat the benefits of a purported cognitive enhancer, which can prove fatal, are ""probably worth a dead kid once a year"". ""Eugenics are about selecting 'for' good things,"" he said in the same interview. ""Intelligence is largely inherited and it correlates with better outcomes: physical health, income, lower mental illness. And in a Twitter post from 2019,external, he said: ""I am always straight up in saying that women's sport is more comparable to the Paralympics than it is to men's."" Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery said: ""It is disgusting that not only has Number 10 failed to condemn [these] appalling comments, but also seems to have endorsed the idea that white people are more intelligent than black people. ""Boris Johnson should have the backbone to make a statement in his own words on why he has made this appointment, whether he stands by it, and his own views on the subject of eugenics.""

Acting Liberal Democrat leader Ed Davey urged the prime minister to ""put an end to the offence caused and sack Andrew Sabisky"".

There are cancellations and significant delays on trains after a month's worth of rain fell in 48 hours. Roads across south and mid Wales remain blocked by floods and landslips. Meanwhile, homes were evacuated in Monmouth on Monday night after two severe flood warnings for the River Wye were declared. The river's water levels are predicted to reach 7.2m (23ft) between 03:00 and 07:00 on Tuesday. And more rain has been forecast with aMet Office yellow warning for rain,externalissued from 18:00 GMT on Wednesday until 15:00 on Thursday in areas of south, mid and north Wales. Inside a flooded kitchen in Nantgarw People living in areas at immediate risk in Monmouth have been evacuated and other properties nearby have been provided with sandbags and support.

It said 163mm (6.5in) of rain had fallen in the 48 hours between lunchtime on Friday and Sunday and described the scale of flooding as ""unprecedented"". Meanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has defended the Welsh Government's investment into flood defences following the widespread damage after Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it ""clearly isn't adequate"". First Minister Mark Drakeford meets householder Caroline Jones in her flood-affected house in Pontypridd Mr Drakeford said the impact of the weekend's events would have been ""even worse"" if there had not been major investment in flood defences, adding a Â£350m programme was ongoing over this assembly term. ""The impact of global warming is real and there for anyone to see, the science tells us we will have to face in greater frequency these intense weather events in future,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government would work with local authorities to repair infrastructure damage by flooding including bridges, roads and existing flood defences and explore whether there are funds available to help flood victims, local authorities and emergency services. ""For individuals our first focus will be on those families who don't have any form of insurance who lost everything and have no way of replacing it,"" he said.

This football pitch in Cwmbran turned into a boating lake for this canoeist A roof was carried into her garden from about 400m away Taff Street in Pontypridd was left underwater after heavy rain on Saturday and Sunday Clearing up in the centre of Pontypridd on Monday At the peak of the flooding on Sunday, we had 900 tonnes of water per second flowing down the River Taff. That's not just a massive amount of water flowing very fast, it's the damage it can bring, especially when debris is carried along in such a torrent. Well over a month's rainfall came in just 48 hours. This product of Storm Dennis came hot on the heels of Storm Ciara - drenching land that was already soaked through and filling rivers fast. Monitoring sites on rivers and streams flowing down from the mountains through the south Wales valleys started reporting record-breaking levels of water. We saw the highest levels ever recorded on the rivers Taff, Tawe, Neath, Rhondda, Cynon, Usk and the Wye. This shows river Taff levels at Pontypridd over the last month up until 1500 on Monday If we look at the NRW monitoring site at Pontypridd in isolation over the last month, the level surges to well over 5m on Sunday at the peak of Storm Dennis. Even down in Cardiff, river levels were 80cm higher than the previous record set in 1979. Since then, there has been widespread investment in flood defences across south Wales, which has played a big part in saving tens of thousands of homes from damage this time around. That will be no comfort to those people closest to rivers, who have still been affected, All the science around climate change is suggesting that weather events like this will become more frequent and more extreme. So the questions that are sure to be asked over the coming weeks and months is how we cope with that.

Love Island to return with Caroline Flack tribute,"An ITV boss has said staff at the TV station are ""devastated"" by the ""tragic"" death of ex-Love Island presenter Caroline Flack. Director of television Kevin Lygo said that when Flack stepped down after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend, the door was left open for her to return as host on the ITV2 show. Tonight's episode will carry a tribute to her from Iain Stirling and the team. A lawyer for Flack's family said she had taken her own life. In a statement, Lygo, ITV's director of television, said Flack had been part of the dating show ""from the very beginning"" and her ""passion, dedication and boundless energy contributed to the show's success"". Caroline ""was very vocal"" in her support of the show, and viewers ""could relate to her and she to them"", he said. Lygo added that, after Flack stepped down, the channel ""made it clear that the door was left open for her to return"". He said the show's team remained in ""regular contact with her"" and ""continued to offer support over the last few months"". ""We will all miss her very much,"" he added. Who decides whether someone should go on trial? Looking back at Caroline Flack's career Love Island is to return tonight after two episodes over the weekend were cancelled after the 40-year-old was found dead in her north London home on Saturday. ITV confirmed companion show Love Island: Aftersun will not air on Monday while the Morning After podcast will not take place on Tuesday. In a joint statement, ITV and Just Eat, Love Island's advertising partner, said they have worked with Samaritans to replace the branding for tonight's episode ""so that anyone affected by Caroline's death can access support"". Laura Whitmore replaced her as host of the dating show after Flack was charged with assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, last December, and had been due to stand trial. Flack denied the charge. Her management company said she had been ""under huge pressure"" since the assault charge. Following her death, a petition was launched calling for new laws to prevent sections of the media ""knowingly and relentlessly bullying people, famous or not"". The petition, calling for the introduction of ""Caroline's Law"", has had more than 500,000 signatures so far. If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. Dozens of celebrities, friend and former Love Island contestants have paid tribute to Flack, who had also co-hosted The X Factor andwon Strictly Come Dancing in 2014, describing her death as ""heartbreaking"". Flack's friend Mollie Grosberg called Flack's death a ""massive and painful and heartbreaking loss"". She also shared on Instagram a picture of Flack taken on Friday night, the last time she saw her. On Sunday, Mr Burton wrotean emotional tribute to FlackonInstagram,external, promising he would ""try [to] make you proud everyday"". ""I am so lost for words I am in so much pain I miss you so much I know you felt safe with me you always said I don't think about anything else when I am with you and I was not allowed to be there this time I kept asking and asking,"" the 27-year-old tennis player wrote. Flack's management company has criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for refusing to drop the charge against her, even though Mr Burton said he did not want the case to go ahead. Bail conditions had stopped Flack having any contact with Mr Burton ahead of her trial next month. This video can not be played Caroline Flack won a British Academy Television Award for Love Island in 2018 The CPS said it would not comment on the specifics of the case but in response to questions about its role, it outlined on Sundayhow it reached decisions,externalover whether or not to charge someone. A statement said: ""We do not decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence - that is for the jury, judge or magistrate - but we must make the key decision of whether a case should be put before a court."" It said every decision over whether to charge someone is based on the same two-stage test - does the evidence provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and is it in the public interest to prosecute? That includes asking how serious the offence is, the harm caused to the victim and whether prosecution is a proportionate response. Former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said his impression was that the case had been determined to be a serious case, and one which the CPS felt it should proceed with ""regardless of what the victim thought"".

France warns UK of bitter post-Brexit trade talks,"French foreign minister Jean-Yves Le Drian predicted the two sides would ""rip each other apart"" France has warned Britain to expect a bruising battle with the EU in post-Brexit trade negotiations. French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian predicted the two sides would ""rip each other apart"" as they strove for advantage in the negotiations. He also said it would be tough for the UK to achieve its aim of agreeing a free trade deal by the end of the year. The UK government said it wanted a deal based on ""friendly co-operation between sovereign equals"". Boris Johnson's chief Brexit negotiator is expected to give more details of the UK's negotiating aims in a speech in Brussels later. David Frost is expected to say the UK will be happy with a trade deal based on thatagreed by the EU with Canada in 2016but to rule out any form of regulatory alignment with the bloc from 2021 onwards. What does the UK sell to the rest of the world? What happens after Brexit? What is the transition period? The UK formally left the EU two weeks ago but still trades like a member under a transition period which ends on 31 December. Talks on their future relationship are set to begin next month once the EU's 27 members have agreed the bloc's negotiating mandate. Speaking at a security conference in Munich on Sunday, Mr Le Drian said the two sides were far apart on a range of issues. He said: ""I think that on trade issues and the mechanism for future relations, which we are going to start on, we are going to rip each other apart. ""But that is part of negotiations, everyone will defend their own interests."" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has previously cast doubt on Boris Johnson's aim to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year Mr Le Drian, a close ally of President Emmanuel Macron, is the latest senior EU figure to warn that the negotiations will be difficult. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and chief negotiator Michel Barnier have both cast doubt on Boris Johnson's aim to reach a comprehensive agreement by the end of the year. Brexit: What is a level playing field? Brexit: Will it be a Canadian or an Australian ending? Britain 'will not be aligning with EU rules' - Raab The EU has repeatedly warned that the UK cannot expect to enjoy continued ""high-quality"" market access if it insists on diverging from EU social and environmental standards. Last week the European Parliament called for the UK to follow EU rules in a host of areas, such as chemicals regulation, food labelling and subsidies for companies, as part of a process of ""dynamic alignment"". But UK ministers have repeatedly ruled out such a close regulatory relationship. There is expected to be a particularly tough fight over fishing rights, with the EU insisting continued access to UK waters must form part of any agreement. Mr Johnson, in turn, has said the UK will act as an ""independent coastal state"" taking control of its own fisheries. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""Our approach is clear - we are not asking for anything special, bespoke or unique, but are looking for a deal like those the EU has struck previously with other friendly countries like Canada. ""We want a relationship based on friendly cooperation between sovereign equals, one centred on free trade and inspired by our shared history and values.""

Love Island to return with Caroline Flack tributeIt comes after Saturday and Sunday's episodes were cancelled following the ex-host's death aged 40.Entertainment & Arts,"An ITV boss has said staff at the TV station are ""devastated"" by the ""tragic"" death of ex-Love Island presenter Caroline Flack. Director of television Kevin Lygo said that when Flack stepped down after being charged with assaulting her boyfriend, the door was left open for her to return as host on the ITV2 show. Tonight's episode will carry a tribute to her from Iain Stirling and the team. A lawyer for Flack's family said she had taken her own life. In a statement, Lygo, ITV's director of television, said Flack had been part of the dating show ""from the very beginning"" and her ""passion, dedication and boundless energy contributed to the show's success"". Caroline ""was very vocal"" in her support of the show, and viewers ""could relate to her and she to them"", he said. Lygo added that, after Flack stepped down, the channel ""made it clear that the door was left open for her to return"". He said the show's team remained in ""regular contact with her"" and ""continued to offer support over the last few months"". ""We will all miss her very much,"" he added. Who decides whether someone should go on trial? Looking back at Caroline Flack's career Love Island is to return tonight after two episodes over the weekend were cancelled after the 40-year-old was found dead in her north London home on Saturday. ITV confirmed companion show Love Island: Aftersun will not air on Monday while the Morning After podcast will not take place on Tuesday. In a joint statement, ITV and Just Eat, Love Island's advertising partner, said they have worked with Samaritans to replace the branding for tonight's episode ""so that anyone affected by Caroline's death can access support"". Laura Whitmore replaced her as host of the dating show after Flack was charged with assaulting her boyfriend, Lewis Burton, last December, and had been due to stand trial. Flack denied the charge. Her management company said she had been ""under huge pressure"" since the assault charge. Following her death, a petition was launched calling for new laws to prevent sections of the media ""knowingly and relentlessly bullying people, famous or not"". The petition, calling for the introduction of ""Caroline's Law"", has had more than 500,000 signatures so far. If you or someone you know needs support for issues about emotional distress,these organisationsmay be able to help. Dozens of celebrities, friend and former Love Island contestants have paid tribute to Flack, who had also co-hosted The X Factor andwon Strictly Come Dancing in 2014, describing her death as ""heartbreaking"". Flack's friend Mollie Grosberg called Flack's death a ""massive and painful and heartbreaking loss"". She also shared on Instagram a picture of Flack taken on Friday night, the last time she saw her. On Sunday, Mr Burton wrotean emotional tribute to FlackonInstagram,external, promising he would ""try [to] make you proud everyday"". ""I am so lost for words I am in so much pain I miss you so much I know you felt safe with me you always said I don't think about anything else when I am with you and I was not allowed to be there this time I kept asking and asking,"" the 27-year-old tennis player wrote. Flack's management company has criticised the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) for refusing to drop the charge against her, even though Mr Burton said he did not want the case to go ahead. Bail conditions had stopped Flack having any contact with Mr Burton ahead of her trial next month. This video can not be played Caroline Flack won a British Academy Television Award for Love Island in 2018 The CPS said it would not comment on the specifics of the case but in response to questions about its role, it outlined on Sundayhow it reached decisions,externalover whether or not to charge someone. A statement said: ""We do not decide whether a person is guilty of a criminal offence - that is for the jury, judge or magistrate - but we must make the key decision of whether a case should be put before a court."" It said every decision over whether to charge someone is based on the same two-stage test - does the evidence provide a realistic prospect of conviction, and is it in the public interest to prosecute? That includes asking how serious the offence is, the harm caused to the victim and whether prosecution is a proportionate response. Former chief prosecutor Nazir Afzal said his impression was that the case had been determined to be a serious case, and one which the CPS felt it should proceed with ""regardless of what the victim thought"".

Forecasters set for 'billion pound' supercomputerA new supercomputer is to be built by 2022 to improve the accuracy of weather forecasting.,"Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis have both caused widespread wind and flooding damage Ever wondered why your village was suddenly flooded by a thunderstorm the weather forecasters hadn't mentioned? Or why they failed to warn you about the dense fog shrouding your home in the morning? The fact is that predicting the ""big picture"" of future conditions has got a lot better - Storm Dennis was spotted six days before it arrived. But getting local forecasts right - street by street and hour by hour - is still a massive challenge. And that might now change as the Met Office secures the help of a supercomputer project costing Â£1.2bn. Better forecasting means handling more data, more rapidly, and running it through simulations of the atmosphere more accurately. Already the Met Office is pulling in more than 200 billion observations from satellites, weather stations and buoys out in the ocean every single day, and that's set to increase. And working out if a summer downpour will flood your home or one down the road requires more and more processing power. London breaks a high-pressure record Weather forecasters start using space laser data The Met Office's existing supercomputer ""We'll be streets ahead of anybody else,"" according to Penny Endersby, chief executive of the Met Office. ""Ultimately it'll make a difference to every individual, every government department, every industry as people see forecasts becoming steadily better."" It'll be the biggest investment in the 170-year history of the organisation and will dwarf the Â£97m bill for the current supercomputer. In the new project, the billion-plus cost will cover not just the hardware itself but all the running costs too over a ten-year period. There'll be a first stage installation, which should be six times more capable than the supercomputer used now. And then five years later there'll be a major upgrade to increase performance by a further three times. It'll run what the Met Office calls its ""digital twin"" of the Earth's atmosphere, a highly detailed ""model"" of everything from the winds to the temperatures to the pressures. The new supercomputer will be six times more capable than the current one To create this simulated picture of our weather, the globe is divided into grid squares. These have become smaller as the technology has advanced - and the smaller the better because that means more accuracy. At the moment, the model of Earth is divided up into a grid of squares that are 10km across. The UK gets more detailed treatment: its squares are 1,500m across. London is studied with the aid of even smaller squares - 300m wide - mainly to improve the accuracy of forecasts for the airspace above the big airports. And the ambition, when the new supercomputer is up and running, is to operate at an even sharper resolution, down to a scale of 100m. The Met Office certainly believes it will. There's huge demand for better forecasting - from the military to the power companies to organisers of big outdoor events. It could guide Environment Agency teams deploying mobile flood barriers or help the National Grid balancing fluctuations in wind and solar power. Original supercomputer installed at the Met Office in Dunstable in 1959 And the prospect of rising global temperatures fuelling new and more dangerous extremes of weather makes accuracy all the more important. There has been a huge improvement in recent years - every passing decade has seen forecasts reach a whole day further into the future. A five-day forecast now is as accurate as a one-day forecast 40 years ago. So will the new computing power continue that advance? Penny Endersby prefers not to make any promises. ""I won't hang my hat on getting another day in the next decade,"" she says. ""But it will make our forecasts more accurate, more timely and more localised."" And the government has calculated what that could mean in hard cash: that for every pound invested, there should be Â£19 in economic benefit. That's the aim, with the digitally-simulated atmosphere also run far into the future to explore the effects of a hotter world. The effects of the rise of 1C over the past 150 years are still not fully understood, let alone those of bigger increases to come. It should mean researchers can add more detail to their projections, weaving in factors such as the way nitrogen reacts with the carbon in the air. And as the UK moves towards its target of net zero emissions by 2050, there'll be a chance to explore different options for how the country uses the land. For example, what will the effects be of planting new forests or protecting peat bogs or growing more biofuels? Like any huge IT installation, it'll certainly need a massive supply of electricity. That's why the Met Office is inviting the potential providers to come up with low-carbon options. And that's led to a radical idea.

Amazon store sold suspect child seats from Â£3.99,"The car seats ranged in price from Â£3.99 to Â£30.99 Amazon says it ""regrets"" that suspect child car seats have once again been found on sale on its UK store, and says it has removed them. The products were discovered by BBC Panorama as part of a wider-ranging programme. The US firm has repeatedly faced complaints about listing such seats. A case dating back to 2013 led to a trading standards investigation that confirmed one example would tear apart if involved in a 30mph (48km/h) crash. More recently, Which? magazine found examples on Amazon of fabric-based seats that lacked therequired safety labelling in 2019,external. Other outlets, including eBay, were also found to be selling the items at the time. Four obscure brands were involved in the latest case. One listing described the product as being an ""Infant Safe Seat"" capable of preventing injury to a baby if a car urgently braked. It was on sale for just Â£3.99. Panorama attempted to contact the brands involved. It received a reply from only one of them, which said it was not the manufacturer. The programme purchased three of the suspect seats. They appeared similar in design to some of those involved in the 2013 case and lacked safety labels. The documentary-maker alerted Surrey Trading Standards at the start of January. Officers have begun a fresh investigation but have yet to publish their findings. 'Killer car seats' sold online for Â£8 Amazon 'flooded by fake five-star reviews' Amazon: Christmas sales soar as other retailers struggle Amazon's UK chief said the company took proactive steps to ensure the products it sold were safe. ""Automated algorithms [survey] over five billion product pages every day and we monitors tens of millions of customer reviews,"" Doug Gurr said. In a follow-up statement, the firm added: ""Safety is extremely important to us and we regret that these products were available from third-party sellers using our stores. ""After a thorough investigation, we identified the issue and are removing these products, and we're also contacting each customer who purchased one of these products to explain the situation and issue a refund. ""We will continue to leverage and improve our tools and technology to ensure only safe and compliant car seats are available worldwide."" At present, the operators of online markets, including Amazon Marketplace, are exempt from liability if they are not aware of illegal content being sold on their platform. But Which? has campaigned for this to change as part of the forthcoming Online Harms Bill. ""The voluntary nature of current checks by marketplaces fails to recognise their role as the primary interface for consumers with the technical, as well as commercial, ability to hold their suppliers to account for consumer safety,""it blogged in November,external. ""Clearer government guidance is needed while this legislation is being drafted."" Amazon has sent emails to consumers who purchased the removed seats. They said: ""The product you received from a third-party seller may not be compliant with applicable child restraint standards. ""If you still have this product, please stop using it immediately, cut the straps to ensure it cannot be used, and dispose of the item.""

Forecasters set for 'billion pound' supercomputer,"Storm Ciara and Storm Dennis have both caused widespread wind and flooding damage Ever wondered why your village was suddenly flooded by a thunderstorm the weather forecasters hadn't mentioned? Or why they failed to warn you about the dense fog shrouding your home in the morning? The fact is that predicting the ""big picture"" of future conditions has got a lot better - Storm Dennis was spotted six days before it arrived. But getting local forecasts right - street by street and hour by hour - is still a massive challenge. And that might now change as the Met Office secures the help of a supercomputer project costing Â£1.2bn. Better forecasting means handling more data, more rapidly, and running it through simulations of the atmosphere more accurately. Already the Met Office is pulling in more than 200 billion observations from satellites, weather stations and buoys out in the ocean every single day, and that's set to increase. And working out if a summer downpour will flood your home or one down the road requires more and more processing power. London breaks a high-pressure record Weather forecasters start using space laser data The Met Office's existing supercomputer ""We'll be streets ahead of anybody else,"" according to Penny Endersby, chief executive of the Met Office. ""Ultimately it'll make a difference to every individual, every government department, every industry as people see forecasts becoming steadily better."" It'll be the biggest investment in the 170-year history of the organisation and will dwarf the Â£97m bill for the current supercomputer. In the new project, the billion-plus cost will cover not just the hardware itself but all the running costs too over a ten-year period. There'll be a first stage installation, which should be six times more capable than the supercomputer used now. And then five years later there'll be a major upgrade to increase performance by a further three times. It'll run what the Met Office calls its ""digital twin"" of the Earth's atmosphere, a highly detailed ""model"" of everything from the winds to the temperatures to the pressures.

GM scraps historic Holden car brand in Australia,"General Motors has said it will retire the iconic Australian car brand Holden as it leaves more markets. The American car giant said it will wind down Holden sales, design and engineering operations in Australia and New Zealand by next year. It also said China's Great Wall Motors had agreed to buy its manufacturing plant in Thailand. The announcement comes three years after GM ended manufacturing in Australia. In a statement posted on GM's website, chief executive Mary Barra said: ""I've often said that we will do the right thing, even when it's hard, and this is one of those times."" The statement did not say how many jobs would be lost as a result of the move but reports suggest it will mean up to 600 layoffs. In response to the news, Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison said: ""I am disappointed but not surprised. But I am angry, like I think many Australians would be. ""Australian taxpayers put millions into this multinational company. They let the brand just wither away on their watch. Now they are leaving it behind,"" he added. Historic car brand loved by families and surfers Australian carmaking runs out of road GM President Mark Reuss said the company had explored ways to keep the Holden brand but had decided that it would cost too much to remain in the ""highly fragmented right-hand-drive market"". It comes as GM is accelerating its exit from unprofitable markets as it focuses on the US, China, Latin America and South Korea. A 1963 EH model Holden sedan The move will end 160 years of the Holden name's association with Australia. The company was founded as a saddle maker in South Australia in 1856 before it started building vehicles in 1908. Holden was bought by GM in 1931, beginning their 89-year history as a combined entity. The hashtag #RIPHolden is trending on Twitter as people post pictures and memories of the much-loved Australian brand. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Late last year the company also said it would stop selling its most iconic model the Commodore after more than four decades. At the end of 2013 Holden announced that it would halt production in Australia and start importing vehicles from its overseas plants. GM said a strong Australian currency, high manufacturing costs and a small domestic market were among the reasons behind its decision. The ending of Australian production of Holdens in 2017 resulted in nearly 2,900 job losses.

"David Lloyd Club facing prosecution over deathRocco Wright, 3, drowned in a David Lloyd pool in the Moortown area of Leeds in April 2018.Leeds & West Yorkshire","Rocco Wright died in the David Lloyd Leisure pool in Leeds in April 2018 A leisure group is facing prosecution after a three-year-old boy drowned in one of its swimming pools. Rocco Wright died after being found in the pool at the David Lloyd Leisure centre in Moortown, Leeds, in 2018. Earlier on Monday a jury inquest at Wakefield Coroner's Court ruled his death was accidental. After the inquest Leeds City Council said it believed the group had breached health and safety laws and intended to ""prosecute in the near future"". In a statement, the council said: ""The death of a child in any circumstances is tragic, and we continue to offer the Wright family our sincerest sympathy. ""We will keep in regular contact with the family and ensure they are informed and supported throughout this next stage."" The inquest previously heard how Rocco had to be pulled from the water by his father Steven Wright in April 2018. Mr Wright described how his panic grew as he searched for Rocco before he spotted him at the bottom of the main pool. He said his son had never got into the pool by himself and the inquest heard there were no witnesses or CCTV evidence that could explain how Rocco ended up in the water. The jury found that the youngster had probably been under the 1.2m (4ft) deep water for more than two minutes. Police said there were no witnesses or CCTV to help determine how Rocco got into the pool Jurors were told that at the time of the drowning, there had only been one 17-year-old lifeguard on duty. David Lloyd Leisure's operations director Stephen Brown denied in the inquest there had been cuts to the lifeguard budget at the pool. He told the hearing the company's policy was that a maximum of 50 people in a pool could be supervised by a single lifeguard. Mr Brown also denied David Lloyd Leisure had a policy of employing young lifeguards because they were cheaper and added lifeguard staffing levels were for local managers to decide. Outside the coroner's court, Natalie Marrison - representing Catharine and Steven Wright - said Rocco's parents supported Leeds City Council's investigation and planned prosecution. Ms Marrison said: ""At the heart of this is a three-year-old boy who has lost his life. ""The family remain devastated by the loss."" Mr Wright said that the family had ""lost the fun from our lives"" following Rocco's death. ""We're definitely going to fight for further law and guidelines in this field, just to make sure it can't happen to anyone else,"" he said. ""No-one should lose a child at a family swim session."" In a statement after the inquest, David Lloyd Leisure said it wanted ""to express our deepest sympathies to Rocco's family"". ""David Lloyd Leisure never places profit above safety,"" the company said. ""Subsequent evidence given by David Lloyd Leisure at the inquest showed no evidence of budget cuts to lifeguarding at the Leeds Club at the time of the accident, on the contrary lifeguarding had in fact received increased investment."" The firm added that safety was its ""number one priority"" and it was ""unaware on what basis Leeds City Council intend to prosecute"". The jury returned its conclusion after coroner Jonathan Leach told jurors that accident was the only one available to them.

Surgeon suspended over treatment concerns,"A doctor who worked at the same private healthcare firm as rogue breast surgeon Ian Paterson has been suspended, it has emerged. Spire Healthcare said Mike Walsh -  a specialist in trauma and orthopaedic surgery - was suspended in April 2018 over concerns about patient treatment. Almost 50 of his patients from its Leeds hospital had been recalled. The details emerged following an independent inquiry into Paterson, who is serving a 20-year jail sentence. Paterson wasfound guilty in 2017of intentionally wounding his patients. Earlier this month, an inquiry into the breast surgeon found that a culture of ""avoidance and denial"" had allowed him to perform botched and unnecessary operations on hundreds of women. Surgeon wounded hundreds amid 'culture of denial' Care of 217 patients reviewed amid surgeon probe Spire said in a statement that it acted after concerns were raised about Mr Walsh's work at its hospital in Leeds in 2018. The company, which contacted the Royal College of Surgeons to assist with its investigation, said it had reviewed the notes of fewer than 200 patients, of which ""fewer than 50"" had been invited back for a follow-up appointment. ""Where we have identified concerns about the care a patient received, we have invited the patient to an appointment with an independent surgeon to review their treatment,"" a spokesman for Spire Healthcare said. ""This is a complex case and the review is ongoing."" It said that Mr Walsh, who was immediately suspended after the concerns were raised, was no longer working with Spire Healthcare. The company said any patients at its Spire Leeds Hospital who had concerns about their treatment under Mr Walsh should contact the hospital. It said its findings had also been shared with the Care Quality Commission and the General Medical Council (GMC). The GMC said that while Mr Walsh was still on the medical register, he does not currently have a licence to practise, having held full registration until January 2019. Last month, Spire also said it was reviewing the care of more than 200 patients after stopping another of its surgeons - Habib Rahman - from practising. He worked at Spire's Parkway hospital in the West Midlands - where Paterson had also worked. Spire has 39 hospitals across the UK and one specialist cancer centre.

Schools told not to close over coronavirus fears,"About 3,700 people are quarantined on board the Diamond Princess The Foreign Office is ""considering all options"" for Britons trapped on a quarantined cruise liner in Japan struck by coronavirus - including flying them home. Some of the 74 UK passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess said they felt ""forgotten"", asother countries flew citizens home. The ship was quarantined on 3 February. Meanwhile, a hotel at Heathrow Airport has been block-booked to isolate arrivals suspected of having the virus. On Monday, Japanese officials said there were 99 new cases of infections on board the ship, bringing the total to 454 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. It emerged that about 3,700 passengers and crew could be stuck in quarantine beyond the initial 19 February deadline. How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? Coronavirus: What you need to know Are coronavirus tests flawed? A Number 10 spokesman said: ""We sympathise with all those caught up in this extremely difficult situation. ""The Foreign Office is in contact with all British people on the Diamond Princess, including to establish interest in a possible repatriation flight."" He said the government is ""urgently considering all options to guarantee the health and safety of those on board"". Earlier,passenger David Abel called for the government to evacuate the British citizens on board, saying: ""It feels that we have been forgotten."" David Abel said he had little confidence the UK government would rescue him and his wife Mr Abel's son, Steve, said in a message posted on YouTube his parents were beginning to feel the effects of ""stress"" and ""confinement"" after 28 days on the ship. ""I want my mum and dad to wake up in the morning and actually have some information sent to them - they need to be communicated with,"" he wrote. All rooms at the Holiday Inn Heathrow Ariel hotel have been booked by the government to quarantine passengers displaying symptoms of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. The move is expected mostly to apply to foreign nationals from the most affected countries who arrive in the UK showing symptoms, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. The rooms will be used to isolate suspected cases while test results are awaited. Meanwhile, Chinese nationals in the UK whose visas are close to expiring will have their stay automatically extended, the government announced. The Home Office said it recognised that some may be facing uncertainty over their visas due to travel restrictions imposed after the outbreak. The new guidance issued to Chinese nationals advises that if their visa is due to expire between January 24 and March 30, it will be automatically extended until March 31. Airlines have cancelled flights and the Foreign Office updated its guidance at the end of January to advise ""against all but essential"" travel to mainland China. The number of people tested for the coronavirus in the UK has risen sharply, with an additional 1,392 tests carried out on Sunday alone. It brings the total number of tests to 4,501 as of 14:00 GMT on Monday, with nine confirmed positive. NHS leaders said they believed the health service was able to cope. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals and other trusts, said ""the system is under enormous pressure"" but the NHS is ""very used to dealing with emergencies of all kinds"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are contingency plans if things get worse."" Eight of those who contracted the virushave since been discharged from hospitalafter two negative tests showed they were now clear of the infection. This video can not be played ""I think it will be fine,"" says NHS Confederation chief Niall Dickson All 94 people who had been in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral have also been released, NHS England said on Saturday. They had been kept in isolation at the hospital after returning to the UK from Wuhan in China, the centre of the outbreak. More than 100 people remain in isolation in Milton Keynes after being repatriated back to the UK on a later rescue flight. However, schools are being told by they do not need to close or send staff or pupils home if there is only a suspected case of coronavirus, rather than a positive test. If tests are positive, health protection teams will speak to the head teacher and action will be taken. The advice from Public Health England comes after some schools in Brighton told concerned parents they can choose to keep their children away from school as an authorised absence, even if a coronavirus case is only suspected. PHE says that it will continue to advise people who have been in close contact with a confirmed case to self-isolate. It is believed to have advised at least seven schools in Brighton, Hove and Eastbourne that a member of staff or pupil should stay at home for 14 days. The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent handwashing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service. The main focus is on rapidly identifying people with the disease and taking them to specialist hospitals for treatment in isolation. They are then tracing anybody who has come into close contact with the patient to make sure they know the signs of the disease and what to do. The coronavirus death toll in mainland China rose by 105 to 1,770, in figures announced early on Monday morning. Chinese authorities also reported the number of new cases had increased slightly on the previous day's figure after falling for three consecutive days. A total of 2,048 new cases were reported across the country on Monday - 1,933 of which were from Hubei. More than 70,500 people nationwide have already been infected.

Breaking|Breaking newsForbes appointed new Scottish finance secretaryKate Forbes takes over as Scottish finance secretary following the resignation of Derek Mackay.Scotland politics,"Kate Forbes was formerly public finance minister, but has now been promoted Kate Forbes has been appointed as the Scottish government's new finance secretary following the resignation of Derek Mackay. The 29-year-old became the first woman to set out a budget at Holyrood or Westminster when she stepped in for Mr Mackay earlier this month. In a reshuffle of Nicola Sturgeon's cabinet, Fiona Hyslop will now take on extra responsibility for the economy. Jenny Gilruth has joined the government as Europe minister. Ms Sturgeon said the appointments ""bring new talent into government and deliver a real focus, not only on driving forward our economy, but also on addressing the challenges of Brexit, increasing our population and ending Scotland's contribution to the climate crisis"". The appointments of Ms Forbes and Ms Gilruth will be confirmed in a vote by MSPs on Tuesday. Scots finance secretary quits over messages to boy No extra cash for budget deals Ms Forbes was praised by both SNP colleagues and opposition MSPs after stepping in due to Mr Mackay's resignation on the eve of the budget. Mr Mackay quit on 5 February after saying he had ""behaved foolishly"" by sending hundreds of social media messages to a 16-year-old boy. He was subsequently suspended from the SNP pending investigation, and Ms Sturgeon told BBC Scotland that he ""is receiving some medical assessment and treatment and won't be in parliament over the next few days"". Ms Forbes set out the government's tax and spending plans in his place, and defended them during a scrutiny session with Holyrood's finance committee. MSPs are due to debate the plans on 27 February, giving her only a few weeks to secure a budget deal with opposition parties. Ms Sturgeon said she was pleased to promote ""two incredibly talented colleagues"" The reshuffle of the cabinet sees the finance and economy portfolios split up, with Ms Forbes taking the finance role and Fiona Hyslop adding economy and fair work to her previous job of culture secretary. Ms Hyslop's responsibilities for external affairs and tourism are being taken on by Constitution Secretary Mike Russell and Rural Economy Secretary Fergus Ewing respectively. In the junior ministerial team, Ben Macpherson takes on Ms Forbes' old job of public finance minister, while Ms Gilruth has entered government to replace him as Europe and international development minister. Ms Sturgeon said she was ""pleased to be able to put Scotland's finances and economy into the hands of two incredibly talented colleagues"". She said Ms Forbes and Ms Hyslop would ""continue to drive forward our economy, support our key industries and maintain Scotland's long tradition as an outward-looking, dynamic and enterprising nation"". Meanwhile Scottish Conservative finance spokesman Murdo Fraser said Ms Forbes' promotion was ""well-deserved"", but said that ""no shuffling of personnel can disguise the fact that the SNP's time in government is up"". After 18 months as a junior minister, Ms Forbes has now replaced Derek Mackay as finance secretary Having become a full cabinet secretary during her first term in parliament and still shy of her 30th birthday, Ms Forbes is one of the SNP's fastest-rising stars. Born in Dingwall, she was raised in Glasgow and India - where her father worked to provide healthcare to those unable to afford it - before studying history at the University of Cambridge. She worked as an accountant in the banking industry and as an assistant to MSP Dave Thompson, before being nominated to succeed him as SNP candidate for Skye, Lochaber and Badenoch in the 2016 Holyrood election. Ms Forbes held the seat witha comfortable 24.8% majority. As a backbencher, she campaigned to ban plastic straws and once gave a speech in the Holyrood chamber entirely in Gaelic. She entered government as minister for public finance and the digital economy in June 2018, working alongside Mr Mackay - and has now replaced him as both finance secretary and as the favourite with many bookmakers to eventually succeed Ms Sturgeon as first minister.

Hong Kong gang steals hundreds of toilet rolls,"Not all of the toilet paper was stolen, some of it was left behind by the robbers Armed robbers in Hong Kong made off with hundreds of toilet rolls worth more than HKD1,000 ($130; Â£98). Toilet rolls are currently in short supply in Hong Kong due to shortages caused by panic-buying during the coronavirus outbreak. Knife wielding men robbed a delivery man outside a supermarket in the Mong Kok district, police said. Police have arrested two men and recovered some of the stolen loo rolls, local media reports said. The armed robbery took place in Mong Kok, a district of Hong Kong with a history of ""triad"" crime gangs, early on Monday. According to local reports, the robbers had threatened a delivery worker who had unloaded rolls of toilet paper outside Wellcome Supermarket. An Apple Daily report said that 600 toilet paper rolls, valued at around HKD1,695 ($218; Â£167), had been stolen. Stores across the city have seen supplies massively depleted with long queues when new stock arrives. Coronavirus: A visual guide to the outbreak Why a global city is so vulnerable to virus spread Coronavirus: What you need to know Despite government assurances that supplies remain unaffected by the virus outbreak, residents have been stocking up on toilet paper. Other household products have also seen panic-buying including rice, pasta and cleaning items. Face masks and hand sanitisers are almost impossible to get as people try to protect themselves from the coronavirus, which has already claimed more than 1,700 lives. This video can not be played Inside the US laboratory developing a coronavirus vaccine ""A delivery man was threatened by three knife-wielding men who took toilet paper worth more than HK$1,000 ($130),"" a police spokesman said. Authorities blame false online rumours for the panic buying and say supplies of food and household goods remain stable. There has also been some panic-buying of toilet rolls, hand sanitisers and face masks in Singapore, which has 75 confirmed coronavirus cases. Covid map: Where are cases the highest?

Chinese visitor slump hits Bicester Village,"Fashion buyer Xia Yae purchases clothing in Bicester Village, Selfridges and Harrods for clients in South Korea On a rainy weekday morning, the luxury shopping outlet Bicester Village feels deserted. While February is typically a quiet time for the Oxfordshire retail village, staff the BBC spoke to said visitor numbers were much lower than usual. Cut-price handbags and coats draw thousands of Chinese tourists to the retail outlet each year. But the number of those diagnosed with coronavirus in China has spiked,and this has taken its toll on popular tourist destinations. Eager shoppers, many of them from Asia and the Middle East, wear face masks and apply hand sanitiser on the Thursday morning train. Mixed in with commuters, some snack on pastries and carry Oxford Street-branded tote bags. But fashion buyer Xia Yae says she has noticed a ""lot less people"" travelling to the retail village in the last two weeks. Purchasing designer items for South Korean clients from brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry, Xia says that Bicester retailers are having a ""tough time"". Few shoppers made their way around the pastel, wood-panelled shops ""Usually, fashion buyers would be restricted on how many discounted items they can buy. But now, they're allowed to buy as many as they want - the retailers clearly need to make more money,"" she adds. More than seven million people visited Bicester Village in 2019,according to its owner Value Retail,external. It was established in 1995 by American Scott Malkin,and reported sales of Â£259m in 2018,external. The Hwang family are visiting Bicester as part of their week-long holiday to London.

Schools to be told not to close over coronavirus,"About 3,700 people are quarantined on board the Diamond Princess The Foreign Office is ""considering all options"" for Britons trapped on a quarantined cruise liner in Japan struck by coronavirus - including flying them home. Some of the 74 UK passengers and crew on the Diamond Princess said they felt ""forgotten"", asother countries flew citizens home. The ship was quarantined on 3 February. Meanwhile, a hotel at Heathrow Airport has been block-booked to isolate arrivals suspected of having the virus. On Monday, Japanese officials said there were 99 new cases of infections on board the ship, bringing the total to 454 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. It emerged that about 3,700 passengers and crew could be stuck in quarantine beyond the initial 19 February deadline. How do you self-isolate due to coronavirus? Coronavirus: What you need to know Are coronavirus tests flawed? A Number 10 spokesman said: ""We sympathise with all those caught up in this extremely difficult situation. ""The Foreign Office is in contact with all British people on the Diamond Princess, including to establish interest in a possible repatriation flight."" He said the government is ""urgently considering all options to guarantee the health and safety of those on board"". Earlier,passenger David Abel called for the government to evacuate the British citizens on board, saying: ""It feels that we have been forgotten."" David Abel said he had little confidence the UK government would rescue him and his wife Mr Abel's son, Steve, said in a message posted on YouTube his parents were beginning to feel the effects of ""stress"" and ""confinement"" after 28 days on the ship. ""I want my mum and dad to wake up in the morning and actually have some information sent to them - they need to be communicated with,"" he wrote. All rooms at the Holiday Inn Heathrow Ariel hotel have been booked by the government to quarantine passengers displaying symptoms of Covid-19, the illness caused by the coronavirus. The move is expected mostly to apply to foreign nationals from the most affected countries who arrive in the UK showing symptoms, BBC health editor Hugh Pym said. The rooms will be used to isolate suspected cases while test results are awaited. Meanwhile, Chinese nationals in the UK whose visas are close to expiring will have their stay automatically extended, the government announced. The Home Office said it recognised that some may be facing uncertainty over their visas due to travel restrictions imposed after the outbreak. The new guidance issued to Chinese nationals advises that if their visa is due to expire between January 24 and March 30, it will be automatically extended until March 31. Airlines have cancelled flights and the Foreign Office updated its guidance at the end of January to advise ""against all but essential"" travel to mainland China. The number of people tested for the coronavirus in the UK has risen sharply, with an additional 1,392 tests carried out on Sunday alone. It brings the total number of tests to 4,501 as of 14:00 GMT on Monday, with nine confirmed positive. NHS leaders said they believed the health service was able to cope. Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals and other trusts, said ""the system is under enormous pressure"" but the NHS is ""very used to dealing with emergencies of all kinds"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are contingency plans if things get worse."" Eight of those who contracted the virushave since been discharged from hospitalafter two negative tests showed they were now clear of the infection. This video can not be played ""I think it will be fine,"" says NHS Confederation chief Niall Dickson All 94 people who had been in quarantine at Arrowe Park Hospital on the Wirral have also been released, NHS England said on Saturday. They had been kept in isolation at the hospital after returning to the UK from Wuhan in China, the centre of the outbreak. More than 100 people remain in isolation in Milton Keynes after being repatriated back to the UK on a later rescue flight. However, schools are being told by they do not need to close or send staff or pupils home if there is only a suspected case of coronavirus, rather than a positive test. If tests are positive, health protection teams will speak to the head teacher and action will be taken. The advice from Public Health England comes after some schools in Brighton told concerned parents they can choose to keep their children away from school as an authorised absence, even if a coronavirus case is only suspected. PHE says that it will continue to advise people who have been in close contact with a confirmed case to self-isolate. It is believed to have advised at least seven schools in Brighton, Hove and Eastbourne that a member of staff or pupil should stay at home for 14 days. The main signs of infection are fever (high temperature) and a cough as well as shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. Frequent handwashing with soap or gel, avoiding close contact with people who are ill and not touching your eyes, nose and mouth with unwashed hands can help cut the risk of infection. Catching coughs and sneezes in a tissue, binning it and washing your hands can minimise the risk of spreading disease. Anyone experiencing symptoms, even if mild, after travelling from mainland China, Thailand, Japan, Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, Malaysia or Macau, is advised to stay indoors and call the NHS 111 phone service. The main focus is on rapidly identifying people with the disease and taking them to specialist hospitals for treatment in isolation. They are then tracing anybody who has come into close contact with the patient to make sure they know the signs of the disease and what to do. The coronavirus death toll in mainland China rose by 105 to 1,770, in figures announced early on Monday morning. Chinese authorities also reported the number of new cases had increased slightly on the previous day's figure after falling for three consecutive days. A total of 2,048 new cases were reported across the country on Monday - 1,933 of which were from Hubei. More than 70,500 people nationwide have already been infected.

One plane landed at a US Air Force base in California and the other in Texas. Passengers will be isolated at military facilities for 14 days. There were about 400 Americans on board the Diamond Princess. The ship, with some 3,700 passengers and crew, has been in quarantine since 3 February. Meanwhile, China has reported 2,051 new cases in the past 24 hours. Of those new cases, 94% were from Hubei province, the epicentre of the outbreak. More than 70,600 people across China have been infected by the virus, with 1,771 deaths. Most new cases and deaths have been reported in Wuhan, Hubei's largest city.

The cruise ship was put in quarantine in Japan's port of Yokohama after a man who disembarked in Hong Kong was found to have the virus. On Monday, Japanese officials said there were 99 new cases of infections on board the ship, bringing the total to 454 confirmed cases. It is the largest cluster of cases outside China. A Russian woman who was on board and tested positive is thought to be the first Russian national to contract the virus, Reuters news agency reports. She will be taken to a hospital for treatment, the Russian embassy in Japan said. Those bound for the US left from Tokyo's Haneda Airport To assist with relief efforts,Japan's government has given away 2,000 iPhones to passengers on the ship,external- one for each cabin. The smartphones were distributed so people could use an app, created by Japan's health ministry, which links users with doctors, pharmacists and mental health counsellors. Phones registered outside of Japan are unable to access the app. Other evacuation flights have been arranged to repatriate residents of Israel, Hong Kong and Canada. On Monday, Australia announced that it would evacuate 200 of its citizens too andthe UK said it was considering organising an evacuation flight. According to official figures for 16 February, 100 people died from the virus in Hubei, down from 139 on Saturday. The Chinese authorities are tightening curbs on movement to combat the outbreak. People in Hubei province, which has 60 million people, have been ordered to stay at home, though they will be allowed to leave in an emergency. In addition, a single person from each household will be allowed to leave the building or compound they live in every three days to buy food and essential items. On housing estates, one entrance will be kept open. It will be guarded to ensure that only residents can enter or leave. All businesses will stay closed, except chemists, hotels, food shops and medical services. What are the symptoms?

Bicester Village shops 'having a tough time',"Fashion buyer Xia Yae purchases clothing in Bicester Village, Selfridges and Harrods for clients in South Korea On a rainy weekday morning, the luxury shopping outlet Bicester Village feels deserted. While February is typically a quiet time for the Oxfordshire retail village, staff the BBC spoke to said visitor numbers were much lower than usual. Cut-price handbags and coats draw thousands of Chinese tourists to the retail outlet each year. But the number of those diagnosed with coronavirus in China has spiked,and this has taken its toll on popular tourist destinations. Eager shoppers, many of them from Asia and the Middle East, wear face masks and apply hand sanitiser on the Thursday morning train. Mixed in with commuters, some snack on pastries and carry Oxford Street-branded tote bags. But fashion buyer Xia Yae says she has noticed a ""lot less people"" travelling to the retail village in the last two weeks. Purchasing designer items for South Korean clients from brands including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent and Burberry, Xia says that Bicester retailers are having a ""tough time"". Few shoppers made their way around the pastel, wood-panelled shops ""Usually, fashion buyers would be restricted on how many discounted items they can buy. But now, they're allowed to buy as many as they want - the retailers clearly need to make more money,"" she adds. More than seven million people visited Bicester Village in 2019,according to its owner Value Retail,external. It was established in 1995 by American Scott Malkin,and reported sales of Â£259m in 2018,external. The Hwang family are visiting Bicester as part of their week-long holiday to London. The daughter says the family ""aren't worried"" about the coronavirus outbreak. They are looking forward to searching through discounted items in Burberry. Being able to claim back the 20% VAT available to non-EU visitors is also a perk. Wearing traditional red uniforms resembling those of bellboys, Bicester Village ""hosts"" greet them as they arrive and help other tourists buy tickets for travel. Bicester Village host Jefferson helps tourists travelling to the luxury shopping destination from London Marylebone Announcements in Mandarin and Arabic are made over the tannoy as the train pulls in. Tourists make their way through a neon walkway and past an empty car park to the 160 shops on-site. Few shoppers walk along the artificial streets between pastel-coloured storefronts. A shop assistant at one store says they are ""concerned"" about how reliant Bicester Village is on tourism. More than 72% of Chinese visitors to the UK go shopping during their trips, according to research by VisitBritain. In total, there were 415,000 visits from China to the UK in the 12 months to September 2019, the tourism body says. Staff say Chinese tourists are the biggest group for the luxury shop. They add that the last two weeks have been ""quiet"", estimating the branch has seen a drop of about 85% in the number of Chinese customers entering the store. They say: ""It's been a double whammy. Storm Ciara also meant a lot of the trains and coaches from London were cancelled. It's really scary."" Another sales adviser at the high fashion label Balenciaga says the last week has been ""very quiet"" in the shop. Many of the people the BBC spoke to requested not to be named as they do not have permission to speak to the press. Sales assistants in Balenciaga said tourists visiting in the week buy bigger-ticket items than British shoppers He says he uses hand sanitiser every five minutes. Stations are placed at the back of the store for staff, away from customers. In several stores, retail assistants outnumber customers. They huddle for chats near the doors of Givenchy, Diesel and Karl Lagerfeld. Four staff members in Burberry wear surgical masks, and tell the BBC they've been ""advised not to speak to journalists"". The complex is privately owned and restricts filming. The BBC was asked not to speak to ""guests"" by security at the site. Dominic Hare, chief executive of the nearby Blenheim Palace, is hoping that any shortfall in visitor numbers will eventually be recouped. He said: ""We need to ensure that these are visits deferred, not deleted."" Mr Hare said that in the meantime they were ""working hard to attract people from short-haul markets, as well as the UK. ""We're optimistic we can make it up from the local audience - and that's important because the jobs in the wider economy depend on us, and we depend on them too."" For now, Bicester Village shoppers seem happy enough as they wander down the makeshift streets. One tells the BBC through Google Translate that there are fewer people to fight for bargains. Its owner Value Retail has not yet responded to the BBC's request for comment. Will someone develop a coronavirus vaccine?

Roads 'impassable' as Storm Dennis clean-up beginsA huge clean-up effort is continuing after hundreds of homes and businesses were flooded.Wales,"This video can not be played Home owners are trying to clean up the substantial damage left in the wake of Storm Dennis. Residents are counting the cost of ""unprecedented"" flooding after Storm Dennis left parts of Wales under water. There are cancellations and significant delays on trains after a month's worth of rain fell in 48 hours. Roads across south and mid Wales remain blocked by floods and landslips. Meanwhile, homes were evacuated in Monmouth on Monday night after two severe flood warnings for the River Wye were declared. The river's water levels are predicted to reach 7.2m (23ft) between 03:00 and 07:00 on Tuesday. And more rain has been forecast with aMet Office yellow warning for rain,externalissued from 18:00 GMT on Wednesday until 15:00 on Thursday in areas of south, mid and north Wales. Inside a flooded kitchen in Nantgarw People living in areas at immediate risk in Monmouth have been evacuated and other properties nearby have been provided with sandbags and support.

Natural Resources Wales still hadeight flood warnings in place,externalat 21:10 GMT, meaning flooding is expected. It said 163mm (6.5in) of rain had fallen in the 48 hours between lunchtime on Friday and Sunday and described the scale of flooding as ""unprecedented"". Meanwhile, Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has defended the Welsh Government's investment into flood defences following the widespread damage after Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said it ""clearly isn't adequate"". First Minister Mark Drakeford meets householder Caroline Jones in her flood-affected house in Pontypridd Mr Drakeford said the impact of the weekend's events would have been ""even worse"" if there had not been major investment in flood defences, adding a Â£350m programme was ongoing over this assembly term. ""The impact of global warming is real and there for anyone to see, the science tells us we will have to face in greater frequency these intense weather events in future,"" he said. Mr Drakeford said the Welsh Government would work with local authorities to repair infrastructure damage by flooding including bridges, roads and existing flood defences and explore whether there are funds available to help flood victims, local authorities and emergency services. ""For individuals our first focus will be on those families who don't have any form of insurance who lost everything and have no way of replacing it,"" he said.

This football pitch in Cwmbran turned into a boating lake for this canoeist A roof was carried into her garden from about 400m away Taff Street in Pontypridd was left underwater after heavy rain on Saturday and Sunday Clearing up in the centre of Pontypridd on Monday At the peak of the flooding on Sunday, we had 900 tonnes of water per second flowing down the River Taff. That's not just a massive amount of water flowing very fast, it's the damage it can bring, especially when debris is carried along in such a torrent. Well over a month's rainfall came in just 48 hours. This product of Storm Dennis came hot on the heels of Storm Ciara - drenching land that was already soaked through and filling rivers fast. Monitoring sites on rivers and streams flowing down from the mountains through the south Wales valleys started reporting record-breaking levels of water. We saw the highest levels ever recorded on the rivers Taff, Tawe, Neath, Rhondda, Cynon, Usk and the Wye. This shows river Taff levels at Pontypridd over the last month up until 1500 on Monday If we look at the NRW monitoring site at Pontypridd in isolation over the last month, the level surges to well over 5m on Sunday at the peak of Storm Dennis. Even down in Cardiff, river levels were 80cm higher than the previous record set in 1979. Since then, there has been widespread investment in flood defences across south Wales, which has played a big part in saving tens of thousands of homes from damage this time around. That will be no comfort to those people closest to rivers, who have still been affected, All the science around climate change is suggesting that weather events like this will become more frequent and more extreme. So the questions that are sure to be asked over the coming weeks and months is how we cope with that.

Japan's economy shrinks at fastest rate since 2014,"Japan's economy shrank at the fastest rate in five years at the end of 2019 as it was hit by a sales tax rise, a major typhoon and weak global demand. Annualised gross domestic product (GDP) fell by a much steeper than expected 6.3% in October-December. There are also concerns the coronavirus outbreak will mean the slump continues this quarter. That has raised fears that the world's third-biggest economy may fall into recession. During the period Japanese consumer spending fell 2.9% after the country's sales tax was raised in October to 10% from 8%. In the same month Typhoon Hagibis hit large parts of the country. Last quarter, capital spending dropped by 3.7% and exports slipped 0.1% amid the ongoing US-China trade war. Investors are now watching to see whether the economy will rebound after the coronavirus forced China to shut down factories and led to a big drop in Chinese tourists visiting Japan. Coronavirus: Nissan to shut factory in Japan Japan deploys 110,000 rescuers after typhoon Japan hikes sales tax despite growth jitters In response to today's data economy minister Yasutoshi Nishimura said the Japanese government was ready to take all necessary steps to deal with the impact of the coronavirus outbreak on the economy and tourism. In December Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's government approved $120bn (Â£90bn) in spending aimed at cushioning the impact of the sales tax rise. The shrink in GDP was the first in more than a year and the largest since a 7.4% fall in 2014, the last time Japan raised its sales tax.
