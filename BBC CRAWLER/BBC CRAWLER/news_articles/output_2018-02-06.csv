US shares regain ground to close higher,"This video can not be played Why are share prices falling? US stock markets have ended a day of massive fluctuations on a high note, rebounding  after recent steep losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.3%, while the Nasdaq hit 2.1% and the S&P 500 rose 1.7%. Stocks shuttled between positive and negative territory throughout the day, their activity spanning more than 1,000 points. On Monday, the Dow had plunged by nearly 1,200 points or 4.6%, triggering losses in Asia and Europe. ""I think what you're seeing today is, 'Hold on. This got overdone'. The fundamentals of the companies haven't changed since Friday,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at online brokerage TD Ameritrade. Analysts have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices. Investors are also fretting over the prospect of rising interest rates, which push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The steep sell-off began last week after data in the US showed stronger than expected wage growth. The report came amid other shifts, including new tax cuts, trade tensions, and a sinking dollar, that analysts say could lead inflation to rise faster than expected. The conditions pose a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which will need to raise interest rates to counter inflation, without moving so aggressively that it severely curbs economic activity. It is not clear how the changing economic currents, including tax cuts, will affect company financials ultimately, said Michael Bapis, managing director of The Bapis Group at Hightower, a wealth management firm in New York. ""You're seeing that volatility now because there's uncertainty,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday,Japan's Nikkei 225closed down 4.7%. Markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris had initial losses of up to 3%, before recovering some ground. London's FTSE 100closed down almost 200 points or 2.6% at 7141.Frankfurt's DaxandParis's CACwere down 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. On Monday the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level since April of last year. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow in the US was up 25% and London's FTSE 100 rose 7.6%. Live: Global stock markets slump Asia markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why? The 2018 economy: What to watch Monday's decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US. US markets opened sharply lower again on Tuesday, but quickly rebounded amid frantic trade that continued throughout the day. Analysts have said the swings in the US markets in part reflect big investors moving to sell stocks and put money in other assets, such as bonds, which benefit from higher interest rates. Other companies that had strategies betting on calm markets also had to adjust. What has driven the Dow's surge? US jobs and wages rise in January The US economy in six charts Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not think the declines were a sign of broader problems. ""There are no systemic issues,"" he told a congressional panel on Tuesday. ""I don't think these types of moves, given how much the market has rallied, have financial stability concerns."" Even if you don't own shares directly, the chances are that you will be paying into a pension which is invested in shares and bonds. More than nine million people in the UK have auto enrolment pensions, and 12 million are active members of defined contribution schemes. That means the value of the pension is dependent on the value of the investments in it. Similarly, anyone who owns shares or funds in an ISA or a SIPP will have seen the value of their savings fall. But experts point out that investments rise and fall over time, and over the longer term, it should make little difference. ""It is effectively no change for normal investors, in that you have ridden a wave on the way up, so now is not the time to cash in,"" said Rebecca O'Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor. ""This is unwelcome news, but it is fundamentally a not unexpected reaction to the euphoria that saw markets rise so fast."" If you are planning on retiring in the next couple of months, you will have a slightly smaller pension pot than you did at the start of the year. But coincidentally the FTSE 100 is at almost exactly the same place it was a year ago, so you won't have lost anything over that longer term. Furthermore if you have a while to go before you retire, the shares in your pension fund have just become cheaper to buy - so there is a greater chance of them increasing in value. But, as ever, future market trends are difficult to determine. ""Markets are capricious beasts in the short term, and, looking forward, stock prices could move in either direction without defying the laws of statistics,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""However, in the long term, markets are more reliable in generating growth, and so anyone saving for retirement should still consider the stock market as a friend, not a foe."" An A-Z Guide to Business Beasts Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets, but doubt whether there will be a prolonged period of selling. Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, said the recent moves were a ""correction"" rather than a crash. ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added thatbear markets- when shares go into a long period of decline - tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. And analyst Laith Khalaf, of Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that, despite the heavy falls on Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones share index is still 20% up on where it stood this time last year.

EU 'seeks single market sanction power',"The European Union wants to be able to restrict the UK's access to the single market if there is a dispute after Brexit, a leaked document suggests. The power to suspend ""certain benefits"" would apply during the post-Brexit transition phase before the final arrangements come into force. It is revealed in a draft section of the UK and EU's withdrawal agreement, which has yet to be finalised. The UK said the document simply reflected the EU's ""stated directives"". But it provoked an angry reaction from former UKIP leader Nigel Farage who said the transition deal on offer would be tantamount to creating a ""Vichy Britain"". Theresa May is to chair the first of two key Brexit meetings with her senior ministers later as the government faces more calls to clarify the UK's position. The first Brexit cabinet committee will focus on Northern Ireland and immigration, while trade will be discussed on Thursday. Ministers gather for key Brexit meeting A quick guide to the Brexit transition phase Barnier's trade warning for the UK How soon are answers needed? The transition period is expected to begin straight after the UK officially leaves the European Union on 29 March 2019, and end on 31 December 2020. The UK says this will allow businesses to adapt to its new relationship with the EU. The EU says its rules should still apply during the transition period, as will rulings of the European Court of Justice. According to a footnote in the EU papers leaked to journalists in Brussels, if referring a dispute to the EU court would take too long, the withdrawal agreement ""should provide for a mechanism allowing the Union to suspend certain benefits deriving for the United Kingdom from participation in the internal market"". It does not go into detail about what disputes could trigger the powers being used, or which parts of the single market could be suspended. It also says the UK would be consulted about fishing quotas, and would have to pledge not to act against the EU in international organisations. A Department for Exiting the European Union spokesman said: ""This is a draft document produced by the EU that simply reflects their stated directives."" Together with the UK's position as set out last month, it provides a ""solid foundation for the negotiations on the implementation period"". The UK plans to continue participating in the single market - which allows frictionless trade and the free movement of people between EU members - during the transition phase, before the final trading relationship - which has yet to be negotiated - comes into force. Some Conservative MPs are unhappy at the idea of the UK following EU rules but having no say on them, and have warned that when Brexit happens in March 2019 it will be ""in name only"". Bernard Jenkin, chair of the Commons Public Administration Committee, said it would be ""utterly perverse"" if the EU ended up imposing tariffs on British goods given the current levels of alignment between it and the UK. ""This is an indication of how fearful the EU is that they have to make these silly threats,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Of course we are going to do rather well outside the EU and we are going to show the EU up as a rather less successful organisation than it is."" And former trade minister Lord Jones, a leading pro-Leave voice within the business community, said it was increasingly clear no deal was better than a bad one. We've had position papers. We've had guidelines, directives and a joint report. This is the first draft of legally-binding words that will end up in the withdrawal agreement - the Brexit treaty that will seal the UK's departure from the EU and a document of real historical significance. EU sources say it proves that they are getting a move on - ""Please! No more position papers"" - which the UK wants too. The EU's suggestion, in a footnote, that the UK's access to parts of the single market will be curtailed if the European Court of Justice cannot solve any disputes within the two-ish year timeframe of the transition, will sound threatening to some. To others it will sound like an obvious back-up plan to deal with the famously long time it takes for the ECJ to make a decision. The Brits caution that this is a first draft for the EU27 and does not reflect any negotiations over what they prefer to call the implementation phase.

Poorest children 'face biggest cuts',"Many councils are having to cut services providing early help to families Mary, not her real name, knows all about the consequences of family breakdown. She has taken a relative's two children into her home in Birmingham and believes that with earlier intervention from social services they would still be living with their mother. But, she says, social workers took action only once the family had reached crisis point. Earlier help, perhaps in the form of parenting classes or counselling for the children's mother or even budgeting and cooking classes of the sort available in many council-run children's centres would have made a big difference, she says. ""It would have made a lot of difference. It maybe would have helped probably keep the family together and not have it broken up the way that it is,"" she says. Vulnerable children: Crisis help only Vulnerable children 'left in limbo' Help for vulnerable children 'at risk' Amid warnings from councils and charities that a spending squeeze is threatening early help for vulnerable families in England, new figures seen exclusively by the BBC lay bare the scale of the problem. The analysis of Department for Education figures by researchers at Huddersfield and Sheffield universities shows that since 2010, council areas with the highest levels of deprivation and need have faced the biggest cuts. Adjusted for inflation, the figures show overall spending on children's services has fallen by 16% across England - but in the poorest areas the figure is 27%, compared with 4% in the wealthiest areas. And spending on intervention services to help families before they reach a crisis has fallen by 47% overall - but the figure in the poorest boroughs is 54%, while in the wealthiest it is 33%. A Department for Education spokeswoman said the government had committed Â£20m to provide ""additional support to local authorities where the risk of service failure is highest"". ""In addition, more than Â£200bn has been made available to councils for local services, including children's services, up to 2019-20. ""We want every child, no matter where they live, to receive the same high quality care and support,"" said the spokeswoman. But Prof Paul Bywaters of Huddersfield University, who led the research, said the scale of the budget crisis councils faced meant they were being driven towards short-term cuts that could cost more in the long term. ""It's not only that children are suffering now, but we're storing up costs for society in the future and creating a kind of vicious spiral,"" he said. ""The more we cut prevention and family support services and concentrate expenditure on the other areas, the more likely it is that more children will come into care, more children will be at risk of abuse and neglect."" Deputy head Nicky Hinchliff says families still need the help offered by the closed children's centre Birmingham's Adderley Children's Centre, in Saltley, used to provide specialist early support for families in difficulty - but budget problems meant this ended just before Christmas. Deputy head Nicky Hinchliff says the community has lost a place where parents and children could feel safe, with expertise on site to offer early support to mothers with difficulties ranging from debt to depression and stop problems escalating. ""Those issues have not gone away,"" she says. ""Those parents and those families still need our support. ""I dread to think what that means for children in the longer term."" Mary, who asked not to be identified, gets some support at a charity-run centre On the other side of Birmingham, in Winson Green, Mary gets some support at a charity-run centre at a primary school. At the Oasis Hub, parents can drop in to learn cooking and budgeting skills from volunteers. Many parents here are under pressure, with money or other worries, but in these sessions, they can find counselling, childcare and friends. ""It builds their confidence. It builds their skills. And obviously having the mothers emotionally stable, helps the children, and happy parents means happy children,"" says one volunteer. Centre manager Anji Barker says staff have noticed that neglect cases are on the rise. ""What we see is that where that early help could have happened, and then mum was able to get on her feet and keep those children and then go on to actually be a very effective parent, we are now seeing that's just left and left and left until the crisis emerges,"" she says. ""And then you are at the very top end of crisis that involves removal of children."" Birmingham City Council's deputy leader, Brigid Jones, said the council had been required by the government to make cuts of more than Â£642m since 2010. ""Faced with incredibly difficult choices, we chose to protect and increase funding to our child-protection service. And sadly this has inevitably meant cuts for other services across the council, even those we would normally consider vital, like children's centres."" The Local Government Association, which represents councils in England, said it had repeatedly warned of a Â£2bn funding gap in children's services by 2020. ""It is often those who are most vulnerable and need support across a wide range of services to improve life chances who rely on these services the most,"" said Richard Watts, who chairs the LGA's Children and Young People Board.

Man jailed for ex-girlfriend stab murder,"Molly McLaren met Joshua Stimpson on dating app Tinder A man has been jailed for murdering his ex-girlfriend by stabbing her 75 times in her car. Molly McLaren, 23, died in a ""frenzied"" attack at the Dockside shopping centre in Chatham, Kent, on 29 June. Joshua Stimpson, 26, had admitted manslaughter but denied murder before his trial at Maidstone Crown Court. Sentencing him to a serve a minimum of 26 years in prison, Judge Adele Williams said: ""This was a cruel, calculated and cowardly act."" The judge told Stimpson, of Wouldham High Street in Rochester, he may never be released for his ""wickedness"". She added: ""You slit her throat while repeatedly stabbing her. ""You were determined to punish her for finishing with you. You were seeking revenge."" Joshua Stimpson was jailed for a minimum of 26 years It took the jury less than four hours to convict Stimpson, who had been in a seven-month relationship with Ms McLaren before she ended it two weeks before her death. The court heard after the relationship finished, Stimpson posted derogatory messages about Ms McLaren on social media. This video can not be played Family and friends paid tribute to Molly McLaren after the verdict On the day of the murder he turned up at the gym she was in and waited for her to get into her car before he launched his attack. As well as the murder weapon, police recovered two Stanley knives and a pick axe from Stimpson's car at the scene. The judge told Stimpson: ""You are a highly-dangerous young man and you will pose a very considerable risk to women for a very considerable period in the future."" Joshua Stimpson and Molly McLaren had been dating for seven months The jury had been told Stimpson took his parents splitting up very badly and the feeling of abandonment from his mother leaving was ""more significant than it might have been for others"". In the years that followed, he was repeatedly referred to a mental health clinic in Gillingham, and had a ""hypersensitivity to any rejection"". However psychiatrist Dr Philip Josephsaid Stimpson does not have a personality disorder but has narcissistic traitsand showed ""no remorse"" for killing Ms McLaren. Det Sgt Ali Worton said Stimpson is a ""cold and calculated killer rather than somebody who does not have the mental capacity to control himself"". Ms McLaren's family released a statement thanking Kent Police and Benjamin Moreton ""for his brave efforts"" after he tried to intervene in the attack. It continued: ""The verdict has brought us a small measure of comfort, but it seems that nothing will take away the pain or allow us to come to terms with our Molly being taken from us.  We are serving a lifetime of pain, anguish and loss. ""A light has gone out in all of our hearts but shines bright as a star forever glowing. We love you Molly."" The family is calling for more awareness over the dangers of stalking and the need for people to report any concerns to the police. Stimpson had a history of stalking two previous girlfriends and was warned twice by police to keep away from Ms McLaren. Kent Police reported itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct after Ms McLaren's death. The force said the inquiry would be finalised once criminal proceedings were concluded.

"Love Island women 'paid less' in new jobsOlivia Attwood says she has been offered ""substantially less"" pay than men for work since the show.19h19 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Olivia Atwood speaks to MP Anna Soubry about her views on Parliament and being paid less since Love Island One of Love Island's female stars says she has been offered ""substantially"" less pay for the same jobs as the male contestants since leaving the ITV show. Olivia Attwood told the Victoria Derbyshire show this included jobs with her boyfriend Chris Hughes. The female contestants discovered the disparity after speaking to each other and ""doing some digging"". She said when her management approached the clients to ask why, they immediately matched the payments. Ms Attwood said there was ""a lot of panic"" when her management team of ""very strong women"" told the client the female stars knew they were being paid less. ""Straight away it was 'please don't tell anyone, we'll match the money'. So the money was always there,"" she said. 'Lady friendly' crisps mocked online Mass Greek protest at Macedonia name Korean men are starting a beauty revolution Speaking to Conservative MP Anna Soubry on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, the reality star said: ""We never got an answer [to], 'why did you feel that they should be paid more than us, for us all to come and do the exact same thing on the same day, the same outcome?'."" Olivia Attwood said she has also worked as a Formula 1 ""grid girl"" The 27-year-old said her boyfriend told her that when he worked with other men they were paid the same, irrespective of how well-known they were. ""They would never dream of insulting four men that way, but they'll tell the two girls and make up some ridiculous reason, but it was really because they thought they'd get away with it. ""That was really an eye-opener and it's made me angry,"" she said. Gender pay gap: Charity questions accuracy of data Gender pay gap and equal pay: What's the difference? Should men take a pay cut to reduce the gender pay gap? Gender pay gap 'widens as women get older' Ms Attwood also said that she had previously worked as a ""grid girl"" for Formula 1,a role the sport's bosses said would no longer be used from this season. She said she knew that fans of the sport did not need to see half-naked girls to enjoy it. ""But by the same token, if a particular girl wants to do that and she finds that really fun and she gets to travel the world doing it, I think you can go so far and take the fun out of everything, can't you?"" She added that the models were always very well looked after by the Formula 1 teams, and ""no-one got within 5m [15ft] of us"" and that they were told to shout about it ""if anyone had crossed any boundaries"".

"Outlaw online abuse, Katie Price tells MPs","This video can not be played Katie Price: âHe canât speak to defend himself, I canâ Katie Price has told MPs of the ""horrific"" social media abuse targeted at her son Harvey, and how she wants to protect him from it. The model and reality TV star is campaigning for online abuse to be made a criminal offence. MPs launched an inquiry into online abuse after a petition started by Ms Price was backed by 200,000 people. Harvey, who is 15-years-old, is partially blind, autistic and has Prader-Willi syndrome. Ms Price, who has four other children, told the Commons petitions committee only Harvey had been singled out for cruel mockery including ""a lot of racial abuse"". ""They know he hasn't got a voice back and they mock him more...  I just think they find him an easy target - just to pick on. ""But I'm his voice. I'm here and I am going to protect him."" Social media sites 'face tax over abuse' End intimidation in politics, PM warns She said she had complained to the police but they had been unable to take action because there were no specific laws in place to deal with online abuse. ""The most horrific things.... have been said about my son,"" she told the MPs, and she had realised through her petition that others face similar harassment. Katie Price's son Harvey accompanied her to Parliament Her mother, Amy Price, suggested ""the law is out of date - it's got to be policed more"". Katie ""has always been in the limelight"" and she has ""got used to it,"" she added, but the abuse of Harvey ""does upset you and you do feel emotional - it's hard"". In response to the suggestion that she invited the insults by posting pictures of her son, Katie Price said ""I'm proud of Harvey"" and it was important for disabled children to have visibility. Katie Price and her mother Amy wore rosettes marking the 100th anniversary of the law that first allowed some women to vote MPs put questions to witnesses at committee hearings She said the criminalisation of online abuse shouldn't just be restricted to the targeting of disabled people. ""I know I'm here because it started off because Harvey and his disabilities but this isn't just for people with disabilities as well, it will help everybody."" She added: ""Like me or hate me, I'm here to protect others."" She said it was important to protect freedom of speech and there needed to be a discussion about how bad abuse could get before it was considered criminal. She also argued for a register of people found guilty of online abuse, saying:  ""If they are big enough to go behind their computers and say these things then I want them named and shamed."" After 40 minutes facing MPs' questions, she said:  ""I know you lot sitting there agree with me, really. ""We know we all agree but we just have to get the government to do it."" If nothing happened, she joked, she would be ""like Arnold Schwarzenegger - I'll be back."" The Petitions Committee is looking at the impact of online abuse - particularly on people with disabilities - responsibility for protection, whether technology companies are doing enough. It is also examining whether the law needs to be changed, how to define online abuse and what support is given to victims. The government's minister for women, Victoria Atkins, said she had become disillusioned with social media. This video can not be played The minister for women on quitting Twitter because of death threats. ""I've come off Twitter because I was so fed up of it. I was fed up with the death threats and the nastiness, from people who often live many, many miles away from my constituency,"" she told BBC Radio 5 live's told Emma Barnett. It comes as Prime Minister Theresa May also announced proposed new laws to stop people being intimidated in public life. In a speech marking the centenary of women getting the vote, she made an appeal for ""tolerance and respect"" and said it was unacceptable for anyone to face threats over their political views. The PM added that she was considering a new offence to protect politicians and their families.

Pardoning suffragettes 'complicated',"Students marking the anniversary by recreating a suffragette protest march Giving pardons to women who were jailed while fighting for the right to vote would be ""complicated"", Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said. But she said she would ""take a look"", 100 years on from some women getting the vote in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn said a Labour government would apologise to suffragettes and have criminal records overturned. Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, said the women had been pardoned by society. Equality campaign group the Fawcett Society and some relatives of the suffragettes are among those who called on the home secretary to overturn the convictions of women who were imprisoned while fighting for the vote. But Helen Pankhurst said the suffragettes would be urging women to ""continue the fight"" rather than ""dwell"" on their personal sacrifice. ""It was not them breaking the laws that were the problem, it was the laws that were constraining our democracy,"" she told BBC Radio 5live. Theresa May and female MPs past and present gathered at Westminster for a reception The Representation of the People Act,externalwas passed on 6 February 1918 and gave women aged over 30 and ""of property"" the right to vote. In a speech in Manchester to mark the centenary of women's votes, Theresa May hailed the ""heroism"" of the suffragettes. Meet the women fighting for females in 2018 Laura Kuenssberg: The journey towards 50-50 This video can not be played Theresa May on being a woman in politics She also used the speech to criticise online abuse and intimidation of political candidates and representatives - often women, gay people and members of ethnic minorities. ""While there is much to celebrate, I worry that our public debate today is coarsening,"" Mrs May said. ""That for some it is becoming harder to disagree, without also demeaning opposing viewpoints in the process."" The PM warned ""bitterness and aggression"" online threatens democracy and deters many people from engaging in politics.

She also promised an internet safety report will be published every year to assess how social media companies are dealing with abuse posted online. Reality Check: What if women couldn't vote? How the Suffragettes woke us up The women against female suffrage Meanwhile, a cross-party group of Green, Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians called on the home secretary to make misogyny a hate crime. In July 2016,Nottinghamshire Police became the first force in the UK to record harassment of women as a hate crimein a bid to tackle sexist abuse, but the scheme has not been rolled out further. Other ways in which the anniversary is being marked include: A public exhibition of life-sized images of the central figures of the suffrage movement in London's Trafalgar Square Portraits of these people will also be in an exhibition at London's City Hall A reception for female MPs past and present in Parliament, hosted by Mrs May The Parliamentary Archives will display the 1918 Representation of the People Act itself for the first time BBC Radio 4's Today Programme used only women contributors and an all-female presenter line-up on its show Records compiled by the England, Suffragettes Arrested, 1906-1914 collection indicate there were more than 1,300 suffragette arrests and many women were jailed. Hate mail and firebombs: How women won the vote What female MPs wore to mark the occasion Suffragette tributes shared online Emmeline Pankhurst, a founder member of the Woman's Social and Political Union, and leading suffragettes Emily Davison and Flora Drummond were among them. Ms Davison was found guilty of placing a ""dangerous substance likely to injure"" in a post office letter box outside Parliament and sentenced to six months in Holloway Prison. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, attended the opening of an exhibition celebrating the centenary in Trafalgar Square By Francesca Gillett, BBC News Women and men of all ages gathered outside the pop-up exhibition in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday morning. In freezing temperatures, the passers-by stopped to look at the cardboard cut-outs of 59 campaigners involved in the women's suffrage movement, many of whom are unknown faces. ""We forget these women,"" said charity worker Lucy Rae, who came to see the exhibition with a colleague. ""I do think it's quite poignant. You almost want to stand in with them to be part of it and to be one of these women."" University professor Hazel Barrett, whose grandmother supported the suffragette movement, said people of all classes got involved, adding: ""Just look at them, ordinary women"". Sheree Davey, who came with her young son to see the display, said: ""It's incredible. It inspires you to learn a bit more. ""You know the basics but there's so much more to it."" Victoria Taylor, a tourist visiting from Australia, said: ""It's a great way to engage people. It's not confronting but it's very prominent."" The Scottish Tory leader said she supported calls for posthumous pardons for the convicted women as they were simply ""righting the wrong"" of of an unjust law. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,,externalRuth Davidson said: ""Voting was a value judgement, not an intrinsic right."" Ms Rudd, who is also minister for women and equalities, said she would consider the issue. However,she told Radio 4's Today Programme:""I must be frank, it is complicated because if you're going to give a legal pardon for things like arson and violence it's not as straightforward as people think it might be."" Eight things that were bigger killers in the 70s Spain cracks king's 500-year-old code Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack Krista Cowman, professor of history at the University of Lincoln, said many suffragettes would ""be spinning in their graves"" about the idea of being pardoned.

Ex-boss takes blame for Carillion failure,"This video can not be played Former chairman of Carillion, Philip Green. Former Carillion chairman Philip Green has said he takes the blame for the collapse of the company last month. Mr Green was in the post when the construction giant, which provided services for schools, hospitals and prisons,went into liquidation. He said his responsibility was ""full and complete, total - no question in my mind about that. Not necessarily culpability but full responsibility"". The Work and Pensions Committee has been quizzing former directors. Carillion's collapse last month sent shockwaves through the building and construction sector, casting a shadow over a number of public sector projects. As the MPs were questioning the former directors,the Royal Liverpool Hospital announced its opening would be delayed due to Carillion's demise. Earlier in the hearing, the company's former finance director, Zafar Khan, denied being ""asleep at the wheel"" during his time in the role. Mr Khan was not working for the company when it collapsed, having been sacked last September, but he said: ""I believe I did everything that I could have done. ""As soon as I came into the role, we were looking to tackle the issues. The key focus of my time in the role was to bring net debt down. ""I was surprised at the outcome that eventually came to pass."" Work and Pensions Committee session in detail Carillion collapse delays new Â£335m Liverpool hospital UK puts up Â£100m to back Carillion contractor loans Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Regret, surprise and anger were the emotions on show as former Carillion executives faced a grilling from MPs about the company's collapse. All those questioned spoke of their surprise at the speed at which the company's financial position had deteriorated. That didn't stop them signing off on a dividend that the former finance chief, Zafar Khan, said should not have been paid. All agreed the level of debt meant the company was ill equipped to deal with these nasty surprises. The anger came from MPs including co-chair Rachel Reeves who launched an emotional attack on executives who had banked years of pay and bonuses while employees and pensioners face joblessness and reduced payouts. The auditors who passed the company fit just three months before a crippling profit warning will approach this committee with some trepidation. In a stormy committee session, Mr Khan said he ""spooked the board"" when he reviewed the company's contracts. But former Carillion chief executive Keith Cochrane told MPs that was not the reason for Mr Khan's dismissal. Mr Cochrane accepted that Mr Khan's findings were correct but told the committee: ""Our concern was whether he was fully on top of all the cashflow arrangements and close to what was actually happening."" He added that Mr Khan's dismissal happened at the same time as other senior management changes. This video can not be played Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane says his decisions were made in the best interests of the firm. Mr Cochrane, who only took charge last July, said he was ""truly sorry"" about the company's collapse. ""It was the worst possible outcome. This was a business worth fighting for. That's what I sought to do during my time as chief executive,"" he said. The previous chief executive Richard Howson ran the company for six years before stepping down after a profit warning. Mr Howson told the committee that towards the end of his time in charge, he ""felt like a bailiff"" trying to collect money. He added: ""The amount of energy and effort to make sure there is enough cashflow each month is extraordinary."" Mr Howson said he believed the company was well run, but had difficulties getting paid. In particular he noted that Carillion was owed Â£200m for work on a project in Qatar. He described a project in Qatar for which Carillion was owed around Â£200m at the time he was replaced by Mr Cochrane and which has now been put back until the end of this year. MPs Rachel Reeves and Frank Field, co-chairs of the committee, were unimpressed with the answers they received from the former Carillion directors. In a joint statement, they said: ""A series of delusional characters maintained that everything was hunky dory until it all went suddenly and unforeseeably wrong. ""We heard variously that this was the fault of the Bank of England, the foreign exchange markets, advisers, Brexit, the snap election, investors, suppliers, the construction industry, the business culture of the Middle East and professional designers of concrete beams. ""Everything we have seen points the fingers in another direction - to the people who built a giant company on sand in a desperate dash for cash."" Carillion employed 43,000 people, including around 20,000 in the UK. This month alone,more than 800 job losses have been announcedand Mr Cochrane said: ""Do I wish we'd done something about it sooner? Absolutely. ""Clearly with the benefit of hindsight should the board have been asking further, more probing questions? Perhaps."" Do you work for Carillion? Do you have any concerns about your job or project?

Elon Musk's Falcon rocket soars away,"This video can not be played SpaceX launches world's most powerful rocket US entrepreneur Elon Musk has launched his new rocket, the Falcon Heavy, from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mammoth vehicle - the most powerful since the shuttle system - lifted clear of its pad without incident to soar high over the Atlantic Ocean. It was billed as a risky test flight in advance of the lift-off. The SpaceX CEO said the challenges of developing the new rocket meant the chances of a successful first outing might be only 50-50. ""I had this image of just a giant explosion on the pad, a wheel bouncing down the road. But fortunately that's not what happened,"" he told reporters after the event. Shock and awe at Falcon Heavy launch With this debut, the Falcon Heavy becomes the most capable launch vehicle available. The aim was to send this car and mannequin towards Mars' orbit It is designed to deliver a maximum payload to low-Earth orbit of 64 tonnes - the equivalent of putting five London double-decker buses in space. Such performance is slightly more than double that of the world's next most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy - but at one third of the cost, says Mr Musk. SpaceX rocket lights 27 engines Musk's Boring Company presents LA tunnel plan 'Approval' for hyperloop from New York to Philadelphia For this experimental and uncertain mission, however, he decided on a much smaller and whimsical payload - his old cherry-red Tesla sports car. A space-suited mannequin was strapped in the driver's seat, and the radio set to play a David Bowie soundtrack on a loop. The Tesla and its passenger have been despatched into an elliptical orbit around the Sun that reaches out as far as the Planet Mars. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 vehicles strapped together. And, as is the usual practice for SpaceX, all three boost stages - the lower segments of the rocket - returned to Earth to attempt controlled landings. Allow Twitter content?

Two came back to touchdown zones on the Florida coast just south of Kennedy. Their landing legs made contact with the ground virtually at the same time. ""That was epic,"" said Mr Musk. ""That's probably the most exciting thing I've ever seen, literally."" The third booster was due to settle on a drone ship stationed several hundred kilometres out at sea. Unfortunately, it was unable to slow its descent by re-igniting sufficient engines, missed the target vessel and was destroyed as it hit the water at some 500km/h. By then, the upper-stage of the Falcon Heavy, with its Tesla cargo, was heading on a trajectory that would hopefully take it towards Mars' orbit. That required the engine on the upper-stage to fire on three separate occasions, with the third and final ignition only occurring after a long cruise phase - something which was confirmed some six hours after the launch.

This video can not be played A car, a golf ball, a pie... the oddities sent into space over the years. Having such a large and powerful rocket should open up some fascinating new possibilities for Mr Musk and his SpaceX company. These include launching: Much bigger satellites for use by US intelligence and the military. The scale of these satellites is limited by current rocket performance. Large batches of satellites, such as those for Mr Musk's proposed constellation of thousands of spacecraft to deliver broadband across the globe. Bigger, more capable robots to go to the surface of Mars, or to visit the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, and their moons. Huge telescopes. Hubble's successor, the James Webb Space Telescope, is having to be folded origami-like to fit in its launcher next year. But it is the low cost - brought about through the recovery and reuse of the boosters - that Elon Musk believes will be a game-changer when allied to the new performance. ""It'll be game-over for all other heavy-lift rockets,"" he told reporters on Monday. ""It'll be like trying to sell an aircraft where one aircraft company has a reusable aircraft and all the other companies had aircraft that were single-use where you would parachute out at your destination and the plane would crash-land randomly somewhere. Crazy as that sounds - that's how the rocket business works.""

Did robots trigger the falls?,"The speed of Monday's fall was accelerated by algorithms Robot trading has accelerated this week's market dive and may have sparked the sell-off, experts say. Financial firms use computers programmed with complex sets of instructions known as algorithms. They identify trading opportunities and then strike faster than any human could. Algorithmic trading has become so ubiquitous that some estimate well over half of all trading of the S&P 500 Index is done this way. Such automated trading almost certainly accelerated the sell-off on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashing 800 points in ten minutes. ""The explosive speed of the fall ... that is done by machines,"" said Tom Stevenson, Investment Director at Fidelity Personal Investing. Most analysts believe the market tumble was prompted by a report on the US job market, released on Friday, which showed strong wage growth. But the decision to sell on that news may have been made by robot traders. US government bonds, or Treasuries, fell in value after the US jobs report. Yields (the interest that bonds offer investors) rise as prices fall. It's thought that robot traders were waiting for that yield to hit 3% - a significant figure as it could prompt human investors to switch out of shares into bonds. Mr Stevenson said: ""Everyone looks for a reason for why the fall happened. One of them was that bond yields rose up towards the magic number of 3%. ""There seems to have been a trigger at 2.9% for automatic trading to sell and once that trigger was pulled the markets went into freefall."" Piers Curran, head of trading at Amplify Trading, explained that algorithms will be set up to react in certain ways to certain situations. He said: ""One might work by a stop loss criteria, selling an asset as it falls to prevent further losses. ""So if the Dow Jones Index has dropped 5% it may trigger the machine to sell, but if you have a huge number of these algorithms hitting stop losses at the same time that produces further falls which produce further stop losses."" The algorithmic trading can also be triggered by ""correlation"" trades, when movement in one market will trigger a trade in a different market. Last week an Index called the VIX, nicknamed the Fear Index because it measures stock market volatility, started to rise sharply. Mr Currant said: ""The VIX was very elevated last week, and doubled on Monday, and because there is often an inverse correlation between the VIX and the Dow Jones Index, the machine trades sold US equities."" Man and machine. Robot traders can act a million times faster than a human The triggers though can work in the opposite direction. Many of the algorithms that sold equities on Monday were ""selling short"", that is selling stocks specifically to buy them back cheaper later and net a profit. Steep market falls created by algorithms can create equally steep recoveries. Mr Curran said: ""The markets were reacting to some very specific numbers on Monday, but they are only one set of figures. ""We are going to have to see wages growing strongly in February too and get at least four rises in interest rates this year before we can be sure inflation is going to be that much higher. ""The market reaction to these single numbers was massively exaggerated because of the machine trades."" Mr Stevenson agreed: ""Algorithmic trading or quant trading does make markets more volatile."" Longer term Mr Stevenson is not pessimistic. ""There are two things that can cause a proper bear market - interest rates rising faster than expected, or a recession,"" he said. ""Rates may rise a little faster but not excessively so. As for a recession, all the evidence, bearing in mind the strength of the US economy, is against it.""

Musk: Rockets will fly between cities,"Artwork: The BFR would assume the roles performed by current SpaceX vehicles People will soon be able to fly from city to city within minutes, rocket and car entrepreneur Elon Musk says. Mr Musk made the promise at the International Astronautical Congress (IAC) in Adelaide, Australia. A promotional video,externalsays the London-New York journey would take 29 minutes. Mr Musk told the audience he aimed to start sending people to Mars in 2024. His SpaceX company would begin building the necessary ships to support the mission next year. He says he is refocusing SpaceX to work on just one type of vehicle - known as the BFR - which could do all of the firm's current work and interplanetary travel. Elon Musk: ""That's not a typo"" Mr Musk first laid out his Mars travel ambitions at the IAC in 2016. Twelve months on, he returned with more detail. His BFR, although still massive, is now a little smaller at 106m in height and 9m in width. The major difference compared with the original version, however, was cost, the South African-born American said. ""I think we've figured out how to pay for it. This is very important."" Elon Musk and the hyperbolic hyperloop 'announcement' Musk warns of 'killer robot' arms race The route to affordability, he explained, was in refocusing all of the company's efforts into the one system - and then using that to meet all its customers' needs. Artwork: The BFR would launch much bigger or many more satellites than current rockets This means the BFR would launch satellites and service the space station - as SpaceX's Falcon 9 and Dragon capsule do now - but also take people to the Moon and Mars, and do what is termed ""point to point"" travel on Earth. ""Most of what people consider to be long-distance trips could be completed in less than half-an-hour,"" he told the Adelaide audience. ""Some of our customers are conservative and they want to see the BFR fly several times before they're comfortable launching [on it],"" Mr Musk said. ""So what we plan to do is to build ahead and have a stock of Falcon 9 and Dragon vehicles, so that customers can be comfortable if they want to use the old rocket, the old spacecraft - they can do that because we'll have a bunch in stock. ""But all of our resources will then turn to building BFR."" Artwork: Musk envisages colonies on Mars As well as being the CEO and chief designer at SpaceX, Mr Musk also founded the Tesla electric car company and is chairman of SolarCity which specialises in renewables technologies, such as high-storage batteries. He has attracted a rock-star following from fans who love his visionary thinking. And although his promises have often taken much longer to deliver, he has achieved a number of notable firsts. These include 16-in-a-row successful landings of orbital-class rockets back on Earth after they have completed their missions. Two of these rockets have even flown a second time. This video can not be played Elon Musk's 'underground road plan' Key to his thinking is the concept of reusability. Space activity is currently expensive only because it is disposable, he says. There is no reason, he claims, why rocket systems cannot be made to operate like airliners where the most significant ongoing cost is the fuel in the tanks. His Falcon 9 rocket is partially reusable; the BFR would be totally reusable. The same vehicle would fly time and time again. Mr Musk recognises that his ambitious timelines sometimes slip. When he put up a slide in Adelaide stating that the first cargo (no humans aboard) versions of BFR would go to Mars in 2022, he said: ""That's not a typo, although it is aspirational."" Elon Musk rolls out cheapest Tesla yet Australia to host 'historic' large battery Artwork: Why haven't we got a lunar base yet, Musk complained His many fans in the audience lapped up the presentation, but his numerous business customers will also have stiffened slightly at the news that SpaceX is to begin diverting its energies towards the all-new rocket system. These customers are extremely conservative - as Mr Musk himself concedes. They are only just beginning to grapple with the idea that they can put their very expensive satellites on ""second-hand"" Falcons. Now they must also get used to the idea that the Falcon will eventually be replaced by another rocket system - the BFR. Prof Alan Duffy is from the centre for astrophysics and supercomputing at Swinburne University of Technology in Melbourne. He was among the 4,000-strong audience at the IAC. ""This is SpaceX's Elon Musk. This is what he does,"" he told the BBC. ""What I love about SpaceX - and why the world's scientists and engineers are willing to give them that credence - is that they make things profitable at every step of the way.

Tarantino's 'regret' over Uma car crash,"The pair have been friends for over 20 years Quentin Tarantino has said allowing Uma Thurman to drive a car that crashed on the set of 2003 film Kill Bill is ""one of the biggest regrets of my life"". He said he drove the car in one direction to test it, but then asked Thurman to drive it the other way. He said he didn't realise there was a twist in the road coming back.Thurman posted footage of her crash,externalon Monday. The director said failing to test the route one more time was ""one of my most horrendous mistakes"". Thurman suffered neck and knee injuries in the accident. In aNew York Times interview,externalpublished over the weekend, Thurman said she had worries about the state of the car, but that Tarantino had persuaded her to go ahead with the scene. In an interview with Deadline Hollywood,external, the director said he heard ""Uma was trepidatious about doing the driving shot"" but added: ""None of us ever considered it a stunt. It was just driving. Maybe we should have but we didn't."" The crash affected their friendship for several years He said he drove down the road to check it was OK and thought, ""this is going to be okay. This is a straight shot... no hidden S-curves"". He added: ""I was very happy, thinking, she can totally do this, it won't be a problem. ""I came in there all happy telling her she could totally do it, it was a straight line, you will have no problem. Uma's response was 'OK'. Because she believed me. Because she trusted me... I told her it would be safe. And it wasn't. I was wrong. ""I didn't force her into the car. She got into the car because she trusted me. And she believed me."" He said they decided Thurman should drive the car down the same road in the opposite direction because the light would be better as it was getting towards the end of the day. ""I thought, a straight road is a straight road and I didn't think I needed to run the road again to make sure there wasn't any difference, going in the opposite direction. ""Again, that is one of the biggest regrets of my life. As a director, you learn things and sometimes you learn them through horrendous mistakes. That was one of my most horrendous mistakes, that I didn't take the time to run the road, one more time, just to see what I would see."" Kill Bill Volume One was released in 2003 He said it was ""just horrible"" when he saw her crash. ""It was heartbreaking. Beyond one of the biggest regrets of my career, it was one of the biggest regrets of my life. ""It affected me and Uma for the next two or three years. It wasn't like we didn't talk. But a trust was broken."" Thurman played Beatrix Kiddo (aka The Bride), who takes revenge on those who have wronged her Writing on Instagram, Thurman said she was proud of Tarantino forfinding the footage,externalfor her. ""Quentin Tarantino was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event, and gave me the footage years later so I could expose it and let it see the light of day, regardless of it most likely being an event for which justice will never be possible,"" she said. ""He also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm, and I am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage."" Michael Madsen played one of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad In the interview, Tarantino also responded to other claims in the New York Times - namely that the director spat in Thurman's face in the Kill Bill scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing so, and choked her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is seen doing it in the film. The director said: ""I love Michael, he's a terrific actor, but I didn't trust him with this kind of intricate work, of nailing this. So the idea is, I'm doing it, I'm taking responsibility. Also, I'm the director, so I can kind of art direct this spit."" Regarding the choking scene, Tarantino said it was the actress's suggestion ""to just wrap the thing around her neck, and choke her. Not forever, not for a long time"". He added: ""I would ask a guy the same thing. In fact, I would probably be more insistent with a guy."" Responding to the New York Times article, he added: ""Uma was in turmoil about the uprising against me this whole weekend... she never meant this to roll over to me.

Tarantino defended Polanski over 'rape',"Quentin Tarantino has been criticised after a radio interview resurfaced in which he said Roman Polanski having sex with a 13-year-old girl wasn't rape. In the 2003 interview, the Pulp Fiction director downplayed the incident - dismissing the idea that it was rape. Tarantino told DJ Howard Stern the 13-year-old ""wanted to have it"" and was ""down to party with Roman"". Polanski admitted unlawful sex with a minor in 1977 and served 42 days in prison before fleeing the US. Tarantino has not responded to a request for comment. Earlier, he apologised for the crash Uma Thurman sufferedwhile on set of the 2003 film Kill Bill. In the interview for The Howard Stern Show, which was posted to YouTube - but has since been removed, Tarantino discussed the Polanski case at length with Stern and his co-host Robin Quivers. As part of a plea bargain, Polanski pleaded guilty to unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor - an offence that was previously known as statutory rape. ""He didn't rape a 13-year-old,"" Tarantino told Stern. ""It was statutory rape. That's not quite the same thing... He had sex with a minor, all right. That's not rape. ""To me, when you use the word rape, you're talking about violent, throwing them down."" Roman Polanski has been in exile from the US for more than 40 years Quivers told Tarantino that Polanski's victim had been given psychoactive drugs and alcohol before being assaulted. The director still denied the sexual encounter could be deemed a rape. Tarantino replied: ""No, that was not the case at all. She wanted to have it and dated the guy."" Later in the exchange, Tarantino told Stern he accepted the act was illegal, and that he'd ""beat the hell"" out of a man who had sex with his 13-year-old daughter, if he had one. He went on: ""I don't believe that's rape. I believe it's against the law. I don't believe it's rape. Not at 13 - not for these 13-year-old party girls."" Quivers told Tarantino that Polanski could have avoided the situation by not socialising with 13-year-olds, to which the director responded: ""He likes girls."" On Twitter, many have been shocked at the comments. Anthony Rapp,who says Kevin Spacey made sexual advances on him when he was 14,called the interview ""gruesome"". Allow Twitter content?

Deadly earthquake strikes Taiwan,"This video can not be played Taiwan eyewitness Zeena Starbuck was caught in an aftershock live on TV A strong earthquake in Taiwan has killed at least two people and injured more than 200 others, officials say. The powerful 6.4-magnitude tremor struck at 23:50 (15:50 GMT) about 20km (12 miles) off the island's east coast. Emergency responders have rescued about 150 people from hotels and residential buildings that have partially collapsed in the city of Hualien. Photographs show tilting structures, scattered debris and extensive damage to roads in the area. Among the several badly damaged buildings was a hospital, local media reports. The lower basement and ground floor of the 10-storey Marshal Hotel gave way after the quake. The lower floors of the 270-room Marshal Hotel have collapsed, trapping people One member of staff has been rescued, but another two are said to be still be trapped in the building. ""We know there are people who are trapped inside - we can see lights inside the hotel,"" eyewitness Zeena Starbuck told the BBC. ""People with phones are shining their lights to let people know they're there."" At least two others are known to be trapped in residential properties, officials say. This video can not be played Children are lifted from a partially collapsed building in Taiwan About 40,000 homes are without water, and highways and bridges have been are closed. Residents have been told to stay away from their damaged homes, and about 800 have taken shelter in community buildings. Offices and school in the city will remain closed on Wednesday. The army has been called in to help with emergency rescues. Hualien has about 100,000 residents and is a popular tourist destination. Several high-rise buildings sustained severe damage, with this one tilting heavily People reported feeling the quake in the island's capital, Taipei, more than 160km (100 miles) away. Rescue efforts have been complicated by powerful aftershocks. Dozens of smaller tremors have been felt throughout the island over several days. Taiwan sits near a junction of two tectonic plates and is regularly hit by earthquakes. The earthquake happened on the second anniversary ofa 6.4-magnitude tremor that killed 117 people. Taiwan is an island which has for all practical purposes been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland. Are you in the area?

âVIP paedophile ringâ accuser charged,"Nick alleged that some of the abuse took place in the Dolphin Square apartments in London A man who alleged he was the victim of a VIP child abuse ring faces multiple charges relating to the possession of indecent images of children. The man, known as Nick, claimed a paedophile ring was responsible for murdering three children. He also said he was systematically abused and tortured by senior politicians and members of the armed forces during the 1970s and 80s. The claims triggered the abandoned Met Police investigation Operation Midland. Those he accused included former Conservative politicians Lord Brittan and Harvey Proctor, and Field Marshal Lord Bramall. After the Met launched Operation Midland in 2014 they held a press conference where a senior detective described Nick's allegations as ""credible and true"". In 2015, the Met carried out a series of high-profile dawn raids on the homes of those Nick had accused. All of them denied his allegations and no evidence whatsoever was found to support Nick's claims. After the Â£2.5m investigation was closed, without any charges, the Met apologised for the way they had conducted the inquiry and paid compensation. A report into Operation Midland, carried out by a retired High Court judge, said the Met had made a series of errors in the investigation and made 25 recommendations on how police should handle similar allegations in the future. Nick's real identity cannot be reported for legal reasons. The offences he was charged with last year relate to indecent images of children of varying levels of seriousness, including the most serious. Some of the offences are alleged to have happened during the same period he was talking to Operation Midland detectives. Nick is also being investigated for perverting the course of justice and fraud - a file of evidence for those offences has been sent to the Crown Prosecution Service.

"Man jailed for ex-girlfriend stab murderJoshua Stimpson is convicted of killing Molly McLaren, 23, by stabbing her 75 times in her car.4h4 hours agoKent","Molly McLaren met Joshua Stimpson on dating app Tinder A man has been jailed for murdering his ex-girlfriend by stabbing her 75 times in her car. Molly McLaren, 23, died in a ""frenzied"" attack at the Dockside shopping centre in Chatham, Kent, on 29 June. Joshua Stimpson, 26, had admitted manslaughter but denied murder before his trial at Maidstone Crown Court. Sentencing him to a serve a minimum of 26 years in prison, Judge Adele Williams said: ""This was a cruel, calculated and cowardly act."" The judge told Stimpson, of Wouldham High Street in Rochester, he may never be released for his ""wickedness"". She added: ""You slit her throat while repeatedly stabbing her. ""You were determined to punish her for finishing with you. You were seeking revenge."" Joshua Stimpson was jailed for a minimum of 26 years It took the jury less than four hours to convict Stimpson, who had been in a seven-month relationship with Ms McLaren before she ended it two weeks before her death. The court heard after the relationship finished, Stimpson posted derogatory messages about Ms McLaren on social media. This video can not be played Family and friends paid tribute to Molly McLaren after the verdict On the day of the murder he turned up at the gym she was in and waited for her to get into her car before he launched his attack. As well as the murder weapon, police recovered two Stanley knives and a pick axe from Stimpson's car at the scene. The judge told Stimpson: ""You are a highly-dangerous young man and you will pose a very considerable risk to women for a very considerable period in the future."" Joshua Stimpson and Molly McLaren had been dating for seven months The jury had been told Stimpson took his parents splitting up very badly and the feeling of abandonment from his mother leaving was ""more significant than it might have been for others"". In the years that followed, he was repeatedly referred to a mental health clinic in Gillingham, and had a ""hypersensitivity to any rejection"". However psychiatrist Dr Philip Josephsaid Stimpson does not have a personality disorder but has narcissistic traitsand showed ""no remorse"" for killing Ms McLaren. Det Sgt Ali Worton said Stimpson is a ""cold and calculated killer rather than somebody who does not have the mental capacity to control himself"". Ms McLaren's family released a statement thanking Kent Police and Benjamin Moreton ""for his brave efforts"" after he tried to intervene in the attack. It continued: ""The verdict has brought us a small measure of comfort, but it seems that nothing will take away the pain or allow us to come to terms with our Molly being taken from us.  We are serving a lifetime of pain, anguish and loss. ""A light has gone out in all of our hearts but shines bright as a star forever glowing. We love you Molly."" The family is calling for more awareness over the dangers of stalking and the need for people to report any concerns to the police. Stimpson had a history of stalking two previous girlfriends and was warned twice by police to keep away from Ms McLaren. Kent Police reported itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct after Ms McLaren's death. The force said the inquiry would be finalised once criminal proceedings were concluded.

Elon Musk's huge rocket set for launchThe entrepreneur will attempt to fly the world's most powerful rocket with his own Tesla as payload.1h31 minutes agoScience & Environment,"Elon Musk's roadster is ready to head in the direction of Mars Elon Musk is attempting to fly the world's most powerful rocket with his own sports car on the top. The US entrepreneur's Falcon Heavy launcher is designed to have twice the lifting capacity of any other vehicle. But because of the historic high failure rate of maiden flights, only a dummy payload is being risked. Mr Musk has decided this should be his old cherry-red Tesla roadster with a space-suited mannequin strapped in the driver's seat. David Bowie's classic hit Space Oddity will be looping on the radio as the car is hurled into an elliptical orbit that stretches out to Mars' orbit around the Sun. ""[The roadster will] get about 400 million km away from Earth, and it'll be doing 11km/s,"" he told reporters in a briefing on Monday. ""We estimate it will be in that orbit for several hundred million years, maybe in excess of a billion years."" This video can not be played A car, a golf ball, a pie... the oddities sent into space over the years. Three cameras attached to the car would provide ""epic views"", Mr Musk added. The Falcon Heavy will go up from the Kennedy Space Center Thousands of spectators were expected to descend on Florida's Kennedy Space Center to witness the ascent, which is tentatively scheduled for 15:45 EST (20:45 GMT). If technical glitches lead to a postponement, a second attempt by Mr Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, will be made on Wednesday. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 vehicles strapped together. But the triple-booster configuration has demanded a number of specific alterations, including a strengthening of the central core booster. The 27 Merlin engines at the base of the rocket should be capable of generating almost 23,000 kilonewtons of thrust - slightly more than double that of the world's current most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, which is operated by US competitor United Launch Alliance. Have they found a cure for our cancer? UK must tackle 'astonishing' congestion Dinos âtoo successful for their own goodâ The 70m-tall Falcon Heavy is designed to put up to a maximum of 64 tonnes in low-Earth orbit. That is like putting five London double-decker buses in space. In reality, however, the Heavy would rarely be asked to raise so much because SpaceX intends to land the rocket's boosters back on Earth after launch and the fuel required to do this necessarily negates some performance. But the rocket's immense thrust does open up some fascinating new possibilities. These include: much bigger satellites for use by US intelligence and the military. The scale of these satellites is limited by current rocket performance. large batches of satellites, such as those for Mr Musk's proposed constellation of thousands of spacecraft to deliver broadband across the globe. bigger, more capable robots to go to the surface of Mars, or to visit the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, and their moons. putting up huge telescopes. Hubble's successor, the James Webb telescope, is having to be folded origami-like for its launch in 2019 At the moment, the Falcon Heavy only has a handful of bookings on its manifest. Two of these are for large telecommunications satellites that must be thrown up into a geostationary orbit some 36,000km above the Earth. ""These satellites are over six tonnes, knowing that the capacity of the rocket is eight tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) - if it is fully reused,"" Rachel Villain, from the leading space consultancy Euroconsult, told BBC News. ""So, obviously, the objective must be to fully re-use the rocket, otherwise the capacity to GTO is 20 tonnes which is a lot to fill."" She added: ""The main targets are possibly the US government and those proprietary constellations. And when I say US government, I mean both beyond Earth orbit (Nasa) and the US Department of Defence, because SpaceX is now a recognised supplier to the DoD for classified and non-classified missions."" Assuming it works, the Falcon Heavy raises some thorny issues for US space policy. While Nasa could certainly find many uses for the extra capability, it has its own ""monster rocket"" in development. The conundrum for the agency and legislators in Washington DC is that this Space Launch System, as it is known, is still some years away from entering service (in a 70-tonnes to LEO configuration); but more than that - it will probably cost about $1bn per flight. Mr Musk says his Falcon Heavy will cost just $90m per flight. SpaceX rocket lights 27 engines Musk's Boring Company presents LA tunnel plan 'Approval' for hyperloop from New York to Philadelphia Many commentators are already asking how Congress can justify the considerable extra expense of the SLS when a much cheaper alternative is about to become available. And Mr Musk is not the only entrepreneur developing a commercial heavy-lift solution that promises to dramatically undercut the SLS on cost. Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon.com, is working on a rocket he calls New Glenn, which should be able to put 45 tonnes in low-Earth orbit. He has even teased something more powerful still, called New Armstrong. A test firing of the engines occurred at the end of last month Mr Musk has emphasised the difficulties in getting the Falcon Heavy ready for its maiden outing. His formal announcement of the project was in 2011, with a first flight planned for perhaps 2013. Five years later, the entrepreneur concedes the chances of failure are significant. ""If it goes wrong, hopefully it goes wrong far into the mission so at least we learn as much as possible along the way,"" he said. ""I'll consider it a win if it just clears the pad and doesn't blow the pad to smithereens. That's 4,000,000lbs of TNT equivalent.

United's Munich air disaster remembered,"Michael Carrick, Sir Alex Ferguson, executive vice-chairman Ed Woodward and manager Jose Mourinho paid their respects A service to mark 60 years since the Munich air crash which killed 23 people, including eight Manchester United players, has taken place. The crash, on 6 February 1958, happened on United's return from a European Cup tie in Belgrade. Eight players, three club staff, eight journalists, two crew members and two passengers were killed. The Old Trafford service included a minute's silence at 15:04, the time of the crash. Harry Gregg: Munich service will be last time at Old Trafford Munich air disaster and Man Utd's laundry ladies Thousands of fans turned out for the ceremony. Manchester United invited season ticket holders aged over 65 but said all supporters were welcome. Former United players Sir Bobby Charlton and Harry Gregg, who both survived the crash, were at the ceremony, along with former manager Sir Alex Ferguson. Current manager Jose Mourinho and captain Michael Carrick laid wreaths.

Club officials wore ties bearing the names of the eight players who died in the tragedy, while United chaplain John Boyers in a roll call of the 23 who lost their lives in the crash. The presence of the two remaining survivors, Harry Gregg and Sir Bobby Charlton, was particularly well received. Gregg, who went to the club's Carrington training ground earlier to meet the players, said it would be the last time he comes to Old Trafford. He sat behind current first team manager Jose Mourinho, who made a point of shaking the Northern Irishman's hand. Sheffield Wednesday, United's first opponents after the crash, were represented, as were Bishop Auckland, who loaned the club players. Kenny Dalglish was also present, as was former Manchester City star Mike Summerbee, in a nod to the loss felt by the whole city at the death of former Blues keeper Frank Swift. Gregg told BBC Sport NI he did not believe the disaster had defined him or the club. ""I do not think what happened in Munich made Manchester United. It is a very large part of Manchester United history but it's not all Manchester United,"" he said. ""I have seen Manchester United through bad times and good times. ""I'm just very glad that Harry Gregg from 34 Windsor Avenue was counted good enough to play for what I consider to be one of the greatest clubs in the world."" A service has also been held in Munich The victims of the crash were remembered at Saturday's match at Old Trafford Bayern Munich president Uli Hoeness and chief executive officer Karl-Heinz Rummenigge took part in a memorial service held in Munich.

Elon Musk's huge rocket set for launch,"Elon Musk's roadster is ready to head in the direction of Mars Elon Musk is attempting to fly the world's most powerful rocket with his own sports car on the top. The US entrepreneur's Falcon Heavy launcher is designed to have twice the lifting capacity of any other vehicle. But because of the historic high failure rate of maiden flights, only a dummy payload is being risked. Mr Musk has decided this should be his old cherry-red Tesla roadster with a space-suited mannequin strapped in the driver's seat. David Bowie's classic hit Space Oddity will be looping on the radio as the car is hurled into an elliptical orbit that stretches out to Mars' orbit around the Sun. ""[The roadster will] get about 400 million km away from Earth, and it'll be doing 11km/s,"" he told reporters in a briefing on Monday. ""We estimate it will be in that orbit for several hundred million years, maybe in excess of a billion years."" This video can not be played A car, a golf ball, a pie... the oddities sent into space over the years. Three cameras attached to the car would provide ""epic views"", Mr Musk added. The Falcon Heavy will go up from the Kennedy Space Center Thousands of spectators were expected to descend on Florida's Kennedy Space Center to witness the ascent, which is tentatively scheduled for 15:45 EST (20:45 GMT). If technical glitches lead to a postponement, a second attempt by Mr Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, will be made on Wednesday. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 vehicles strapped together. But the triple-booster configuration has demanded a number of specific alterations, including a strengthening of the central core booster. The 27 Merlin engines at the base of the rocket should be capable of generating almost 23,000 kilonewtons of thrust - slightly more than double that of the world's current most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, which is operated by US competitor United Launch Alliance. Have they found a cure for our cancer? UK must tackle 'astonishing' congestion Dinos âtoo successful for their own goodâ The 70m-tall Falcon Heavy is designed to put up to a maximum of 64 tonnes in low-Earth orbit. That is like putting five London double-decker buses in space. In reality, however, the Heavy would rarely be asked to raise so much because SpaceX intends to land the rocket's boosters back on Earth after launch and the fuel required to do this necessarily negates some performance. But the rocket's immense thrust does open up some fascinating new possibilities. These include: much bigger satellites for use by US intelligence and the military. The scale of these satellites is limited by current rocket performance. large batches of satellites, such as those for Mr Musk's proposed constellation of thousands of spacecraft to deliver broadband across the globe. bigger, more capable robots to go to the surface of Mars, or to visit the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, and their moons. putting up huge telescopes. Hubble's successor, the James Webb telescope, is having to be folded origami-like for its launch in 2019 At the moment, the Falcon Heavy only has a handful of bookings on its manifest. Two of these are for large telecommunications satellites that must be thrown up into a geostationary orbit some 36,000km above the Earth. ""These satellites are over six tonnes, knowing that the capacity of the rocket is eight tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) - if it is fully reused,"" Rachel Villain, from the leading space consultancy Euroconsult, told BBC News. ""So, obviously, the objective must be to fully re-use the rocket, otherwise the capacity to GTO is 20 tonnes which is a lot to fill."" She added: ""The main targets are possibly the US government and those proprietary constellations. And when I say US government, I mean both beyond Earth orbit (Nasa) and the US Department of Defence, because SpaceX is now a recognised supplier to the DoD for classified and non-classified missions."" Assuming it works, the Falcon Heavy raises some thorny issues for US space policy. While Nasa could certainly find many uses for the extra capability, it has its own ""monster rocket"" in development. The conundrum for the agency and legislators in Washington DC is that this Space Launch System, as it is known, is still some years away from entering service (in a 70-tonnes to LEO configuration); but more than that - it will probably cost about $1bn per flight. Mr Musk says his Falcon Heavy will cost just $90m per flight. SpaceX rocket lights 27 engines Musk's Boring Company presents LA tunnel plan 'Approval' for hyperloop from New York to Philadelphia Many commentators are already asking how Congress can justify the considerable extra expense of the SLS when a much cheaper alternative is about to become available. And Mr Musk is not the only entrepreneur developing a commercial heavy-lift solution that promises to dramatically undercut the SLS on cost. Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon.com, is working on a rocket he calls New Glenn, which should be able to put 45 tonnes in low-Earth orbit. He has even teased something more powerful still, called New Armstrong. A test firing of the engines occurred at the end of last month Mr Musk has emphasised the difficulties in getting the Falcon Heavy ready for its maiden outing. His formal announcement of the project was in 2011, with a first flight planned for perhaps 2013. Five years later, the entrepreneur concedes the chances of failure are significant. ""If it goes wrong, hopefully it goes wrong far into the mission so at least we learn as much as possible along the way,"" he said. ""I'll consider it a win if it just clears the pad and doesn't blow the pad to smithereens. That's 4,000,000lbs of TNT equivalent. There's probably not going to be much left if that thing lets loose."" Getting all 27 engines to light in unison and control them during the first phase of ascent is not straightforward. The Soviets tried to ignite 30 engines on the first stage of their ill-fated Moon rocket, the N1, and never got to orbit. Mr Musk has a future rocket under development he calls the BFR.

Fraud trial of Tesco executives abandoned,"Former Tesco executives Chris Bush (left), John Scouler (centre) and Carl Rogberg (right) The trial of three former Tesco executives charged with fraud and false accounting has been abandoned. Chris Bush, Tesco's former UK boss, John Scouler, Tesco's former commercial food director and Carl Rogberg, its former UK finance boss have been on trial for more than four months. It emerged on Tuesday that Mr Rogberg had a heart attack last Thursday. The Serious Fraud Office will decide in early March whether to pursue a re-trial. The men deny the charges. Mr Rogberg, aged 51, remains in hospital awaiting surgery. His solicitor read out a statement on the steps of Southwark Crown Court: ""Mr Rogberg is devastated at the news that the trial has been aborted. ""He waived his right to attend these last stages after he had given evidence himself for many days, and had participated in the last four and half months of the trial. ""He was always very anxious that this jury should be allowed to reach its verdict and is desperately sorry that they were prevented from doing so."" Discharging the jury, Judge Deborah Taylor said: ""It wouldn't be right or proper to continue with this trial."" She acknowledged the impact on the jury: ""It has been a long period and I know it must be quite frustrating for you not to come to a conclusion at the end of all your hard work during the course of this trial."" Nicholas Purnell, QC, representing Mr Rogberg, had asked for the trial to continue while his client was having treatment. He told the court: ""I think he would be utterly devastated to discover that as a consequence of what he has been through, there's a possibility that the trial has to start again."" The three defendants had been accused of fraud and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting scandal. The criminal charges stemmed from a statement the supermarket group made three-and-a-half years ago. On 29 August 2014,Tesco said it expected profits for the first half of its financial year,externalto be ""in the region of Â£1.1bn"". Some three weeks later, under the stewardship of new chief executive Dave Lewis, Tesco admitted that the figure had been overstated. In fact, it said that profits had beeninflated by an estimated Â£250m,external. Further investigations discovered that irregularities, which centred around its UK food business, were also found in Tesco's accounts for 2013-14. The figures had been flattered by early recognition of payments from suppliers who sell their goods in the supermarket's stores as well as delays in charging costs. Eventually, it was determined that Tesco had overstated its profits by Â£284m. The three men always denied the charges and argued in court that the SFO's investigation was flawed from the outset. Initially, the hope was that the case would finish before Christmas, but the trial has been beset by delays. The judge became ill during her summing up and there was a further pause of two weeks when a juror went on holiday. One member of the jury had already been discharged by then because of an operation. It's an outcome no one could've predicted - or would have wanted. It had already taken up more than a quarter of a year and had been beset by delays. There was the hope it would end before Christmas, then the judge became ill and it's been stop, start, stop ever since. Having already discharged one juror for health reasons, there was a further delay when a juror went on holiday. And then there's the cost. This has been a complex, multi-million pound, trial. The SFO, which brought the case, will now decide whether or not a retrial is appropriate. Meanwhile the defendants, who denied the charges, have almost another month to wait to find out what happens next.

Love Island women 'paid less' in new jobs,"This video can not be played Olivia Atwood speaks to MP Anna Soubry about her views on Parliament and being paid less since Love Island One of Love Island's female stars says she has been offered ""substantially"" less pay for the same jobs as the male contestants since leaving the ITV show. Olivia Attwood told the Victoria Derbyshire show this included jobs with her boyfriend Chris Hughes. The female contestants discovered the disparity after speaking to each other and ""doing some digging"". She said when her management approached the clients to ask why, they immediately matched the payments. Ms Attwood said there was ""a lot of panic"" when her management team of ""very strong women"" told the client the female stars knew they were being paid less. ""Straight away it was 'please don't tell anyone, we'll match the money'. So the money was always there,"" she said. 'Lady friendly' crisps mocked online Mass Greek protest at Macedonia name Korean men are starting a beauty revolution Speaking to Conservative MP Anna Soubry on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, the reality star said: ""We never got an answer [to], 'why did you feel that they should be paid more than us, for us all to come and do the exact same thing on the same day, the same outcome?'."" Olivia Attwood said she has also worked as a Formula 1 ""grid girl"" The 27-year-old said her boyfriend told her that when he worked with other men they were paid the same, irrespective of how well-known they were. ""They would never dream of insulting four men that way, but they'll tell the two girls and make up some ridiculous reason, but it was really because they thought they'd get away with it. ""That was really an eye-opener and it's made me angry,"" she said. Gender pay gap: Charity questions accuracy of data Gender pay gap and equal pay: What's the difference? Should men take a pay cut to reduce the gender pay gap? Gender pay gap 'widens as women get older' Ms Attwood also said that she had previously worked as a ""grid girl"" for Formula 1,a role the sport's bosses said would no longer be used from this season. She said she knew that fans of the sport did not need to see half-naked girls to enjoy it. ""But by the same token, if a particular girl wants to do that and she finds that really fun and she gets to travel the world doing it, I think you can go so far and take the fun out of everything, can't you?"" She added that the models were always very well looked after by the Formula 1 teams, and ""no-one got within 5m [15ft] of us"" and that they were told to shout about it ""if anyone had crossed any boundaries"". Ms Attwood added: ""So my experience with it was really good and really positive, whereas other girls might not have had the same protection.""

Review launched into future of newspapers,"Some titles, such as London's Evening Standard, have become free Theresa May has announced a review into the future of the newspaper industry, warning that the closure of hundreds of titles was a ""danger to our democracy"". In a speech in Manchester, she warned that the decline of ""credible"" news providers left the public ""vulnerable to news which is untrustworthy"". The review will look into sustainable funding models for the printed press at national, regional and local level. The prime minister said high-quality journalism was a ""force for good"". ""Good quality journalism provides us with the information and analysis we need to inform our viewpoints and conduct a genuine discussion,"" she said. ""It is a huge force for good. But in recent years - especially in local journalism - we've seen falling circulations, a hollowing-out of local newsrooms, and fears for the future sustainability of high quality journalism."" New tabloid look for the Guardian Mirror in talks to buy Express newspapers Publisher plans 'significant' job cuts Research by Press Gazette in December 2016 found that 46 regional and local titles had closed in the previous 18 months, with big players such as Trinity Mirror and Johnston Press among those shutting or merging long-established titles. The trade publication said there were 198 fewer regional and local titles than in 2005. ""Here in Greater Manchester, several local newspapers have closed, including the Salford Advertiser, the Trafford Advertiser and the Wilmslow Express,"" Mrs May said. The UK newspaper industry is still among the most competitive and diverse in the world ""This is dangerous for our democracy. When trusted and credible news sources decline, we can become vulnerable to news which is untrustworthy."" The review, whose chair will be announced in due course, will consider whether content providers are receiving a fair share of digital advertising revenue and how their data is collected and distributed by social media platforms such as Facebook and Google. BBC-funded reporters to be across UK Independent to cease as print edition It will also look at ""low-quality news"" and the prevalence of ""clickbait"" - a term used to describe sensational online headlines designed to drive traffic to websites - and whether ""commercial incentives"" driving the practice can be tackled. It will also look at what role the government can play in maintaining a diverse and vibrant press landscape or whether solutions should be left up to the industry. The News Media Association said viable business models must be found to ensure the survival of local journalism. ""Through digital platforms, news content is more widely consumed than ever before but the revenues to sustain the investment in that quality content are challenged,"" said its chair David Dinsmore. Many national papers have seen sharp declines in their print circulation in recent years, as more people access the news online. The Independent closed its print edition in 2016, while the Guardian and Observer recently went tabloid as part of a move to reduce the newspaper's losses, following other titles such as the Times.

Students fall ill after taking ecstasy,"The ""Tesla"" tablets, often orange and in the shape of a shield, can contain up to 240mg of MDMA Several students have fallen ill after taking super-strength ecstasy in North Yorkshire, prompting a warning to pupils and parents. The pupils, who attend Richmondshire schools, were recently hospitalised after taking orange ""Tesla"" tablets. North Yorkshire County Council did not confirm the number of pupils who fell ill, but it is understood to be under five. All have made a full recovery. The local authority has written to parents warning of the dangers. It said in a statement: ""We are aware of recent incidents that have resulted in a few young people requiring hospital treatment after taking Ecstasy. ""While the number affected is small, the local authority and schools take the issue very seriously."" More on this story and others in North Yorkshire Dr Lincoln Sargeant, director of public health at the council, said taking ""even one single tablet"" could be fatal and told parents to be alert for any mention of the pills. Schools which distributed the letter to parents Richmond School & Sixth Form College St Francis Xavier School, Richmond Wensleydale School and Sixth Form, Leyburn Risedale Sports and Community College, Catterick Garrison Bedale High School Hambleton and Richmondshire Pupil Referral Service The schools will take ""robust action"" against any student involved in taking or supplying tablets, the local authority added. The tablets, often in the shape of a shield, can contain up to 240mg of MDMA. Ecstasy, an illegal class A drug, can cause several short-term side effects including paranoia, an increased heart rate and a raised body temperature.

Christmas Day homeless helper fined,"Lee Williamson said he pulled in to a bus stop to give a homeless man clothes, food, and to chat to him A man who pulled in to a bus stop on Christmas Day to help a homeless man was fined by a council. Lee Williamson, of Evington, Leicester, said he stopped to give a homeless man a blanket, hat, gloves, scarf, food, and chat to him. He later received a Â£70 fine, despite there being no buses on 25 December. Leicester City Council said the camera enforcement was an important safety measure after acyclist died there in 2016. Mr Williamson, 43, said: ""I feel like I am being punished for helping someone - Â£70 could have put a homeless guy in a B&B for a week. ""Normally that is a busy road and I would never dream of stopping in a bus stop. But with it being Christmas Day, with no traffic and buses I could not see the harm in it."" War veteran Mr Williamson said it is normally a busy road and he would ""never dream"" of stopping in a bus stop He added that he wished the council could have ""a little more discretion and common sense"". ""I am not going to pay it. They will have to take me to court,"" he said. City Mayor Sir Peter Soulsby said: ""While buses may not be operating on Christmas Day, there is every likelihood that cyclists and other traffic will be using this stretch of road and stopping illegally in this area should still be considered dangerous. ""While we do recognise the good intentions in this instance, ample safe and legal parking was available within just a few metres of the bus clearway.""

Strong Taiwan quake topples buildings,"This video can not be played Taiwan eyewitness Zeena Starbuck was caught in an aftershock live on TV A strong earthquake in Taiwan has killed at least two people and injured more than 200 others, officials say. The powerful 6.4-magnitude tremor struck at 23:50 (15:50 GMT) about 20km (12 miles) off the island's east coast. Emergency responders have rescued about 150 people from hotels and residential buildings that have partially collapsed in the city of Hualien. Photographs show tilting structures, scattered debris and extensive damage to roads in the area. Among the several badly damaged buildings was a hospital, local media reports. The lower basement and ground floor of the 10-storey Marshal Hotel gave way after the quake. The lower floors of the 270-room Marshal Hotel have collapsed, trapping people One member of staff has been rescued, but another two are said to be still be trapped in the building. ""We know there are people who are trapped inside - we can see lights inside the hotel,"" eyewitness Zeena Starbuck told the BBC. ""People with phones are shining their lights to let people know they're there."" At least two others are known to be trapped in residential properties, officials say. This video can not be played Children are lifted from a partially collapsed building in Taiwan About 40,000 homes are without water, and highways and bridges have been are closed. Residents have been told to stay away from their damaged homes, and about 800 have taken shelter in community buildings. Offices and school in the city will remain closed on Wednesday. The army has been called in to help with emergency rescues. Hualien has about 100,000 residents and is a popular tourist destination. Several high-rise buildings sustained severe damage, with this one tilting heavily People reported feeling the quake in the island's capital, Taipei, more than 160km (100 miles) away. Rescue efforts have been complicated by powerful aftershocks. Dozens of smaller tremors have been felt throughout the island over several days. Taiwan sits near a junction of two tectonic plates and is regularly hit by earthquakes. The earthquake happened on the second anniversary ofa 6.4-magnitude tremor that killed 117 people. Taiwan is an island which has for all practical purposes been independent since 1950, but which China regards as a rebel region that must be reunited with the mainland. Are you in the area?

Assange arrest warrant still stands - court,"This video can not be played Julian Assange's lawyer says he is not hiding from justice A UK warrant to arrest Wikileaks founder Julian Assange is still valid, a court has ruled. The warrant was issued in 2012 after Mr Assange failed to answer bail over sex assault claims in Sweden, now dropped. Lawyers for Mr Assange, who has been living in London's Ecuador embassy since then, argued the warrant had therefore ""lost its purpose"". His lawyers went on to argue against it on other grounds and the court will rule on 13 February. At Westminster Magistrates' Court, senior district judge and chief magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said, having considered the arguments,she was ""not persuaded that the warrant should be withdrawn"",external. She told the court that not surrendering to bail was a stand-alone offence under the Bail Act and Mr Assange must explain why he had failed to do so. The offence carries a maximum penalty of one year in prison. Profile: Julian Assange Julian Assange: Sweden drops rape investigation Timeline: Julian Assange case His lawyers went on to argue that his case should be discontinued on the grounds that his treatment was not proportionate in the interests of justice. Mr Assange's lawyer Mark Summers QC said his client had ""had reasonable grounds for the course that he took"". He said the UN had ruled that Mr Assange's situation at present was ""arbitrary, unreasonable and disproportionate"" and his conduct in failing to answer bail had not had ""the usual consequence of paralysing the underlying legal proceedings"". Mr Summers said Mr Assange had ""at all times"" offered to cooperate with the Swedish investigation and the five and a half years he had spent in the embassy in London ""may be thought to be adequate, if not severe punishment, for the actions that he took"". Mr Assange has long feared that, if he leaves the Ecuadorean embassy and is arrested, he could then be extradited to the US to face prosecution for publishing classified information through Wikileaks. After the hearing, his legal team said they would continue to seek assurances that the UK did not have a US extradition warrant and would let him leave the country freely and without interference. Mr Assange later said in a tweet,externalthat he had received a package addressed to him at the embassy and containing ""an unknown white powdery substance and a threat"". The Metropolitan Police confirmed specialist officers assessed a small package and it was deemed not to be suspicious. Earlier this month the UK government refusedto grant Mr Assange diplomatic status and called on him to leave the embassy and ""face justice"". It has refused to guarantee he will not be extradited to the US, which has said his arrest is ""a priority"". Wikileaks, which was founded by Mr Assange in 2006, has been involved in several high-profile releases of classified US information. It made headlines around the world in April 2010 when it released footage showing US soldiers shooting dead 18 civilians from a helicopter in Iraq. Mr Assange promoted and defended the video, as well as a massive release of classified US military documents relating to the Afghan and Iraq wars in July and October 2010. The website continued to release new documents, including five million confidential emails from US-based intelligence company Stratfor.

"Carillion collapse delays Â£335m hospitalIt will be ""challenging"" to open the new Royal Liverpool Hospital in 2018, its chief executive says.1han hour agoLiverpoolComments","The Royal Liverpool Hospital building will cost Â£335m The collapse of Carillion has delayed the opening of the new Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital, with bosses saying it is unlikely to be finished in 2018. The hospital trust's chief executive Aidan Kehoe said opening the 646-bed site in 2018 would be ""challenging"". First due to open in March 2017, the project has been repeatedly delayed after asbestos was found on site, while remedial building work was also needed. Construction giant Carillion collapsed last month with debts of about Â£1.5bn. The Insolvency Service and accountancy firm PwC, which is overseeing Carillion's liquidation, declined to comment on the hospital delay. Much of the work on the hospital was close to completion when Carillion collapsed Liverpool Riverside MP Louise Ellman, who has previously stated the hospital was ""around 90% complete"", said she would be pressing ministers to minimise the delay because she did not ""want months to pass before work resumes"". She also said it was ""important that subcontractors who have not been paid are supported, so that they can remain viable and continue their work"", adding: ""A new contractor must be appointed."" Gail Cartmail, assistant general secretary of the union Unite, said the Royal Liverpool delay had revealed ""the stark reality"" of what Carillion's collapse meant for communities and the construction industry. She said: ""The Government needs to prioritise how stalled projects are restarted and what other support can be given to protect jobs and skills in Carillion's supply chain which are at increasing risk of being lost."" Green takes blame for Carillion failure Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Carillion collapse: What next? Mr Kehoe said the organisation in charge of the build, Hospital Company (Liverpool), was trying to work with existing sub-contractors and former Carillion staff ""because they have the best understanding of the work that is required to finish the job"". However, he said ""highly complex"" negotiations were taking time because many were facing financial difficulties as a result of Carillion's collapse. Mr Kehoe said: ""Given this situation, we expect a significant delay and it will prove challenging to get the new Royal finished before the end of the year."" The new hospital is being built next to the existing Royal Liverpool, which will be demolished once the new site opens. Graffiti at Carillion's Royal Liverpool Hospital site Mr Kehoe said the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust ""was doing all it can"" to minimise the completion delay including liaising with the Department of Health. He said: ""We all want the best for our patients and the people of Liverpool and that is to move into our world-class new hospital."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said health minister Steve Barclay had held a ""constructive discussion"" with Mr Kehoe on Monday. He said: ""Along with the hospital regulator NHS Improvement, we will continue to support all NHS organisations involved to ensure there are plans in place to keep any construction delays to a minimum."" Carillion employs 43,000 staff globally, about half of them in the UK where it did most of its business. It also operated in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. The British Medical Association, which previously said the company's collapse raised ""serious questions about PFI deals and the tendering of NHS services"",tweeted,externalthat ""both patients and staff need urgent answers on when construction will resume"".

"Tarantino's 'regret' over Uma car crashThe director says persuading the actress to drive a car that crashed on set was ""heartbreaking"".5h5 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","The pair have been friends for over 20 years Quentin Tarantino has said allowing Uma Thurman to drive a car that crashed on the set of 2003 film Kill Bill is ""one of the biggest regrets of my life"". He said he drove the car in one direction to test it, but then asked Thurman to drive it the other way. He said he didn't realise there was a twist in the road coming back.Thurman posted footage of her crash,externalon Monday. The director said failing to test the route one more time was ""one of my most horrendous mistakes"". Thurman suffered neck and knee injuries in the accident. In aNew York Times interview,externalpublished over the weekend, Thurman said she had worries about the state of the car, but that Tarantino had persuaded her to go ahead with the scene. In an interview with Deadline Hollywood,external, the director said he heard ""Uma was trepidatious about doing the driving shot"" but added: ""None of us ever considered it a stunt. It was just driving. Maybe we should have but we didn't."" The crash affected their friendship for several years He said he drove down the road to check it was OK and thought, ""this is going to be okay. This is a straight shot... no hidden S-curves"". He added: ""I was very happy, thinking, she can totally do this, it won't be a problem. ""I came in there all happy telling her she could totally do it, it was a straight line, you will have no problem. Uma's response was 'OK'. Because she believed me. Because she trusted me... I told her it would be safe. And it wasn't. I was wrong. ""I didn't force her into the car. She got into the car because she trusted me. And she believed me."" He said they decided Thurman should drive the car down the same road in the opposite direction because the light would be better as it was getting towards the end of the day. ""I thought, a straight road is a straight road and I didn't think I needed to run the road again to make sure there wasn't any difference, going in the opposite direction. ""Again, that is one of the biggest regrets of my life. As a director, you learn things and sometimes you learn them through horrendous mistakes. That was one of my most horrendous mistakes, that I didn't take the time to run the road, one more time, just to see what I would see."" Kill Bill Volume One was released in 2003 He said it was ""just horrible"" when he saw her crash. ""It was heartbreaking. Beyond one of the biggest regrets of my career, it was one of the biggest regrets of my life. ""It affected me and Uma for the next two or three years. It wasn't like we didn't talk. But a trust was broken."" Thurman played Beatrix Kiddo (aka The Bride), who takes revenge on those who have wronged her Writing on Instagram, Thurman said she was proud of Tarantino forfinding the footage,externalfor her. ""Quentin Tarantino was deeply regretful and remains remorseful about this sorry event, and gave me the footage years later so I could expose it and let it see the light of day, regardless of it most likely being an event for which justice will never be possible,"" she said. ""He also did so with full knowledge it could cause him personal harm, and I am proud of him for doing the right thing and for his courage."" Michael Madsen played one of the Deadly Viper Assassination Squad In the interview, Tarantino also responded to other claims in the New York Times - namely that the director spat in Thurman's face in the Kill Bill scene where Michael Madsen is seen on screen doing so, and choked her with a chain in the scene where a teenager named Gogo is seen doing it in the film. The director said: ""I love Michael, he's a terrific actor, but I didn't trust him with this kind of intricate work, of nailing this. So the idea is, I'm doing it, I'm taking responsibility. Also, I'm the director, so I can kind of art direct this spit."" Regarding the choking scene, Tarantino said it was the actress's suggestion ""to just wrap the thing around her neck, and choke her. Not forever, not for a long time"". He added: ""I would ask a guy the same thing. In fact, I would probably be more insistent with a guy."" Responding to the New York Times article, he added: ""Uma was in turmoil about the uprising against me this whole weekend... she never meant this to roll over to me.

Did robots trigger the market plunge?,"The speed of Monday's fall was accelerated by algorithms Robot trading has accelerated this week's market dive and may have sparked the sell-off, experts say. Financial firms use computers programmed with complex sets of instructions known as algorithms. They identify trading opportunities and then strike faster than any human could. Algorithmic trading has become so ubiquitous that some estimate well over half of all trading of the S&P 500 Index is done this way. Such automated trading almost certainly accelerated the sell-off on Monday, which saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average crashing 800 points in ten minutes. ""The explosive speed of the fall ... that is done by machines,"" said Tom Stevenson, Investment Director at Fidelity Personal Investing. Most analysts believe the market tumble was prompted by a report on the US job market, released on Friday, which showed strong wage growth. But the decision to sell on that news may have been made by robot traders. US government bonds, or Treasuries, fell in value after the US jobs report. Yields (the interest that bonds offer investors) rise as prices fall. It's thought that robot traders were waiting for that yield to hit 3% - a significant figure as it could prompt human investors to switch out of shares into bonds. Mr Stevenson said: ""Everyone looks for a reason for why the fall happened. One of them was that bond yields rose up towards the magic number of 3%. ""There seems to have been a trigger at 2.9% for automatic trading to sell and once that trigger was pulled the markets went into freefall."" Piers Curran, head of trading at Amplify Trading, explained that algorithms will be set up to react in certain ways to certain situations. He said: ""One might work by a stop loss criteria, selling an asset as it falls to prevent further losses. ""So if the Dow Jones Index has dropped 5% it may trigger the machine to sell, but if you have a huge number of these algorithms hitting stop losses at the same time that produces further falls which produce further stop losses."" The algorithmic trading can also be triggered by ""correlation"" trades, when movement in one market will trigger a trade in a different market. Last week an Index called the VIX, nicknamed the Fear Index because it measures stock market volatility, started to rise sharply. Mr Currant said: ""The VIX was very elevated last week, and doubled on Monday, and because there is often an inverse correlation between the VIX and the Dow Jones Index, the machine trades sold US equities."" Man and machine. Robot traders can act a million times faster than a human The triggers though can work in the opposite direction. Many of the algorithms that sold equities on Monday were ""selling short"", that is selling stocks specifically to buy them back cheaper later and net a profit. Steep market falls created by algorithms can create equally steep recoveries. Mr Curran said: ""The markets were reacting to some very specific numbers on Monday, but they are only one set of figures. ""We are going to have to see wages growing strongly in February too and get at least four rises in interest rates this year before we can be sure inflation is going to be that much higher. ""The market reaction to these single numbers was massively exaggerated because of the machine trades."" Mr Stevenson agreed: ""Algorithmic trading or quant trading does make markets more volatile."" Longer term Mr Stevenson is not pessimistic. ""There are two things that can cause a proper bear market - interest rates rising faster than expected, or a recession,"" he said. ""Rates may rise a little faster but not excessively so. As for a recession, all the evidence, bearing in mind the strength of the US economy, is against it.""

Stock markets: Your questions answered,"This video can not be played Wall Street's worst day since the crisis â explained in 90 seconds. As European stock markets follow the turbulence in Asia and US trading, the BBC has asked for your questions about what is happening. Many of the questions the BBC received focused on the possible ramifications for ordinary people. Others wanted to know if it was likely the instability could bring about a crash. BBC Business journalist Brian Milligan answers a selection of your questions below. Even if you don't own shares or bonds directly, there is a good chance you own them as part of your pension. Twelve million workers in the UK are now members of defined contribution (dc) schemes. This means the value of their retirement income is directly dependent on the value of the shares their pension fund owns. But as long as you are not retiring in the very near future, this should not really affect you. In fact the shares your pension fund will now be buying will be cheaper, and will have a better chance of growing in value. US shares regain ground after big losses European shares tumble in new sell-off Will a market fall turn into a rout? Live: Global stock markets slump Ultimately, share prices depend on two things: the profits made by companies, and the sentiment of investors. At the moment, many companies are making good profits, especially in the US, where tax cuts will boost earnings further. As long as these economic fundamentals are good, it is unlikely there will be a full-blown ""crash"" - unless investors have a real reason to worry. Their concern at the moment is about rising inflation and rising interest rates, which are actually signs the global economy is growing well. Investors are concerned by rising inflation and interest rates Ask your crystal ball! The only advice on this from the experts is that markets recover over the long term. The definition of ""long term"" is rather more hazy. ""Markets are capricious beasts in the short term and, looking forward, stock prices could move in either direction without defying the laws of statistics,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""However, in the long term, markets are more reliable in generating growth, and so anyone saving for retirement should still consider the stock market as a friend not a foe."" Do you have a question for the BBC to investigate? It's really the other way round. Investors are worried the US Federal Reserve - America's central bank - may raise rates four times this year, rather than the three previously expected. The Bank of England has also signalled that it expects to raise rates twice this year, maybe as soon as May. Higher borrowing costs mean lower profits for companies, and less spending by consumers. Which is why share prices have fallen. It is the danger of inflation which causes central banks to raise rates. However, the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will take market falls into account when deciding whether to increase rates, particularly if they think consumers are likely to cut their spending as a result. An A-Z Guide to Business Beasts The Bank of England target for CPI inflation is 2%. The latest figures show CPI running at 3% in the year to December. While the Monetary Policy Committee's main job is to keep inflation in check, it also takes into account the health of - and risks to - the economy as a whole. While it did put up rates by 0.25% in November - to 0.5% - that was the first rise in 10 years. However, the Bank has now hinted that it may not tolerate 3% inflation for much longer. The Bank of England raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade in November 2017 You may also like: Diesel cars: Your questions answered Your questions about interest rates answered Panama Papers: What happened next? Stock markets move constantly, so measuring growth very much depends on the dates you chose. But it is interesting to ask whether the average investor has gained or lost money over the last year, given the correction in prices. At the time of writing, the FTSE 100 is pretty much where it was a year ago. In other words at the headline level the average investor has neither lost nor gained money over the last year. However, when you take dividends into account, investors may still have made reasonable returns. The average yield on the FTSE 100 is currently 3.8% - far higher than the return on cash.

If you are considering investing soon, it may be worth using up your ISA allowance for 2017/18. If you buy a stocks and shares ISA, you can leave it in cash, until you decide where you want to invest. You are allowed to contribute up to Â£20,000, for which you will pay no tax on the income or capital gain. Younger people who want to buy a home may want to consider the Lifetime ISA, to which the government will contribute an extra 25%.

Ahmed: Will fall turn into rout?,"To the great synchronisation - stronger global growth returning to all the major economic engines of the world - add the great normalisation. The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing. Monetary policy is starting its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks. Now, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money. Fingers are hovering over the ""sell"" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to ""chase the dip"". Central banks led by the Federal Reserve have been gently tightening - withdrawing stimulus - as concerns grow that inflation is returning. It is the first time there has been such a synchronisation in major central bank policy since the financial crisis. When the Federal Reserve spoke of ""tapering"" in 2014, the Bank of Japan was in full monetary easing mode. When the Fed raised interest rates in December 2015, the European Central Bank cut them further into negative territory. Now the Fed is signalling further interest rate rises. The ECB's quantitative easing programme - the purchasing of bonds - is being reduced. And the Bank of Japan has also slowed its purchasing of long dated bonds. The next move by the Bank of England on interest rates is likely to be up. Make no mistake - we still have monetary policy broadly set for recession despite global economic growth being at its most positive since the financial crisis. Globally, the economic fundamentals are strong and the market falls we have seen come after a record long run of equity highs. But be prepared for more volatility ahead as markets catch up with the fact that the era of endless central bank support is coming, slowly but surely, to an end.

Carillion collapse delays Â£335m hospital,"The Royal Liverpool Hospital building will cost Â£335m The collapse of Carillion has delayed the opening of the new Â£335m Royal Liverpool Hospital, with bosses saying it is unlikely to be finished in 2018. The hospital trust's chief executive Aidan Kehoe said opening the 646-bed site in 2018 would be ""challenging"". First due to open in March 2017, the project has been repeatedly delayed after asbestos was found on site, while remedial building work was also needed. Construction giant Carillion collapsed last month with debts of about Â£1.5bn. The Insolvency Service and accountancy firm PwC, which is overseeing Carillion's liquidation, declined to comment on the hospital delay. Much of the work on the hospital was close to completion when Carillion collapsed Liverpool Riverside MP Louise Ellman, who has previously stated the hospital was ""around 90% complete"", said she would be pressing ministers to minimise the delay because she did not ""want months to pass before work resumes"". She also said it was ""important that subcontractors who have not been paid are supported, so that they can remain viable and continue their work"", adding: ""A new contractor must be appointed."" Gail Cartmail, assistant general secretary of the union Unite, said the Royal Liverpool delay had revealed ""the stark reality"" of what Carillion's collapse meant for communities and the construction industry. She said: ""The Government needs to prioritise how stalled projects are restarted and what other support can be given to protect jobs and skills in Carillion's supply chain which are at increasing risk of being lost."" Green takes blame for Carillion failure Where did it go wrong for Carillion? Carillion collapse: What next? Mr Kehoe said the organisation in charge of the build, Hospital Company (Liverpool), was trying to work with existing sub-contractors and former Carillion staff ""because they have the best understanding of the work that is required to finish the job"". However, he said ""highly complex"" negotiations were taking time because many were facing financial difficulties as a result of Carillion's collapse. Mr Kehoe said: ""Given this situation, we expect a significant delay and it will prove challenging to get the new Royal finished before the end of the year."" The new hospital is being built next to the existing Royal Liverpool, which will be demolished once the new site opens. Graffiti at Carillion's Royal Liverpool Hospital site Mr Kehoe said the Royal Liverpool and Broadgreen University Hospitals NHS Trust ""was doing all it can"" to minimise the completion delay including liaising with the Department of Health. He said: ""We all want the best for our patients and the people of Liverpool and that is to move into our world-class new hospital."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said health minister Steve Barclay had held a ""constructive discussion"" with Mr Kehoe on Monday. He said: ""Along with the hospital regulator NHS Improvement, we will continue to support all NHS organisations involved to ensure there are plans in place to keep any construction delays to a minimum."" Carillion employs 43,000 staff globally, about half of them in the UK where it did most of its business. It also operated in Canada, the Middle East and the Caribbean. The British Medical Association, which previously said the company's collapse raised ""serious questions about PFI deals and the tendering of NHS services"",tweeted,externalthat ""both patients and staff need urgent answers on when construction will resume"".

Hunt orders review of disciplining doctors,"Hadiza Bawa-Garba was struck off following an appeal Jeremy Hunt has ordered an urgent review of medical malpractice cases following concerns over a recent manslaughter case involving a doctor. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba wasstruck off the medical registerafter she was found guilty of mistakes in the care of a six-year-old boy who died of sepsis. The health secretary says clarity is needed about drawing the line between gross negligence and ordinary errors. Doctors should learn from - not fear - mistakes, he says. The Bawa-Garba case has rocked the medical profession. Medics rally behind struck off doctor Doctor struck off over six-year-old's death More than 800 medics have signed an open letter in support of Dr Bawa-Garba, saying focusing on one person ignored the part low staffing levels played in the tragedy and striking her off would discourage medics from being open when reviewing mistakes. Dr Bawa-Garba was originally suspended from the medical register for 12 months last June by a tribunal, but she has now been removed from the medical register following a High Court appeal by regulator the General Medical Council. The GMC said the the original decision was ""not sufficient to protect the public"". Jack died at Leicester Royal Infirmary in 2011 when undiagnosed sepsis led to cardiac arrest Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""The only way we can reduce mistakes in the NHS is to learn from every single one, and the tragic case of Dr Bawa-Garba raises many important questions about how the health system supports staff to be open and transparent when things go wrong."" The government's rapid review will be led by Prof Sir Norman Williams, former President of the Royal College of Surgeons, and will report back by the end of April 2018. It will look at: Any lessons that need to be learned by the General Medical Council and other professional regulators How learning, openness and transparency can be protected so that mistakes are learned from and not covered up Providing clarity to doctors about where they stand with respect to criminal liability and professional misconduct When six-year-old Jack Adcock, from Glen Parva, Leicestershire, was admitted to the hospital in February 2011, his sepsis went undiagnosed and led to him suffering a cardiac arrest. The courts heard Dr Bawa-Garba, a paediatrician, committed a ""catalogue"" of errors, including missing signs of his infection and mistakenly thinking Jack was under a do-not-resuscitate order. At the time of the ruling, Jack's mother, Nicola, said: ""We are absolutely elated with the decision. It's what we wanted. ""I know we'll never get Jack back but we have got justice for our little boy."" The Medical Protection Society, which represented Dr Bawa-Garba, said at the time: ""A conviction should not automatically mean that a doctor who has fully remediated and demonstrated insight into their clinical failings is erased."" An online appeal set up by concerned doctors has raised more than Â£320,000 to help pay the legal costs of Dr Bawa-Garba. Charlie Massey, chief executive of the General Medical Council, welcomed the announcement of the government's rapid review.

Children fall ill after taking ecstasy,"The ""Tesla"" tablets, often orange and in the shape of a shield, can contain up to 240mg of MDMA Several students have fallen ill after taking super-strength ecstasy in North Yorkshire, prompting a warning to pupils and parents. The pupils, who attend Richmondshire schools, were recently hospitalised after taking orange ""Tesla"" tablets. North Yorkshire County Council did not confirm the number of pupils who fell ill, but it is understood to be under five. All have made a full recovery. The local authority has written to parents warning of the dangers. It said in a statement: ""We are aware of recent incidents that have resulted in a few young people requiring hospital treatment after taking Ecstasy. ""While the number affected is small, the local authority and schools take the issue very seriously."" More on this story and others in North Yorkshire Dr Lincoln Sargeant, director of public health at the council, said taking ""even one single tablet"" could be fatal and told parents to be alert for any mention of the pills. Schools which distributed the letter to parents Richmond School & Sixth Form College St Francis Xavier School, Richmond Wensleydale School and Sixth Form, Leyburn Risedale Sports and Community College, Catterick Garrison Bedale High School Hambleton and Richmondshire Pupil Referral Service The schools will take ""robust action"" against any student involved in taking or supplying tablets, the local authority added. The tablets, often in the shape of a shield, can contain up to 240mg of MDMA.

Maldives opposition seeks foreign help,"This video can not be played Trouble in paradise: Maldives crisis explained The exiled ex-president of the Maldives has called for other countries to intervene in a political crisis engulfing the island nation. Mohamed Nasheed asked India to help release prisoners and the US to curb leaders' financial transactions. Turmoil began when current President Abdulla Yameen refused to release political dissidents, defying a court order and sparking protests. On Tuesday night, the Supreme Court revoked its move to free the prisoners. Two of its top judges had already been arrested. The remaining three have now issued a statement, saying the order was being rescinded ""in light of the concerns raised by the president"", according to AFP news agency. The government has declared a state of emergency, while the opposition has called the arrest of the two judges a ""purge"". Political turmoil threatens 'island paradise' Maldives leaves Commonwealth over democracy row Former Maldives leader 'given UK asylum' There has also been international condemnation of the government's moves, with the US expressing concern. President Yameen gave a televised address to the country on Tuesday, saying judges had been plotting a coup. ""I had to declare a national emergency because there was no other way to investigate these judges,"" he said. The Indian Ocean island nation is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 islands, and tourism is a vital part of its economy. By Olivia Lang, BBC News Under President Yameen, China has increased its influence in the Maldives as part of its ""string of pearls"" strategy in the Indian Ocean. India - which has traditionally viewed itself as the island nation's ""big brother"" - is not happy. Delhi is now very much aligned with former President Mohamed Nasheed, who is in exile in Sri Lanka. Mr Nasheed told me he wanted an Indian official ""with enough clout"" to go to the Maldives, ""backed by the military"". But he refused to be drawn on what exactly this meant. While India is unlikely to take military action, it would not look unfavourably at any move to dislodge Mr Yameen from power. Mr Nasheed called on India to put pressure on the Maldives government to release opposition detainees. He also asked the US to restrict Maldivian leaders' transactions through US banks.

In a statement, Mr Nasheed added: ""President Yameen has illegally declared martial law and overrun the state,external. We must remove him from power."" Mr Nasheed was an opposition leader under a former government and became the country's first democratically elected leader in 2008, but was ousted and jailed in 2012. A Maldivian minister to the UN, Jeffrey Salim Waheed, called his intervention ""treason"" and ""the single biggest attempt to undermine the Maldives' sovereignty"". Last week, the Supreme Court ordered the release of a group of opposition politicians. It also ruled that Mr Nasheed's trial, held in 2015, had been unconstitutional. The country's police commissioner said he would enforce the court's ruling and, in response, the government of President Yameen sacked him. The army has now been ordered to resist any attempt to impeach or remove President Yameen. Police arrested Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and another judge, Ali Hameed, hours after the government declared a state of emergency. Former President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, who has allied himself with the opposition, was detained at his home. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a video posted online, the ex-president addressed his supporters (in Divehi),external, saying that he had not ""done anything to warrant arrest"" while urging them to ""remain strong"". The state of emergency gives security forces enhanced powers to make arrests, and means public gatherings are banned. The political crisis comes during the country's peak tourism season, when tens of thousands of foreigners visit the Maldives' beaches. China, the US, India and the UK are among those issuing warnings to travellers in the Maldives. The UK's Foreign Office said British nationals in the capital, Male, should ""exercise caution and avoid any protests or rallies"", but that outlying islands and resorts - and the international airport - were not affected. Tourism was worth $2.7bn (Â£1.9bn) to the Maldivian economy in 2016. It is the biggest industry in the country - home to just 400,000 people - and could be hit hard if the crisis worsens and puts people off travelling.

Man guilty of murdering ex-girlfriend,"Molly McLaren met Joshua Stimpson on dating app Tinder A man has been jailed for murdering his ex-girlfriend by stabbing her 75 times in her car. Molly McLaren, 23, died in a ""frenzied"" attack at the Dockside shopping centre in Chatham, Kent, on 29 June. Joshua Stimpson, 26, had admitted manslaughter but denied murder before his trial at Maidstone Crown Court. Sentencing him to a serve a minimum of 26 years in prison, Judge Adele Williams said: ""This was a cruel, calculated and cowardly act."" The judge told Stimpson, of Wouldham High Street in Rochester, he may never be released for his ""wickedness"". She added: ""You slit her throat while repeatedly stabbing her. ""You were determined to punish her for finishing with you. You were seeking revenge."" Joshua Stimpson was jailed for a minimum of 26 years It took the jury less than four hours to convict Stimpson, who had been in a seven-month relationship with Ms McLaren before she ended it two weeks before her death. The court heard after the relationship finished, Stimpson posted derogatory messages about Ms McLaren on social media. This video can not be played Family and friends paid tribute to Molly McLaren after the verdict On the day of the murder he turned up at the gym she was in and waited for her to get into her car before he launched his attack. As well as the murder weapon, police recovered two Stanley knives and a pick axe from Stimpson's car at the scene. The judge told Stimpson: ""You are a highly-dangerous young man and you will pose a very considerable risk to women for a very considerable period in the future."" Joshua Stimpson and Molly McLaren had been dating for seven months The jury had been told Stimpson took his parents splitting up very badly and the feeling of abandonment from his mother leaving was ""more significant than it might have been for others"". In the years that followed, he was repeatedly referred to a mental health clinic in Gillingham, and had a ""hypersensitivity to any rejection"". However psychiatrist Dr Philip Josephsaid Stimpson does not have a personality disorder but has narcissistic traitsand showed ""no remorse"" for killing Ms McLaren. Det Sgt Ali Worton said Stimpson is a ""cold and calculated killer rather than somebody who does not have the mental capacity to control himself"". Ms McLaren's family released a statement thanking Kent Police and Benjamin Moreton ""for his brave efforts"" after he tried to intervene in the attack. It continued: ""The verdict has brought us a small measure of comfort, but it seems that nothing will take away the pain or allow us to come to terms with our Molly being taken from us.  We are serving a lifetime of pain, anguish and loss. ""A light has gone out in all of our hearts but shines bright as a star forever glowing. We love you Molly."" The family is calling for more awareness over the dangers of stalking and the need for people to report any concerns to the police. Stimpson had a history of stalking two previous girlfriends and was warned twice by police to keep away from Ms McLaren. Kent Police reported itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct after Ms McLaren's death. The force said the inquiry would be finalised once criminal proceedings were concluded.

Arrests made in people smuggling raids,"Police targeted about 20 properties in the North East and south of England Raids have taken place across England in an operation to tackle people smuggling involving suspected Kurdish gangsters. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said 350 officers were involved in the raids in Middlesbrough, Hartlepool, Stockton, Newcastle, Hastings and London. Officers raided about 20 addresses and arrested 20 men and one woman. The gang is suspected of charging up to Â£10,000 per head to smuggle migrants in the back of lorries across the Channel. As well as residential properties, a number of car washes believed to be linked to money laundering activities were also raided. The NCA said most of the trafficked immigrants are Iraqi Kurds and mostly men, but some families have also been brought into Britain. Deputy director Tom Dowdall said: ""We believe we have identified and disrupted a significant network which is suspected of smuggling hundreds of migrants into the UK and planned to carry on going."" A woman was arrested at an address on Teesside Police arrested a 42-year-old from a terraced house in Devonshire Road, Linthorpe, Middlesbrough, who was one of 16 people arrested in the Cleveland Police area. A further two people were arrested in London, as well as two in Sussex and one in the Northumbria area. The NCA's senior investigating officer Mark Spoors said the suspects were arrested on suspicion of immigration offences and linked to money laundering. ""The crime group have used complicit lorry drivers running from France into the UK,"" he added. Mr Spoors said the operation had been a success as all the targets had been arrested. Police made 21 arrests in the major operation The operation followed a year-long investigation with links to the French, Belgian and Dutch authorities, the NCA said. It said it was one of the biggest operations it had carried out since it started five years ago. Officers at a briefing at Cleveland Police's HQ in Middlesbrough were told some of those targeted were suspected of being involved in bringing migrants into the UK in lorries for money. They were told two men in the Linthorpe area of Middlesbrough were thought to be ringleaders.

Fraud trial of Tesco executives abandonedThe trial of three former Tesco executives has been stopped after one of the defendants suffered a heart attack.1han hour agoBusiness,"Former Tesco executives Chris Bush (left), John Scouler (centre) and Carl Rogberg (right) The trial of three former Tesco executives charged with fraud and false accounting has been abandoned. Chris Bush, Tesco's former UK boss, John Scouler, Tesco's former commercial food director and Carl Rogberg, its former UK finance boss have been on trial for more than four months. It emerged on Tuesday that Mr Rogberg had a heart attack last Thursday. The Serious Fraud Office will decide in early March whether to pursue a re-trial. The men deny the charges. Mr Rogberg, aged 51, remains in hospital awaiting surgery. His solicitor read out a statement on the steps of Southwark Crown Court: ""Mr Rogberg is devastated at the news that the trial has been aborted. ""He waived his right to attend these last stages after he had given evidence himself for many days, and had participated in the last four and half months of the trial. ""He was always very anxious that this jury should be allowed to reach its verdict and is desperately sorry that they were prevented from doing so."" Discharging the jury, Judge Deborah Taylor said: ""It wouldn't be right or proper to continue with this trial."" She acknowledged the impact on the jury: ""It has been a long period and I know it must be quite frustrating for you not to come to a conclusion at the end of all your hard work during the course of this trial."" Nicholas Purnell, QC, representing Mr Rogberg, had asked for the trial to continue while his client was having treatment. He told the court: ""I think he would be utterly devastated to discover that as a consequence of what he has been through, there's a possibility that the trial has to start again."" The three defendants had been accused of fraud and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting scandal. The criminal charges stemmed from a statement the supermarket group made three-and-a-half years ago. On 29 August 2014,Tesco said it expected profits for the first half of its financial year,externalto be ""in the region of Â£1.1bn"". Some three weeks later, under the stewardship of new chief executive Dave Lewis, Tesco admitted that the figure had been overstated. In fact, it said that profits had beeninflated by an estimated Â£250m,external. Further investigations discovered that irregularities, which centred around its UK food business, were also found in Tesco's accounts for 2013-14. The figures had been flattered by early recognition of payments from suppliers who sell their goods in the supermarket's stores as well as delays in charging costs. Eventually, it was determined that Tesco had overstated its profits by Â£284m. The three men always denied the charges and argued in court that the SFO's investigation was flawed from the outset. Initially, the hope was that the case would finish before Christmas, but the trial has been beset by delays. The judge became ill during her summing up and there was a further pause of two weeks when a juror went on holiday. One member of the jury had already been discharged by then because of an operation. It's an outcome no one could've predicted - or would have wanted. It had already taken up more than a quarter of a year and had been beset by delays. There was the hope it would end before Christmas, then the judge became ill and it's been stop, start, stop ever since. Having already discharged one juror for health reasons, there was a further delay when a juror went on holiday. And then there's the cost. This has been a complex, multi-million pound, trial. The SFO, which brought the case, will now decide whether or not a retrial is appropriate. Meanwhile the defendants, who denied the charges, have almost another month to wait to find out what happens next.

Katie Price takes online abuse fight to MPsThe reality TV star will tell a committee of MPs about the need for new laws against online abuse.16m16 minutes agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played Katie Price: âHe canât speak to defend himself, I canâ Katie Price has told MPs of the ""horrific"" social media abuse targeted at her son Harvey, and how she wants to protect him from it. The model and reality TV star is campaigning for online abuse to be made a criminal offence. MPs launched an inquiry into online abuse after a petition started by Ms Price was backed by 200,000 people. Harvey, who is 15-years-old, is partially blind, autistic and has Prader-Willi syndrome. Ms Price, who has four other children, told the Commons petitions committee only Harvey had been singled out for cruel mockery including ""a lot of racial abuse"". ""They know he hasn't got a voice back and they mock him more...  I just think they find him an easy target - just to pick on. ""But I'm his voice. I'm here and I am going to protect him."" Social media sites 'face tax over abuse' End intimidation in politics, PM warns She said she had complained to the police but they had been unable to take action because there were no specific laws in place to deal with online abuse. ""The most horrific things.... have been said about my son,"" she told the MPs, and she had realised through her petition that others face similar harassment. Katie Price's son Harvey accompanied her to Parliament Her mother, Amy Price, suggested ""the law is out of date - it's got to be policed more"". Katie ""has always been in the limelight"" and she has ""got used to it,"" she added, but the abuse of Harvey ""does upset you and you do feel emotional - it's hard"". In response to the suggestion that she invited the insults by posting pictures of her son, Katie Price said ""I'm proud of Harvey"" and it was important for disabled children to have visibility. Katie Price and her mother Amy wore rosettes marking the 100th anniversary of the law that first allowed some women to vote MPs put questions to witnesses at committee hearings She said the criminalisation of online abuse shouldn't just be restricted to the targeting of disabled people. ""I know I'm here because it started off because Harvey and his disabilities but this isn't just for people with disabilities as well, it will help everybody."" She added: ""Like me or hate me, I'm here to protect others."" She said it was important to protect freedom of speech and there needed to be a discussion about how bad abuse could get before it was considered criminal. She also argued for a register of people found guilty of online abuse, saying:  ""If they are big enough to go behind their computers and say these things then I want them named and shamed."" After 40 minutes facing MPs' questions, she said:  ""I know you lot sitting there agree with me, really. ""We know we all agree but we just have to get the government to do it."" If nothing happened, she joked, she would be ""like Arnold Schwarzenegger - I'll be back."" The Petitions Committee is looking at the impact of online abuse - particularly on people with disabilities - responsibility for protection, whether technology companies are doing enough. It is also examining whether the law needs to be changed, how to define online abuse and what support is given to victims. The government's minister for women, Victoria Atkins, said she had become disillusioned with social media. This video can not be played The minister for women on quitting Twitter because of death threats. ""I've come off Twitter because I was so fed up of it. I was fed up with the death threats and the nastiness, from people who often live many, many miles away from my constituency,"" she told BBC Radio 5 live's told Emma Barnett. It comes as Prime Minister Theresa May also announced proposed new laws to stop people being intimidated in public life. In a speech marking the centenary of women getting the vote, she made an appeal for ""tolerance and respect"" and said it was unacceptable for anyone to face threats over their political views. The PM added that she was considering a new offence to protect politicians and their families.

Frasier star John Mahoney dies aged 77,"This video can not be played John Mahoney, who played Marty Crane in Frasier, has died at the age of 77. The British-born actor John Mahoney, who played Martin Crane in the US sitcom Frasier, has died aged 77. He died on Sunday while in hospice care in Chicago. Mahoney enjoyed a distinguished career in theatre, winning a Tony award, and had a long list of film and TV credits. But he will be best remembered for playing the unpretentious, blunt father of Frasier and Niles Crane in the hit comedy, which ran for 11 seasons from 1993-2004. Mahoney won a SAG award in 2000 for the role, and was also nominated for two Emmys and two Golden Globes. Much of the comic spark in Frasier came from the relationship between the down-to-earth retired police officer Martin Crane and his pompous sons Frasier and Niles, played by Kelsey Grammer and David Hyde Pierce. Mahoney (pictured second from right) with his co-stars in Frasier Mahoney was born in Blackpool, where his pregnant mother had been evacuated to escape Nazi bombing raids. He moved to the US as a young man, serving in the US army for three years, which he credits with eradicating his native British accent. It was only in his 40s that he became a professional actor, after actors John Malkovich and Gary Sinise invited him to join the new Steppenwolf Theatre Company. Allow Twitter content?

Elon Musk's huge rocket set for launchThe entrepreneur will attempt to fly the world's most powerful rocket with his own Tesla as payload.11h11 hours agoScience & Environment,"Elon Musk's roadster is ready to head in the direction of Mars Elon Musk is attempting to fly the world's most powerful rocket with his own sports car on the top. The US entrepreneur's Falcon Heavy launcher is designed to have twice the lifting capacity of any other vehicle. But because of the historic high failure rate of maiden flights, only a dummy payload is being risked. Mr Musk has decided this should be his old cherry-red Tesla roadster with a space-suited mannequin strapped in the driver's seat. David Bowie's classic hit Space Oddity will be looping on the radio as the car is hurled into an elliptical orbit that stretches out to Mars' orbit around the Sun. ""[The roadster will] get about 400 million km away from Earth, and it'll be doing 11km/s,"" he told reporters in a briefing on Monday. ""We estimate it will be in that orbit for several hundred million years, maybe in excess of a billion years."" This video can not be played A car, a golf ball, a pie... the oddities sent into space over the years. Three cameras attached to the car would provide ""epic views"", Mr Musk added. The Falcon Heavy will go up from the Kennedy Space Center Thousands of spectators were expected to descend on Florida's Kennedy Space Center to witness the ascent, which is tentatively scheduled for 15:45 EST (20:45 GMT). If technical glitches lead to a postponement, a second attempt by Mr Musk's rocket company, SpaceX, will be made on Wednesday. The Falcon Heavy is essentially three of SpaceX's workhorse Falcon 9 vehicles strapped together. But the triple-booster configuration has demanded a number of specific alterations, including a strengthening of the central core booster. The 27 Merlin engines at the base of the rocket should be capable of generating almost 23,000 kilonewtons of thrust - slightly more than double that of the world's current most powerful rocket, the Delta IV Heavy, which is operated by US competitor United Launch Alliance. Have they found a cure for our cancer? UK must tackle 'astonishing' congestion Dinos âtoo successful for their own goodâ The 70m-tall Falcon Heavy is designed to put up to a maximum of 64 tonnes in low-Earth orbit. That is like putting five London double-decker buses in space. In reality, however, the Heavy would rarely be asked to raise so much because SpaceX intends to land the rocket's boosters back on Earth after launch and the fuel required to do this necessarily negates some performance. But the rocket's immense thrust does open up some fascinating new possibilities. These include: much bigger satellites for use by US intelligence and the military. The scale of these satellites is limited by current rocket performance. large batches of satellites, such as those for Mr Musk's proposed constellation of thousands of spacecraft to deliver broadband across the globe. bigger, more capable robots to go to the surface of Mars, or to visit the outer planets such as Jupiter and Saturn, and their moons. putting up huge telescopes. Hubble's successor, the James Webb telescope, is having to be folded origami-like for its launch in 2019 At the moment, the Falcon Heavy only has a handful of bookings on its manifest. Two of these are for large telecommunications satellites that must be thrown up into a geostationary orbit some 36,000km above the Earth. ""These satellites are over six tonnes, knowing that the capacity of the rocket is eight tonnes to geostationary transfer orbit (GTO) - if it is fully reused,"" Rachel Villain, from the leading space consultancy Euroconsult, told BBC News. ""So, obviously, the objective must be to fully re-use the rocket, otherwise the capacity to GTO is 20 tonnes which is a lot to fill."" She added: ""The main targets are possibly the US government and those proprietary constellations. And when I say US government, I mean both beyond Earth orbit (Nasa) and the US Department of Defence, because SpaceX is now a recognised supplier to the DoD for classified and non-classified missions."" Assuming it works, the Falcon Heavy raises some thorny issues for US space policy. While Nasa could certainly find many uses for the extra capability, it has its own ""monster rocket"" in development. The conundrum for the agency and legislators in Washington DC is that this Space Launch System, as it is known, is still some years away from entering service (in a 70-tonnes to LEO configuration); but more than that - it will probably cost about $1bn per flight. Mr Musk says his Falcon Heavy will cost just $90m per flight. SpaceX rocket lights 27 engines Musk's Boring Company presents LA tunnel plan 'Approval' for hyperloop from New York to Philadelphia Many commentators are already asking how Congress can justify the considerable extra expense of the SLS when a much cheaper alternative is about to become available. And Mr Musk is not the only entrepreneur developing a commercial heavy-lift solution that promises to dramatically undercut the SLS on cost. Jeff Bezos, the head of Amazon.com, is working on a rocket he calls New Glenn, which should be able to put 45 tonnes in low-Earth orbit. He has even teased something more powerful still, called New Armstrong. A test firing of the engines occurred at the end of last month Mr Musk has emphasised the difficulties in getting the Falcon Heavy ready for its maiden outing. His formal announcement of the project was in 2011, with a first flight planned for perhaps 2013. Five years later, the entrepreneur concedes the chances of failure are significant. ""If it goes wrong, hopefully it goes wrong far into the mission so at least we learn as much as possible along the way,"" he said. ""I'll consider it a win if it just clears the pad and doesn't blow the pad to smithereens. That's 4,000,000lbs of TNT equivalent. There's probably not going to be much left if that thing lets loose."" Getting all 27 engines to light in unison and control them during the first phase of ascent is not straightforward. The Soviets tried to ignite 30 engines on the first stage of their ill-fated Moon rocket, the N1, and never got to orbit. Mr Musk has a future rocket under development he calls the BFR. This will feature 31 first-stage engines.

I grew up with a female prime minister in charge. It would have made no sense to me whatsoever back then to discover that women hadn't had a say. If Mrs Thatcher wasn't always given a fond reception in Glasgow in the 1980s, it wasn't because she had a particular kind of chromosomes. And growing up - I suppose like many women of my generation - our expectation was that if you worked hard enough, women could more or less have it all. That sense of what was possible grew with the size of Sue Ellen from Dallas's shoulder pads, followed later by the Spice Girls' cartoonish power. The fictitious Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins seemed to rather enjoy dashing off to suffragette rallies (whatever they really were), which of course she could do only with the help of her nanny to look after her children. But to learn about the history of the fight for the vote back then seemed like a study of a weird injustice overturned from another world, not anything that could be in the memory of anyone's lifetime. Interesting to learn, yes, but relevant? It didn't necessarily seem so. Well guess what? I can't be the only person in the world to have discovered as I grew up that life was a bit more complicated than that, and opportunity for women wasn't really going to be defined by Kylie Minogue's example of switching careers when she fancied it. Personal choices were a lot more complex. And yes, reality crept in - women were, and are, treated differently in so many parts of life. Without question, that decades-long struggle finds its own echoes today. I'm writing this late at night on a bus speeding along a four-lane highway in China. It's full of officials from No 10 and other British journalists. We're all trailing the convoy of the UK's second female prime minister, who saw off another woman for her job (although who knows what might come next), following her every move in a trade mission as she escapes the political maelstrom for a moment. And while there are plenty of women in this travelling version of the Westminster bubble, here, as time and again in our politics, it is a long way off from being one-for-one. In politics at least, it is abundantly clear that big changes have taken place. Parliament does now look more like the population. There are 208 female MPs at the moment, that's a record level. But it's still not quite a third, and well short of reflecting the population. It's a long time since the first ever MP was elected, in 1918, a long time since 19 MPs were voted in at the 1979 general election alongside the country's first female political leader, the 60 women elected in 1992 or even the dramatic doubling in 1997. Life is about more than just numbers, of course, but does the proportion of women sitting on our green benches really matter? Forty five women have served as cabinet ministers (pictures: Getty Images & PA) The argument is made, by most politicians certainly, that we should be aiming for something much more like 50-50. But the parties have different approaches to how to hit that mark. Labour has pursued an active strategy for many years, where only women are allowed to stand for some seats. The all-women shortlist was much argued over to start with. And as times move on there's a new pointed question, dragging in the debate over the status of transgender candidates. The Tories have worked more informally, using support networks and gentle encouragement - and that has often been important too. Interestingly, many female MPs who give wholehearted backing to Theresa May came to know and like her through her work over the years as part of their organisation, Women To Win. But why should they make the effort, and does it matter to you? Certainly most voters have got many more things to worry about than gender equality in politics. Remember, it took years and years for the campaigns of the suffragettes to cut through. But if we want our politics to represent all of us fairly, consider this. If you are reading this with female eyes then I guess, like me, you're no stranger to being the only woman in the room. It's not necessarily bad, or good, sometimes it doesn't occur to you at all, but sometimes it is glaringly obvious, and rather different. If you are a man reading this, what does it feel like if you are the only one in a room full of women? Again, whether you like it or loathe it, you may not always notice, but when you do, sometimes it can feel pretty different. As human beings, we all know that different environments and different contexts lead to different conversations. Think back to when women were forbidden from having a say in who ran the country. Were their voices heard, their hopes and fears fully taken into consideration? With the glorious benefit of 100 years of hindsight, the answer to that is a straightforward no. A century on, is it so strange to hope that everyone can be represented in any room? That's not to say for a second that women's concerns are all the same. But in the most straightforward of terms, if you want a system to be successful, why would you not want to include as many people as possible? Does a democracy inspire faith, if some of its members feel no-one is listening? As this anniversary approaches it is not simply a question of commemorating an achievement of days long gone. The best tribute maybe is to remember suffrage's most simple message, to give everyone a say.

Reality Check: What if women couldn't vote?,"It's 100 years since some women (and all men) were finally given the vote. But how might political history have been different if they hadn't won suffrage? In the real world, the Conservatives couldn't win a majority at the 2017 general election. But what would happen if all the votes cast by women were removed from the equation? Because of different patterns in how men and women vote it is likely the result would have been different and Prime Minister Theresa May would have had a majority. The results of some other elections would probably have been different too in this alternate reality. It's important to be clear about the limitations of what we can know here. The secret ballot means we never have definitive figures about how men and women vote. We are reliant on studies that involve asking a sample of the population how they voted after elections have taken place. PM hails 'heroic' suffragettes on centenary Laura Kuenssberg: The journey towards 50-50 The women against female suffrage How the Suffragettes woke us up The gender gap in voting is fairly small. Other demographic factors have a far bigger impact on people's likelihood to vote for each party. In the past, social class was a dominant factor. Middle-class people were more likely to vote Conservative and working-class people were more likely to vote Labour. Women at a polling station in 1983 Recently that's changed. In 2017, age and education were far more important. Young voters and voters with degrees were more likely to back Labour. Older voters and those with fewer qualifications were more likely to back the Conservatives. But how do the sexes differ when it comes to elections? If we look back over time the gender gap in voting has changed. The British Election Study has data going back to the 1964 general election. In the 1960s and 1970s it found that women were more likely than men to vote Conservative and less likely to vote Labour. It's not easy to find a definitive explanation. Hate mail and firebombs: How women won the vote Women's suffrage: New coin to mark 100 years of voting The 100-year-old protest posters that show women's outrage The Pankhurst Anthem: Song written for women's vote centenary Voting behaviour expert Dr Rosalind Shorrocks, from the University of Manchester, says that one of the reasons behind the difference was that women were more religious than men, and also points to the way they were affected by government policies. ""The Conservative Party's post-war anti-rationing stance appealed particularly to housewives who were managing family budgets,"" she explains. So in a close election like 1970, it was probably women voters who sealed the Conservative victory. That trend evaporated in the 1980s - interestingly when the prime minister was a woman - before returning in the 1990s. At recent elections the pattern seems to have become more volatile, like other trends in voting behaviour. In 2010 there was very little difference between men and women in terms of the two main parties. But women were more likely to back the Liberal Democrats and less likely to back smaller parties. The gender gap for other parties became more pronounced in 2015. This was connected to UKIP's very strong showing. They received 13% of the vote overall but were considerably more popular among men than women. That meant that women were more likely than men to vote for both Labour and the Conservatives. So if women had been unable to vote, it's quite likely that UKIP would have won more than the single seat they did. Nigel Farage might have become an MP. Douglas Carswell (left) and Nigel Farage campaigning in 2014 In 2017 the pattern changed again. The British Election Study and other post-election surveys suggest that the gender gap was the opposite of what it used to be. Women were more likely than men to vote Labour and less likely to vote Conservative. That is likely to have swayed the overall result. The Conservatives were only eight seats short of an outright majority and there was an unusually large number of seats where they lost very narrowly. So if women had not voted, Theresa May would probably have had more Conservative MPs and British politics could look very different. Again, Dr Shorrocks says this could be down to the perceived impact of government policies. ""In 2015 and 2017, it is especially younger women - under the age of 40 - who were particularly supportive of Labour. ""This is likely to be due to the disproportionate impact of austerity on women, with younger women the most likely to say that their cost of living has gone up and quality of services such as the NHS has gone down under the Conservative government.""

The women against female suffrage,"A century ago, after years of campaigning, women over the age of 30 who owned property were given the right to vote in the UK. But for many thousands of women, it was not a moment of celebration. Known as the anti-suffrage movement, these women had been working to oppose the suffragettes. They believed women didn't have the capacity to understand politics, and portrayed the suffragettes as a group of ""ugly"" women and ""spinsters"". The Anti-Suffrage League was founded in 1908 by Mary Humphrey Ward, with support from two men: Lord Curzon and William Cremer. Suffragettes v suffragists: Who won women the vote? Reality Check: What if women couldn't vote? How the Suffragettes woke us up A year later, it was announced that more than 250,000 people, both men and women, had signed a petition against giving women the vote. Writing in The Queen in 1908,external, one ""opponent"", as they were described in the article, said they saw the campaign for the vote as a ""prelude to a social revolution"" that would set society back. ""We believe in the division of functions as the keystone of civilisation,"" the piece continued. ""It is as if the animals on the farm should insist on changing places - the cows insist upon drawing the coach, while the horses strive in vain to chew the cud and ruminate."" Historian Kathy Atherton says people nowadays can find it ""surprising"" that women were involved in an anti-suffrage movement, but that it's important to ""put yourself in their shoes"". ""There would have been a general acceptance that women were intellectually inferior and emotional - and women would have believed that as well as men - so they didn't have the capacity to make political judgements,"" she says. ""It's a really hierarchical society and the white male is at the top of the heap. ""There's a fear that you're upsetting the natural order of things, even going so far as thinking the colonies would be affected if they felt that Britain was being ruled by women."" ""One of the arguments that some of these anti-suffrage campaigners put forward was that if we give British women the vote - and they would very specifically use the example of India - Indian men and women won't like it,"" says Dr Sumita Mukherjee from the University of Bristol. At the time, India was ruled by the British Empire so power was exerted by the government in London and, by default, those who voted for them in the first place. ""They [the anti-suffrage movement] used this assumption that colonial subjects were very patriarchal themselves and they wouldn't like it if women had the vote in Britain,"" says Dr Mukherjee. ""The counter-argument was that there had been a female queen, Queen Victoria. She'd been Empress of the British Empire and most subjects hadn't kicked up a fuss about having an empress so why would they kick up a fuss about British women having a vote?"" There were also arguments much closer to home. Historical author Elizabeth Crawford says there was a genuine concern at the time that giving women the vote would ""destroy families"". ""They thought it would cause dissension in the home if a man wanted to vote conservative and his wife liberal,"" she says. The writer in The Queen magazine said the suffragettes were ""irresponsible"" in forcing the vote on wives and mothers. ""It is a vast upheaval of social institutions and habits, which must cut into the peace and well-being of families and harm the education of children,"" the article claimed. A leaflet from 1909,externalheld in The Woman's Library puts forward an argument that women have ""neither capacity nor leisure"" to vote. ""Women are more easily swayed by sentiment, less open to reason, less logical, keener in intuition, more sensitive than men,"" the writer claims. ""The qualities in which their minds excel are those least required in politics; their strong points are wasted or harmful there."" Both sides of the campaign produced artwork and slogans to promote their points of view. ""They [the anti-suffrage images] are portraying the suffragettes as being absolute harridans, slovenly housewives, appalling mothers, that they were ugly, that they looked like men, that they were lesbians,"" says Ms Atherton. ""It's very much like the Twitter campaigns that you get at the moment, whenever a high-profile woman says something of a feminist nature."" The Suffragists â were first to organise, forming local societies in the 1860s The Suffragettes â were active for just 10 years after splitting from the Suffragists in 1903 Suffragists â focused on middle-class women Suffragettes â encouraged working-class women to protest Suffragists â held public speaking events, lobbied MPs and wrote petitions Suffragettes â disrupted meetings, vandalised art and buildings and were often arrested Suffragists â dinner parties! Suffragettes â hunger strikes! Everyone organised marches! Suffragists â successfully built support in parliament over many years Suffragettes â increased publicity and re-energised the cause but also sparked a backlash Then in World War One, women took new roles in factories and beyond... ...which made denying them voting rights harder than ever After 50 years of women standing up and speaking out... Parliament finally passed a law giving some women the vote in 1918 Click next arrow to proceed Loading ... Swipe to progress  Prof June Purvis of the University of Portsmouth has collected many postcards printed with anti-suffrage messages and imagery. ""I was quite fascinated by these postcards because not many people have done research on them, and I thought they were telling a message of how difficult it was for women at that time to be taken seriously,"" she says. A number of the examples in her collection still have original writing on the back, many of which don't explicitly refer to the image on the front. ""In the early 20th century postcards were big business,"" says Prof Purvis. ""I think the people who bought them were sending a normal message [for example arranging to meet up], like how we now use email."" For Prof Purvis, one of the stand-out postcards shows a group of women, supposedly in the House of Commons, showing what a future with women in Parliament would be like. In the image, one woman is staring into a hand mirror, while another reads a book in the corner and yet another has brought her baby with her. ""That postcard really portrays the cultural fear at the time, that if women got the vote, they may then ask to be allowed to stand for Parliament and this is going to upset the whole gender order."" In November 1918 women were granted the right to stand for election for the first time.

"E-cigarettes 'should be on prescription'A review into e-cigarettes found they were far safer than smoking, Public Health England says.10h10 hours agoHealthComments","E-cigarettes should be available on prescription, according to Public Health England (PHE). The agency wants them to be prescribed on the NHS within the next few years because of how successful they have been in helping people give up smoking. An independent review of the latest evidence, published by PHE, suggests at least 20,000 people a year are quitting with the help of e-cigarettes. The report also says they are at least 95% less harmful than smoking. PHE also wants hospitals to be able to sell e-cigarettes and have areas where patients can vape. This could even be in private rooms for patients on long hospital stays, it says. PHE also encouraged employers to provide vaping areas. In Wales, the Welsh Government had tried to ban the use of e-cigarettes in some enclosed places, including schools, hospitals and places selling food, fearing vaping would ""re-normalise smoking"". But thelegislation failedat the last hurdle in 2016 after a row between Labour and Plaid. The review found vaping was of ""negligible risk to bystanders"" No e-cigarettes are currently licensed in the UK as a quit-smoking aid. And PHE is calling for ""an easier route"" for manufacturers to get a medicinal licence. ""Anything that the [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] MHRA can do to make it easier for manufacturers we think would be helpful,"" said PHE health improvement director John Newton. The evidence review, which was carried out by independent tobacco experts, also found confusion over the risk posed by e-cigarettes. But Mr Newton said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" they were far safer than smoking and ""of negligible risk to bystanders"". ""Almost half of smokers have never tried an e-cigarette possibly because they have views about how risky they are which are not founded on the evidence. ""We really want to get the message out that they really should consider using an e-cigarette because they're a lot better for them than continuing to smoke,"" he said. Ann McNeil, professor of tobacco addiction at King's College London and lead author of the report, said it was ""of great concern"" that smokers still had ""such a poor understanding"" about what caused the harm from smoking. ""When people smoke tobacco cigarettes, they inhale a lethal mix of 7,000 smoke constituents, 70 of which are known to cause cancer,"" she said. ""The constituents in tobacco smoke that cause the harm are either absent or at much lower levels... in e-cigarettes so we are confident that they are substantially less harmful than cigarette smoking. ""People smoke for the nicotine - but contrary to what the vast majority believe, nicotine causes little if any of the harm. ""The toxic smoke is the culprit and is the overwhelming cause of all the tobacco-related disease and death."" The review also found there was little evidence to suggest that e-cigarettes were leading young people into smoking. The research suggests less than 1% of young people who have never smoked use e-cigarettes regularly and the number of young people smoking continues to decline at an ""encouraging"" rate.

"Love Island women 'paid less' in new jobsOlivia Attwood says she has been offered ""substantially less"" pay than men for work since the show.9h9 hours agoEntertainment & Arts","This video can not be played Olivia Atwood speaks to MP Anna Soubry about her views on Parliament and being paid less since Love Island One of Love Island's female stars says she has been offered ""substantially"" less pay for the same jobs as the male contestants since leaving the ITV show. Olivia Attwood told the Victoria Derbyshire show this included jobs with her boyfriend Chris Hughes. The female contestants discovered the disparity after speaking to each other and ""doing some digging"". She said when her management approached the clients to ask why, they immediately matched the payments. Ms Attwood said there was ""a lot of panic"" when her management team of ""very strong women"" told the client the female stars knew they were being paid less. ""Straight away it was 'please don't tell anyone, we'll match the money'. So the money was always there,"" she said. 'Lady friendly' crisps mocked online Mass Greek protest at Macedonia name Korean men are starting a beauty revolution Speaking to Conservative MP Anna Soubry on the Victoria Derbyshire programme, the reality star said: ""We never got an answer [to], 'why did you feel that they should be paid more than us, for us all to come and do the exact same thing on the same day, the same outcome?'."" Olivia Attwood said she has also worked as a Formula 1 ""grid girl"" The 27-year-old said her boyfriend told her that when he worked with other men they were paid the same, irrespective of how well-known they were. ""They would never dream of insulting four men that way, but they'll tell the two girls and make up some ridiculous reason, but it was really because they thought they'd get away with it.

She said she knew that fans of the sport did not need to see half-naked girls to enjoy it. ""But by the same token, if a particular girl wants to do that and she finds that really fun and she gets to travel the world doing it, I think you can go so far and take the fun out of everything, can't you?"" She added that the models were always very well looked after by the Formula 1 teams, and ""no-one got within 5m [15ft] of us"" and that they were told to shout about it ""if anyone had crossed any boundaries"".

Ex-Carillion boss 'not asleep at wheel',"This video can not be played Former chairman of Carillion, Philip Green. Former Carillion chairman Philip Green has said he takes the blame for the collapse of the company last month. Mr Green was in the post when the construction giant, which provided services for schools, hospitals and prisons,went into liquidation. He said his responsibility was ""full and complete, total - no question in my mind about that. Not necessarily culpability but full responsibility"". The Work and Pensions Committee has been quizzing former directors. Carillion's collapse last month sent shockwaves through the building and construction sector, casting a shadow over a number of public sector projects. As the MPs were questioning the former directors,the Royal Liverpool Hospital announced its opening would be delayed due to Carillion's demise. Earlier in the hearing, the company's former finance director, Zafar Khan, denied being ""asleep at the wheel"" during his time in the role. Mr Khan was not working for the company when it collapsed, having been sacked last September, but he said: ""I believe I did everything that I could have done. ""As soon as I came into the role, we were looking to tackle the issues. The key focus of my time in the role was to bring net debt down. ""I was surprised at the outcome that eventually came to pass."" Work and Pensions Committee session in detail Carillion collapse delays new Â£335m Liverpool hospital UK puts up Â£100m to back Carillion contractor loans Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Regret, surprise and anger were the emotions on show as former Carillion executives faced a grilling from MPs about the company's collapse. All those questioned spoke of their surprise at the speed at which the company's financial position had deteriorated. That didn't stop them signing off on a dividend that the former finance chief, Zafar Khan, said should not have been paid. All agreed the level of debt meant the company was ill equipped to deal with these nasty surprises. The anger came from MPs including co-chair Rachel Reeves who launched an emotional attack on executives who had banked years of pay and bonuses while employees and pensioners face joblessness and reduced payouts. The auditors who passed the company fit just three months before a crippling profit warning will approach this committee with some trepidation. In a stormy committee session, Mr Khan said he ""spooked the board"" when he reviewed the company's contracts. But former Carillion chief executive Keith Cochrane told MPs that was not the reason for Mr Khan's dismissal. Mr Cochrane accepted that Mr Khan's findings were correct but told the committee: ""Our concern was whether he was fully on top of all the cashflow arrangements and close to what was actually happening."" He added that Mr Khan's dismissal happened at the same time as other senior management changes. This video can not be played Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane says his decisions were made in the best interests of the firm. Mr Cochrane, who only took charge last July, said he was ""truly sorry"" about the company's collapse. ""It was the worst possible outcome. This was a business worth fighting for. That's what I sought to do during my time as chief executive,"" he said. The previous chief executive Richard Howson ran the company for six years before stepping down after a profit warning.

Ex-Carillion boss sorry for collapse,"This video can not be played Former chairman of Carillion, Philip Green. Former Carillion chairman Philip Green has said he takes the blame for the collapse of the company last month. Mr Green was in the post when the construction giant, which provided services for schools, hospitals and prisons,went into liquidation. He said his responsibility was ""full and complete, total - no question in my mind about that. Not necessarily culpability but full responsibility"". The Work and Pensions Committee has been quizzing former directors. Carillion's collapse last month sent shockwaves through the building and construction sector, casting a shadow over a number of public sector projects. As the MPs were questioning the former directors,the Royal Liverpool Hospital announced its opening would be delayed due to Carillion's demise. Earlier in the hearing, the company's former finance director, Zafar Khan, denied being ""asleep at the wheel"" during his time in the role. Mr Khan was not working for the company when it collapsed, having been sacked last September, but he said: ""I believe I did everything that I could have done. ""As soon as I came into the role, we were looking to tackle the issues. The key focus of my time in the role was to bring net debt down.

Tesco fraud trial discontinued,"Former Tesco executives Chris Bush (left), John Scouler (centre) and Carl Rogberg (right) The trial of three former Tesco executives charged with fraud and false accounting has been abandoned. Chris Bush, Tesco's former UK boss, John Scouler, Tesco's former commercial food director and Carl Rogberg, its former UK finance boss have been on trial for more than four months. It emerged on Tuesday that Mr Rogberg had a heart attack last Thursday. The Serious Fraud Office will decide in early March whether to pursue a re-trial. The men deny the charges. Mr Rogberg, aged 51, remains in hospital awaiting surgery. His solicitor read out a statement on the steps of Southwark Crown Court: ""Mr Rogberg is devastated at the news that the trial has been aborted. ""He waived his right to attend these last stages after he had given evidence himself for many days, and had participated in the last four and half months of the trial. ""He was always very anxious that this jury should be allowed to reach its verdict and is desperately sorry that they were prevented from doing so."" Discharging the jury, Judge Deborah Taylor said: ""It wouldn't be right or proper to continue with this trial."" She acknowledged the impact on the jury: ""It has been a long period and I know it must be quite frustrating for you not to come to a conclusion at the end of all your hard work during the course of this trial."" Nicholas Purnell, QC, representing Mr Rogberg, had asked for the trial to continue while his client was having treatment. He told the court: ""I think he would be utterly devastated to discover that as a consequence of what he has been through, there's a possibility that the trial has to start again."" The three defendants had been accused of fraud and false accounting in connection with the retailer's Â£250m accounting scandal. The criminal charges stemmed from a statement the supermarket group made three-and-a-half years ago. On 29 August 2014,Tesco said it expected profits for the first half of its financial year,externalto be ""in the region of Â£1.1bn"". Some three weeks later, under the stewardship of new chief executive Dave Lewis, Tesco admitted that the figure had been overstated. In fact, it said that profits had beeninflated by an estimated Â£250m,external. Further investigations discovered that irregularities, which centred around its UK food business, were also found in Tesco's accounts for 2013-14. The figures had been flattered by early recognition of payments from suppliers who sell their goods in the supermarket's stores as well as delays in charging costs. Eventually, it was determined that Tesco had overstated its profits by Â£284m. The three men always denied the charges and argued in court that the SFO's investigation was flawed from the outset. Initially, the hope was that the case would finish before Christmas, but the trial has been beset by delays. The judge became ill during her summing up and there was a further pause of two weeks when a juror went on holiday. One member of the jury had already been discharged by then because of an operation. It's an outcome no one could've predicted - or would have wanted. It had already taken up more than a quarter of a year and had been beset by delays. There was the hope it would end before Christmas, then the judge became ill and it's been stop, start, stop ever since. Having already discharged one juror for health reasons, there was a further delay when a juror went on holiday. And then there's the cost. This has been a complex, multi-million pound, trial. The SFO, which brought the case, will now decide whether or not a retrial is appropriate. Meanwhile the defendants, who denied the charges, have almost another month to wait to find out what happens next.

E-cigarettes 'should be on prescription',"E-cigarettes should be available on prescription, according to Public Health England (PHE). The agency wants them to be prescribed on the NHS within the next few years because of how successful they have been in helping people give up smoking. An independent review of the latest evidence, published by PHE, suggests at least 20,000 people a year are quitting with the help of e-cigarettes. The report also says they are at least 95% less harmful than smoking. PHE also wants hospitals to be able to sell e-cigarettes and have areas where patients can vape. This could even be in private rooms for patients on long hospital stays, it says. PHE also encouraged employers to provide vaping areas. In Wales, the Welsh Government had tried to ban the use of e-cigarettes in some enclosed places, including schools, hospitals and places selling food, fearing vaping would ""re-normalise smoking"". But thelegislation failedat the last hurdle in 2016 after a row between Labour and Plaid. The review found vaping was of ""negligible risk to bystanders"" No e-cigarettes are currently licensed in the UK as a quit-smoking aid. And PHE is calling for ""an easier route"" for manufacturers to get a medicinal licence. ""Anything that the [Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency] MHRA can do to make it easier for manufacturers we think would be helpful,"" said PHE health improvement director John Newton. The evidence review, which was carried out by independent tobacco experts, also found confusion over the risk posed by e-cigarettes. But Mr Newton said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" they were far safer than smoking and ""of negligible risk to bystanders"". ""Almost half of smokers have never tried an e-cigarette possibly because they have views about how risky they are which are not founded on the evidence. ""We really want to get the message out that they really should consider using an e-cigarette because they're a lot better for them than continuing to smoke,"" he said. Ann McNeil, professor of tobacco addiction at King's College London and lead author of the report, said it was ""of great concern"" that smokers still had ""such a poor understanding"" about what caused the harm from smoking. ""When people smoke tobacco cigarettes, they inhale a lethal mix of 7,000 smoke constituents, 70 of which are known to cause cancer,"" she said. ""The constituents in tobacco smoke that cause the harm are either absent or at much lower levels... in e-cigarettes so we are confident that they are substantially less harmful than cigarette smoking. ""People smoke for the nicotine - but contrary to what the vast majority believe, nicotine causes little if any of the harm. ""The toxic smoke is the culprit and is the overwhelming cause of all the tobacco-related disease and death."" The review also found there was little evidence to suggest that e-cigarettes were leading young people into smoking. The research suggests less than 1% of young people who have never smoked use e-cigarettes regularly and the number of young people smoking continues to decline at an ""encouraging"" rate.

Hyde Park bombing case granted legal aidThe families of those killed in the 1982 IRA attack are launching a civil case against suspect John Downey.,"John Downey denied murdering the soldiers in the 1982 Hyde Park bombing The families of four soldiers killed in the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombings have been granted legal aid to take a civil case against one of the alleged bombers. John Downey, 66, has denied murdering the soldiers. A 2014 prosecution against him was dropped whena judge ruled an official assurance given in errormeant he could not face trial. He had an""on the run"" letter telling him he was no longer a wanted man. Four soldiers and seven horses were killed in the Hyde Park attack The letter, which he had received in 2007, assured him he would not face arrest and prosecution for IRA crimes. The then prime minister, David Cameron, described the letter as a ""dreadful mistake"". The Hyde Park attack on 20 July 1982 killed Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. On Tuesday,The Sun reported that the Legal Aid Agency had confirmed that it was providing funding to the families of the victims.,external At that time of John Downey's 2014 prosecution, Mr Justice Sweeney heard from Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly that 187 people had received ""on the run"" letters. These people were either suspected of paramilitary crimes or had escaped from prison after being convicted. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement meant that anyone convicted of paramilitary crimes was eligible for early release, but the agreement did not cover on the runs. Sinn FÃ©in sought a scheme that would allow on the runs to return to the UK without fear that they would be arrested. This scheme was agreed with the UK government but not disclosed to the public. Read more about on the runs here. Former Ulster Unionist MP, Danny Kinahan, welcomed news of the legal aid. Mr Kinahan, who was a former colleague of the murdered soldiers, said it should have happened ""a lot sooner"". Former MP, Danny Kinahan, said the soldiers were in the ""prime of their lives"" ""The families of my murdered colleagues have been put through hell,"" he said. ""Firstly, they lost their loved ones, stolen from them in the prime of their lives. ""Then, they suffered the pain of the farce of the trial of John Downey being thrown out because of one of the despicable on-the-run letters."" Civil action is taken to seek financial compensation, rather than a criminal conviction, and it requires a much lower standard of proof than a criminal case. A civil court is also less stringent in terms of what can be entered as evidence. The families involved in this case will hope their legal team will be able to use that extra latitude to put as much information as possible about the Hyde Park attack into the public domain. But even if a judge was to rule that John Downey was liable for the Hyde Park bombing, he could not be sent to prison. Mr Downey also cannot be compelled to attend any future civil court hearing, or to pay damages if any were to be awarded. Relatives of 12 of the 29 people killed in the 1998 Omagh bomb attack successfully took a civil case against four men they claimed were responsible. A judge ruled that the men were liable for the bomb and ordered them to pay Â£1.6m in damages. None of them were sent to prison and the families have not received any compensation. The Hyde Park attack is one of the most significant unsolved IRA bombings of The Troubles. One other person was convicted in relation to the deaths before being later cleared on appeal.

Rush hour drivers 'lose 31 hours a year',"Congestion in rush hour takes up about a 10th of the journey time for many drivers. Drivers in UK cities spent more than a day each year stuck in rush hour traffic, new research has shown. Motorists in London lost an average of 74 hours - more than three days - in 2017, an hour more than in 2016. Manchester was next with an average of 39 hours, followed by Lincoln and Birmingham, according to data from Inrix. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it was investing Â£23bn in road schemes which would reduce congestion. Researchers also found the overall cost per driver, including wasted fuel and working time, was Â£1,168. Their figures classed rush hour as between 06:00 and 09:00 and 16:00 to 19:00 on weekdays. In Scotland, Aberdeen and Edinburgh drivers lost 28 hours a year to peak time traffic and in Wales, the most congested city wasNewport, where motorists spent 24 hours a year in jams. In Northern Ireland, drivers in Belfast lost an average of 21 hours in 2017 because of congestion. Graham Cookson, chief economist for Inrix, said: ""Combined with the rising price of motoring, the cost of congestion is astonishing - it takes billions out of the economy and impacts businesses and individuals alike."" How far can you get in rush hour? Five handy winter driving tips Potholes send breakdown figures flying Drivers in London travel at an average of less than 13mph during peak times, he said. It was ranked seventh out of 1,360 global cities covered by the study for congestion. Los Angeles in the USA came top with 102 hours a year lost by the average peak time driver. Thailand had the worst congestion out of 38 countries covered by the study, with an average 56 hours a year lost to congestion at peak times. Chiswick Roundabout is part of the UK's most congested route The most congested routes in the UK at peak times and the annual hours lost per driver were: Chiswick Roundabout to A40 Hanger Lane, London: 56 hours A23 Kennington Park to Norbury Station, London: 50 hours A4200/A4 Russell Square to New Fetter Lane, London: 47 hours A34 Robin Hood Lane to A41 Soho Hill, Birmingham: 44 hours Kensington High Street along Earl's Court Road to A308, near Chelsea and Westminster Hospital: 42 hours Finchley Road to Colney Hatch Lane, London: 42 hours A4540 Five Ways to A41 Soho Hill, Birmingham: 42 hours A658 Harrogate Road to Victoria Street, Leeds: 40 hours B6117 to A644  Huddersfield Road, near Dewsbury: 36 hours A56 to Northumberland Street, Manchester: 33 hours The Lincoln Eastern Bypass is intended to cut congestion With less than a tenth of the population of Birmingham, Lincoln is a surprising entry in the 10 most congested large towns and cities in the UK. Drivers lose an average 36 hours, a day and a half, each of their lives sitting in traffic at peak time. Sarah Westney, from Lincoln-based PC Coaches, said: ""It only takes one car to break down on Pelham Bridge to slow everyone down. ""It's not a big city so when there are roadworks or accidents there aren't a lot of alternatives routes."" Inrix said the cost of delays in Lincoln worked out at about Â£1,790 per driver in terms of fuel, working time and other economic losses. The Lincoln Eastern Bypass, costing Â£92m, is intended to cut congestion while Lincolnshire County Council has been givenÂ£5.4 million from the Department for Transport to tackle congestion,externalfor other projects. On top of its Â£23bn investment in road schemes, the DfT said it was giving councils ""record amounts of capital funding"" of more than Â£7.1bn up to 2021. This would ""help to upgrade and maintain local roads up and down the country"", a spokeswoman said.

Hyde Park bombing case granted legal aid,"John Downey denied murdering the soldiers in the 1982 Hyde Park bombing The families of four soldiers killed in the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombings have been granted legal aid to take a civil case against one of the alleged bombers. John Downey, 66, has denied murdering the soldiers. A 2014 prosecution against him was dropped whena judge ruled an official assurance given in errormeant he could not face trial. He had an""on the run"" letter telling him he was no longer a wanted man. Four soldiers and seven horses were killed in the Hyde Park attack The letter, which he had received in 2007, assured him he would not face arrest and prosecution for IRA crimes. The then prime minister, David Cameron, described the letter as a ""dreadful mistake"". The Hyde Park attack on 20 July 1982 killed Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. On Tuesday,The Sun reported that the Legal Aid Agency had confirmed that it was providing funding to the families of the victims.,external At that time of John Downey's 2014 prosecution, Mr Justice Sweeney heard from Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly that 187 people had received ""on the run"" letters. These people were either suspected of paramilitary crimes or had escaped from prison after being convicted. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement meant that anyone convicted of paramilitary crimes was eligible for early release, but the agreement did not cover on the runs. Sinn FÃ©in sought a scheme that would allow on the runs to return to the UK without fear that they would be arrested. This scheme was agreed with the UK government but not disclosed to the public. Read more about on the runs here. Former Ulster Unionist MP, Danny Kinahan, welcomed news of the legal aid. Mr Kinahan, who was a former colleague of the murdered soldiers, said it should have happened ""a lot sooner"". Former MP, Danny Kinahan, said the soldiers were in the ""prime of their lives"" ""The families of my murdered colleagues have been put through hell,"" he said. ""Firstly, they lost their loved ones, stolen from them in the prime of their lives. ""Then, they suffered the pain of the farce of the trial of John Downey being thrown out because of one of the despicable on-the-run letters."" Civil action is taken to seek financial compensation, rather than a criminal conviction, and it requires a much lower standard of proof than a criminal case. A civil court is also less stringent in terms of what can be entered as evidence. The families involved in this case will hope their legal team will be able to use that extra latitude to put as much information as possible about the Hyde Park attack into the public domain. But even if a judge was to rule that John Downey was liable for the Hyde Park bombing, he could not be sent to prison. Mr Downey also cannot be compelled to attend any future civil court hearing, or to pay damages if any were to be awarded. Relatives of 12 of the 29 people killed in the 1998 Omagh bomb attack successfully took a civil case against four men they claimed were responsible. A judge ruled that the men were liable for the bomb and ordered them to pay Â£1.6m in damages. None of them were sent to prison and the families have not received any compensation. The Hyde Park attack is one of the most significant unsolved IRA bombings of The Troubles. One other person was convicted in relation to the deaths before being later cleared on appeal.

Maldives ex-president calls for help,"This video can not be played Trouble in paradise: Maldives crisis explained The exiled ex-president of the Maldives has called for other countries to intervene in a political crisis engulfing the island nation. Mohamed Nasheed asked India to help release prisoners and the US to curb leaders' financial transactions. Turmoil began when current President Abdulla Yameen refused to release political dissidents, defying a court order and sparking protests. On Tuesday night, the Supreme Court revoked its move to free the prisoners. Two of its top judges had already been arrested. The remaining three have now issued a statement, saying the order was being rescinded ""in light of the concerns raised by the president"", according to AFP news agency. The government has declared a state of emergency, while the opposition has called the arrest of the two judges a ""purge"". Political turmoil threatens 'island paradise' Maldives leaves Commonwealth over democracy row Former Maldives leader 'given UK asylum' There has also been international condemnation of the government's moves, with the US expressing concern. President Yameen gave a televised address to the country on Tuesday, saying judges had been plotting a coup. ""I had to declare a national emergency because there was no other way to investigate these judges,"" he said. The Indian Ocean island nation is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 islands, and tourism is a vital part of its economy. By Olivia Lang, BBC News Under President Yameen, China has increased its influence in the Maldives as part of its ""string of pearls"" strategy in the Indian Ocean. India - which has traditionally viewed itself as the island nation's ""big brother"" - is not happy. Delhi is now very much aligned with former President Mohamed Nasheed, who is in exile in Sri Lanka. Mr Nasheed told me he wanted an Indian official ""with enough clout"" to go to the Maldives, ""backed by the military"". But he refused to be drawn on what exactly this meant. While India is unlikely to take military action, it would not look unfavourably at any move to dislodge Mr Yameen from power. Mr Nasheed called on India to put pressure on the Maldives government to release opposition detainees. He also asked the US to restrict Maldivian leaders' transactions through US banks.

Mr Nasheed was an opposition leader under a former government and became the country's first democratically elected leader in 2008, but was ousted and jailed in 2012. A Maldivian minister to the UN, Jeffrey Salim Waheed, called his intervention ""treason"" and ""the single biggest attempt to undermine the Maldives' sovereignty"". Last week, the Supreme Court ordered the release of a group of opposition politicians. It also ruled that Mr Nasheed's trial, held in 2015, had been unconstitutional. The country's police commissioner said he would enforce the court's ruling and, in response, the government of President Yameen sacked him. The army has now been ordered to resist any attempt to impeach or remove President Yameen. Police arrested Chief Justice Abdulla Saeed and another judge, Ali Hameed, hours after the government declared a state of emergency.

Timing of attack coincided with State of Emergency declaration in #Maldives. We are currently unable to report on our website."" As of 6 February the website appears to be unavailable. The outlet said on Twitter that its website is ""still under attack"" but added that they would ""continue live tweeting"".

""While there is much to celebrate, I worry that our public debate today is coarsening,"" Mrs May said. ""That for some it is becoming harder to disagree, without also demeaning opposing viewpoints in the process."" The PM warned ""bitterness and aggression"" online threatens democracy and deters many people from engaging in politics. The Suffragists â were first to organise, forming local societies in the 1860s The Suffragettes â were active for just 10 years after splitting from the Suffragists in 1903 Suffragists â focused on middle-class women Suffragettes â encouraged working-class women to protest Suffragists â held public speaking events, lobbied MPs and wrote petitions Suffragettes â disrupted meetings, vandalised art and buildings and were often arrested Suffragists â dinner parties! Suffragettes â hunger strikes! Everyone organised marches!

She also promised an internet safety report will be published every year to assess how social media companies are dealing with abuse posted online. Reality Check: What if women couldn't vote? How the Suffragettes woke us up The women against female suffrage Meanwhile, a cross-party group of Green, Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians called on the home secretary to make misogyny a hate crime. In July 2016,Nottinghamshire Police became the first force in the UK to record harassment of women as a hate crimein a bid to tackle sexist abuse, but the scheme has not been rolled out further. Other ways in which the anniversary is being marked include: A public exhibition of life-sized images of the central figures of the suffrage movement in London's Trafalgar Square Portraits of these people will also be in an exhibition at London's City Hall A reception for female MPs past and present in Parliament, hosted by Mrs May The Parliamentary Archives will display the 1918 Representation of the People Act itself for the first time BBC Radio 4's Today Programme used only women contributors and an all-female presenter line-up on its show Records compiled by the England, Suffragettes Arrested, 1906-1914 collection indicate there were more than 1,300 suffragette arrests and many women were jailed. Hate mail and firebombs: How women won the vote What female MPs wore to mark the occasion Suffragette tributes shared online Emmeline Pankhurst, a founder member of the Woman's Social and Political Union, and leading suffragettes Emily Davison and Flora Drummond were among them. Ms Davison was found guilty of placing a ""dangerous substance likely to injure"" in a post office letter box outside Parliament and sentenced to six months in Holloway Prison. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, attended the opening of an exhibition celebrating the centenary in Trafalgar Square By Francesca Gillett, BBC News Women and men of all ages gathered outside the pop-up exhibition in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday morning. In freezing temperatures, the passers-by stopped to look at the cardboard cut-outs of 59 campaigners involved in the women's suffrage movement, many of whom are unknown faces. ""We forget these women,"" said charity worker Lucy Rae, who came to see the exhibition with a colleague. ""I do think it's quite poignant. You almost want to stand in with them to be part of it and to be one of these women."" University professor Hazel Barrett, whose grandmother supported the suffragette movement, said people of all classes got involved, adding: ""Just look at them, ordinary women"". Sheree Davey, who came with her young son to see the display, said: ""It's incredible. It inspires you to learn a bit more. ""You know the basics but there's so much more to it."" Victoria Taylor, a tourist visiting from Australia, said: ""It's a great way to engage people. It's not confronting but it's very prominent."" The Scottish Tory leader said she supported calls for posthumous pardons for the convicted women as they were simply ""righting the wrong"" of of an unjust law. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,,externalRuth Davidson said: ""Voting was a value judgement, not an intrinsic right."" Ms Rudd, who is also minister for women and equalities, said she would consider the issue. However,she told Radio 4's Today Programme:""I must be frank, it is complicated because if you're going to give a legal pardon for things like arson and violence it's not as straightforward as people think it might be."" Eight things that were bigger killers in the 70s Spain cracks king's 500-year-old code Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack Krista Cowman, professor of history at the University of Lincoln, said many suffragettes would ""be spinning in their graves"" about the idea of being pardoned. She told Radio 5live: ""It was a badge of honour and they were proud of it.""

The PM said getting the vote was ""the first step"" for women to be involved ""properly in public life"". ""It was the point at which women were able to start to feel that they could bring their experience, their views, their opinions, into the world of public life,"" she added. Later in the day, Mrs May joined female MPs past and present at a reception in Westminster Hall.

However, overall demand for the full year fell by 7% to 4,071.7t, compared with 2016. Alistair Hewitt, Head of Market Intelligence at the World Gold Council, said: âItâs not surprising to see overall gold demand down given the backdrop of monetary policy tightening and strong equity markets in 2017, but the market is not in bad shape."" He said that jewellery demand picked up as economic conditions improved in China and a policy change in India removed a barrier to demand, while next-generation smartphones ""boosted gold demand from technology companies.â Walt Disney, which is buying

Read more Profits at Toyota are picking up steam. The Japanese carmaker has raised its annual profit guidance by 10% to 2.2 trillion yen ($20.23bn), thanks to a weaker yen and strong sales at home. That's up from the 2 trillion yen previously forecast. The upbeat outlook came as Toyota said sales in Japan and Europe rose in the nine months to December. But sales in North America - its biggest market - took at hit. Operating profit there plunged more than 50% as increasing marketing costs and tough competition knocked earnings.

The Dow Jones is now up by 1.6%, but is it finally out of the doldrums? The S&P 500 and Nasdaq are up too, by 1% and 1.6% respectively. European Union regulators are to examine Apple's plan to buy the song recognition app, Shazam, to see whether it would hamper competition. Shazam - a British company - allows people to use their smartphone or computer to identify music through a snippet of sound, as well as providing the option to buy it. Apple had reportedly offered four-hundred-million pounds for the app, which it said would be a natural fit with with its music streaming device. Seven European countries urged the competition regulator to investigate the bid. US stocks continue to oscillate wildly following a global sell-off that has wiped trillions of dollars off share markets. Currently Wall Street is climbing again, with the Dow Jones up 0.6% or 145.94 points at 24,491.69. The S&P 500 is 0.2% higher at 2,654.16 points and the Nasdaq has gained 0.7% to 7,018.10. Richard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, notes that the recent falls in the FTSE 100 mean that over the past 12 months the index is flat, while it's about 6% lower in the year to date. However, he suggests there are reasons to be optimistic. ""Corporate earnings continue to justify [stock] valuations, the general synchronised economic recovery is still in tact, and even an aggressive increase in the interest rate across the pond would still likely leave [US rates] at relative historic lows. ""Providing that the current situation of letting some air out of the tyres does not result in a puncture, this reset could be seen as a justified reaction to recent exuberance."" US regulators may need enhanced powers to oversee crypto-currencies, the head of the US Securities and Exchange Commission has said. Jay Clayton told the Senate Banking Committee that his agency was coordinating with the Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve and together they could call on Congress to pass legislation strengthening their remits. âWe may be back with our friends from Treasury and the Fed to ask for additional legislation,â Mr Clayton said. It comes amid fears about the fluctuating value of crypto-currencies and a series of damaging hacks into exchanges. China has said it wants to be compensated for US tariffs imposed on imported solar panels and washing machines, according to World Trade Organization filings. China said it was asserting its rights as a major exporter and called on the US to hold talks. It also said it believed the US measures broke numerous WTO rules. The White House approved the tariffs last month in a bid to protect US manufacturers from foreign competition. China, Taiwan and South Korea have reacted angrily to the move and all three have called for compensation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Armed forces 'paralysis due to Brexit'Delays over planned military reductions created uncertainty and risked reputation, says think tank.3h3 hours agoUK","A government preoccupation with Brexit has led to ""policy paralysis"" over the armed forces, a think tank is warning. The Royal United Services Institute said delays over implementing planned military reductions, including the axing of some warships, aircraft and regiments, had created uncertainty. Rusi said the UK was risking its reputation as an international partner. The Ministry of Defence says its review, to be concluded by the summer, will strengthen the armed forces. Rusi's warning comes as the Ministry of Defence faces a budget shortfall of up to Â£20bn over the next 10 years. Reality Check: What's happening to defence spending? Marine cuts would 'undermine UK security' UK could lose 'fight on beaches' ships A defence review was due to be published early this year which could have led to significant cuts in the armed forces. BBC Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beale said the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, has managed to buy the MoD more time as he tries to persuade the Treasury to give his department more money. ButRusi's report,externalsays any further delay in making those decisions risks damaging Britain's standing with key allies. It argues that by extending the defence review and with themedia focus on possible cuts to ""totemic"" units like the Marinesthere is now a greater danger to the UK's ""credibility as a serious security actor"". The think-tank says the government has a ""positive story to tell"" with defence spending due to be 5% higher in real terms in 2020-21 compared to 2015-16. But Rusi said the MoD promised more than it could realistically afford and this year's review is having to address this. It added:  ""The government is increasingly perceived to be unable to make difficult decisions, distracted by Brexit and unable to play an international role that is commensurate with the resources it devotes to this purpose. ""The longer this policy paralysis continues, the greater the risk to the UK's reputation as a reliable ally, and the stronger the (unfair) perception that it is no longer capable of being a serious security player. ""With talks on the EU's future relationship with the UK approaching a critical moment, this is not a helpful message.""

UK must tackle 'astonishing' congestion,"UK drivers wasted an average of 31 hours in rush-hour traffic last year, costing each motorist Â£1,168, a study by traffic data firm Inrix suggests. The UK is the world's 10th most congested country and London is Europe's second most gridlocked city after Moscow. Manchester, Birmingham, Luton and Edinburgh completed the UK's top five major areas affected. The government said a record Â£23bn was being invested in road schemes. The study - which took into account direct costs such as wasted fuel and time, as well as indirect consequences, such as higher prices for household goods due to increased freight fees -  found London drivers spent an average of 74 hours in gridlock last year, at a cost of Â£2,430. The worst stretch of road was the A406 outer London ring road from Chiswick roundabout to Hanger Lane during the evening rush hour. UK's worst motorway disruption revealed Car ownership up as bus use falls Inrix chief economist Dr Graham Cookson called for innovative approaches to deal with the ""astonishing"" cost of congestion that took ""billions out of the economy"". He said flexible working hours and road charges ""have potential"", but said transport authorities should be looking at data analytics and artificial intelligence that ""promise to reinvent our approach to traffic management"". Inrix ranked most congested areas using the financial cost of congestion, as well as hours wasted. But a top 10 list of hours wasted in congestion includes towns like Braintree in Essex, and Bath in Somerset. In England,drivers in Lincoln lost an average of 36 hours to the rush hour commute, the same as drivers in Birmingham. It is hoped that a new Â£92m bypass will help cut congestion in the cathedral city. Seven UK locations suffered double-digit rises in the number of hours lost to queues, including Wrexham (up 17%) Mansfield (up 15%) and Bath (up 12%). In Wales,Newport ranked as the most congested city in the country, with drivers losing an average of 24 hours a year in traffic jams. Drivers in Cardiff are thought to lose an average of Â£1,119 in lost time and fuel. Despite the scale of the congestion problem, three of Scotland's big cities saw major improvements in traffic flow following heavy investment in road infrastructure. The completion of road projects on the M8, M73 and M74 in central Scotland helped ease congestion by 20% in Aberdeen, 15% in Glasgow and 10% in Edinburgh. ""Journeys have got better because of the combination of new roads and the end of roadworks,"" Dr Cookson added. The Department for Transport said that alongside its national road investment, councils were to receive more than Â£7.1bn in funding by 2021. A spokeswoman said this ""record amount"" of funding would ""help to upgrade and maintain local roads up and down the country"". ""Alongside this, we've announced plans for a new major road network that will give councils access to a multi-billion pound fund to improve or replace the most important A-roads in their area,"" she added. 2017 traffic jams 'cost drivers Â£280m' New diesel and petrol cars face 2040 ban UK's worst traffic jams revealed Firefighters running out of water as wildfire declared most destructive in LA's history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Ahmed: Will market fall turn into rout?,"To the great synchronisation - stronger global growth returning to all the major economic engines of the world - add the great normalisation. The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing. Monetary policy is starting its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks. Now, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money. Fingers are hovering over the ""sell"" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to ""chase the dip"". Central banks led by the Federal Reserve have been gently tightening - withdrawing stimulus - as concerns grow that inflation is returning. It is the first time there has been such a synchronisation in major central bank policy since the financial crisis. When the Federal Reserve spoke of ""tapering"" in 2014, the Bank of Japan was in full monetary easing mode. When the Fed raised interest rates in December 2015, the European Central Bank cut them further into negative territory. Now the Fed is signalling further interest rate rises. The ECB's quantitative easing programme - the purchasing of bonds - is being reduced. And the Bank of Japan has also slowed its purchasing of long dated bonds. The next move by the Bank of England on interest rates is likely to be up. Make no mistake - we still have monetary policy broadly set for recession despite global economic growth being at its most positive since the financial crisis. Globally, the economic fundamentals are strong and the market falls we have seen come after a record long run of equity highs. But be prepared for more volatility ahead as markets catch up with the fact that the era of endless central bank support is coming, slowly but surely, to an end.

Why are Asian markets tumbling?,"Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was down as much as 5% in mid morning trade Asian investors typically take their cue from what share prices do in America, as many Asian countries still depend on the US economy for growth. But analysts saythe sharp falls, while dramatic in themselves, should be seen in perspective. Economic fundamentals in the US, and in many Asian countries, are still stronger than they have been since the global financial crisis. It seems counter-intuitive, but as Dheeraj Bharwani, an independent wealth strategist said to me in the wake of the initial falls on Asian shares, ""it's actually positive economic news coming out of the US that has caused the Asian market falls"". The US economy is growing, and that means inflation expectations - how much things will cost in the future - are going up. And that means the US Federal Reserve may raise interest rates faster and at a steadier pace than they were expected to, in order to stabilise the economy. That's the job of central banks, to tweak and adjust interest rates to make sure the economy doesn't grow too fast, or too slow. (Think of the economy like the perfect bowl of Goldilocks porridge, and it might become a little clearer.) This is what's causing some investors in the US and Asia to pull their money out of the stock market. Because when the cost of borrowing rises, investors worry about the impact of that on the growth outlook of companies that might find it more expensive to build new factories or expand. So investors now have ""a choice about where to put their money"", says David Kuo of Motley Fool. ""With US interest rates rising this year, they don't have to invest it in shares to get a return."" Asian markets have also benefited from US interest rates being at record lows over the last decade because a lot of that money has come into Asian markets to look for better returns. But now with US interest rates expected to rise, traders say many Asian investors are feeling anxious that the US stock market rally may be winding down, and that could drag Asian stocks lower too.

Asian markets plunged on Tuesday as investors dumped stocks following the biggest US market fall for six years At one point Japan's Nikkei 225 index was down 7%, but recovered some of those losses to close 4.7% lower. London, Frankfurt and Paris all fell sharply when they opened on Tuesday with new losses of up to 3%. In the US overnight the Dow lost 4.6%. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow was up 25%, helped by a resurgent economy. Strong profits and low interest rates also underpinned the positive investment climate. This global sell-off began last week after a solid US jobs report fuelled expectations that the economy's strength was such the Federal Reserve would need to raise interest rates faster than expected. The softness of markets over the last few days is down to one thing. As monetary policy begins its long journey away from the trillions of pounds of stimulus pumped into the system to keep the economic ship from the rocks, shareholders are beginning to wonder how much of their investments are in companies with strong fundamentals. And how much is simply holding up an asset bubble - frothy prices led ever higher in an era of ultra low interest rates and cheap money. Fingers are hovering over the ""sell"" button. And once investors start looking at their portfolio and selling out of the froth, automatic algorithmic trading tends to ""chase the dip"". Read more from Kamal here: Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, told the BBC the falls did not appear to herald a serious change of sentiment: ""It is always a bit too early to tell, but I think these recent market falls are in the nature of a correction. ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added that bear markets tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence, said: ""This isn't a collapse of the economy. ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate."" One country whose immediate economic outlook remains stagnant is Japan. The authorities there said there was little chance of interest rates being increased. The Bank of Japan's governor, Haruhiko Kuroda, ruled out the possibility of raising interest rates in the near future. He said it was ""inappropriate"" to do so with inflation still about half its 2% target. But markets in Asia typically follow the lead from the US. Elsewhere in the region, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index closed down 1,649.8 points - or 5.12% - at 30,595.42 and South Korea's Kospi index gave up 2.6%. Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 lost 3.2%. Live: Global stock markets slump Asia markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why? The 2018 economy: What to watch On Monday the Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75. The decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US. The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%. The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". What has driven the Dow's surge? US jobs and wages rise in January The US economy in six charts Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said. ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" However, he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. Asian markets, on the other hand, have benefitted from record low US interest rates in the last decade because money has flowed into Asia in search of stronger returns. Analysts say the expected rate rises could impact Asia over the longer term. Ahmed: Will market fall turn into rout?

London shares hit lowest level since 2016,"This video can not be played Why are share prices falling? US stock markets have ended a day of massive fluctuations on a high note, rebounding  after recent steep losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed up 2.3%, while the Nasdaq hit 2.1% and the S&P 500 rose 1.7%. Stocks shuttled between positive and negative territory throughout the day, their activity spanning more than 1,000 points. On Monday, the Dow had plunged by nearly 1,200 points or 4.6%, triggering losses in Asia and Europe. ""I think what you're seeing today is, 'Hold on. This got overdone'. The fundamentals of the companies haven't changed since Friday,"" said JJ Kinahan, chief market strategist at online brokerage TD Ameritrade. Analysts have said for months that the financial markets were due a correction after a long period of rising prices. Investors are also fretting over the prospect of rising interest rates, which push up borrowing costs for companies and consumers. The steep sell-off began last week after data in the US showed stronger than expected wage growth. The report came amid other shifts, including new tax cuts, trade tensions, and a sinking dollar, that analysts say could lead inflation to rise faster than expected. The conditions pose a challenge for the Federal Reserve, which will need to raise interest rates to counter inflation, without moving so aggressively that it severely curbs economic activity. It is not clear how the changing economic currents, including tax cuts, will affect company financials ultimately, said Michael Bapis, managing director of The Bapis Group at Hightower, a wealth management firm in New York. ""You're seeing that volatility now because there's uncertainty,"" he said. Earlier on Tuesday,Japan's Nikkei 225closed down 4.7%. Markets in London, Frankfurt and Paris had initial losses of up to 3%, before recovering some ground. London's FTSE 100closed down almost 200 points or 2.6% at 7141.Frankfurt's DaxandParis's CACwere down 2.3% and 2.4% respectively. On Monday the FTSE 100 closed at its lowest level since April of last year. The falls follow some good years for investors. In 2017 the Dow in the US was up 25% and London's FTSE 100 rose 7.6%. Live: Global stock markets slump Asia markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why? The 2018 economy: What to watch Monday's decline was the largest in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US. US markets opened sharply lower again on Tuesday, but quickly rebounded amid frantic trade that continued throughout the day. Analysts have said the swings in the US markets in part reflect big investors moving to sell stocks and put money in other assets, such as bonds, which benefit from higher interest rates. Other companies that had strategies betting on calm markets also had to adjust. What has driven the Dow's surge? US jobs and wages rise in January The US economy in six charts Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said he did not think the declines were a sign of broader problems. ""There are no systemic issues,"" he told a congressional panel on Tuesday. ""I don't think these types of moves, given how much the market has rallied, have financial stability concerns."" Even if you don't own shares directly, the chances are that you will be paying into a pension which is invested in shares and bonds. More than nine million people in the UK have auto enrolment pensions, and 12 million are active members of defined contribution schemes. That means the value of the pension is dependent on the value of the investments in it. Similarly, anyone who owns shares or funds in an ISA or a SIPP will have seen the value of their savings fall. But experts point out that investments rise and fall over time, and over the longer term, it should make little difference. ""It is effectively no change for normal investors, in that you have ridden a wave on the way up, so now is not the time to cash in,"" said Rebecca O'Keefe, head of investment at Interactive Investor. ""This is unwelcome news, but it is fundamentally a not unexpected reaction to the euphoria that saw markets rise so fast."" If you are planning on retiring in the next couple of months, you will have a slightly smaller pension pot than you did at the start of the year. But coincidentally the FTSE 100 is at almost exactly the same place it was a year ago, so you won't have lost anything over that longer term. Furthermore if you have a while to go before you retire, the shares in your pension fund have just become cheaper to buy - so there is a greater chance of them increasing in value. But, as ever, future market trends are difficult to determine. ""Markets are capricious beasts in the short term, and, looking forward, stock prices could move in either direction without defying the laws of statistics,"" said Laith Khalaf, a senior analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. ""However, in the long term, markets are more reliable in generating growth, and so anyone saving for retirement should still consider the stock market as a friend, not a foe."" An A-Z Guide to Business Beasts Analysts say that in the short term, investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets, but doubt whether there will be a prolonged period of selling. Jane Sydenham, investment director at the stockbrokers Rathbones, said the recent moves were a ""correction"" rather than a crash. ""What we have to remember is stock markets have had a very smooth ride upwards and we've not had a fall of more than 3% for 15 months. There's been a real lack of volatility, which is very unusual."" She added thatbear markets- when shares go into a long period of decline - tend to happen ahead of a recession and at the moment growth forecasts were being upgraded. And analyst Laith Khalaf, of Hargreaves Lansdown, pointed out that, despite the heavy falls on Wall Street, the benchmark Dow Jones share index is still 20% up on where it stood this time last year.

PM hails 'heroic' suffragettes on centenary,"Students marking the anniversary by recreating a suffragette protest march Giving pardons to women who were jailed while fighting for the right to vote would be ""complicated"", Home Secretary Amber Rudd has said. But she said she would ""take a look"", 100 years on from some women getting the vote in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn said a Labour government would apologise to suffragettes and have criminal records overturned. Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, said the women had been pardoned by society. Equality campaign group the Fawcett Society and some relatives of the suffragettes are among those who called on the home secretary to overturn the convictions of women who were imprisoned while fighting for the vote. But Helen Pankhurst said the suffragettes would be urging women to ""continue the fight"" rather than ""dwell"" on their personal sacrifice. ""It was not them breaking the laws that were the problem, it was the laws that were constraining our democracy,"" she told BBC Radio 5live. Theresa May and female MPs past and present gathered at Westminster for a reception The Representation of the People Act,externalwas passed on 6 February 1918 and gave women aged over 30 and ""of property"" the right to vote. In a speech in Manchester to mark the centenary of women's votes, Theresa May hailed the ""heroism"" of the suffragettes. Meet the women fighting for females in 2018 Laura Kuenssberg: The journey towards 50-50 This video can not be played Theresa May on being a woman in politics She also used the speech to criticise online abuse and intimidation of political candidates and representatives - often women, gay people and members of ethnic minorities. ""While there is much to celebrate, I worry that our public debate today is coarsening,"" Mrs May said. ""That for some it is becoming harder to disagree, without also demeaning opposing viewpoints in the process."" The PM warned ""bitterness and aggression"" online threatens democracy and deters many people from engaging in politics.

She also promised an internet safety report will be published every year to assess how social media companies are dealing with abuse posted online. Reality Check: What if women couldn't vote? How the Suffragettes woke us up The women against female suffrage Meanwhile, a cross-party group of Green, Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians called on the home secretary to make misogyny a hate crime. In July 2016,Nottinghamshire Police became the first force in the UK to record harassment of women as a hate crimein a bid to tackle sexist abuse, but the scheme has not been rolled out further. Other ways in which the anniversary is being marked include: A public exhibition of life-sized images of the central figures of the suffrage movement in London's Trafalgar Square Portraits of these people will also be in an exhibition at London's City Hall A reception for female MPs past and present in Parliament, hosted by Mrs May The Parliamentary Archives will display the 1918 Representation of the People Act itself for the first time BBC Radio 4's Today Programme used only women contributors and an all-female presenter line-up on its show Records compiled by the England, Suffragettes Arrested, 1906-1914 collection indicate there were more than 1,300 suffragette arrests and many women were jailed. Hate mail and firebombs: How women won the vote What female MPs wore to mark the occasion Suffragette tributes shared online Emmeline Pankhurst, a founder member of the Woman's Social and Political Union, and leading suffragettes Emily Davison and Flora Drummond were among them. Ms Davison was found guilty of placing a ""dangerous substance likely to injure"" in a post office letter box outside Parliament and sentenced to six months in Holloway Prison. Sadiq Khan, the mayor of London, attended the opening of an exhibition celebrating the centenary in Trafalgar Square By Francesca Gillett, BBC News Women and men of all ages gathered outside the pop-up exhibition in Trafalgar Square on Tuesday morning. In freezing temperatures, the passers-by stopped to look at the cardboard cut-outs of 59 campaigners involved in the women's suffrage movement, many of whom are unknown faces. ""We forget these women,"" said charity worker Lucy Rae, who came to see the exhibition with a colleague. ""I do think it's quite poignant. You almost want to stand in with them to be part of it and to be one of these women."" University professor Hazel Barrett, whose grandmother supported the suffragette movement, said people of all classes got involved, adding: ""Just look at them, ordinary women"". Sheree Davey, who came with her young son to see the display, said: ""It's incredible. It inspires you to learn a bit more. ""You know the basics but there's so much more to it."" Victoria Taylor, a tourist visiting from Australia, said: ""It's a great way to engage people. It's not confronting but it's very prominent."" The Scottish Tory leader said she supported calls for posthumous pardons for the convicted women as they were simply ""righting the wrong"" of of an unjust law. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,,externalRuth Davidson said: ""Voting was a value judgement, not an intrinsic right."" Ms Rudd, who is also minister for women and equalities, said she would consider the issue. However,she told Radio 4's Today Programme:""I must be frank, it is complicated because if you're going to give a legal pardon for things like arson and violence it's not as straightforward as people think it might be."" Eight things that were bigger killers in the 70s Spain cracks king's 500-year-old code Uma Thurman breaks silence on Weinstein attack Krista Cowman, professor of history at the University of Lincoln, said many suffragettes would ""be spinning in their graves"" about the idea of being pardoned.

""It was the point at which women were able to start to feel that they could bring their experience, their views, their opinions, into the world of public life,"" she added. Later in the day, Mrs May joined female MPs past and present at a reception in Westminster Hall.

"Airlines get tough on 'support pets'Airlines are banning more animals, after rising requests to travel with emotional-support pets.6h6 hours agoFamily & Education","Cute but not to be cuddled on board. Hedgehogs are on an in-flight banned list. If you were planning to bring a hedgehog on to a flight as a form of emotional support, you might have to think again. Hedgehogs have been included on a banned list - as airlines get tougher over soaring demands from anxious passengers wanting to travel with ""emotional support animals"". United Airlines say requests have risen by 75% to 76,000 in a year. The airline recently had to turn down a request to travel with a peacock. But a spokeswoman for the airline says that even beforeturning away the peacock at Newark airportin the US, there had been recognition that the rules needed to be tightened. This was because of a ""significant increase in onboard incidents involving these animals"", she added. United said that last year there had been an increase of more than 30,000 passengers wanting to travel with emotional support pets. From next month, there will be tougher rules on animals carried by passengers to provide reassurance or as part of therapy - although this will not affect animals such as guide dogs for the blind. An emotional support peacock was turned away from Newark airport As well as 48 hours' notice and a letter from a mental health professional, passengers will now have to show proof that their animal has been ""trained to behave properly in a public setting"". United will also keep a list of banned animals, including hedgehogs, ferrets, insects, rodents, snakes, spiders, reptiles and ""non-household birds"" under review. From next month, Delta will also be stepping up efforts to ""protect"" its passengers, after an 84% increase in on-board animal ""incidents"". A statement from the airline says this is because of ""serious safety risks involving untrained animals in flight"". The airline says it will continue to carry about 250,000 guide dogs or other service animals each year. But Delta has faced requests to carry ""comfort turkeys"", possums and snakes. And it says staff have faced biting, growling and barking animals, as well as urination and defecation. Virgin Atlantic says that it only allows dogs to be carried as emotional support pets. British Airways, meanwhile, says that it has had no increase in requests - because it doesn't allow passengers to bring any emotional support animals on board.

Dow's sharpest drop since June 2016,"The Dow sank by nearly 1.4% on Tuesday The blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average suffered its steepest decline since June 2016 on Friday, amid wider losses in US markets. The fall came after a string of disappointing earnings reports from giants such as Apple. Strong wage growth in the latest payrolls data also spooked investors raising the possibility of higher interest rates than expected. The Dow fell more than 665 points or 2.5% to 25,520.96. The S&P 500 tumbled 59.8 points, falling 2.12% to 2,762.13, while the Nasdaq closed 144.91 points lower at 7,240.9, down 1.96%. The losses touched every sector, with the steepest declines in energy and technology stocks. Chevron and Exxon, which both reported quarterly earnings to investors on Friday, were the two biggest losers on the Dow, falling more than 5%. Apple, which reported after the close of trading on Thursday, was number four, retreating 4.3%. Stocks were also rattled as the yield on the 10-year Treasury note hit a four-year high after Friday's payrolls report. The gain in bond yields, which come as central banks globally ease stimulus programmes and raise rates, have touched off fears that stocks could become a less attractive investment, while signalling higher borrowing costs that could crimp consumer activity. Analysts said markets may also be responding to outstanding political and policy issues, such as trade tensions with partners such as China and how tax cuts will shift corporate financial strategies. ""There are still a number of question marks on the side of fiscal policy,"" said Lindsey Piezga, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income. For the week, the Dow fell 4%, while the Nasdaq and S&P 500 each slipped by more than 3%. Analysts cautioned against reading too much into the market declines, which follow a massive rally in 2017 that was fuelled by a strengthening global economy and high expectations for US corporate tax cuts. The three major stocks indexes also closed January up more than 5%. The Dow, which tracks about 30 major companies, in particular is not a good gauge, said Brian Barnier, head of analytics at Valuebridge Advisers. ""It's very important to separate trading activity from real investing activity,"" said Mr Barnier, who also teaches at the Colin Powell School at the City College of New York. Assuming they have well-designed portfolios, ""mom and pops sitting at home... should not be concerned, given the massive run up in the market,"" he added.

Alleged IRA bomber faces civil action,"John Downey denied murdering the soldiers in the 1982 Hyde Park bombing The families of four soldiers killed in the 1982 IRA Hyde Park bombings have been granted legal aid to take a civil case against one of the alleged bombers. John Downey, 66, has denied murdering the soldiers. A 2014 prosecution against him was dropped whena judge ruled an official assurance given in errormeant he could not face trial. He had an""on the run"" letter telling him he was no longer a wanted man. Four soldiers and seven horses were killed in the Hyde Park attack The letter, which he had received in 2007, assured him he would not face arrest and prosecution for IRA crimes. The then prime minister, David Cameron, described the letter as a ""dreadful mistake"". The Hyde Park attack on 20 July 1982 killed Squadron Quartermaster Corporal Roy Bright, Lieutenant Anthony Daly, Trooper Simon Tipper and Lance Corporal Jeffrey Young. On Tuesday,The Sun reported that the Legal Aid Agency had confirmed that it was providing funding to the families of the victims.,external At that time of John Downey's 2014 prosecution, Mr Justice Sweeney heard from Sinn FÃ©in's Gerry Kelly that 187 people had received ""on the run"" letters. These people were either suspected of paramilitary crimes or had escaped from prison after being convicted. The 1998 Good Friday Agreement meant that anyone convicted of paramilitary crimes was eligible for early release, but the agreement did not cover on the runs. Sinn FÃ©in sought a scheme that would allow on the runs to return to the UK without fear that they would be arrested. This scheme was agreed with the UK government but not disclosed to the public. Read more about on the runs here. Former Ulster Unionist MP, Danny Kinahan, welcomed news of the legal aid. Mr Kinahan, who was a former colleague of the murdered soldiers, said it should have happened ""a lot sooner"". Former MP, Danny Kinahan, said the soldiers were in the ""prime of their lives"" ""The families of my murdered colleagues have been put through hell,"" he said. ""Firstly, they lost their loved ones, stolen from them in the prime of their lives. ""Then, they suffered the pain of the farce of the trial of John Downey being thrown out because of one of the despicable on-the-run letters."" Civil action is taken to seek financial compensation, rather than a criminal conviction, and it requires a much lower standard of proof than a criminal case. A civil court is also less stringent in terms of what can be entered as evidence. The families involved in this case will hope their legal team will be able to use that extra latitude to put as much information as possible about the Hyde Park attack into the public domain. But even if a judge was to rule that John Downey was liable for the Hyde Park bombing, he could not be sent to prison. Mr Downey also cannot be compelled to attend any future civil court hearing, or to pay damages if any were to be awarded. Relatives of 12 of the 29 people killed in the 1998 Omagh bomb attack successfully took a civil case against four men they claimed were responsible. A judge ruled that the men were liable for the bomb and ordered them to pay Â£1.6m in damages. None of them were sent to prison and the families have not received any compensation. The Hyde Park attack is one of the most significant unsolved IRA bombings of The Troubles. One other person was convicted in relation to the deaths before being later cleared on appeal.

"Armed forces 'paralysis due to Brexit'Delays over planned military reductions created uncertainty and risked reputation, says think tank.15m15 minutes ago","A government preoccupation with Brexit has led to ""policy paralysis"" over the armed forces, a think tank is warning. The Royal United Services Institute said delays over implementing planned military reductions, including the axing of some warships, aircraft and regiments, had created uncertainty. Rusi said the UK was risking its reputation as an international partner. The Ministry of Defence says its review, to be concluded by the summer, will strengthen the armed forces. Rusi's warning comes as the Ministry of Defence faces a budget shortfall of up to Â£20bn over the next 10 years. Reality Check: What's happening to defence spending? Marine cuts would 'undermine UK security' UK could lose 'fight on beaches' ships A defence review was due to be published early this year which could have led to significant cuts in the armed forces. BBC Defence Correspondent Jonathan Beale said the defence secretary, Gavin Williamson, has managed to buy the MoD more time as he tries to persuade the Treasury to give his department more money. ButRusi's report,externalsays any further delay in making those decisions risks damaging Britain's standing with key allies. It argues that by extending the defence review and with themedia focus on possible cuts to ""totemic"" units like the Marinesthere is now a greater danger to the UK's ""credibility as a serious security actor"". The think-tank says the government has a ""positive story to tell"" with defence spending due to be 5% higher in real terms in 2020-21 compared to 2015-16. But Rusi said the MoD promised more than it could realistically afford and this year's review is having to address this. It added:  ""The government is increasingly perceived to be unable to make difficult decisions, distracted by Brexit and unable to play an international role that is commensurate with the resources it devotes to this purpose. ""The longer this policy paralysis continues, the greater the risk to the UK's reputation as a reliable ally, and the stronger the (unfair) perception that it is no longer capable of being a serious security player. ""With talks on the EU's future relationship with the UK approaching a critical moment, this is not a helpful message.""

What's behind the rise of Asia's stock markets,"Analysts believe the strong appetite for Asian stocks can continue Memory chips and China's economic muscle are among the factors that have put a rocket under Asian stocks this year, pushing markets to record or multi-year highs. ""Everyone hated Asia markets for a long time,"" says Josh Crabb, head of Asian equities at Old Mutual Global Investors. ""Now we've moved on from there"". Moved on indeed: South Korea's Kospi sits at a record; Japan's Nikkei 225 index is above a two-decade high; Hong Kong's Hang Seng is around a 10-year peak, while markets in India, Taiwan and Indonesia are among the others scaling fresh heights. It's an unusual moment for equities in the region as strong corporate profits, economic stimulus and growth are overshadowing nearby political risks. ""Markets seem impervious to events,"" says CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy. ""Sabre-rattling from North Korea barely makes a dent"". And some analysts argue that as long as US markets keep their cool, there's plenty of good times for investors in Asia still to come. Many markets in Asia are trading at historic or multi-year highs Since the 2009 crash, global markets have been moving steadily higher - with a few stumbles en route. Massive liquidity coupled with ultra-low interest rates has created a fertile environment for stocks to thrive. Asia has enjoyed a tailwind fromrecord gains on Wall Street. At the same time, China's economy - aiming for 6.5% growth this year - has been  underpinning the broader region for some time. The world's second largest economy has a big impact on the fortunes of other countries, even as its growth rate moderates. Take South Korea: It's seen double-digit export growth for the last 11 months, thanks largely to China, which buys about one-quarter of its products sold offshore. China third-quarter growth hits 6.8% Japan economy grows at fastest pace in more than 2 years ""China's improving economic conditions can really be seen as a trigger for the equity run in Asia,"" says IG Markets analyst Jingyi Pan. Asia is home to two of the world's three largest economies, China and Japan Japan's economy is also gathering steam. Exports are climbing and strong domestic spending on devices like cameras and computers from China is driving growth.Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's re-election, and the likely continuation of his Abenomics policies, was met with cheers from investors. Ed Rogers, chief executive of Rogers Investment Advisors in Japan believes the benchmark Nikkei index can track even higher. ""Japan has a long way to go. There's $18tn in cash on the sidelines,"" he says, adding that most of that money is currently invested in low-yielding Japanese government bonds. ""There's a similar boat load of money that wants to get out of China,"" Mr Rogers says. That money could find plenty of homes in Asia where equities are cheap relative to other parts of the world. Companies in the region are strengthening, and well-received results this earnings season have given markets a boost. For South Korean firms, the outlook is even brighter. CLSA analyst Paul Choi says at the beginning of 2017, people were expecting 10% corporate earnings growth, now that forecast is around 50%. It's got a lot to do with memory chips. Higher prices for chips used in electronic devices have spurred index heavyweights like Samsung and SK Hynix, as well as the broader market. Samsung sees record quarterly profit on chip demand In fact, Mr Choi says that fluctuations in the value of memory chips is more threatening to South Korea's market than provocations from its northern neighbour. Which brings us back to North Korea. North Korea insists it needs a nuclear-weapons programme to ensure its survival Investors appear largely unshaken by displays of military aggression - missile tests and provocations against Japan - and analysts say markets have factored in the risk. Rogers Investment Advisors Mr Rogers describes the North Korea threat as ""kind of overblown"". North Korea fires missile over Japan in 'unprecedented threat' Can the US defend itself against North Korea? Japan PM Shinzo Abe promises to handle North Korea threat That attitude will shift dramatically if threats turn to action. Until then, other risks to the Asian rally loom larger. Turning off the stimulus tap and theratcheting up of interest rates will dampen enthusiasm, while analysts point toChina's ballooning debtas another threat to the region. Mr Rogers says political risk and ""unpredictability"" hang over Asian markets and unexpected moves could stunt recent rallies. The threat of the ""unknown"" is a familiar refrain from market-watchers in the region. ""The most damaging risks are the ones we don't forecast,"" says CMC Markets' Mr McCarthy. A final recurring note of caution is therush on Wall Street. Recent gains have been inspired by strong earnings, along with hopes of tax reform and business friendly policies under President Trump. But the chorus of concern about the market's sharp rise is growing on Wall Street. US economic growth revised up again US markets are rising - So why are some people worried? History shows a gradual climb-down from the record highs on US markets is unlikely, and a collapse could shock the world. ""If the US blows up, most things will come off. [Asia] won't be immune,"" says Josh Crabb of Old Mutual Global Investors. ""Markets tend to get euphoric and then they get fearful. Theoretically you shouldn't have boom and bust, but human behaviour drives stock markets more than logic.""

Asian markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why?,"Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 was down as much as 5% in mid morning trade Asian investors typically take their cue from what share prices do in America, as many Asian countries still depend on the US economy for growth. But analysts saythe sharp falls, while dramatic in themselves, should be seen in perspective. Economic fundamentals in the US, and in many Asian countries, are still stronger than they have been since the global financial crisis. It seems counter-intuitive, but as Dheeraj Bharwani, an independent wealth strategist said to me in the wake of the initial falls on Asian shares, ""it's actually positive economic news coming out of the US that has caused the Asian market falls"". The US economy is growing, and that means inflation expectations - how much things will cost in the future - are going up. And that means the US Federal Reserve may raise interest rates faster and at a steadier pace than they were expected to, in order to stabilise the economy. That's the job of central banks, to tweak and adjust interest rates to make sure the economy doesn't grow too fast, or too slow. (Think of the economy like the perfect bowl of Goldilocks porridge, and it might become a little clearer.) This is what's causing some investors in the US and Asia to pull their money out of the stock market. Because when the cost of borrowing rises, investors worry about the impact of that on the growth outlook of companies that might find it more expensive to build new factories or expand. So investors now have ""a choice about where to put their money"", says David Kuo of Motley Fool. ""With US interest rates rising this year, they don't have to invest it in shares to get a return."" Asian markets have also benefited from US interest rates being at record lows over the last decade because a lot of that money has come into Asian markets to look for better returns. But now with US interest rates expected to rise, traders say many Asian investors are feeling anxious that the US stock market rally may be winding down, and that could drag Asian stocks lower too.

"Barnier's Brexit trade warning to UKThe EU's chief negotiator says trade barriers are ""unavoidable"" if UK leaves the customs union.11h11 hours agoUK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Barnier: It's time for UK to make a choice The UK will face ""unavoidable"" barriers to trade if it leaves the customs union and single market, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier has said. Speaking in Downing Street, he said the ""time had come"" for the UK to choose what it wanted after its 2019 exit. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK's position was ""perfectly clear"". The UK, he argued, wanted a free trade deal with the EU but also the freedom to strike deals with other countries, where trade opportunities were growing. ""There's no doubt about it. We are leaving the customs union but we are aiming for a good future for Britain,"" Mr Davis said. He also said he was confident the two sides would reach an agreement on a ""transitional"" or ""implementation"" phase - to last between 18 months and two years after the UK leaves next year - in time for an EU summit at the end of March. After lunch with Mr Davis and a 20-minute meeting with Theresa May, Mr Barnier said there was ""some divergence"" between the two sides when it came to issues relating to transition and how the exit deal would be enforced. Kuenssberg: The clock is ticking Explained: Customs union and single market Reality Check: How soon are Brexit answers needed? What is the Brexit 'transition phase' all about? While he said he respected the UK's decision to rule out any form of long-term customs union and other so-called ""red lines"", he said it was a prerequisite of any deal that ""everyone plays by the same rules"" during the transition period - where the UK would have to comply with existing EU laws and regulations. He said he wanted greater clarity from the UK about what ultimate partnership it wanted with the EU after its departure, expressing his hope an ""official position"" would be put forward soon.

""The only thing I can say, without a customs union and outside the single market, barriers to trade in goods and services are unavoidable. The time has come to make a choice."" The government's 11-strong Brexit cabinet sub-committee will meet on Wednesday and Thursday as UK officials prepare to brief their EU counterparts on their vision for post-Brexit relations on Friday. At the same time, there will be initial discussions on the ""transitional"" period as well as efforts to convert the details of December's agreement on the Irish border, citizens' rights and money into a legal framework. Ahead of this, Downing Street ruled out any form of customs union with the EU, which would give the UK access to tariff-free trade within the bloc but mean it cannot negotiate its own deals with other countries.

Downing Street said the government had set out two potential alternatives last summer - a new customs partnership without the need for any customs checks and a ""highly streamlined"" arrangement in which EU arrivals would be subject to customs checks but in a way that minimised disruption through technology. No 10 would not say which was the preferred option and said work was continuing on both proposals. Conservative MEP Daniel Hannan said Switzerland was an example of a country which had both its own customs arrangements with the EU and an independent trade policy. Michel Barnier was welcomed to No 10 by David Davis ""Britain is a global country, a world trader,"" he told the BBC's Daily Politics, adding that the UK had been ""artificially penalised"" by the customs unions because it trades more outside the EU than inside. But former attorney general Dominic Grieve said he found Downing Street's intervention ""rather strange"" since the UK would have to maintain some form of ""customs union or alignment"" with the EU if it was to honour the terms of its agreement to prevent any hard border on the island of Ireland. Ministers are looking at two options to ensure ""frictionless"" trade after Brexit Labour said it was ""foolhardy"" to rule out any kind of customs union with the UK's largest trading partner. ""The government must put jobs and the economy first, not their own internal party wrangling,"" a party spokesman said. In the House of Commons, ministers faced criticism for delays in putting forward new post-Brexit immigration rules. The government has said new border controls will be brought in when EU free movement rules no longer apply, but a promised White Paper policy document has yet to be published. Businesses groups have expressed frustration at the wait for concrete proposals. And in an urgent Commons question, Labour MP Yvette Cooper, who chairs the Home Affairs Select Committee, said it was a ""shambles"" and accused the government of ""kicking the can down the road"". Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes denied this, saying it was ""imperative"" that the White Paper and an immigration bill were the ""right pieces of legislation"" when they were brought to the Commons. ""We will publish a White Paper in the coming months, when the time is right,"" she said. Rudd hits back at Brexiteers What happens now that a deal's been done?

Stagecoach East Coast deal to end earlyTransport Secretary Chris Grayling will end the contract after Stagecoach 'got its numbers wrong'.5h5 hours agoBusiness,"Stagecoach's contract to run the East Coast Mainline rail franchise will end earlier than expected after the government said the operator had ""got its numbers wrong"". Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said Stagecoach would continue running the London to Edinburgh line only for ""a small number of months and no more"". He said the government may step in to run the service. He added that the day-to-day operation of the line would be unaffected. The East Coast Mainline franchise was taken into public ownership in 2009 after being run by National Express. It was reprivatised when Stagecoach and Virgin signed a deal to run the East Coast line from 2015 to 2023, promising to pay the government Â£3.3bn to run the service. Stagecoach owns 90% of the joint venture and Virgin owns the remaining 10%. In November, the Department for Transport said Stagecoach and Virgin would withdraw from running the service three years early, in 2020, after running into difficulties. But on Monday Mr Grayling told the House of Commons the situation was now ""much more urgent"" and that new arrangements were needed ""in the very near future"". Mr Grayling said he was considering two approaches. One option was to allow Stagecoach to continue operating the franchise on a short-term and not-for-profit basis until a new contract is awarded in 2020. Alternatively, East Coast Mainline could be brought back under government control and be run by the Department for Transport through an operator of last resort. Mr Grayling said: ""The problem is that Stagecoach got its numbers wrong. It overbid and is now paying a price."" East Coast decision investigated by watchdog 'Indefensible' deal over East Coast rail Plan to fix 'creaking' railways unveiled by government Labour former transport secretary Lord Adonis accused Mr Grayling of ""undertaking another unjustified bailout of Virgin and Stagecoach at the expense of taxpayers"". He said: ""The reason for these disgraceful bailouts we've been seeing from Mr Grayling is because he simply is not prepared to contemplate putting his duty above ideology and substituting for failing private companies a state company."" However Mr Grayling insisted that there was ""no question of a bailout"" for the company, adding: ""Stagecoach will be held to all of its contractual obligations in full."" He said Stagecoach was set to lose about Â£200m, equating to more than 20% of its total market value. Mr Grayling said: ""It should also act as a stark warning to any company tempted to over-bid in future."" At the same time, Mr Grayling also announced that another joint venture between Stagecoach and Virgin had won an extension to operate the West Coast Mainline rail service between London and Glasgow. He said that this joint venture will operate the West Coast Mainline from 1 April 2018 until potentially 31 March 2020. A Stagecoach subsidiary is also on the shortlist of bidders hoping to operate the East Midlands franchise, scheduled to begin in August 2019. Shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald said: ""That Chris Grayling awarded a profitable contract to Virgin and Stagecoach on the West Coast while simultaneously confirming the same companies have collapsed on the East Coast shows Government policy is in chaos. ""This is yet another Tory handout to private shareholders at the public's expense. Failing train companies should not be awarded future contracts, but this government is rewarding them for failure by extending their lucrative deal."" Mick Whelan, leader of the train drivers' union Aslef, said: ""It is outrageous that Virgin Trains has been handed a lucrative new contract to run services on the West Coast Mainline despite serious criticism of its owners' handling of the East Coast franchise."" Stagecoach Group Chief Executive Martin Griffiths said: ""A lot has been said and written in the past few months about Virgin Trains East Coast - a lot of it has been misinformed and much of it has been politically motivated."" He said Stagecoach and Virgin had delivered for passengers, employees and the economy including generating payments to the taxpayer of more than Â£800m.

US stock plunge sparks global sell-off,"US stocks suffered their worst falls in more than six years on Monday in a sell-off sparked by concerns of higher interest rates. The Dow Jones Industrial Average index tumbled 1,175 points, or 4.6% to close down at 24,345.75. The White House moved to reassure investors saying it was focused on ""long-term economic fundamentals, which remain exceptionally strong"". Signs of improvement in the economy had driven US markets to record highs. Ever since he was elected in November 2016 President Donald Trump has tweeted a number of times about the increase in US stock markets, using the gains since he took office to illustrate market improvement. ""Economic news from the US has been stronger than anticipated,"" said David Kuo, chief executive of financial services advisory Motley Fool. ""So, perversely, the market correction has been caused by positive economic news"". Monday's decline is the largest decline in percentage terms for the Dow since August 2011, when markets dropped in the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" - the day Standard & Poor's downgraded its credit rating of the US. The drop on the Dow was closely followed by the wider S&P 500 stock index, down 4.1% and the technology-heavy Nasdaq, which lost 3.7%. In London, the FTSE 100 index of leading companies also fell to close down 1.46% or 108 points lower. In Tuesday's early Asian trade, stocks were following Wall Street's lead. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 sank 4.8% before recovering slightly, while Australia's benchmark S&P/ASX 200 was down 2.7%. In South Korea, the Kospi lost 2.3%. Asian markets are following Wall Street's lead - but why? Investors are reacting to changes in the outlook for the American and global economy, and what that might mean for the cost of borrowing. The stock market sell-off accelerated on Friday when the US Labour Department released employment numbers which showed stronger growth in wages than was anticipated. CMC Markets analyst Michael McCarthy said the wage numbers ""blew lower interest rates out of the water"". ""The share selling....reflects a higher than previously anticipated interest rate environment,"" Mr McCarthy said. US jobs and wages rise in January The US economy in six charts In response to that, investors moved to sell out of stocks and put money into assets like bonds which benefit from higher interest rates. ""This isn't a collapse of the economy. This isn't a concern that markets aren't going to do well,"" said Erin Gibbs, portfolio manager for S&P Global Market Intelligence. ""This is concern that the economy is actually doing much better than expected and so we need to re-evaluate,"" she said. What has driven the Dow's surge? Stronger global growth has prompted central banks in Europe, Canada and elsewhere to ease away from policies put in place to stimulate the economy after the financial crisis. Analysts say investors should be prepared for choppier stock markets in the months ahead. But the Dow closed Monday having shed about a third of its gains since Mr Trump took office in January 2017. It marks a dramatic turnaround from January, whenit raced past the 25,000 and 26,000 point milestonesin less than a month. Joel Prakken, chief US economist for IHS Markit, predicts share price gains will be limited over the next two years. But he added that markets would need to deteriorate more significantly for him to start to worry about the broader economy. ""The difference between this year and last year is we're going to see more periods of volatility like this as the market reacts to higher inflation,"" he said. ""We're just not used to it because it's been so long since we've had a significant correction."" Investors have been bracing for a downturn after months of seemingly unstoppable gains. Amid the market plunge on Monday, websites for several large money management companies suffered slowdowns or crashes. Wall Street firms also said they have been fielding calls from people worried about their investments. Jerome Powell was sworn in as the new chairman of the US Federal Reserve on Monday Boasting about stock market gains is a dangerous game that most presidents avoid playing. Barack Obama did it occasionally, but only after the US economy had climbed significantly from the wreckage of the 2008 collapse. After warning of a market bubble during the campaign, however, Donald Trump became the Dow Jones's biggest cheerleader- in tweets, at rallies and even during last week's State of the Union address. That set up the jarring visual of the president boasting about the benefits of his tax cuts in a speech as the markets headed south. US cable news channels, which had been airing the president live, cut into their coverage to report on the record-setting day. It was a highly visible hiccup in the recent US economic success story that will be hard for most Americans to miss. The president will make the case that the fundamentals in the economy are still strong. Wages are up and unemployment is down - possibly contributing to stock drop. If growth continues, this could be chalked up as yet another rhetorical mis-step by a non-politician. If it's the beginning of a larger correction in an election year, however, the president's words could come back to haunt him.

Airlines get tough on 'support pets',"Cute but not to be cuddled on board. Hedgehogs are on an in-flight banned list. If you were planning to bring a hedgehog on to a flight as a form of emotional support, you might have to think again. Hedgehogs have been included on a banned list - as airlines get tougher over soaring demands from anxious passengers wanting to travel with ""emotional support animals"". United Airlines say requests have risen by 75% to 76,000 in a year. The airline recently had to turn down a request to travel with a peacock. But a spokeswoman for the airline says that even beforeturning away the peacock at Newark airportin the US, there had been recognition that the rules needed to be tightened. This was because of a ""significant increase in onboard incidents involving these animals"", she added. United said that last year there had been an increase of more than 30,000 passengers wanting to travel with emotional support pets. From next month, there will be tougher rules on animals carried by passengers to provide reassurance or as part of therapy - although this will not affect animals such as guide dogs for the blind. An emotional support peacock was turned away from Newark airport As well as 48 hours' notice and a letter from a mental health professional, passengers will now have to show proof that their animal has been ""trained to behave properly in a public setting"". United will also keep a list of banned animals, including hedgehogs, ferrets, insects, rodents, snakes, spiders, reptiles and ""non-household birds"" under review. From next month, Delta will also be stepping up efforts to ""protect"" its passengers, after an 84% increase in on-board animal ""incidents"". A statement from the airline says this is because of ""serious safety risks involving untrained animals in flight"". The airline says it will continue to carry about 250,000 guide dogs or other service animals each year. But Delta has faced requests to carry ""comfort turkeys"", possums and snakes. And it says staff have faced biting, growling and barking animals, as well as urination and defecation. Virgin Atlantic says that it only allows dogs to be carried as emotional support pets. British Airways, meanwhile, says that it has had no increase in requests - because it doesn't allow passengers to bring any emotional support animals on board.

'Anti-homeless' bars to be removed,"Bars were fitted to the benches to deter people from lying on them A council has said it will remove ""anti-homeless"" bars from benches after receiving ""extensive feedback"". Protestors including rapper Professor Green condemned the bars as ""inhumane"", ""brutal"" and ""disgraceful"". Bournemouth Borough Council said it had fitted the devices to stop people lying on the benches and preventing others from sitting down. It said it would remove them in the next few days, in the light of ""the depth of feeling"" over the issue. More than 19,500 people signed an online petition calling for the bars to be taken off. The housing charity Crisis said the benches were a ""sad indictment"" and failed to ""address the root causes of rough sleeping"". Mum covers anti-homeless spikes with cushions Homeless would risk Â£1k fine in tent ban plan Rough sleeping in England rises for seventh year Professor Green, who last year fronted aBBC documentary on homelessness,said the benches sent a hostile message to ""poor sods with no safety net"". In a social media post, he said: ""Nothing done to tackle the problem, just something to make it more invisible so we can pretend it isn't happening."" Protestors festooned the 28 benches with throws, cushions and balloons on Monday The council said Â£3,650 was spent fitting the bars On Monday, protestorsfestooned the 28 benches with throws, cushions and balloons. Bournemouth Borough Council later announced its change of heart. Councillor Robert Lawton said: ""The decision last summer to install the bars on a very small number of benches... was taken in response to many complaints about people lying on them throughout the day. ""However we have listened to the extensive feedback over the last week and in light of the depth of feeling, have today reviewed that decision and agreed to have the bars removed."" Artist Stuart Semple, who prompted the protests byposting a photo of a bench in January, said he was delighted. ""We're totally over the moon, it's brilliant... It just really goes to show when the community comes together, gets behind something and keeps the pressure up."" Professor Green, whofilmed a friend removing bars from a bench on Thursday, posted: ""Well done all involved... A small example of how a little bit of togetherness can bring about change.""

The Dow Jones industrial average has close down 1,100 points in its worst trading day since 2008. It ended 1,175.11 points lower at 24,345.85, or off 4.6%. It is the biggest drop in points since 29 September 2008 when US Congress rejected a $700bn bank bailout plan after Lehman Brothers collapse earlier that month. BBC business producer tweets... US tax reforms could reduce badly needed investment by US firms abroad, the UN's trade arm has warned. UNCTAD said some $2trn of overseas investment could be repatriated to the US. Almost half of global investment stock is either located in the United States or owned by US multinationals,it said,external. In a statement it said: ""Repatriations could cause a large drop in the outward FDI stock position of the United States, from the current $6.4 trillion to possibly as low as $4.5 trillion, with inverse consequences for inward FDI stocks in other countries. ""About one quarter of United States outward stock of FDI is located in developing countries. However, it is likely that a large part of the stock located in developing countries is invested in productive assets and therefore not easily repatriated."" Allow Twitter content?

A short while ago the Dow Jones had lost some 4.4% to 24,393.37 points. The S&P 500 was down 2.5% to 2,693.21 points while the Nasdaq had shed 2.9% to 7,033.52 points. Speaking during the Future of the City dinner, FCA boss Mr Bailey said: ""The best solutions are mutually agreed and enacted so that they are consistent. ""And to achieve this, we need by the end of March a joint commitment by the political authorities to a well-defined implementation or transition period which will create the space and support for the regulators to work with firms and political authorities to put practical solutions into place. ""It can be done, and I think there is a growing consensus on both sides that it must be done. I sense this view increasingly taking hold from my discussions around Europe. ""But it needs support in the form of a timely commitment to a transition agreement which will allow the regulators to get on and tackle these issues. "" The boss of Britain's financial watchdog has urged the government to give firms, markets and regulators ""much-needed assurance"" over the Brexit
transition period. Andrew Bailey, chief executive of the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has
called on UK and EU regulators show their
commitment to the process by drawing up a memorandum of understanding to
underpin a ""stable and orderly"" change. The UK and the European Union have already agreed to honour a two-year
transition period to avoid
disruption. But the two parties remain divided over what the ""implementation phase""
should look like, with Britain wanting to maintain full-membership rights and
the EU wanting to strip the UK of its decision-making powers. It seems everyone is laying into Bitcoin today. Now Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, has warned that the coin and other virtual currencies are âvery risky assetsâ that should be bought with caution. âVirtual currencies are indeed subject to high volatility. Their price is entirely speculative,â he told the European Parliament in Strasbourg. More regulation of crypto-currencies was needed, he said - but recent developments like the listing of bitcoin futures contracts could lead to European banks holding positions in bitcoin in future. He said the ECBâs regulatory arm was working âto identify potential prudential risks that these digital assets could pose to supervised institutionsâ. Allow Twitter content?

Lloyds Banking Group is to cut 930 jobs as a part of a restructuring. The lender, which had just over 70,000 staff at the end of June 2017, said most of the cuts would be âwithin commercial banking, the chief information office, risk, community banking and insurance and wealthâ. It also plans to hire an extra 465 people to new roles. The cuts reflect changing customer behaviour as more people bank online and shun high street branches. The bank said: ""The groupâs policy is always to use natural turnover and to redeploy people wherever possible to retain their expertise and knowledge within the group. ""Where it is necessary for employees to leave the company, we will look to achieve this by offering voluntary redundancy. Compulsory redundancies will always be a last resort.â Production has been allowed to resume at one Russell Hume site, two weeks after the meat supplier was put under investigation over food hygiene standards. The firm, who supplied Jamie's Italian and others, will be allowed to resume production and distribution from its Liverpool site, the Food Standards Agency said. This is because certain ""assurances"" have been met, although other sites remain on lock-down for now. The FSA said: ""This
decision has been taken on the basis that we are now assured that the food
being produced at the Liverpool site complies with the relevant legislation.
The action taken has been proportionate and we recognise the potential impact
on the business and peoplesâ livelihoods."" After paring their losses, US stocks have taken a turn for the worse again. The Dow Jones index is down more than 1.5% at 25,125.61 points, while the S&P 500 is 1.1% lower at 2,730.02. The Nasdaq - which turned positive earlier - is 1% lower at 7,166.74. Responding to news that the East Coast Mainline could be terminated in ""a matter of months"", shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald accuses the government of a ""monumental misjudgment"". He says the Transport Secretary has favoured private companies over passengers and the rail industry. He also says the ""bailout culture at the Department for Transport is alive and well"". He accuses the operators of ""gaming"" the system of millions of pounds of public money and says the government has failed to stand up to them. Mr Grayling said he had not yet decided which company would be awarded the East Coast Franchise but that, for the time being, Stagecoach could be permitted to continue to operate the franchise on a short term and not-for-profit basis. Another option would be for the line to be run directly by the Department of Transport via an ""operator of last resort"". In terms of the re-tendering in 2020, Mr Grayling said there were no legal grounds to prevent Stagecoach from bidding for current or future franchises. But he said he would keep Stagecoach's eligibility for future contracts under ""constant review"". Mr Graying also said the problems on the East Coast Mainline were very simple: Stagecoach, one of the operators, ""got its sums wrong and overbid"". He said the taxpayer had continued to profit from the franchise and the operators had invested in the network. He said Stagecoach would not be receiving a ""bailout"" and had suffered a ""significant"" loss for its mistake. In an update to the House of Commons, the Transport secretary has said that the loss-making East Coat Mainline contract - run by Virgin and Stagecoach - will be replaced (in its current form) imminently. Back in November the operators Virgin and Stagecoach said they would cut short the contract by three years, ending in 2020, due to mounting losses. But Chris Grayling today told MPs the situation was much worse than initially thought and the contract can only last a ""matter of months"" as it is. He said this news would not ""impact on the railway's day to day operations"" and it would be ""business as usual"" for passengers and staff."" But he does need to put in a successor contract in the ""very near future"". The London market ended lower after a turbulent day for global stocks driven by fears about potential US rate rises. The FTSE 100 ended Monday 1.465% lower at 7,334.98 points, while the FTSE 250 lost 1.36% to 19,690.49. The worst blue-chip performers includedRandgold Resources,external, which lost 7.4%,Vodafone Group,external, down 4% and G4S, 3.4% lower. David Madden of CMC Markets said: ""European
markets are firmly in the red as the global sell-off in stocks has taken hold. ""Ever since the US posted strong average earnings last Friday, traders have been
rattled by the prospect of tighter monetary policy around the world. Economic
indicators in the US, Europe and Asia point for a need to tighten up monetary
policies from various central banks."" Virgin Money has banned cryptocurrency purchases on its credit cards, following similar moves by Lloyds and other issuers. A spokesman said: ""Following a review of our policies, I can confirm customers
will no longer be able to use their Virgin Money credit card to
purchase cryptocurrencies. This only
applies to our credit cards and not our debit card."" Concerned by the fluctuating value of cryptocurrency, issuers fear that those who buy it on credit could run up huge debts. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
The painkiller that killed my sonMichelle Fraser's 18-year-old son Robert died from an overdose of fentanyl.10h10 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played ""My child died from it"": One mum on the prescription painkiller being taken to get a high Little more than a year ago Michelle Fraser knew nothing about fentanyl. Now she knows a lot: that the drug is a synthetic opioid related to heroin but more powerful; that it is a prescription drug used for cancer patients and others suffering severe pain; and that it is increasingly being used as a recreational drug. She also knows that fentanyl is a killer. It took the life of her 18-year-old son, Robert. ""I got a phone call from my ex-husband to say he had found Robert dead in bed and I remember thinking, 'He hasn't said that, he can't have said that - it's not true,'"" Michelle, from Deal in Kent, says. Robert's mum Michelle Fraser said drug dealers were ""playing Russian Roulette with our lives"" Robert had died of a fentanyl overdose. He had been given the drug by a dealer when he had gone with friends to buy cannabis. Michelle is convinced that Robert had no idea that he was taking fentanyl - or how dangerous it could be. ""Fentanyl is a killer and the drug dealers are playing Russian Roulette with our livesâ¦ my child died from it,"" she says. At the Eurofins Forensic Services laboratory in south-west London, they know all about the dangers of fentanyl. And of carfetanil - a related drug developed as a large animal tranquiliser. Just a few grains can be enough to kill. And it can be absorbed through the skin, or simply breathed in. The laboratory's forensic scientists have to work in pairs with the antidote to fentanyl close at hand. They test for the drug in specialised extractor cabinets which remove particles from the air and they wear disposable lab coats, double gloves and face masks. The laboratory has, for decades, analysed drugs for the police and the CPS to provide evidence in court. Lethal doses of heroin, fentanyl and carfentanil Forensic scientist Peter Cain says: ""Fentanyls are a different category of drug altogether. ""And the potential harm they could cause is just way above anything we have had in the past. ""It's the potency of them that is what's frightening."" So where is this dangerous, deadly drug coming from? Most of the supply in the UK is produced in China and then secretly shipped to the UK where users buy it through the dark web. The BBC went undercover in China to get at least part of the answer. After weeks of negotiations through messaging apps, we were invited to a meeting in an ordinary tearoom in a city in northern China. Here we met a young manager from a laboratory which makes research chemicals. He's with his translator. The conversation was stilted and slowed down by the language barrier but the message was very clear. They have brought samples of drugs made by the family firm. No fentanyl, of course, as it is too dangerous for this public place. The laws in China mean some labs can make certain types of fentanyl legally. The issue is who they are prepared to sell it to. Within minutes we were offered a deal. Quickly we learned that fentanyl was freely available, no questions asked, with an offer to ship it out to the UK: A class A drug readily available for the international criminal market. It would be packed up and sent discretely by mail or courier. The BBC left without making an order. No drugs were bought. The reason drug dealers are attracted to fentanyl over, say, heroin, is that it is so strong - a little goes a long way. It is a cheap alternative which can be sent in small packages. From China, and other places where fentanyl is produced, the dealers must, eventually, get the drug into the hands of those who choose to use it. Often, the last link in the chain is the so-called dark web. Most of the fentanyl supply in the UK is produced in China and then shipped to the UK where users buy it through the dark web Author Jamie Bartlett researches and writes about this unregulated part of the internet. He has logged on to a website that looks like any other online marketing site. Except in this case, we are offered heroin, morphine and fentanyl. Jamie says: ""It turns everything into a very professional sort of transaction and it just feels like: 'I will go onto my computer, get a few drugs delivered to my house and don't even think too much of it.' ""I think people who spend a lot of time on these markets can lose touch with what they're actually doing. ""They don't realise quite how serious or strong some of these drugs are and the severity of the crimes they're committing, because it feels like you are on a normal website doing a normal bit of business."" Fentanyl has also been sold on the street. Across the north east of England, in the early part of 2017, heroin suppliers started secretly mixing fentanyl with their usual supplies in order to increase profits. There was a surge in overdoses in the region. In Teeside at least six people died. Kenny almost became the seventh. Kenny survived a fentanyl overdose because the antidote was at hand. He has a long history of heroin abuse but his body was simply overwhelmed when he injected what the dealer had sold him. ""I was using what I thought was heroin and turns out it wasn't,"" he says. ""It was fentanyl or carfentanil. ""I overdosed - that is as much as I can remember. Injected it and overdosed. I was dead. ""I'd gotten about halfway down and I was just seeing red and that is the last I remember. ""It was like blood was covering my eyes."" Kenny survived only because he overdosed at a drop-in centre run by the Moses Project, which had taken the precaution of having the antidote to fentanyl. The spike of deaths across the north east of England put fentanyl firmly on the radar of the National Crime Agency. The drug has killed 113 people in the UK since 2016.

Maldives detains ex-leader in crackdown,"Police stood guard outside the the Supreme Court on Monday evening A former president of Maldives, who was in power for three decades, has been arrested at his home as a crackdown on the opposition intensifies. Maumoon Abdul Gayoom was detained after the government declared a 15-day state of emergency, suspending parliament and sending police to the Supreme Court. President Abdulla Yameen has refused to comply with a court order to release political prisoners. The army have been ordered to resist any move to impeach him. The court also ruled that the 2015 trial of another former President, Mohamed Nasheed, had been unconstitutional. Judges who were at the Supreme Court when police arrived have reportedly been held against their will overnight. Boris Johnson, foreign secretary of the UK, the former colonial power, called on President Yameen to lift the state of emergency. ""The damage being done to democratic institutions in Maldives andthe sustained misuse of process in Parliament is deeply worrying,"" he said in a statement.,external The US National Security Council has warned in a tweet that ""the world is watching"" the Maldives, which has a population of 400,000 and depends on tourism to power its economy.

Political turmoil threatens 'island paradise' Maldives leaves Commonwealth over democracy row Former Maldives leader 'given UK asylum' Olivia Lang, BBC News Last week's Supreme Court ruling very much caught the government on the back foot but it had been difficult to see how they would manage to avoid implementing it in the face of domestic and international pressure. With drastic measures, it seems. President Yameen clearly saw a threat to his rule and is pulling no punches in fending off the challenge. The mood has turned from tense to fearful. More arrests are expected to take place overnight. Maldivians are passing around messages telling one another to ""be safe"". With many constitutional rights suspended, there is little protection. Now aged 80, he ruled the country autocratically before the Maldives became a multi-party democracy in 2008. A half-brother of current President Yameen, he has now aligned himself with the opposition. He was detained in a police raid on his home, the opposition says. Shortly before, he tweeted about a large police presence outside. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a video posted online the ex-president addresses his supporters (in Dhivehi),external, saying that he has not ""done anything to warrant arrest"" and urging them to ""remain strong"". There were judges inside the court when it was stormed but a court spokesman said he was unable to contact them. ""I just spoke to the Chief Justice and he told me that the gates of the Supreme Court [were] being stormed by the military,"" Husnu al-Suood, president of Maldives Bar Association and a former attorney general, told Reuters news agency late on Monday. ""He is inside and nobody can go out or come in. The emergency means the Supreme Court activities are suspended and nobody is in charge of the judiciary."" A Supreme Court spokesperson told local media that security forces were holding all the judges against their will. Mr Nasheed, the island nation's first democratically elected leader, was convicted under anti-terrorism laws of ordering the arrest of a judge and sentenced to 13 years in prison. Ex-President Mohamed Nasheed has told the BBC he plans to return to the Maldives to contest elections However the verdict was internationally condemned and he was given political asylum in the UK the following year after being allowed to travel there for medical treatment. The Supreme Court also ordered the reinstatement of 12 MPs, which would see the opposition's parliamentary majority restored. It sacked the police commissioner for pledging to enforce the ruling and ordered the detention of two opposition MPs who had returned to the Maldives. The Maldives previously declared a state of emergency in November 2015, after the government said it was investigating a plot to assassinate Mr Yameen. That move came two days before a planned protest by Mr Nasheed's Maldivian Democratic Party. Mr Nasheed, who is in exile in Sri Lanka, told BBC News that the government's ""brazenly illegal"" actions amounted to a coup. ""Maldivians have had enough of this criminal and illegal regime,"" he said. ""President Yameen should resign immediately."" An opposition MP, Eva Abdulla, said the state of emergency was a ""desperate move"" that showed the government had ""lost everything [including the] confidence of the people and institutions"". On Sunday, opposition supporters demanded the release of nine jailed MPs What many people associate Maldives with... Breathtakingly beautiful beaches and breathtakingly expensive luxury hotels, says the BBC's South Asia correspondent Justin Rowlatt. The nation is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 individual islands. But while the water of the coral reefs that surround them may be crystal clear, politics in the ""island paradise"" has always been very murky indeed, our correspondent adds. Since President Yameen took power in 2013 the country has faced questions over freedom of speech, the detention of opponents and the independence of the judiciary.

But she said she would ""take a look"", 100 years on from some women getting the vote in the UK. Jeremy Corbyn said a Labour government would apologise to suffragettes and have criminal records overturned. Helen Pankhurst, great-granddaughter of suffragette Emmeline Pankhurst, said the women had been pardoned by society. Equality campaign group the Fawcett Society and some relatives of the suffragettes are among those who called on the home secretary to overturn the convictions of women who were imprisoned while fighting for the vote. But Helen Pankhurst said the suffragettes would be urging women to ""continue the fight"" rather than ""dwell"" on their personal sacrifice. ""It was not them breaking the laws that were the problem, it was the laws that were constraining our democracy,"" she told BBC Radio 5live. Theresa May and female MPs past and present gathered at Westminster for a reception The Representation of the People Act,externalwas passed on 6 February 1918 and gave women aged over 30 and ""of property"" the right to vote.

""While there is much to celebrate, I worry that our public debate today is coarsening,"" Mrs May said. ""That for some it is becoming harder to disagree, without also demeaning opposing viewpoints in the process."" The PM warned ""bitterness and aggression"" online threatens democracy and deters many people from engaging in politics.

How the Suffragettes woke us up The women against female suffrage Meanwhile, a cross-party group of Green, Labour and Liberal Democrat politicians called on the home secretary to make misogyny a hate crime. In July 2016,Nottinghamshire Police became the first force in the UK to record harassment of women as a hate crimein a bid to tackle sexist abuse, but the scheme has not been rolled out further. Other ways in which the anniversary is being marked include: A public exhibition of life-sized images of the central figures of the suffrage movement in London's Trafalgar Square Portraits of these people will also be in an exhibition at London's City Hall A reception for female MPs past and present in Parliament, hosted by Mrs May The Parliamentary Archives will display the 1918 Representation of the People Act itself for the first time BBC Radio 4's Today Programme used only women contributors and an all-female presenter line-up on its show Records compiled by the England, Suffragettes Arrested, 1906-1914 collection indicate there were more than 1,300 suffragette arrests and many women were jailed.

""We forget these women,"" said charity worker Lucy Rae, who came to see the exhibition with a colleague. ""I do think it's quite poignant. You almost want to stand in with them to be part of it and to be one of these women."" University professor Hazel Barrett, whose grandmother supported the suffragette movement, said people of all classes got involved, adding: ""Just look at them, ordinary women"". Sheree Davey, who came with her young son to see the display, said: ""It's incredible. It inspires you to learn a bit more. ""You know the basics but there's so much more to it."" Victoria Taylor, a tourist visiting from Australia, said: ""It's a great way to engage people. It's not confronting but it's very prominent."" The Scottish Tory leader said she supported calls for posthumous pardons for the convicted women as they were simply ""righting the wrong"" of of an unjust law. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,,externalRuth Davidson said: ""Voting was a value judgement, not an intrinsic right."" Ms Rudd, who is also minister for women and equalities, said she would consider the issue. However,she told Radio 4's Today Programme:""I must be frank, it is complicated because if you're going to give a legal pardon for things like arson and violence it's not as straightforward as people think it might be.""

"Hacking suspect wins extradition appealLauri Love, suspected of hacking into FBI and Nasa systems, may now face trial in the UK.12h12 hours agoSuffolk","This video can not be played Lauri Love: Alleged hacker hopes extradition case 'sets a precedent' Alleged computer hacker Lauri Love has won his High Court appeal against his extradition to the US. Mr Love, 33, from Stradishall, Suffolk, was first arrested in October 2013 on suspicion of hacking into FBI, US Central Bank and Nasa systems. Appeal judges said extradition,externalwould be ""oppressive by reason of his physical and mental condition"". They urged the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to prosecute Mr Love, who has Aspergers syndrome, in England. Lord Chief Justice Lord Burnett and Mr Justice Ouseley said Mr Love, who also has depression, ""did not seek impunity for the acts alleged against him, but contended that he should be tried and, if convicted, sentenced in the United Kingdom"". Lauri Love attended the appeal hearing with his girlfriend Sylvia Mann They said: ""We accept that the evidence shows that the fact of extradition would bring on severe depression, and that Mr Love would probably be determined to commit suicide, here or in America."" Mr Love is alleged to have stolen huge amounts of data from US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the US army, the defence department, Nasa and the FBI in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013. However, his supporters had warned if he was extradited there was a ""high risk"" he would kill himself. The judges urged the Crown Prosecution Service to work with US authorities because of ""the gravity of the allegations in this case, and the harm done to the victims"". They added that ""if proven, these are serious offences indeed"". The United States authorities now have 14 days to lodge a request for an appeal hearing at the UK Supreme Court. 28 October 2013: Lauri Love isarrested in Suffolkunder the Computer Misuse Act and accused of breaching the security of Nasa and FBI, among other US government agencies. He is released on bail. 27 February 2014: Mr Love is accused of anew chargeof hacking into US Federal Reserve computer servers and stealing the personal information of users. 20 February 2015: Police in the UK say they will not return Mr Love's computer because theycannot decrypt its files. 16 July 2015: Mr Love isre-arrestedby the Met Police executing an extradition warrant on behalf of the US. 20 August 2015: Mr Love tells the BBC he fears he willnot get a fair trialin the US. 10 May 2016: A bid by the National Crime Agency to force Mr Love to hand over encrypted computer passwords isthrown out by a district judgeat Westminster Magistrates' Court. 6 September 2016: Mr Love tells the BBC hefears dying in jail if he is extradited. 16 September 2016: A judge at Westminster Magistrates' Court rules Mr Love should be extradited to the US. 24 October 2016: MPs sign a letter asking President Obama toblock Mr Love's extradition. 14 November 2016: Home Secretary Amber Rudd signs theextradition order. 29 November 2017: The Court of Appealbegins hearing Mr Love's appeal against extradition. Speaking outside the court, Mr Love said he hoped he had set a ""precedent so this will not happen to people in the future"". ""I'm hoping that this outcome can contribute to the discussion we are having as a society about how to accommodate people that have neuro-diversity, whose brains are made up in a slightly different way,"" he said. ""There is an ongoing problem with people with autism in the justice system - they have actually been debating it in Westminster Hall. ""I hope in the future to be able to contribute to a slightly better understanding of the stigma associated with depression.""

What makes Great Britain great is that we live in a place with wisdom and compassion."" Authorities in the US have been fighting for Mr Love to face trial on charges of cyber-hacking, which lawyers have said could have meant a sentence of up to 99 years in prison if he was found guilty. The decision to block extradition was met with cheers in the packed London courtroom. A spokesman for Mr Love's solicitors, Kaim Todner, said it was ""important"" the British justice system ""has taken the stance that we should deal with the matter ourselves, rather than accept the US government's demands"". The United States authorities now have 14 days to lodge a request for an appeal hearing at the UK Supreme Court ""It has also been recognised that mental health provisions in US prisons are not adequate to satisfy us that Lauri would not have come to serious harm if he were extradited,"" the statement added. Emma Norton, head of legal casework for campaign group Liberty, said she was ""delighted"" the court had ""recognised Lauri's vulnerability, close family connections to the UK and the potentially catastrophic consequences of extraditing him"". She added: ""This was always a case that could have been prosecuted here and it's shameful that Lauri and his family have been put through this terrible ordeal."" Mr Love's local MP Matt Hancock said: ""It has been a long and hard process for him and his loving family and I'm delighted this verdict has been reached.""

"Remove hard Brexiteers, Soubry tells PMEx-business minister says she would be willing to quit the party if Johnson and Rees-Mogg take over.6m6 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played The frontbench is in hock to 35 hard ideological Brexiteers - Anna Soubry A pro-European ex-business minister has called on Theresa May to ""get a spine"" and remove 35 ""hard ideological Brexiteers"" from the Tories. Anna Soubry told BBC Newsnight she is willing to leave if the likes of Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg take over. The MP, who was in David Cameron's cabinet between 2015 and 2016, said the PM's ""red lines"" to leave the EU single market and customs union are wrong. Former Tory Chancellor Lord Lamont said Ms Soubry was being ""quite ridiculous"". Ms Soubry was speaking after theEU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned in Downing Streetthat the UK's Brexit plans would create ""unavoidable"" barriers to trade in goods and services. She told Newsnight that all her suggestions, to remain in the single market and customs union or to negotiate membership of the European Free Trade Association, have been dismissed by No 10 - and blames the influence of Tory Brexiteers. Kuenssberg: The clock is ticking What are the UK's Brexit trade options? Amber Rudd hits back at Tory Brexiteers ""My front bench... is in hock to 35 hard ideological Brexiteers who are not Tories,"" the Broxtowe MP said. ""They are not the Tory party I joined 40 years ago and it is about time Theresa stood up to them and slung 'em out. They have taken down Major, they took down Cameron, two great leaders neither of whom stood up to them."" The former minister added that she is prepared to leave her party unless Theresa May challenges her opponents. ""If it comes to it I am not going to stay in a party which has been taken over by the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg and Boris Johnson. They are not proper Conservatives."" She added: ""Unless Theresa stands up and sees off these people she is in real danger of losing huge swathes of not just the parliamentary party but the Conservative party. Ms Soubry spoke out after EU negotiator Michel Barnier held talks with Brexit Secretary David Davis ""That is the risk that she runs. She thinks she can pander to 35 forgetting there is a much larger group who are getting sick and tired of this."" Ms Soubry was speaking as the Brexit cabinet sub committee prepares to meet on Wednesday and Thursday this week to draw up a UK negotiating position on its future relationship with the EU. On Monday Downing Street reiterated its decision to withdraw from the EU customs union and not to join a watered down customs union with the EU. Ministers instead want to negotiate a separate customs arrangement or customs partnership. Downing Street says this is the only way to allow the UK to sign future trade deals around the world while seeking to maintain frictionless trade with the EU. Ms Soubry told Newsnight: ""Frankly people have got to grow some, get a spine, stiffen up, stand up to these people - most of them are ghastly bullies but also cowards at the same time - and speak up for their constituents and what is right for our country. ""And if that means leaving the party, form some new alliance, God knows I don't know. But we just simply cannot go on like this any longer."" Asked about Ms Soubry's intervention, the pro-Brexit Lord Lamont said: ""I think that is quite ridiculous frankly. ""I don't want to be rude about Anna Soubry but she does tend sometimes to go over the top. I think she is doing that here.""

I grew up with a female prime minister in charge. It would have made no sense to me whatsoever back then to discover that women hadn't had a say. If Mrs Thatcher wasn't always given a fond reception in Glasgow in the 1980s, it wasn't because she had a particular kind of chromosomes. And growing up - I suppose like many women of my generation - our expectation was that if you worked hard enough, women could more or less have it all. That sense of what was possible grew with the size of Sue Ellen from Dallas's shoulder pads, followed later by the Spice Girls' cartoonish power. The fictitious Mrs Banks in Mary Poppins seemed to rather enjoy dashing off to suffragette rallies (whatever they really were), which of course she could do only with the help of her nanny to look after her children. But to learn about the history of the fight for the vote back then seemed like a study of a weird injustice overturned from another world, not anything that could be in the memory of anyone's lifetime. Interesting to learn, yes, but relevant? It didn't necessarily seem so. Well guess what? I can't be the only person in the world to have discovered as I grew up that life was a bit more complicated than that, and opportunity for women wasn't really going to be defined by Kylie Minogue's example of switching careers when she fancied it. Personal choices were a lot more complex. And yes, reality crept in - women were, and are, treated differently in so many parts of life. Without question, that decades-long struggle finds its own echoes today. I'm writing this late at night on a bus speeding along a four-lane highway in China. It's full of officials from No 10 and other British journalists. We're all trailing the convoy of the UK's second female prime minister, who saw off another woman for her job (although who knows what might come next), following her every move in a trade mission as she escapes the political maelstrom for a moment. And while there are plenty of women in this travelling version of the Westminster bubble, here, as time and again in our politics, it is a long way off from being one-for-one. In politics at least, it is abundantly clear that big changes have taken place. Parliament does now look more like the population. There are 208 female MPs at the moment, that's a record level. But it's still not quite a third, and well short of reflecting the population. It's a long time since the first ever MP was elected, in 1918, a long time since 19 MPs were voted in at the 1979 general election alongside the country's first female political leader, the 60 women elected in 1992 or even the dramatic doubling in 1997. Life is about more than just numbers, of course, but does the proportion of women sitting on our green benches really matter? Forty five women have served as cabinet ministers (pictures: Getty Images & PA) The argument is made, by most politicians certainly, that we should be aiming for something much more like 50-50. But the parties have different approaches to how to hit that mark. Labour has pursued an active strategy for many years, where only women are allowed to stand for some seats. The all-women shortlist was much argued over to start with. And as times move on there's a new pointed question, dragging in the debate over the status of transgender candidates. The Tories have worked more informally, using support networks and gentle encouragement - and that has often been important too. Interestingly, many female MPs who give wholehearted backing to Theresa May came to know and like her through her work over the years as part of their organisation, Women To Win. But why should they make the effort, and does it matter to you? Certainly most voters have got many more things to worry about than gender equality in politics. Remember, it took years and years for the campaigns of the suffragettes to cut through. But if we want our politics to represent all of us fairly, consider this. If you are reading this with female eyes then I guess, like me, you're no stranger to being the only woman in the room. It's not necessarily bad, or good, sometimes it doesn't occur to you at all, but sometimes it is glaringly obvious, and rather different. If you are a man reading this, what does it feel like if you are the only one in a room full of women? Again, whether you like it or loathe it, you may not always notice, but when you do, sometimes it can feel pretty different. As human beings, we all know that different environments and different contexts lead to different conversations. Think back to when women were forbidden from having a say in who ran the country. Were their voices heard, their hopes and fears fully taken into consideration? With the glorious benefit of 100 years of hindsight, the answer to that is a straightforward no. A century on, is it so strange to hope that everyone can be represented in any room? That's not to say for a second that women's concerns are all the same. But in the most straightforward of terms, if you want a system to be successful, why would you not want to include as many people as possible? Does a democracy inspire faith, if some of its members feel no-one is listening? As this anniversary approaches it is not simply a question of commemorating an achievement of days long gone. The best tribute maybe is to remember suffrage's most simple message, to give everyone a say.

Reality Check: What if women couldn't vote?VideoVideoHow the Suffragettes woke us upThe women against female suffrageVideoVideoMemories of a force-fed suffragette,"It's 100 years since some women (and all men) were finally given the vote. But how might political history have been different if they hadn't won suffrage? In the real world, the Conservatives couldn't win a majority at the 2017 general election. But what would happen if all the votes cast by women were removed from the equation? Because of different patterns in how men and women vote it is likely the result would have been different and Prime Minister Theresa May would have had a majority. The results of some other elections would probably have been different too in this alternate reality. It's important to be clear about the limitations of what we can know here. The secret ballot means we never have definitive figures about how men and women vote. We are reliant on studies that involve asking a sample of the population how they voted after elections have taken place. PM hails 'heroic' suffragettes on centenary Laura Kuenssberg: The journey towards 50-50 The women against female suffrage How the Suffragettes woke us up The gender gap in voting is fairly small. Other demographic factors have a far bigger impact on people's likelihood to vote for each party. In the past, social class was a dominant factor. Middle-class people were more likely to vote Conservative and working-class people were more likely to vote Labour. Women at a polling station in 1983 Recently that's changed. In 2017, age and education were far more important. Young voters and voters with degrees were more likely to back Labour. Older voters and those with fewer qualifications were more likely to back the Conservatives. But how do the sexes differ when it comes to elections? If we look back over time the gender gap in voting has changed. The British Election Study has data going back to the 1964 general election. In the 1960s and 1970s it found that women were more likely than men to vote Conservative and less likely to vote Labour. It's not easy to find a definitive explanation. Hate mail and firebombs: How women won the vote Women's suffrage: New coin to mark 100 years of voting The 100-year-old protest posters that show women's outrage The Pankhurst Anthem: Song written for women's vote centenary Voting behaviour expert Dr Rosalind Shorrocks, from the University of Manchester, says that one of the reasons behind the difference was that women were more religious than men, and also points to the way they were affected by government policies. ""The Conservative Party's post-war anti-rationing stance appealed particularly to housewives who were managing family budgets,"" she explains. So in a close election like 1970, it was probably women voters who sealed the Conservative victory. That trend evaporated in the 1980s - interestingly when the prime minister was a woman - before returning in the 1990s. At recent elections the pattern seems to have become more volatile, like other trends in voting behaviour. In 2010 there was very little difference between men and women in terms of the two main parties. But women were more likely to back the Liberal Democrats and less likely to back smaller parties. The gender gap for other parties became more pronounced in 2015. This was connected to UKIP's very strong showing. They received 13% of the vote overall but were considerably more popular among men than women. That meant that women were more likely than men to vote for both Labour and the Conservatives. So if women had been unable to vote, it's quite likely that UKIP would have won more than the single seat they did. Nigel Farage might have become an MP. Douglas Carswell (left) and Nigel Farage campaigning in 2014 In 2017 the pattern changed again. The British Election Study and other post-election surveys suggest that the gender gap was the opposite of what it used to be. Women were more likely than men to vote Labour and less likely to vote Conservative. That is likely to have swayed the overall result. The Conservatives were only eight seats short of an outright majority and there was an unusually large number of seats where they lost very narrowly. So if women had not voted, Theresa May would probably have had more Conservative MPs and British politics could look very different. Again, Dr Shorrocks says this could be down to the perceived impact of government policies. ""In 2015 and 2017, it is especially younger women - under the age of 40 - who were particularly supportive of Labour. ""This is likely to be due to the disproportionate impact of austerity on women, with younger women the most likely to say that their cost of living has gone up and quality of services such as the NHS has gone down under the Conservative government.""

The women against female suffrageVideoVideoMemories of a force-fed suffragette,"A century ago, after years of campaigning, women over the age of 30 who owned property were given the right to vote in the UK. But for many thousands of women, it was not a moment of celebration. Known as the anti-suffrage movement, these women had been working to oppose the suffragettes. They believed women didn't have the capacity to understand politics, and portrayed the suffragettes as a group of ""ugly"" women and ""spinsters"". The Anti-Suffrage League was founded in 1908 by Mary Humphrey Ward, with support from two men: Lord Curzon and William Cremer. Suffragettes v suffragists: Who won women the vote? Reality Check: What if women couldn't vote? How the Suffragettes woke us up A year later, it was announced that more than 250,000 people, both men and women, had signed a petition against giving women the vote. Writing in The Queen in 1908,external, one ""opponent"", as they were described in the article, said they saw the campaign for the vote as a ""prelude to a social revolution"" that would set society back. ""We believe in the division of functions as the keystone of civilisation,"" the piece continued. ""It is as if the animals on the farm should insist on changing places - the cows insist upon drawing the coach, while the horses strive in vain to chew the cud and ruminate."" Historian Kathy Atherton says people nowadays can find it ""surprising"" that women were involved in an anti-suffrage movement, but that it's important to ""put yourself in their shoes"". ""There would have been a general acceptance that women were intellectually inferior and emotional - and women would have believed that as well as men - so they didn't have the capacity to make political judgements,"" she says. ""It's a really hierarchical society and the white male is at the top of the heap. ""There's a fear that you're upsetting the natural order of things, even going so far as thinking the colonies would be affected if they felt that Britain was being ruled by women."" ""One of the arguments that some of these anti-suffrage campaigners put forward was that if we give British women the vote - and they would very specifically use the example of India - Indian men and women won't like it,"" says Dr Sumita Mukherjee from the University of Bristol. At the time, India was ruled by the British Empire so power was exerted by the government in London and, by default, those who voted for them in the first place. ""They [the anti-suffrage movement] used this assumption that colonial subjects were very patriarchal themselves and they wouldn't like it if women had the vote in Britain,"" says Dr Mukherjee. ""The counter-argument was that there had been a female queen, Queen Victoria. She'd been Empress of the British Empire and most subjects hadn't kicked up a fuss about having an empress so why would they kick up a fuss about British women having a vote?"" There were also arguments much closer to home. Historical author Elizabeth Crawford says there was a genuine concern at the time that giving women the vote would ""destroy families"". ""They thought it would cause dissension in the home if a man wanted to vote conservative and his wife liberal,"" she says. The writer in The Queen magazine said the suffragettes were ""irresponsible"" in forcing the vote on wives and mothers. ""It is a vast upheaval of social institutions and habits, which must cut into the peace and well-being of families and harm the education of children,"" the article claimed. A leaflet from 1909,externalheld in The Woman's Library puts forward an argument that women have ""neither capacity nor leisure"" to vote. ""Women are more easily swayed by sentiment, less open to reason, less logical, keener in intuition, more sensitive than men,"" the writer claims. ""The qualities in which their minds excel are those least required in politics; their strong points are wasted or harmful there."" Both sides of the campaign produced artwork and slogans to promote their points of view. ""They [the anti-suffrage images] are portraying the suffragettes as being absolute harridans, slovenly housewives, appalling mothers, that they were ugly, that they looked like men, that they were lesbians,"" says Ms Atherton. ""It's very much like the Twitter campaigns that you get at the moment, whenever a high-profile woman says something of a feminist nature."" The Suffragists â were first to organise, forming local societies in the 1860s The Suffragettes â were active for just 10 years after splitting from the Suffragists in 1903 Suffragists â focused on middle-class women Suffragettes â encouraged working-class women to protest Suffragists â held public speaking events, lobbied MPs and wrote petitions Suffragettes â disrupted meetings, vandalised art and buildings and were often arrested Suffragists â dinner parties! Suffragettes â hunger strikes! Everyone organised marches! Suffragists â successfully built support in parliament over many years Suffragettes â increased publicity and re-energised the cause but also sparked a backlash Then in World War One, women took new roles in factories and beyond... ...which made denying them voting rights harder than ever After 50 years of women standing up and speaking out... Parliament finally passed a law giving some women the vote in 1918 Click next arrow to proceed Loading ... Swipe to progress  Prof June Purvis of the University of Portsmouth has collected many postcards printed with anti-suffrage messages and imagery. ""I was quite fascinated by these postcards because not many people have done research on them, and I thought they were telling a message of how difficult it was for women at that time to be taken seriously,"" she says. A number of the examples in her collection still have original writing on the back, many of which don't explicitly refer to the image on the front. ""In the early 20th century postcards were big business,"" says Prof Purvis. ""I think the people who bought them were sending a normal message [for example arranging to meet up], like how we now use email."" For Prof Purvis, one of the stand-out postcards shows a group of women, supposedly in the House of Commons, showing what a future with women in Parliament would be like. In the image, one woman is staring into a hand mirror, while another reads a book in the corner and yet another has brought her baby with her. ""That postcard really portrays the cultural fear at the time, that if women got the vote, they may then ask to be allowed to stand for Parliament and this is going to upset the whole gender order."" In November 1918 women were granted the right to stand for election for the first time.
