A bit more on the revelation from the Paradise Papers that Prince Charles campaigned to alter climate-change agreements without disclosing his private estate had an offshore financial interest in what he was promoting. On Tuesday, a spokesman for the Prince denied that Charles had spoken out
on the climate-change deals in order to benefit financially. ""The Prince has never chosen to speak out on a topic simply because of a
company that The Duchy may have invested in,"" he said.
 ""In the case of climate change his views are well-known, indeed he has been
warning of the threat of global warming to our environment for over 30 years."" The spokesman added that carbon markets were just one of many strategies
Charles had championed since the 1990s to try and slow the pace of climate change. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ithaca Energy set up a shell company on Bermuda in 2012 to buy its share in a $50m (Â£38m) North Sea oil production platform. In the leaked papers, Ithaca stated it was ""important"" to its tax position the company was controlled from Bermuda. Les Thomas, the chief executive of Ithaca, spoke to BBC reporter Mark Daly about the arrangement outside the firm's Aberdeen office. BBC News Channel Estonian Finance minister Toomas Toniste says there's ""strong support"" for a tax blacklist BBC correspondent Kevin Connolly says that if European finance ministers are going to pull together a list of tax havens and companies who are avoiding tax (see our post at 17.03), they must be prepared to act on it. He toldthe BBC News Channel:""There are obvious targets - the usual suspects sometimes
referred to in this sort of debate like those small Caribbean islands, like Panama and like other countries
like that where large amount of financial business are transacted, which are not related to the local
economy. ""It is one thing to produce a blacklist - pretty much anyone can do that - there is a huge question then about what you do
to those blacklisted companies and of course for the EU in particular, there are also issues over the tax arrangements that some member states have
made.""

Private equity firm Blackstone avoided tens of millions of pounds in UK taxes on property deals in Glasgow and London, the Paradise Papers show. The documents reveal it used offshore companies to purchase and operate the St Enoch Shopping Centre in Glasgow (pictured) and Chiswick Business Park in London.

Ryan MorrisonBBC News Online John Shenton, a Jersey tax expert, says the Paradise Papers story could harm the island's reputation. ""There is nothing to suggest anybody has done anything wrong, anybody has done anything illegal or Jersey has done anything wrong,"" he said. ""What you have is a perception - it is hard to change perception - that something isn't right here. ""Reputation matters a lot and it is very difficult if somebody sullies your reputation, it is hard to get it back,"" he added.

Queen's private estate invested offshore,"This video can not be played The Queen's private estate invested Â£10m in offshore funds About Â£10m of the Queen's private money was invested offshore, leaked documents show. The Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the Queen with an income, held funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda. A small amount ended up in the company behind BrightHouse, a chain accused of irresponsible lending, and Threshers, which went bust owing Â£17.5m in UK tax. The Duchy said the BrightHouse holding now equates to Â£3,208 and it was not involved in fund investment decisions. It added it had been unaware the stores featured in the investments. The chief finance officer of the Â£500m estate, Chris Adcock, told the BBC: ""Our investment strategy is based on advice and recommendation from our investment consultants and appropriate asset allocation... ""The Duchy has only invested in highly regarded private equity funds following a strong recommendation from our investment consultants."" A spokesperson for the Duchy of Lancaster added: ""We operate a number of investments and a few of these are with overseas funds. All of our investments are fully audited and legitimate. ""The Queen voluntarily pays tax on any income she receives from the Duchy."" Details about the Duchy's investments came to light in the Paradise Papers - a leak of 13.4m documents from companies including Appleby, one of the world's leading offshore law firms. The two funds were based in British overseas territories with no corporation tax and at the centre of the offshore financial industry. But the Duchy said it was not aware there were tax advantages to it from investing in offshore funds, adding that tax strategy was not a part of the estate's investment policy. The documents show the Duchy of Lancaster put Â£5m in the Jubilee Absolute Return Fund Limited in Bermuda in 2004, with the investment coming to an end in 2010. In 2005 the Duchy agreed to put $7.5m (Â£5.7m) in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP. Documents show the fund invested in medical and technology companies. The connection to rent-to-buy firm BrightHouse began in 2007 when the US company running the fund asked the Duchy to contribute $450,000 to five projects, including the purchase of the two UK High Street retailers. This included an interest in London-based private equity firm Vision Capital, the company which acquired 100% of BrightHouse and 75% of the owners of Threshers off licence chain. This video can not be played Labour MP Dame Margaret Hodge says she is furious with those who advise the Queen Under its new owners, Threshers' balance sheet was loaded with debt and it paid no corporation tax for two years.When the drinks retailer went bust in October 2009,external, almost 6,000 people lost their jobs. The majority of Vision Capital's BrightHouse investment later ended up in a company based in Luxembourg and it began paying less corporation tax in the UK. Last month,the UK's financial regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, said BrightHouse, which sells electrical goods and furniture predominantly to people on lower incomes via weekly installments,  had not acted as a ""responsible lender"" and ordered it to pay Â£14.8m compensation to 249,000 customers. The Duchy said its investment in the Cayman Islands fund is due to continue until 2019 or 2020 and amounts to 0.3% of the total value of the estate, while its interest in BrightHouse now equates to just 0.0006% of its wealth. The Duchy did not provide a figure for its interest in Threshers. Vision Capital said it ""complies with all laws and regulations and pays its tax in full and on time. Any suggestion to the contrary is wrong"". The Paradise Papers' revelations over the Queen's finances are certainly embarrassing. Many will also view the Duchy of Lancaster's offshore investments in BrightHouse and Threshers as dubious and inappropriate. However, it is not a question of tax avoidance, but of judgement on behalf of her advisers. The Queen is officially exempt from UK tax laws, but voluntarily pays her share of income tax on her Â£500m estate. It is extraordinary and puzzling that her advisers could have felt that it was appropriate - for somebody whose reputation is based so much on setting a good example - to invest in these offshore funds. There will be meetings and questions being asked within Buckingham Palace this morning as the monarchy finds its reputation tarnished by association. TheDuchy's 2017 annual report,externalsays it ""gives ongoing consideration regarding any of its acts or omissions that could adversely impact the reputation of the Duchy or Her Majesty The Queen"". Labour MP Margaret Hodge, the former chair of the Commons Public Accounts Committee, said she was ""pretty furious"" with the Queen's investment advisers, saying they were bringing her reputation into disrepute. ""It is so obvious that if you're looking after the money of the monarchy, you've got to be actually cleaner than clean and you must never go near the dirty world of money laundering, tax avoidance, tax evasion or actually making money in dubious ways,"" she said. The business model of BrightHouse has long come under the spotlight. Aparliamentary report in 2015,externalsaid the company was charging interest rates of up to 94%. One in five customers were in arrears and one in 10 purchases ended in repossession. In one case examined by MPs and Lords, a Samsung freezer cost Â£644 to buy in John Lewis but Â£1,716 under a five-year plan from the chain. BrightHouse was attracting attention at the time of the Duchy's investment - with theFinancial Times challenging its chief executive in November 2008 to respond to accusations,externalthat the chain was ""preying on the vulnerable"". The company maintains it is a responsible lender and through its 300 stores provides a services to millions of Britons who are unable to access up traditional lines of credit. BrightHouse told the Guardian newspaper it follows all relevant tax regulations and pays its tax in full and on time. Vision Capital announced it was acquiring the stakes in BrightHouse and Threshers,externalin June 2007. The offshore leaked documents show the Duchy of Lancaster was among 46 investors in the $312m Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP. In September 2007, investors were asked to pay 6% of their financial commitment into five investments, including ""Project Bertie"". The investors were told Project Bertie was formed to take an interest in a company set up by Vision Capital to ""acquire a portfolio of two retailers in the United Kingdom"". The Duchy of Lancaster's $450,000 commitment to the ""capital call"" is listed in the documents. Another document shows the investment in Jubilee Absolute Return Fund. Established more than 700 years ago, the Duchy of Lancaster has a commercial and residential property portfolio and financial investments. Its main purpose is to provide income for the Queen, who is known as the ""Duke of Lancaster"". Although the Duchy is not subject to tax, since 1993 the Queen has voluntarily paid tax on any income she receives. The Duchy's annual report and accounts include a summary of its holdings and financial performance and are put before Parliament. The offshore investments were not referenced in the reports but there is no requirement for specific details of the Duchy's holdings to be disclosed. Dave McClure, the author of a book about the wealth of the Royal Family, told the BBC ""pressure will grow on the Duchy to open up to proper parliamentary scrutiny by the National Audit Office, which they've resisted for decades. ""The solution to the problem might be just full disclosure, so everyone knows what investments they're investing in."" The Duchy said the Queen ""takes a keen interest in the Duchy's estates and tenants""  but ""appoints a chancellor and the Duchy Council to administer the affairs of Her Duchy. The chancellor delegates the oversight to the Duchy to the Council"". Investors in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP  made a commitment for a ""given period"" and are ""not party to its ongoing investment decisions"" or where money is ""ultimately invested"", it added. Asked whether the Duchy had other investments in offshore funds, it said it ""currently invests in a fund domiciled in Ireland"". TheChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster is a government minister,externaland sits in the cabinet, but plays a nominal role in running the estate. The current chancellor is Sir Patrick McLoughlin MP, the Chairman of the Conservative Party. At the time the Duchy initially invested in the Dover Street VI Cayman Fund LP in September 2005, its chancellor was Labour MP John Hutton. Ed Miliband was the chancellor of the Duchy at the time the call came to invest in the company taking over BrightHouse and Threshers. Coincidentally in 2016, the former Labour leader called for better regulation on buy-to-rent firms such as BrightHouse in a film for the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme. The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externaland then shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ).Panoramahas led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries.

Invasion 'only way' to disarm N Korea,"US soldiers take part in ""Warrior Strike"" exercises in South Korea in September A Pentagon assessment has declared the only way to completely destroy all parts of North Korea's nuclear weapons programme is through a ground invasion. Rear Admiral Michael Dumont expressed the opinion on behalf of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in a letter to Congressman Ted Lieu. Mr Dumont said calculating ""even the roughest"" potential casualty figures would be extremely difficult. He also gave some detail on what the first hours of a war would involve. ""The only way to 'locate and destroy - with complete certainty - all components of North Korea's nuclear weapons programs' is through a ground invasion,"" he wrote in response to Congressman Lieu's questions about a potential conflict. The risks involved included a potential nuclear counter-attack by North Korea while US forces attempted to disable its ""deeply buried, underground facilities"", he said. ""A classified briefing is the best venue for a detailed discussion,"" he added. The Joint Chiefs of Staff directly advise the president of the United States on military matters.

In a statement with more than a dozen other military veterans turned congressmen, Mr Lieu, a Democrat, said the assessment was ""deeply disturbing"" and warned that a conflict ""could result in hundreds of thousands, or even millions of deaths in just the first few days of fighting."" ""Their assessment underscores what we've known all along: there are no good military options for North Korea,"" the statement said. The letter was published as Donald Trump begins his mammoth tour of Asia, during which the North Korean threat is expected to be a major topic of discussion. Trump vows US resolve to Asian allies A beginner's guide to Trump in Asia Trump vows to tackle N Korea on Asia trip The president has previously said that if forced to defend the US or its allies, he ""will have no choice but to totally destroy North Korea."" ""The President needs to stop making provocative statements that hinder diplomatic options and put American troops further at risk,"" Mr Lieu's joint statement said. This video can not be played Trump: 'Rocket Man's suicide mission' Rear Admiral Dumont opened his letter with a clear indication that his office supported economic and diplomatic solutions ahead of any military action. Potential casualties from a conflict depended heavily on the intensity of any attack on South Korea's capital, Seoul, which lies just 35 miles (56 km) from the border, as well as how much advance warning the US and its allies had, he said. He said a counter-offensive from artillery battery fire and air strikes might help limit casualties. The Joint Chiefs also fear that Pyongyang would use biological weapons in a conflict, despite international conventions banning their use, as well as chemical weapons - which it has never agreed to abandon. ""It likely possesses a [chemical weapons] stockpile,"" the letter said. The assessment by military chiefs follows the release of a report from the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, which warned that even a brief conflict without the use of banned weapons could cost tens of thousands of lives.

Two people injured in vintage car crash,"The wreckage of the 1902 Benz can be seen on the bonnet of the Ford C-Max Six people were injured in a crash during the annual London to Brighton Veteran Car Run. The 1902 Benz was involved in a collision with three other cars at about 11:35 GMT at Reigate Hill, Surrey. It had been taking part in the annual parade of vehicles dating back to the early 20th Century. Two people from the Benz were taken to hospital with serious injuries. Two other people travelling in the car were taken to hospital with minor injuries, said Surrey Police. A Ford C-Max, a Mercedes-Benz GLE and a Fiat Fiorino were also involved in the crash. Two passengers from the Ford were taken to hospital with minor injuries. The Royal Automobile Club, which stages the veteran run, previously said it was the world's oldest motoring event. It commemorates the Emancipation Run in 1896, celebrating the Locomotives on the Highway Act which raised the speed limit from 4mph to 14mph and abolished the requirement for vehicles to be preceded by a man on foot. The Royal Automobile Club said it would be ""conducting a thorough review to identify any lessons which can be learnt from this accident"".

Ex-Catalan leader surrenders to police,"Carles Puigdemont fled to Belgium with four former regional ministers after Spain rejected Catalonia's independence referendum and imposed direct rule Catalonia's deposed leader Carles Puigdemont and four former advisers turned themselves in to Belgian police, says a prosecutors' spokesman. The five were freed late on Sunday evening after being questioned. An investigating judge will decide by Monday morning whether to execute an EU arrest warrant issued by a Spanish judge last week. Mr Puigdemont fled to Belgium after Madrid imposed direct rule on Catalonia following an independence referendum. He has said he will not return to Spain unless he is guaranteed a fair trial. He and his four associates are wanted on charges of rebellion, sedition, misuse of public funds, disobedience and breach of trust following the referendum which a Spanish court deemed unconstitutional. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia, dissolved the regional parliament and called local elections for 21 December. Catalonia's longest week The man who wants to break up Spain Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? Mr Puigdemont's associates who are also listed on the arrest warrant are Meritxell Serret (former agriculture minister), Antoni ComÃ­n (former health minister), LluÃ­s Puig (former culture minister), and Clara PonsatÃ­ (former education minister). From left to right, Meritxell Serret, Antoni ComÃ­n, LluÃ­s Puig and Clara PonsatÃ­ have also handed themselves in They all handed themselves in to Belgian federal police, accompanied by their lawyers, at 09:17 local time (08:17 GMT) on Sunday, said Gilles Dejemppe, a spokesman for Belgian prosecutors. They will be heard by the investigating judge who will then ""have 24 hours, until 09:17 on Monday, to decide whether to refuse the European Arrest [Warrant], arrest them, release them under conditions or grant bail"", Mr Dejemppe said. If the judge decides to go ahead and arrest them, Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the suspects to Spain. But if the suspects do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen much sooner. A country can reject an EU arrest warrant if it fears that extradition would violate the suspect's human rights. Discrimination based on politics, religion or race is grounds for refusal. So are fears that the suspect would not get a fair trial. There is an agreedEU list of 32 offences,external- in Article Two of the European Arrest Warrant law - for which there is no requirement for the offence to be a crime in both countries. In other words, any of those offences can be a justification for extradition, provided the penalty is at least three years in jail. However, neither ""sedition"" nor ""rebellion"" - two of the charges levelled against the Catalan leaders - are on that list. Sunday saw more protests in Catalonian cities against the detention of Catalan officials and activists held by the Madrid authorities. Students demand the release of detained Catalan pro-independence politicians and activists in Barcelona on Sunday Protesters plastered city squares with posters depicting the detainees as political prisoners. Eight politicians are being held in an investigation into alleged rebellion and sedition linked to Catalonia's unilateral declaration of independence. Two activists are being detained in a separate investigation. Meanwhile, Mr Puigdemont's nationalist Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT) said it wanted him to lead the party in the 21 December elections. It comes a day afterMr Puigdemont called for separatist parties to come together in a united frontto continue the push for independence in the poll.

Breaking|Breaking news,"This video can not be played Texas officials give details on church mass shooting At least 26 people have been killed and 20 others wounded after a gunman opened fire at a Texas church during a Sunday service. The attack happened at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, a small town in Wilson County. The victims' ages ranged from five to 72. The suspected gunman was later found dead in his vehicle some miles away. Police identified him only as a ""young, white male"" but US media named him as Devin Patrick Kelley, 26. Kelley is reported to have been discharged from the US air force in 2014 following a court martial for assaulting his wife and child. The motive for the killings was not immediately clear. A candlelit vigil was held for victims of the shooting in Sutherland Springs Texas Department of Public Safety regional director Freeman Martin said the attacker, dressed all in black and wearing a bulletproof vest, opened fire with a Ruger assault rifle outside the church at around 11:30 local time (17:30 GMT) and then went inside. As the gunman left the church, a local citizen grabbed his own rifle and began shooting at the suspect, who then dropped his weapon and fled in a vehicle. The citizen pursued the suspect, who eventually drove off the road and crashed his car at the Guadalupe County line. By Owen Amos, BBC News, Sutherland Springs At 01:30, Chris Speer was still sitting on his porch, sucking his cigarette in the dark. Fourteen hours earlier he was in the same place, with his 11-month-old son, when he heard ""close to 30 shots"". ""Your first instinct, you're out in the country, you think someone is shooting, practising,"" he says. ""But it was too close. I knew something wasn't right."" He took his son inside. ""If I could have got my gun, I would have,"" he says. ""But when you've got a kid in your hands, I'm not risking it. He wouldn't let go."" Mr Speer didn't know the attacker but he knew ""a lot"" of the victims. ""We're a small community. We band together. But what doesn't kill us makes us stronger."" Police found the man dead in his car but it is unclear if he died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound or from injuries received when fired on by the local citizen. The car contained several weapons. Mr Martin added: ""We have multiple crime scenes. We have the church, outside the church. We have where the suspect's vehicle was located. ""We have been following up on the suspect and where he's from. We have Texas Rangers at all the hospitals locating those and interviewing those who were injured."" One man has told how he chased the gunman after seeing ""two men exchanging gunfire"" outside the church. Speaking to local TV station Ksat.com,Johnnie Langendorff said a ""gentleman came and said we need to pursue him. And that's what I did, I just acted"",external. Mr Langendorff said the pair were driving at speeds of up to 95mph (153km/h) until the gunman lost control of his car and crashed. Governor Greg Abbott, confirming the death toll, said it was the worst mass shooting in the history of Texas. ""This will be a long, suffering mourning for those in pain,"" he said at a news conference on Sunday. The First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, told ABC News his 14-year-old daughter, Annabelle, was among those killed. Mr Pomeroy, who was in Oklahoma at the time of the attack, described her as ""one very beautiful, special child"" in a phone call to the television outlet. At least 10 victims, including four children, were being treated at the University Health System in nearby San Antonio,the hospital said in a tweet,external. The authorities could not confirm the names of any victims as they continued to work through the crime scene, Sheriff Joe Tackitt said. Officials said 23 people were found dead inside the church while two people were fatally shot outside. Another died in hospital, the authorities say. This video can not be played After the Las Vegas attack in October 2017 the BBC looked at how US mass shootings are getting worse One witness, Carrie Matula, told NBC News: ""We heard semi-automatic gunfireâ¦ we're only about 50 yards away from this church. ""This is a very small community, so everyone was very curious as to what was going on."" Sutherland Springs, which has a population of about 400, lies about 30 miles (50km) south-east of the city of San Antonio. This video can not be played A guide to the weapons available in the US and the rate at which they fire President Donald Trump, on a tour of Asia, said the gunman was ""a very deranged individual"" and denied that guns were to blame for the shooting. ""We have a lot of mental health problems in our country, but this isn't a guns situation,"" he said. This video can not be played Trump: 'We cannot begin to imagine the suffering' The shooting comes just a month after a gunman in Las Vegas opened fire on an outdoor music festival, killing 58 people and wounding  hundreds in the deadliest mass shooting in recent US history.

Growing number of MPs under scrutiny,"A number of MPs are being investigated over allegations about their past conduct towards women. Ex-ministers Daniel Poulter and Stephen Crabb are among Tory MPs to be referred to internal party inquiries. One cabinet minister, Sir Michael Fallon, has already resigned while others have denied claims against them and remain in office. Labour has suspended two MPs and is separately investigating an ex-official's allegation of rape. The parties have begun a series of investigations under newly constituted procedures into alleged inappropriate behaviour in response to a series of press reports in the last week. Other cases have been referred to the Cabinet Office and, in one case so far, to the police. Damian Green The First Secretary of State, who is Theresa May's effective deputy, is being investigated by the Cabinet Office over claims he ""fleetingly"" touched a female journalist's knee during a meeting in a pub in 2015 and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in a newspaper. Mr Green said any allegationthat he made sexual advances to Kate Maltby was ""untrue (and) deeply hurtful"". It has also been claimed that pornographywas found on the Ashford MP's computer during a 2008 police investigation into Home Office leaks which led the police to search Mr Green's Commons office. The ex-police officer who led the inquiry, Bob Quick, has said he will co-operate with the Cabinet Office probe. Mr Green said the allegations were ""false"", describing them as ""disreputable political smears"" and ""amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination"". Charlie Elphicke The MP for Doverhas been suspended by his party after ""serious allegations"" against him were referred to the police. He says he is not aware of what the alleged claims are and denies any wrongdoing. He has said it is a ""a denial of justice when people who have had allegations made against them, lose their job or their party whip without knowing what those allegations are"". Mark Garnier The international trade ministeris being investigated by the Cabinet Office for a potential breach of ministerial rules after he admitted asking his secretary to buy sex toys. The MP for Wyre Forest also confirmed he called her ""sugar tits"", but said it did not amount to harassment. He has since apologised to his constituents but told theKidderminster Shuttle,externalthat the remarks were reported out of context and did not amount to harassment. Daniel Poulter The MP, who represents Central Suffolk and North Ipswich, has been referred to the Conservative Party disciplinary committee after allegations in the Sunday Times. He said he ""denied all allegations of misconduct or inappropriate behaviour and will vigorously defend himself against any such claims"". The Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen told the BBC that he had made a formal complaint to party officials about Mr Poulter in 2010 which was not acted upon. Sir Michael Fallon The veteran Tory MP resignedas defence secretary on 1 November, saying his conduct ""fell short"" of the standards expected by the UK military. It followed a claim that he put his hand on female journalist Julia Hartley-Brewer's knee back in 2003. After his resignation, other claims have since emerged about his conduct, with journalist Jane Merrick disclosing that he tried to kiss her following a lunch in 2003. And Andrea Leadsom,the leader of the House of Commons, is reported to have complained to Downing Street about ""lewd"" comments that Sir Michael is alleged to have made, which he denies, while they were both members of the Treasury select committee. After he quit, Sir Michael - who is not under formal investigation - told the BBC that behaviour which had been ""acceptable 15, 10 years ago is clearly not acceptable now"". The BBC understands Sir Michael did not feel that he could necessarily account for every encounter in a long ministerial career without being able to guarantee no more revelations would emerge. Stephen Crabb The former Welsh secretary is being investigated by the Conservative Party over newspaper claims that hesent ""explicit"" text messagesto a 19-year-old woman after he interviewed her for a job in 2013. The MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire, who resigned from government last year amid reports that he had ""sexted"" another woman, has been referred to the party's disciplinary panel under the terms of its new code of conduct. Daniel Kawczynski The MP for Shrewsbury and Atcham has been referred to the party's internal disciplinary committee following media reports, first broadcast by Channel 4 News, that he tried to set up a date between a visitor and a Commons researcher. The MP told BBC Radio Shropshire there was no impropriety, saying he asked the woman to have coffee with a friend, she said no and that was the end of it. He has accused the media of a ""febrile witch hunt"". Chris Pincher Chris Pincher is the MP for Tamworth in Staffordshire The MP for Tamworth has stepped down as a government whip and referred himself to police following allegations about his conduct in 2001 made by a party activist and reported by a Sunday newspaper. Kelvin Hopkins The Luton North MP, 76,has been suspended after Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, said he sent her inappropriate text messages and made inappropriate physical contact at a student event in 2014. He says he ""absolutely and categorically"" denies the claims, describing instead what he said was a ""brief, slight hug just before getting into my car"". Labour says Mr Hopkins was informally reprimanded about his behaviour in 2015 but the party faces questions about how he was briefly promoted in 2016 to the role of shadow culture secretary. Jared O'Mara The Sheffield Hallam MPhas had the party whip withdrawn and is being investigated for allegedly posting a series of misogynistic and homophobic messages on social media. The 35-year-old apologised to Labour MPs for online remarks between 2002 and 2004, saying he had been on a ""journey"" since then. He has denied some more recent claims, including making offensive remarks to a woman he met on a dating app in a bar in Sheffield. Clive Lewis A formal complaint has been made against the Norwich South MP by a woman who says he groped her at the party's annual conference. The former shadow defence secretary is alleged to have hugged her and squeezed her bottom. Mr Lewis is ""vigorously"" disputing the allegation, telling the BBC ""it's just not how I roll, it's not what I do"". He suggested the encounter may have been ""misinterpreted"" and he would never have ""deliberately"" done what was alleged. Ivan Lewis Ivan Lewis said he had ""never made non-consensual sexual comments or sexual advances to women"" Labour isinvestigating a complaint made against the Bury South MP,who has been suspended by the party. Mr Lewis said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the move and ""strongly disputes"" the allegation. He had previously denied making any ""non-consensual sexual comments or sexual advances towards women"" after Buzzfeed News reported allegations that he had touched a woman's leg and invited her to his house at a Labour Party event in 2010. He has said he was sorry if his behaviour towards women he worked with had made anyone feel ""awkward"". Carl Sargeant Carl Sargeant was found dead four days after being sacked The Welsh Assembly member quitas secretary for communities and children in the Welsh government after allegations about his conduct. He urged a full inquiry to ""clear his name"" but wasfound deadfour days after he was sacked. It is understood he took his own life. An inquiry will look into how Wales's First Minister Carwyn Jones handled the allegations. Bex Bailey An independent investigation is under wayafter Labour activist Bex Baileysaid that she had been raped at a party event in 2011 and discouraged by a senior official from reporting the attack. Ms Bailey, who was 19 at the time, said she had been told reporting the matter might ""damage"" her career. Labour's response to the incident, which did not involve an MP, is the subject of an investigation by the QC Karon Monaghan. Monica Lennon The MSP said she was sexually assaulted by a senior male colleague at a party in 2013. She told the Sunday Mail she was groped at a social event in front of several witnesses. She said she made an initial complaint to Scottish Labour but decided not to progress with it because she felt she would not be believed. The SNP Mark McDonald MSP hasquit as childcare and early years ministerover previous actions which he said were considered ""inappropriate"". He is being investigated by the SNP for possible misconduct. It is understood the allegations are not criminal in nature.

Labour MSP 'groped' by colleague,"Monica Lennon believes ""at least half a dozen"" people witnessed the alleged sexual assault A Labour MSP has said she was sexually assaulted by a senior male colleague at a party. Monica Lennon told theSunday Mail,externalthat she was groped at a social event in 2013 in front of several witnesses. She said she made an initial complaint to Scottish Labour but decided not to progress it because she felt she would not be believed. Labour said it was working to improve the way it deals with sexual harassment complaints and safeguarding issues. Ms Lennon, 36, told the paper: ""It happened at a Labour Party social event in 2013, before I was an MSP. It was a private function, a room full of people. ""A man, who was a senior figure in the party, touched me in a manner that some would say is 'handsy'. He was sitting next to me when he groped me, in full view of other people. ""I don't want to go into the full details but he touched my body, in an intimate way, without invitation or permission. This shouldn't happen to anyone. ""It's possible at least half a dozen people saw exactly what happened. ""One man, who at the time was a Labour politician, joked to everyone in earshot, 'That's your fault for coming over here and getting him all excited'."" SNP minister quits over 'previous actions' Lawyer slams Holyrood harassment 'silence' Harassment in Westminster: the allegations and denials Ms Lennon, who was a South Lanarkshire councillor at the time, said the experience left her feeling humiliated, though she knew she was not at fault. The MSP added: ""A few days later I ran into another man who had seen what happened and he made a jokey reference to it. ""The underlying message was clear, the whole thing was to be treated as a joke. I felt disappointed, hurt, embarrassed and let down."" Another newspaper, the Sunday Post, reports that the SNP MSP, Willie Coffey was reported to Holyrood authorities six months ago after a civil servant complained about ""inappropriate language"" and ""unsolicited attention"". The Kilmarnock and Irvine Valley MSP denies the allegation and says he does not recognise the claims about his behaviour. Ms Lennon was elected to Holyrood in 2016 and is now Scottish Labour's spokeswoman on inequalities Ms Lennon is the most senior UK politician to say she has been the victim of sexual assault since the harassment scandal began to emerge in the last fortnight. She is the third member of Labour to claim she was not given enough support by the party. Labour activistBex Bailey said she was raped at a party eventand a senior Labour official discouraged her from reporting the attack. Ava Etemadzadeh, another Labour activist, claimedMP Kelvin Hopkins hugged her inappropriately after a student event in 2014. Mr Hopkins denies wrongdoing. Ms Lennon, who was elected to Holyrood in 2016, said she phoned Scottish Labour to report her alleged attacker's behaviour some time later. She added: ""I was asked if I wanted to make an official written complaint. I just felt like that wasn't really an option. I didn't feel I would be believed."" A Labour party spokesman said: ""The party takes all complaints of sexual harassment, abuse and discrimination extremely seriously. ""We ask that anyone with a complaint comes forward so that allegations can be properly investigated. When evidence of misconduct comes to light, all appropriate disciplinary action is taken in line with the party's rule book and procedures. ""The party has been working with its affiliates to develop procedures specifically designed to deal with complaints of sexual harassment and safeguarding issues in order to improve internal processes and make it easier to report concerns.""

Assembly harassment 'ignored',"This video can not be played Cathy Owens says a male politician once tried to get into bed with her The harassment of women in Welsh politics has gone on for some years, a former government advisor has said. Cathy Owens, who runs political consultancy agency Deryn, spoke out about the issue and said a politician once tried to get into bed with her while staying overnight at her house. She was speaking to Sunday Politics Wales about thesexual misconduct scandalengulfing Westminster. Welsh party leaders willdiscuss the issueat the Senedd on Tuesday. 'Politician put his hand on my thigh' Harassment: Welsh Assembly review ordered Ms Owens said party leaders had been told about inappropriate behaviour but no action had been taken, adding some male politicians were ""sexual predators"". She said: ""I was very early on in my career, this was an elected representative, I made clear that nothing was going to happen, he was staying in the spare room, and sometime later [I remember him] coming into my bedroom and trying to get into my bed. ""In another situation someone has come into the taxi that I'm going home in."" Ms Owens said action needed to be taken to tackle the harassment faced by women in Welsh politics, saying the parties did not have the right procedures in place. ""These aren't random men flirting with women,"" she said. ""Thankfully we are talking about a small number of men who have used their positions and are sexual predators, they have used their position in politics knowing that the parties will protect them."" This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said sexual harassment at the assembly ""must not be tolerated"" It comes as former AMs have also said the sexual harassment of women ""goes on all the time"" at the Welsh assembly. Ex-politicians raised concerns about ""a lack of procedures"" and of colleagues ""turning a blind eye to appalling behaviour"". The assembly said no formal sexual harassment allegations had been made against an AM. One former AM spoke of a researcher who claimed she had woken up to find a male former assembly member undressing her. The ex-AM also said they had to step in to physically stop a colleague from harassing another woman researcher. Another former AM said it was difficult to report inappropriate behaviour in the assembly because it is such a small organisation. ""When you see someone behaving inappropriately, you're likely to know that person,"" they said. ""We tolerated things we shouldn't and turned a blind eye... but there wasn't a clear procedure for dealing with problems."" Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said any allegations of sexual harassment at the assembly should be taken seriously and systems must be put in place to make sure such behaviour is not tolerated. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said Ms Owens' experience made him ""sick to the pit of his stomach"" and such actions must ""not be tolerated"" in the future. Labour said it had written to constituency secretaries and women's officers with specific guidance about reporting complaints of sexual harassment. Plaid Cymru said it had put new infrastructure in place to deal with complaints more quickly and was reviewing its internal protocols and considering how it could strengthen them. The Conservatives said they were ""actively working with colleagues across the party to ensure that all the appropriate safeguards are in place to protect staff from harassment in all its forms"". A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ""There are clear guidelines on how to make a complaint and in cases where the complainant doesn't wish to disclose their identity the pastoral care officer can act as the de facto complainant"". UKIP said it was reviewing its safeguarding procedures to ensure the protection of all who work with the party.

Corbyn: Promoting MP Hopkins 'reasonable',"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn 'knew Kelvin Hopkins was reprimanded' Jeremy Corbyn has defended his decision to appoint an MP to his shadow cabinet who had been reprimanded for allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The Labour leader said he was aware Kelvin Hopkins had been rebuked by the party's chief whip in 2015 after concerns raised by a young activist. But he said he thought the case had been ""closed"" and the promotion to his ministerial team was ""reasonable"". Mr Hopkins was suspended last week but denies claims of sexual harassment. The 76-year old MP has been accused by Ava Etemadzadeh of hugging her inappropriately after a student event in 2014 and subsequently making offensive comments during a visit to Parliament. Minister denies computer porn allegations Corbyn 'warned over harassment claim MP' MP Hopkins denies sexual harassment The 27-year-old activist, who said she later received an over-familiar message from the MP, did not make a formal complaint at the time after being told she would have to waive her anonymity to do so. But she reported the matter to an MP, who then informed the then chief whip Rosie Winterton, resulting in Mr Hopkins receiving a verbal reprimand in 2015. Labour's handling of the case has come in for criticism after it emerged that Ms Winterton expressed her reservations to the leadership about Mr Hopkins' appointment as shadow culture secretary in July 2016. Although he only served in the position for three months, at a time when Mr Corbyn was struggling to rebuild his frontbench after a mass walkout over his leadership, several MPs have suggested the move was a mistake. This video can not be played Ava Etemadzadeh said she felt ignored by the party Asked on Sunday whether it was appropriate to promote Mr Hopkins, Mr Corbyn said he could not ""discuss hindsight"" but he stood by his decision at the time. ""He had been reprimanded, the case had been closed... I thought it was reasonable to appoint him, albeit for a very short time, to shadow cabinet... All I can say is I took a decision based on what I knew at the time and he made a good contribution to the shadow cabinet during the short time he was there."" The whole matter must now be ""investigated and resolved,"" Mr Corbyn insisted. ""Now the case has been reopened and it will be looked at again. He has been suspended from party membership, which is the decision I took immediately I heard about the later revelations."" Ms Etemadzadeh has said she believed the party leadership had basically ""ignored"" her concerns and, in promoting Mr Hopkins, had effectively condoned his alleged behaviour - leaving her feeling disillusioned. Categorically denying any claims of harassment, Mr Hopkins said he had only ""put an arm around"" Ms Etemadzadeh at their first meeting and did not rub any part of his body against hers. The activist, he maintained, had given no indication at the time she was in any way upset. The Luton North MP, who has been in Parliament since 1997, said he did not recall subsequently asking her about her personal life, but said he did send a text message saying she was ""charming and sweet-natured"".

Minister denies computer porn allegations,"Damian Green said the allegations were from a ""tainted and untrustworthy source"" Theresa May's most senior minister has denied a claim that police found pornography on a computer in his office during a raid in 2008. First Secretary of State Damian Green said ex-police chief Bob Quick's claims inthe Sunday Times,externalwere ""completely untrue"" and ""political smears"". And he said police had never told him that any improper material had been found on a parliamentary computer. Mr Quick said he ""stood"" by the claim and would take part in an inquiry. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Chris Pincher has resigned as a government whip and referred himself to police following newspaper allegations about his conduct made by a party activist. The revelations are the latest in a growing sexual misconduct scandal in Westminster. Chris Pincher is the MP for Tamworth in Staffordshire On Sunday, further details emerged about allegations against Sir Michael Fallon, who this weekresigned as defence secretaryover his behaviour. Growing number of MPs under scrutiny Labour MSP 'groped' by senior colleague Crabb investigated over lewd text claim The Observer,externalreported that he quit shortly after journalist Jane Merrick told Downing Street he had lunged at her and attempted to kiss her on the lips in 2003 after they had lunch together. And Tory MPs Daniel Poulter, Stephen Crabb and Daniel Kawczynski have been referred to the Conservative Party disciplinary committee after media allegations about their conduct. The allegation regarding Mr Green, who is effectively the prime minister's deputy, relates to an inquiry into Home Office leaks which briefly led to his arrest in 2008. Daniel Poulter, Stephen Crabb and Daniel Kawczynski have faced questions about their professional conduct Former Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick said on Sunday that his officers had found pornographic material on a computer in Mr Green's Commons office after they searched it as part of their controversial investigation - which resulted in no charges. The ex-anti-terror chief said he had made an appointment to speak to a senior official in the Cabinet Office, which last week launched an inquiry into an unrelated allegation against Mr Green, to discuss the matter. ""I bear no malice to Damian Green,"" he told BBC News. Mr Quick,who quit his role in 2009,externalafter inadvertently revealing secret documents, accepted he had not asked officers to report the matter at the time, saying they ""didn't expect to find the material"" and were in the midst of a ""very difficult inquiry with a lot of pressure to drop the case"". This video can not be played Andrew Marr asked Home Secretary Amber Rudd whether the centre of government was close to collapse But Mr Green said ""the allegations about the material and computer, now nine years old, are false, disreputable political smears"", adding that they ""amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination"". The Cabinet Office inquiry was triggered after journalist Kate Maltby, who is three decades younger than Mr Green, told the Times he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee during a meeting in a pub in 2015 and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. Mr Green said any allegation that he made sexual advances to Ms Maltby was ""untrue (and) deeply hurtful"". Two Tory MPs, Anna Soubry and Heidi Allen, have urged Mr Green to step aside pending the outcome of the investigation but Home Secretary Amber Rudd said her cabinet colleague had the right to defend himself. ""I do think that we shouldn't rush to allege anything until that inquiry has taken place,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. More generally, she said abuse of power could not be tolerated and there needed to be a ""clearing out"" of Westminster to get rid of any such behaviour. What counts as inappropriate behaviour? Tories publish new code of conduct Welsh Assembly sexual harassment 'ignored' Meanwhile, Conservative MP Anna Soubry has said former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon was ""responsible for his own downfall"" amid fresh claims about his past behaviour. Ms Merrick told the Observer she ""shrank away in horror"" when Sir Michael tried to kiss her when she was a 29-year-old reporter at the Daily Mail. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says there must be change following recent revelations of sexual harassment ""I felt humiliated, ashamed. Was I even guilty that maybe I had led him on in some way by drinking with him?"" she said. ""After years of having a drink with so many other MPs who have not acted inappropriately towards me, I now know I was not."" Friends of Sir Michael have not denied the allegation, but the BBC understands that his ministerial career ended because he could not guarantee there would be no further revelations after he admitted repeatedly touching another journalist's knee at a conference dinner 15 years ago. Ms Soubry praised the journalist's ""outstanding bravery"" in coming forward and said she had put her in touch with Downing Street after Ms Merrick had confided in her and Labour's Harriet Harman. This video can not be played Jane Merrick ""outstandingly brave"" for speaking out about Sir Michael Fallon - Conservative MP Anna Soubry Theresa May, she added, must ensure an independent complaints system immediately so victims of harassment and those accused of misconduct did not have to undergo ""trial by newspapers"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said this must be a ""turning point"" for how the whole political class behaves, telling activists that his party - under fire for how it has handled harassment and rape allegations - was not afraid to ""shine a spotlight"" on itself. ""We must say, no more. We must no longer allow women, or anyone else for that matter, to be abused in the workplace or anywhere else,"" he said.

Woman's deliberate scratch snares burglar,"Annie-Laure Promonet managed to hang on to her laptop during the burglary A woman said she deliberately scratched a burglar while he was trying to steal her laptop in order to get his DNA. Annie-Laure Promonet, 42, found a man in her home in Watford, Hertfordshire, on 22 July and attempted to stop him. Police were able to take scrapings from under her fingernails and found traces of tissue from Marvyn Mulvey, 40.

Prosecutor Richard Jones told the court Ms Promonet had ""made it her aim"" to scratch Mulvey to obtain his DNA. After the hearing, Ms Promonet said: ""I thought I had to see his face, see if I could get his DNA, while all the time trying to memorise the clothes he was wearing. ""I didn't have time to panic. Maybe if I'd had a few more seconds then I would have realised it was a dangerous thing to do.""

Trump aide's links with sanctioned Russians,"Wilbur Ross has played a key part in Donald Trump's business and political careers A top member of Donald Trump's administration has business links with Russian allies of President Vladimir Putin who are under US sanctions, the Paradise Papers have revealed. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross has an interest in Navigator Holdings, which earns millions a year transporting gas for Russian energy firm Sibur. Two major Sibur shareholders are under some form of US sanctions. A commerce department spokesman did not dispute the revelations. ""Secretary Ross recuses himself from any matters focused on transoceanic shipping vessels,"" the spokesman told BBC Panorama, adding that the secretary ""works closely with Commerce Department ethics officials to ensure the highest ethical standards"". Another Sibur shareholder is President Putin's son in law, Kirill Shamalov. He holds a 3.9% stake in the firm. Gennady Timchenko, who has been individually sanctioned by the United States, has at least 12 companies connected to him, and Leonid Mikhelson, whose main company, Novatek, is also sanctioned, are major shareholders. Sibur itself and Mr Shamalov are not under sanctions, although Mr Shamalov's father, Nikolai, is. The commerce department spokesman said Mr Ross had never met the three Russian shareholders. The US imposed some sanctions after Russia annexed Crimea in 2014. Others were imposed last year for alleged interference in the US presidential election. The revelations will again raise questions about the Russian connections of Donald Trump's team. His presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of the election. He has called the allegations ""fake news"". A special counsel is investigating the matter. Wilbur Ross and Donald Trump have known each other for more than a quarter of a century. Mr Ross played a key part in a prepackaged bankruptcy deal - deal agreed between a company and its creditors - for Mr Trump's Atlantic City casino, the Taj Mahal, in the 1990s. Trump biographer David Cay Johnston told BBC Panorama: ""If it hadn't been for Wilbur Ross, Donald Trump would not be in the White House. WL Ross & Co, which was founded by Wilbur Ross, first invested in Navigator Holdings in 2011. An investigation has revealed details of how Mr Ross retains a financial interest in Navigator Holdings via a number of companies in the Cayman Islands. Some of these Cayman companies were disclosed by Mr Ross when he became commerce secretary, but under the disclosure rules he did not have to declare his interest in Navigator Holdings. Its annual report in 2016 showed 31.5% was still held by entities in which Mr Ross has a stake, although the value of Mr Ross's personal holding remains unclear. Donald Trump at the Taj Mahal casino in 1990 Back in 1990, after a high-profile financial battle, Donald Trump opened his third casino in Atlantic City - the Taj Mahal, dubbed the ""eighth wonder of the world"". It didn't go well. Mr Trump financed it with $675m raised through junk bonds at an interest rate of 14%. He struggled to make the payments. Step in Wilbur Ross. Then at Rothschild Inc, he was representing the angry bondholders but liked Donald Trump's style. Trump biographer David Cay Johnston said: ""Wilbur Ross was a key negotiator in Donald Trump not having to go through bankruptcy and not being swept into the dustbin of history because he saw the value in the Trump name."" Mr Ross said at this year's Concordia Annual Summit: ""When you meet people who are under tremendous financial pressure... you really get to see what they are made of, and he was made of much stronger stuff than a lot of owners of troubled businesses."" One prepackaged bankruptcy later and The Donald was on his way out of debt and heading up the Forbes rich list. Wilbur Ross became a board member of Navigator in 2012 but the commerce department said he was not on the board when Navigator signed its charter deal with Sibur that year. But Mr Ross was still a board member during the period from March to November 2014, when the US was sanctioning Russians over the annexation of Crimea, including Mr Timchenko and Mr Mikhelson's company, Novatek. During that period Navigator continued to increase its business with Sibur. The energy firm accounted for 9.1% of Navigator's total revenues in 2015, compared with 5.3% in 2014, Navigator's own filings show. Mr Ross left Navigator's board in November 2014 but his seat was taken by Ross group partner Wendy Teramoto, who served on it until 2017. Figures from 2016 showed Sibur was still among Navigator's top five clients, predominantly exporting Russian gas to Europe and potentially providing significant income to sanctioned Putin allies. This year, Navigator doubled the fleet it is using on Sibur exports to four. Sibur has provided Navigator with $68m (Â£49m) in revenue since 2014. This video can not be played Ex-US sanctions policy co-ordinator Daniel Fried on dealing with Russians There is no suggestion Mr Ross has violated any rules. But Daniel Fried, who oversaw the introduction of US sanctions against Russia under President Barack Obama, told Panorama that it would be a mistake for any American official to do business with Sibur. ""I would advise any client who came to me to stay well away from Sibur or anybody else who has been sanctioned or has a relationship with sanctioned individuals... on the grounds, at least, of reputational risk."" But Mr Ross appears to have maintained a close relationship with the shipping company. On the night that he was nominated as commerce secretary by President Trump, Mr Ross went to a restaurant in New York where he was congratulated on his promotion by the senior management of Navigator Holdings,Bloomberg reported,external. Mr Ross reportedly told the CEO of Navigator: ""Your interest is aligned to mine. The US economy will grow, and Navigator will be a beneficiary."" Another key Navigator customer has been PDVSA, the Venezuelan state oil company. It was targeted by US sanctions this year. The commerce department said Mr Ross had ""been generally supportive of the Administration's sanctions of Russian and other entities"".

Bringing it to heel is like taming a cat; not just a normal moggy - a thankless task in itself - but a Cheshire Cat: nebulous, hard to pin down, disappearing and reappearing when it likes. No-one can actually agree on what a tax haven is. Or even on the name: one person's tax haven is another's ""offshore financial centre"".  No-one can agree on how many there are. Nor on exactly how much money is stashed offshore. No statistics are fully reliable. And this suits those who operate in offshore finance, from the owner of the wealth to the lawyer or accountant middlemen who manage the funds, to the often sun-kissed beaches of the jurisdictions where they are secluded or pass through. The industry's key word is privacy. Or secrecy - a word it doesn't like so much. One adage cited by the taxation author and expert Nicholas Shaxson sums it up: ""Those who know don't talk. And those who talk don't know."" But do we really not know how much is stashed offshore? A report this September,  co-authored by the economist Gabriel Zucman, estimatesabout 10% of global GDP - the way we measure the size of the world's economy - is held offshore, about $7.8tn (Â£6tn),external. The Boston Consulting Group reported it last year at about $10tn. If you are thinking, wow, that's bigger than Japan's economy, you'd be right. But if you want a real wow, try $36tn - the estimate offered by James Henry, author of the book Blood Bankers. That's twice as big as the US economy. But no-one really knows. And here's another wow. Remember the slogan ""we are the 99%"" coined by the Occupy movement to lambast the top 1% of the population for their disproportionate share of wealth? Well, the Zucman report says 80% of all offshore cash is owned by 0.1% of the richest households, with 50% held by the top 0.01%. So if you read this and are thinking, if you can't beat them... quite frankly, it's unlikely you will ever join them. The management fees for the ordinary person will probably far outstrip the gains. As Nicholas Shaxson told BBC Panorama: ""At the very lowest end you'll have the middle classes doing little bits and pieces. But the large majority of what's going on, this is a game for rich people."" Surely we know some of how this works? The systems have a ring of familiarity - double taxation; tax inversion; trusts; shell companies etc. It's just we don't usually know who's in the schemes and what they are getting out of them. The basic essence is rerouting money in one location where you don't like the taxation rules to another location - one that is stable and reliable - where there aren't as many, or any. For example, if you want to protect your assets to stave off creditors, stick them in an offshore shell company. Hey presto, much harder to get at. Want to hide ownership of a property? Put it in a trust. This is not illegal. There are many other schemes, legal, illegal and sometimes ethically debatable. But even within these categories there are many variables on what actually constitutes The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. After all, in the film with that name the ugly arguably wasn't as bad as the bad, and the good was hardly perfect. True to their Cheshire Cat-like origins, offshore financial centres (OFCs) do not always appear where one might expect them. That's because offshore, sorry to confuse you, is also onshore. This makes it impossible to pin down the global number of OFCs. It could be 50, 70 or more and new ones come and go. The US and UK are arguably two of the biggest OFCs. For example, setting up shell firms is easy in some US states, like Delaware. And it's widely known that the City of London acts as the facilitating hub for Crown dependencies and overseas territories that channel trillions of offshore dollars. The smaller, often island, nations are what Nicholas Shaxson calls ""captured states"". This video can not be played Investigative journalist Nicholas Shaxson on why tax havens are âlike captured statesâ He told Panorama: ""These places don't have a very deep pool of experienced people. They're just people who say, well we trust the accountants, we trust the lawyers to tell us what's best for our island and we'll do it."" So how does offshore defend itself? Well, the jurisdictions say it's wrong to think there are banks in OFCs sitting on pots of gold - the money is simply being reinvested by companies - and that if there were no OFCs there would be no constraint on the tax rates governments might levy. OFCs, they say, simply pump cash around the globe and the new transparency rules put in place over the past decade have severely limited tax evasion. It's certainly wrong to lump all the OFCs together. Some are better regulated than others. Down at the murkier end,dealings in Panama were exposed by leaks last year. But Bermuda's Bob Richards offered a stout defence of its financial services in an interview with Panorama carried out while he was still finance minister, citing a taxation system that had been in place for more than 100 years and adding that if other nations were losing out on tax they should sort their own systems out. Bermuda, he says, has fully signed up to an international agreement that allows for the automatic transfer of tax information within governments and such a jurisdiction ""cannot be a tax haven"". And Appleby, the financial services firm involved in these latest leaks, made the case for OFCs back in 2009, in the wake of the global crash. This video can not be played Ex-Bermuda Finance Minister defends tax practices It said there was ""no evidence OFCs played any role in the economic crisis"",external,  OFCs were ""neither the source of - nor the destination for - criminal proceeds"" and that OFCs ""protect people victimised by crime, corruption, or persecution by shielding them from venal governments"". Of the latest leaks, the company said: ""Many of the questions raise matters where - on any view - there is plainly no conceivable wrongdoing on the part of Appleby whatsoever."" OFCs say there are no secrets, just privacy. But Gerard Ryle, of the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, which oversaw this huge leak of financial documents, known as theParadise Papers, dismisses this. ""The only product that the offshore world sells is secrecy and when you take away secrecy they don't have a product anymore,"" he told the BBC. ""Where you have secrecy, you have the potential for wrongdoing."" Whatever term you prefer, the elusive nature of offshore makes it hard to root out wrongdoing. You could start an investigation into one firm or individual and be shuttled around from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, company to company, turning up a whole tranche of names on documents that are linked to no real owner, sometimes no real person, and lead absolutely nowhere. You're probably also thinking, we've now had an awful lot of these financial leaks, haven't they changed anything? Spin backwards to April 2016. The Panama Papers have just come out. Iceland's PM Sigmundur Gunnlaugsson has resigned after the leaks showed he owned an offshore company with his wife. Thousands are demonstrating in Reykjavik to vent anger at their politicians. Some estimates put the protest numbers at 6% of the whole Icelandic population. That's like if 19 million people turned up to a protest in the US today. But then travel over to Elektrostal, two hours east of Moscow.Resident Nadezhda is haranguing BBC reporter Steve Rosenberg.""All these 'investigations' are a waste of time and money. We know what you're up to. They're trying to rub Putin's face in the dirt,"" she says. It kind of depends on where you are. Ragnar Hansson at the Iceland protest In the West, at least, people are questioning what high-net-worth individuals and multinationals can get away with. Is it right that they can use loopholes to keep more of their cash? Or should it go to governments to spend on their people? To be fair, governments have been tracking stashed cash since the 2008 global meltdown, independent of any financial leaks, although their talk has usually been tougher than their action. Secrecy is now harder to achieve, transparency is greater. So-calledcountry-by-country reporting, requiring multinationals to break down how they operate in different nations,external, has widened and public registries of companies have increased. Even Russia brought in a law requiring the disclosure of offshore assets. The result?Since the law came in three years ago, dozens of the super-rich have given up Russian residency to avoid it.,external There are also OFC blacklists mooted but, as Nicholas Shaxson says, the big players will make sure their operations are not on it and it will weed out only the minnows. The offshore firms will ""recalibrate"", he says. ""When legislation changes, you will have this ecosystem kind of readjusting and the money will shift to other places."" And wealth holders will readjust too. Pump cash into diamonds and artworks maybe? Or just go and actually live somewhere that charges low tax. What makes this a vicious circle is that many governments are fully prepared to sanction offshore finance. Indeed, many people in government use it, as these leaks show. And there is one thing we do know. If the super wealthy don't pay the taxes, the money has to come from everyone else. Which to many may sound a bit mad, but as the Cheshire Cat says: ""We're all mad here"". The papers are a huge batch of leaked documents mostly from offshore law firm Appleby, along with  corporate registries in 19 tax jurisdictions, which reveal the financial dealings of politicians, celebrities, corporate giants and business leaders. The 13.4 million records were passed to German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,externaland then shared with theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ).Panoramahas led research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations, including theGuardian,external, in 67 countries.

Ashcroft 'ignored rules' on offshore trust,"This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust Tory donor Lord Ashcroft ignored rules around the management of his offshore investments, leaked documents suggest. The peer gave assets worth hundreds of millions of dollars to the Punta Gorda Trust in Bermuda in 2000. The Paradise Papers suggests he sometimes made decisions without consulting trust officials. Such action could see the trust challenged by HMRC. Lord Ashcroft said he would not respond because of the way he has been treated by BBC Panorama in the past. Panorama approached Lord Ashcroft during last month's Conservative Party conference in Manchester but he declined to answer any questions about the trust. The 71-year-old former party deputy chairman has given millions of pounds to the Tories. He fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later he co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then prime minister but remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests. Journalist Peter Oborne says Lord Ashcroft has been a ""hugely significant figure"" in the Conservative Party over the last 20 years. He said: ""Lord Ashcroft has been one of the most significant donors to the... party. But it's not just... that he's been a giver of money, he's also been very important organisationally. He's involved himself in the internal politics."" Other documents in the Paradise Papersshow Lord Ashcroft has secretly remained non-domiciledin the UK for tax purposes. The structure of a trust involves one entity legally entrusting a second to look after assets for a third, essentially removing ownership for tax purposes. Wealthy people can legally avoid paying tax on assets that they have given to a trust because they can tell the authorities they no longer own or control the assets in them. But for a trust to work as a tax break, decisions about its assets have to be taken independently by the trustees. A series of leaked emails between trustees and Lord Ashcroft's advisers suggest he was was willing to ignore the rules. Despite the warning, Lord Ashcroft appears to have continued to make decisions about the Trust's assets. In October 2000, one of the trustees says: ""I would like to emphasize at this point that it is imperative at all times that the Trustees are aware of any and all transactions to be entered into prior to transactions occurring. ""To do otherwise, will only serve to undermine the integrity of the Trust as the Trustees are being advised of actions taken in connection with trust assets, which should be under their control, after the event."" A review of the trust in 2009, discovered that significant payments out had been made that had not been properly recorded. In an internal email, a lawyer representing the trust says: ""There have been very large sums of money involved and I am very concerned that there has been inadequate supervision of both transactions and distributions... to put it bluntly we seem to be told nothing whereas we carry the responsibility of acting as trustee."" Paperwork then appears to have been put in place retrospectively ""to ensure that we have all the relevant trustee and company authorities in place for the transactions which have occured [sic]"". Trust experts say anybody who puts their money into a trust could face a challenge by tax authorities if it was felt rules had been abused. Lord Ashcroft's trust was based in Bermuda This could include a challenge from HM Revenue & Customs if it was to take the view an overseas trust had been controlled from the UK. Nicholas Shaxson, the author of Treasure Islands, an expose of the workings of tax havens, told Panorama: ""On the evidence I have seen, it looks like something that is abusive behaviour and an abusive structure. If the trustees are worried, the trustees are expressing alarm about that, that's a clear red flag."" Professor Brooke Harrington, the author of Capital Without Borders, said: ""It's important that trustees be independent because the whole concept of a trust is that a settlor gives over legal ownership of an asset to the trustee. ""That's why you get these tax benefits and other legal benefits from the trust structure."" Lord Ashcroft's spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian newspaper as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures.

Who is in control of Everton?,"This video can not be played Paradise Papers: Who is in control of Everton? Questions have been raised in the leakedParadise Papersabout who controls Everton FC and whether Premier League rules have been broken. Farhad Moshirisold his Arsenal stake in 2016to buy nearly 50% of Everton. But the leaks suggest his original Arsenal stake was funded by a ""gift"" from oligarch Alisher Usmanov, who owns 30.4% of Arsenal, raising the question of whether his money is now in Everton. Mr Moshiri strenuously denied the money was a gift. Lawyers acting for him in the Everton deal said any allegation Premier League rules had been violated were wholly false. They say Mr Moshiri is independently wealthy and funded the football investments himself. Mr Usmanov's legal representatives said there were errors in the allegations and that the investigation was a gross intrusion into their client's privacy. Premier League rules state an individual who owns a stake of 10% or more in one club cannot hold a single share in another, to avoid any conflict of interest, including in games between the clubs and in transfers. Officially Mr Usmanov and Mr Moshiri, the oligarch's former accountant, bought a 14.58% stake in Arsenal together in 2007 through an offshore company called Red and White Holdings. But the documents show that all the funds for the purchase of the Arsenal shares came from a firm called Epion Holdings, a company wholly owned byMr Usmanov, who is currently said to be worth about $15.8bn (Â£12bn),external. This video can not be played Panorama questions Farhad Moshiri on the Everton deal One document reads: ""Dividend from Gallagher Holdings to Alisher Usmanov who will then gift the monies to Moshiri who will in turn invest in the company. Funding for Red and White has come from Epion Holdings Limited"". Gallagher Holdings is also an Usmanov company. Lawyers acting for Mr Moshiri originally denied that the money had come from Epion. They later admitted the initial funding had come from Epion, but said Mr Moshiri had subsequently paid Mr Usmanov back. Red and White Holdings continued to raise its stake in Arsenal, reaching 30.4%. In February 2016, Mr Moshiri sold his half of the Arsenal shares to the Russian oligarch. A document in the Paradise Papers from Appleby, the firm overseeing due diligence on the deal, confirms the sale was used to raise funds to buy a 49.9% stake in Everton. The reported price was Â£87.5m. A Russian media company with close links to Mr Usmanov initially reported the Everton deal as ""Russian businessman Alisher Usmanov has become the new owner of Everton"". The report was soon taken down but suspicions were aroused. The suspicions rose further this January whenit was announced Everton's training ground, Finch Farm, was now being sponsored by Mr Usmanov's company, USM Holdings. The training ground has been renamed USM Finch Farm. When BBC Panorama approached Mr Moshiri and asked him whether Mr Usmanov was in control of Everton, he asked: ""Are you crazy? Have you seen a psychiatrist?"" He said: ""If it is a loan, you owe the money back to him. If it is a gift, it is yours. It is neither of them because I paid for it."" This video can not be played Ex-FA chairman Greg Dyke on how the Premier League may respond Mr Moshiri later said that all the documents that mentioned a gift were ""a mistake"". Mr Moshiri's legal representatives said the Premier League had carried out checks, including on its funding, and was satisfied that he had complied with its Owners' and Directors' Test. They also said that Mr Moshiri, who is said by Forbes magazine to be worth $2.4bn, had subsequently provided considerably more finance to Everton. Former FA chairman Greg Dyke told Panorama that a gift ""sounds unusual"", adding: ""If these papers say what you say they say, I feel sure that the Premier League will want to do their own investigations."" And shadow culture minister Tom Watson has said he will be writing to the Premier League to urge them to investigate. The outcome of any investigation would depend on what the two men did and what the clubs knew. When asked about the matter, the Premier League said it ""would not disclose confidential information about clubs or individuals"". The Everton deal was administered by Isle of Man company Bridgewaters Limited. Other documents in the Paradise Papers suggest that Bridgewaters was secretly taken over by Mr Usmanov in 2011. This is strongly denied by Bridgewaters and Mr Usmanov. Blue Heaven Holdings, the company that owns Everton, has its registered office at Bridgewaters and its two directors are an employee of Bridgewaters and an employee of Mr Usmanov's company, USM Holdings.

They said: ""Our client is not obliged at all to assist you in your enquiries. It is not for him to do your journalists' research which on its face appears to be biased."" In May,Mr Usmanov failed in a Â£1bn bid to buy out major Arsenal shareholder Stan Kroenke, a move that would have left him with about 97% of Arsenal shares. Mr Usmanov is known to be frustrated at his inability to influence Arsenal and has no seat on the board. Both clubs have had their problems on the pitch. Many Arsenal fans have questioned whether manager Arsene Wenger should continue given the recent lack of league titles, while Everton sacked boss Ronald Koeman after a poor start to the season. The teams met at Goodison Park on 22 October, with Arsenal running out 5-2 winners.

Ashcroft stayed non-dom despite pledgesAshcroft 'ignored rules' on offshore trust,"Lord Ashcroft remained a non-dom, and continued to avoid tax despite attempts by Parliament to make peers pay their full share, leaked documents reveal. The peer was domiciled for tax purposes in Belize at a time when it was widely believed he had given up the status, the Paradise Papers show. While ordinary Britons have to pay tax on everything they earn, non-doms are only taxed on their UK income. Lord Ashcroft, who donated millions to the Tories, said he would not comment. He said it was because of the way he had been treated by BBC Panorama in the past. But his spokesman, Alan Kilkenny, is quoted in the Guardian newspaper as saying the peer had never engaged in tax evasion, abusive tax avoidance or tax avoidance using artificial structures. When questions were raised about the peer's non-dom status in 2010, he denied any ""impropriety or wrongdoing"". A former party treasurer and deputy chairman, Lord Ashcroft fell out with David Cameron in 2010 and later co-authored a controversial unauthorised biography of the then prime minister. But the 71-year-old remains involved in UK politics through his polling and publishing interests andlast year said he would start donating ""smaller sums""to the party again. Ashcroft 'ignored rules' on offshore trust Parliament tried to force the controversial peer to pay full British tax when he entered the House of Lords in 2000. Lord Ashcroft  promised to become a permanent resident in the UK - a change that would have meant giving up his status as a UK resident whose permanent home, or domicile, is outside of the country. The then leader of the Conservative Party William Hague told Parliament that becoming a peer would ""cost him [Lord Ashcroft] and benefit the Treasury tens of millions of pounds a year in tax"". This video can not be played Watch Lord Ashcroft try to avoid Richard Biltonâs questions about his offshore trust The tax was never paid because Lord Ashcroft, who was once Belize's ambassador to the United Nations and maintains links to the central American country, persuaded officials that he should be allowed to become a long term resident of the UK rather than a permanent one. A distinction that allowed him to retain his non-dom status. The leaked documents show that between 2000 and 2010, Lord Ashcroft received payments of around $200m (Â£150m) from his offshore trust in the Bermuda. The Tory Peer continued to sit in the House of Lords and as a non-dom he did not have to pay tax on these payments. Lord Ashcroft's admission in 2010 that he was still a non-dom led to a major political controversy and the introduction of legislation designed to force anybody who sits in Parliament to pay full British tax. After Lord Ashcroft told the BBC in May 2010 he was going to become ""a fully taxed person in Britain"",  it was widely reported he had given up his non-dom status. TheConservative Party also gave such an indication,externalon 7 July that same year. However, documents seen by the BBC's Panorama, reveal ""his true domicile is Belize"". The new law, theConstitutional Reform and Governance Act,external,  had not specified that non-dom MPs and peers would have to give up the status - only that they be ""treated as domiciled in the UK"" by the tax authorities. It meant Lord Ashcroft had to pay full British tax while he sat in Parliament, but as soon as he resigned from the House of Lords in March 2015 he was also a non-dom again in the eyes of UK revenue inspectors. The Paradise Papers suggest Lord Ashcroft worked around the new law to continue avoiding tax on his worldwide income between 2010 and 2015. On the 31 March 2010, the day before the new law came into effect, Lord Ashcroft's offshore trust bought shares worth Â£33.9m from one of his companies. His advisers note that the deal has ""capital gains tax implications"" but they point out he is ""not domiciled in the UK at the moment"". If the deal had happened the following day, he would have been treated differently and could have been liable for capital gains tax. Lord Ashcroft with William Hague and Ffion Hague in 2006 While he was sitting in the Lords as a full British taxpayer between 2010 and 2015, Lord Ashcroft appears to have stopped taking payments from his offshore trust. One of his advisers notes ""that there is no applicable tax as there is no distributable income"". The accounts for the trust show Lord Ashcroft didn't receive any payments in 2011, 2012 or 2013. The accounts for 2014 and 2015 were not in the leaked documents. Lord Ashcroft announced his resignation,externalfrom the House of Lords in March 2015. A week later, he sold shares worth Â£11.2m. If he had still been sitting in Parliament, he would have been liable for capital gains tax on any profits from the sale. But Lord Ashcroft was being treated as a non-dom again and could legally avoid the tax. Journalist Peter Oborne says Lord Ashcroft's non-dom status was a ""huge issue"" at the time he started to sit in the Lords and there was ""fresh controversy"" when the Tories entered power in 2010. The revelations in the Paradise Papers could cause a ""major political explosion,"" he said.  ""The Labour Party... will turn it into a first class political row. It will raise huge questions about not just the Conservatives [but] also the House of Lords."" The Conservative Party did not respond to the BBC's request for comment.

"Tax haven secrets of ultra-rich exposedA huge new leak reveals how the wealthy and powerful, including the Queen's private estate, invest offshore.3m4 minutes agoUK","The leaks show about Â£10m of the Queen's private money was invested offshore A huge new leak of financial documents has revealed how the powerful and ultra-wealthy, including the Queen's private estate, secretly invest vast amounts of cash in offshore tax havens. Donald Trump's commerce secretary is shown to have a stake in a firm dealing with Russians sanctioned by the US. The leak, dubbed theParadise Papers, contains 13.4m documents, mostly from one leading firm in offshore finance. BBC Panorama is part of nearly 100 media groups investigating the papers. Follow live updates As with last year's Panama Papers leak, the documents were obtained by the German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external, which called in theInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists,external(ICIJ) to oversee the investigation. TheGuardian,externalis also among the organisations investigating the documents. Sunday's revelations form only a small part of a week of disclosures that will expose the tax and financial affairs of some of the hundreds of people and companies named in the data, some with strong UK connections. Many of the stories focus on how politicians, multinationals, celebrities and high-net-worth individuals use complex structures of trusts, foundations and shell companies to protect their cash from tax officials or hide their dealings behind a veil of secrecy. This video can not be played Paradise Papers: How to hide your cash offshore The vast majority of the transactions involve no legal wrongdoing. Other key stories released on Sunday were: A key aide of Canada's PM has been linked to offshore schemes that may have cost the nation millions of dollars in taxes, threatening to embarrass Justin Trudeau, who has campaigned to shut tax havens.Read the full story here Lord Ashcroft, a former Conservative party deputy chairman and a significant donor, may have ignored rules around how his offshore investments were managed.Read the full story hereOther papers suggest he retained his non-dom status while in the House of Lords, despite reports he had become a permanent tax resident in the UK.Read the full story here How questions were raised about the funding of a major shareholding in Everton FC.Read the full story here An oligarch with close links to the Kremlin, Alisher Usmanov, may have secretly taken ownership of a company responsible for anti-money laundering checks on Russian cash.Read the full story here The other media partners may be covering different stories affecting their regions. The Paradise Papers show that about Â£10m ($13m) of the Queen's private money was invested offshore. It was put into funds in the Cayman Islands and Bermuda by the Duchy of Lancaster, which provides the Queen with an income and handles investments for her Â£500m private estate. There is nothing illegal in the investments and no suggestion that the Queen is avoiding tax, but questions may be asked about whether the monarch should be investing offshore. There were small investments in the rent-to-buy retailer BrightHouse, which has been accused of exploiting the poor, and the Threshers chain of off-licences, which later went bust owing Â£17.5m in tax and costing almost 6,000 people their jobs. The Queen's private estate had a very small investment in the retailer BrightHouse The Duchy said it was not involved in decisions made by funds and there is no suggestion the Queen had any knowledge of the specific investments made on her behalf. The Duchy has in the past said it gives ""ongoing consideration regarding any of its acts or omissions that could adversely impact the reputation"" of the Queen, who it says takes ""a keen interest"" in the estate. The BBC's royal correspondent Nicholas Witchell says it is extraordinary and puzzling that the Queen's advisers could have felt that it was appropriate - for somebody whose reputation is based so much on setting a good example - to invest in these offshore funds. Questions will now be being asked inside Buckingham Palace about how that decision was made, he added. Read the full story here Wilbur Ross helped stave off bankruptcy for Donald Trump in the 1990s and was later appointed commerce secretary in Mr Trump's administration. The documents reveal Mr Ross has retained an interest in a shipping company which earns millions of dollars a year transporting oil and gas for a Russian energy firm whose shareholders include Vladimir Putin's son-in-law and two men subject to US sanctions. It will again raise questions about the Russian connections of Donald Trump's team. His presidency has been dogged by allegations that Russians colluded to try to influence the outcome of last year's US election. He has called the allegations ""fake news"". Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal has called for an investigation,telling NBC News that Mr Ross had given Congress the impression,externalhe no longer held shares in the shipping company. ""Our committee was misled, the American people were misled by the concealment of those companies."" Read the full story here Opposition politicians have said thegovernment must stop ""dragging its feet""and curb the use of offshore tax havens, and Labour Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell has called for a public inquiry. But at the CBI conference on Monday, Prime Minister Theresa May did not commit to a public inquiry. She also did not directly answer when asked whether she would insist on British overseas territories publishing a list of who owns companies and trusts registered in crown dependencies. She said the UK government was working with its dependences ""to ensure we're seeing greater transparency."" Most of the data comes from a company called Appleby, a Bermuda-founded legal services provider at the top end of the offshore industry, helping clients set up in overseas jurisdictions with low or zero tax rates. Its documents, and others mainly from corporate registries in Caribbean jurisdictions, were obtained by SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. It has not revealed the source. The media partners say the investigation is in the public interest because data leaks from the world of offshore have repeatedly exposed wrongdoing. In response to the leaks, Appleby said it was ""satisfied that there is no evidence of any wrongdoing, either on the part of ourselves or our clients"", adding: ""We do not tolerate illegal behaviour.""Read the Appleby story here Essentially it's about a place outside of your own nation's regulations to which companies or individuals can reroute money, assets or profits to take advantage of lower taxes. These jurisdictions are known as tax havens to the layman, or the more stately offshore financial centres (OFCs) to the industry. They are generally stable, secretive and reliable, often small islands but not exclusively so, and can vary on how rigorously they carry out checks on wrongdoing. The UK is a big player here, not simply because so many of its overseas territories and Crown dependencies are OFCs, but many of the lawyers, accountants and bankers working in the offshore industry are in the City of London. It's also about the mega-rich. Brooke Harrington, author of Capital Without Borders: Wealth Managers and the One Percent, says offshore finance is not for the 1% but the .001%. Assets of around $500,000 (Â£380,000) would just not meet the offshore fees the schemes would need, she says. Are we taming offshore? Well, it is a lot of cash. The Boston Consulting Group says $10tn is held offshore. That's about the equivalent of the gross domestic products of the UK, Japan and France - combined. It may also be a conservative estimate. This video can not be played Labour MP Meg Hillier: âIf offshore wasnât secret then this stuff couldnât happenâ Critics of offshore say it is mainly about secrecy - which opens the door to wrongdoing - and inequality. They also say the action of governments to curb it has often been slow and ineffective. Brooke Harrington says if the rich are avoiding tax, the poor pick up the bill: ""There's a minimal amount the governments need to function and they recoup what they lose from the rich and from corporations by taking it out of our hides."" Meg Hillier, UK Labour MP and chair of the Public Accounts Committee, told Panorama: ""We need to see what's going offshore; if offshore was not secret then some of this stuff just couldn't happen... we need transparency and we need sunlight shone on this."" Your guide to a history of financial leaks The offshore financial centres say that if they did not exist, there would be no constraint on taxes governments might levy.

"Corbyn: Promoting MP Hopkins 'reasonable'Labour's leader says it was ""reasonable"" to give Kelvin Hopkins a job despite concerns over his conduct.6m6 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn 'knew Kelvin Hopkins was reprimanded' Jeremy Corbyn has defended his decision to appoint an MP to his shadow cabinet who had been reprimanded for allegations of inappropriate behaviour. The Labour leader said he was aware Kelvin Hopkins had been rebuked by the party's chief whip in 2015 after concerns raised by a young activist. But he said he thought the case had been ""closed"" and the promotion to his ministerial team was ""reasonable"". Mr Hopkins was suspended last week but denies claims of sexual harassment. The 76-year old MP has been accused by Ava Etemadzadeh of hugging her inappropriately after a student event in 2014 and subsequently making offensive comments during a visit to Parliament. Minister denies computer porn allegations Corbyn 'warned over harassment claim MP' MP Hopkins denies sexual harassment The 27-year-old activist, who said she later received an over-familiar message from the MP, did not make a formal complaint at the time after being told she would have to waive her anonymity to do so. But she reported the matter to an MP, who then informed the then chief whip Rosie Winterton, resulting in Mr Hopkins receiving a verbal reprimand in 2015. Labour's handling of the case has come in for criticism after it emerged that Ms Winterton expressed her reservations to the leadership about Mr Hopkins' appointment as shadow culture secretary in July 2016. Although he only served in the position for three months, at a time when Mr Corbyn was struggling to rebuild his frontbench after a mass walkout over his leadership, several MPs have suggested the move was a mistake. This video can not be played Ava Etemadzadeh said she felt ignored by the party Asked on Sunday whether it was appropriate to promote Mr Hopkins, Mr Corbyn said he could not ""discuss hindsight"" but he stood by his decision at the time. ""He had been reprimanded, the case had been closed... I thought it was reasonable to appoint him, albeit for a very short time, to shadow cabinet... All I can say is I took a decision based on what I knew at the time and he made a good contribution to the shadow cabinet during the short time he was there."" The whole matter must now be ""investigated and resolved,"" Mr Corbyn insisted. ""Now the case has been reopened and it will be looked at again. He has been suspended from party membership, which is the decision I took immediately I heard about the later revelations."" Ms Etemadzadeh has said she believed the party leadership had basically ""ignored"" her concerns and, in promoting Mr Hopkins, had effectively condoned his alleged behaviour - leaving her feeling disillusioned. Categorically denying any claims of harassment, Mr Hopkins said he had only ""put an arm around"" Ms Etemadzadeh at their first meeting and did not rub any part of his body against hers. The activist, he maintained, had given no indication at the time she was in any way upset. The Luton North MP, who has been in Parliament since 1997, said he did not recall subsequently asking her about her personal life, but said he did send a text message saying she was ""charming and sweet-natured"".

Saudi princes held in 'corruption' purge,"Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is among those held The heir to the throne in Saudi Arabia has consolidated his hold on power with a major purge of the kingdom's political and business leadership. A new anti-corruption body, headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, detained 11 princes, four sitting ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire with investments in Twitter and Apple, is among those held. Separately King Salman replaced the national guard and the navy chiefs. The new anti-corruption committee has the power to issue arrest warrants and travel bans. Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said the status of the detainees would not influence ""the firm and fair application of justice"", AFP news agency reports. Saudi broadcasterAl-Arabiya said fresh investigations had been launched,externalinto the 2009 Jeddah floods and the outbreak of the Mers virus which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 - but analysts see the detentions as a clear move by the crown prince to strengthen his power base. Who is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? End of Saudi women driving ban reflects deep changes in society Saudi Arabia profile Analysis by Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The events of Saturday night in Saudi Arabia are nothing short of seismic for that country. In a bold, pre-planned move, the 32-year old Crown Prince has removed the final obstacles to his gaining total control over the world's richest oil producer and home to the holiest shrines in Islam. Presented to the world as an anti-corruption drive, the arrests of princes, ministers and the billionaire tycoon Prince Alwaleed bin Talal have shocked Saudis unused to sudden change. The crown prince is largely popular, especially amongst young Saudis, but many older, more conservative citizens think he is moving too far too fast. He has started an unwinnable war in Yemen while still fighting the extremists of so-called Islamic State. He has also backed a damaging boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar. But his supporters hail his efforts to modernise Saudi Arabia and, after decades of rule by old men, they welcome a fresh vision from a man who could well be king for the next 50 years. The owner of London's Savoy hotel isone of the richest men in the world, with a net worth of $17bn (Â£13bn),externalaccording to Forbes. Shares in Kingdom Holding, the investment firm owned by the prince, plunged 9.9% in early trade on the Saudi stock market after news of his detention emerged. The firm is one of Saudi Arabia's most important investors. Apart from Twitter and Apple, it has shares in Citigroup bank, the Four Seasons hotel chain and ride-sharing service Lyft. The Saudi prince made the news in the past for employing women, who make up two-thirds of his staff. But he was also known for his hundred-million-dollar desert resorts, where he employed dwarves for entertainment purposes. Two years ago he offered luxury cars to fighter pilots participating in a bombing campaign in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition continues to bomb Houthi rebels, killing 26 people in an attack on a  hotel and market on Wednesday. Profile: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal The Saudi prince who offered Bentleys to bombers Saudis 'intercept missile' near capital Prince Alwaleed once bought control of a hotel and a yacht from Donald Trump, when he had yet to enter politics, but clashed with him publicly on Twitter in 2015 over his decision to stand for president,the New York Times notes,external.

National guard minister Prince Miteb bin Abdullah and navy commander Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan were both replaced, with no official explanation given. Prince Miteb bin Abdullah has been replaced as head of the powerful national guard Prince Miteb, son of the late King Abdullah, was once seen as a contender for the throne and was the last member of Abdullah's branch of the family in the highest echelons of Saudi government. Those reported to have been detained include: Former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of the Saudi Aramco oil company Economy Minister Adel Fakieh Former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah Former head of the royal court Khalid al-Tuwaijiri Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the Saudi Binladin construction group, and brother ofOsama bin Laden Some of the detainees are being held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, sources in contact with the government told Reuters news agency. Few people outside Saudi Arabia had heard of Prince Mohammed bin Salman before his father became king in 2015. But since then, the 32-year-old has become the most influential figure in the world's leading oil exporter Last year, the crown prince unveiled a wide-ranging plan to bring social and economic change to the oil-dependent kingdom. The anti-corruption committee was formed by royal decree and is headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman He recently said the return of ""moderate Islam"" waskey to his plans to modernise Saudi Arabia. Addressing an economic conference in Riyadh, he vowed to ""eradicate the remnants of extremism very soon"".

"UK 'misled' over Iraq War, says BrownUS intelligence was not shared before the UK joined the fight, the former PM says in his memoir.17h17 hours agoUK","The UK was misled over former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's access to weapons of mass destruction, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown says US intelligence, which challenged the extent of Iraq's WMD stockpile, was not shared with the UK before it joined the Iraq War. In an extract from his memoir, the ex-Labour leader says ""we were not just misinformed, but misled"". Mr Brown says he became aware of the ""crucial"" paper after leaving office. The Iraq War - which divided British public opinion - began in March 2003, with the conflict and its aftermath claiming the lives of 179 UK troops. The UK joined the US-led invasion after both countries jointly accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having links to terrorism. Chilcot report: Findings at-a-glance Who is Gordon Brown?,external What Blair said to Bush in memos British intelligence from 2002, seen at the time by the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and Mr Brown, suggested the country was capable of having such weapons. ""I was told they knew where the weapons were,"" Mr Brown writes. ""I remember thinking at the time that it was almost as if they could give me the street name and number where they were located."" But, Mr Brown says a report commissioned at the time by the then-US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ""forcibly challenged"" this view. He said it suggested other intelligence had relied ""heavily on analytic assumptions"" rather than hard evidence, and disproved Iraq's capability to make weapons of mass destruction. ""If I am right that somewhere within the American system the truth about Iraq's lack of weapons was known, then we were not just misinformed but misled on the critical issue,"" he writes in My Life, Our Times. Tony Blair ordered UK troops into battle in March 2003 A seven-year inquiry into the UK's involvement in the Iraq War found Saddam Hussein posed ""no imminent threat"" when the US and UK invaded. The Chilcot report also concluded that ""flawed"" intelligence started the war. According to Mr Brown, the UK may never have agreed to take part if the information had been shared. ""Given that Iraq had no usable chemical, biological or nuclear weapons that it could deploy and was not about to attack the coalition, then two tests of a just war were not met: war could not be justified."" Despite this, he did say some action was required due to the failure of Saddam Hussein complying with UN resolutions.

Psychiatrist vacancies on the increase,"Mental health is becoming more of a priority on the health agenda One in 10 consultant psychiatrist roles is currently unfilled in NHS organisations in England, says areport by the Royal College of Psychiatrists.,external It says the number of unfilled posts has doubled in the past four years. Wales is also struggling to fill posts, with vacancies of 9%, while Scotland and Northern Ireland have vacancy rates of 6% and 2% respectively. The college called the vacancies ""frankly alarming"" and said they increased waiting times for patients. Prof Wendy Burn, from the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the current situation meant patients might be waiting months to see a psychiatrist, during which time they could be getting worse. She said it was ""a scandal"" because if you had cancer you would expect to see a cancer specialist. ""Patients won't get the care they need. Some will have been plucking up the courage to go to their GP, and then there is no-one to see them when they are referred,"" she said. Prof Burn said the rise in vacancies was down to the difficulty in recruiting psychiatrists. At the same time, more posts were being created for consultant psychiatrists as mental illness moved up the health agenda, but there were no specialists to fill them, she said. She said medical schools need to broaden their pool of applicants in order to get more psychiatrists into the workplace. ""We are keen that medical schools should take in people studying psychology A-level - because they will be more likely to end up as psychiatrists."" It takes 13 years to train as a consultant psychiatrist. The report found the situation was worst for psychiatrists in England who specialise in treating children or older people. In both specialities, the vacancy rates doubled from roughly 6% in 2013 to 12% in 2017. The findings are supported by a recent review by the Care Quality Commission which found young people are facing long waiting times and unequal access to mental health services. Saffron Cordery, from NHS Providers, said the shortages were ""deeply worrying"". ""The government's laudable ambition to improve mental health services will only be realised if we have the right workforce with the right skills in the right place."" The Welsh Government said there was a need for more doctors to choose psychiatry as a specialty. It said it was spending more on mental health services than any other part of the NHS.

Brexit 'threat to UK broadcast jobs',"TV firms may have to move some operations abroad if there is no Brexit trade deal, the body for international broadcasters in the UK has warned. It says thousands of jobs could potentially be at stake in the event of a ""hard "" Brexit, where the UK leaves the EU with no formal trade agreement. The Commercial Broadcasters Association (COBA) speaks for media networks such as Eurosport, Disney and Discovery. The government says it ""will work to get the right deal for broadcasters"". The UK dominates Europe's broadcasting sector, due to the availability of skilled employees and English being the dominant language in the industry. Thanks to the country of origin principle, hundreds of international media organisations based in the UK can broadcast to anywhere in the EU. All you need to know about Brexit Creative sector warns of Brexit threat Business bodies call for Brexit clarity Adam Minns, executive director of COBA, estimates that one in four jobs in the UK broadcasting sector is working exclusively, or in part, on an international channel. He also says there is more than Â£500m a year invested in wages, overheads and technology. ""No [trade] deal would jeopardise the UK's status as Europe's leading international broadcasting hub,"" says COBA. ""International broadcasters based here would, reluctantly, be forced to restructure their European operations. No deal would put at risk thousands of jobs in the UK broadcasting sector, hundreds of millions of pounds of investment every year, and would undermine the sector's long-term global competitiveness. ""Like many sectors, broadcasters cannot wait until the cliff edge of March 2019 to make decisions about the future of their European businesses."" Media watchdog Ofcom recently said that Brexit was now one of the biggest challenges facing the sector. Meanwhile, Amsterdam and Dublin are just two of the cities hoping to attract broadcasters. However, the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""The UK is currently the EU's biggest broadcasting hub, and the sector makes an important contribution to our thriving creative industries. ""During our negotiations with the EU we will work to get the right deal for broadcasters and will support their continued growth in the UK.""

Detained Briton made 'an honest mistake',"Laura Plummer and her partner Omar A British woman who has been detained in Egypt for bringing nearly 300 Tramadol tablets into the country made ""an innocent, honest mistake"", according to her brother. Laura Plummer, from Hull, was transporting the pills for her Egyptian partner who suffers from back pain. It is illegal to supply prescription drugs and Ms Plummer, 33, could face up to 25 years in jail. Her local MP Karl Turner said the Foreign Office was now involved. He said the British Embassy has provided a lawyer - Ms Plummer's third since she was detained at Hurghada International Airport on suspicion of drug trafficking on 9 October. Ms Plummer's family has been told she could face up to 25 years in prison, or even the death penalty. Her brother James Plummer told BBC Radio 5 live that Ms Plummer was visiting her husband of 18 months on ""just a routine holiday"". She reportedly sees him between two and four times a year. It is not clear, however, whether the marriage is official. Ms Plummer's brother said she had taken some Tramadol with her to treat her husband's back pain He said that Laura, a shop assistant, had told a colleague about her partner's back pain and the work colleague replied that she could get some tablets from her GP. ""They were prescribed to a friend of hers,"" he said. ""So she took those over with her,"" Mr Plummer said. ""Laura didn't even check what they were, she didn't even know there was Tramadol in the bag. There was also Naproxen as well."" Mr Turner said Ms Plummer had brought the tablets to Egypt along with a number of other goods. ""It is difficult to get certain things in Egypt apparently so she'd taken talcum powder, shaving gel and razor blades and all sorts of things,"" he said. ""Clearly, [she was] very, very naÃ¯ve."" Tramadol is the most abused drug in Egypt, according to Ghada Wali, the country's Minister of Social Solidarity. In August, she said that the Drug Control Fund, which she chairs, received the most calls about Tramadol on its free helpline - which overall received 48,000 calls between January and June. Ms Plummer is now being held in jail where Mr Turner said she is sharing a cell with between 20 to 30 other women. Mr Turner said: ""The family describe Laura to me as somebody who is very naÃ¯ve. ""Her father said to me 'look, the truth is she wouldn't know Tramadol from a Panadol. She wouldn't have a clue that she was doing something unlawful'."" He said that a British Embassy representative has been visiting Ms Plummer regularly and has been in touch with her family. Despite the severe overcrowding in Egyptian jails, Mr Turner said: ""Her family said to some extent it is better that she's with lots of people in a cell than in a cell on her own because people are around her. ""But the conditions are going to be extremely basic and I'm sure she's petrified by what is unfolding before her.""

Saudi princes held in 'corruption' purgeBillionaire businessman Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is among dozens of senior figures detained.29m29 minutes agoMiddle East,"Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is among those held The heir to the throne in Saudi Arabia has consolidated his hold on power with a major purge of the kingdom's political and business leadership. A new anti-corruption body, headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, detained 11 princes, four sitting ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire with investments in Twitter and Apple, is among those held. Separately King Salman replaced the national guard and the navy chiefs. The new anti-corruption committee has the power to issue arrest warrants and travel bans. Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said the status of the detainees would not influence ""the firm and fair application of justice"", AFP news agency reports. Saudi broadcasterAl-Arabiya said fresh investigations had been launched,externalinto the 2009 Jeddah floods and the outbreak of the Mers virus which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 - but analysts see the detentions as a clear move by the crown prince to strengthen his power base. Who is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? End of Saudi women driving ban reflects deep changes in society Saudi Arabia profile Analysis by Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The events of Saturday night in Saudi Arabia are nothing short of seismic for that country. In a bold, pre-planned move, the 32-year old Crown Prince has removed the final obstacles to his gaining total control over the world's richest oil producer and home to the holiest shrines in Islam. Presented to the world as an anti-corruption drive, the arrests of princes, ministers and the billionaire tycoon Prince Alwaleed bin Talal have shocked Saudis unused to sudden change. The crown prince is largely popular, especially amongst young Saudis, but many older, more conservative citizens think he is moving too far too fast. He has started an unwinnable war in Yemen while still fighting the extremists of so-called Islamic State. He has also backed a damaging boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar. But his supporters hail his efforts to modernise Saudi Arabia and, after decades of rule by old men, they welcome a fresh vision from a man who could well be king for the next 50 years. The owner of London's Savoy hotel isone of the richest men in the world, with a net worth of $17bn (Â£13bn),externalaccording to Forbes. Shares in Kingdom Holding, the investment firm owned by the prince, plunged 9.9% in early trade on the Saudi stock market after news of his detention emerged. The firm is one of Saudi Arabia's most important investors. Apart from Twitter and Apple, it has shares in Citigroup bank, the Four Seasons hotel chain and ride-sharing service Lyft. The Saudi prince made the news in the past for employing women, who make up two-thirds of his staff. But he was also known for his hundred-million-dollar desert resorts, where he employed dwarves for entertainment purposes. Two years ago he offered luxury cars to fighter pilots participating in a bombing campaign in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition continues to bomb Houthi rebels, killing 26 people in an attack on a  hotel and market on Wednesday. Profile: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal The Saudi prince who offered Bentleys to bombers Saudis 'intercept missile' near capital Prince Alwaleed once bought control of a hotel and a yacht from Donald Trump, when he had yet to enter politics, but clashed with him publicly on Twitter in 2015 over his decision to stand for president,the New York Times notes,external.

National guard minister Prince Miteb bin Abdullah and navy commander Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan were both replaced, with no official explanation given. Prince Miteb bin Abdullah has been replaced as head of the powerful national guard Prince Miteb, son of the late King Abdullah, was once seen as a contender for the throne and was the last member of Abdullah's branch of the family in the highest echelons of Saudi government. Those reported to have been detained include: Former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of the Saudi Aramco oil company Economy Minister Adel Fakieh Former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah Former head of the royal court Khalid al-Tuwaijiri Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the Saudi Binladin construction group, and brother ofOsama bin Laden Some of the detainees are being held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, sources in contact with the government told Reuters news agency. Few people outside Saudi Arabia had heard of Prince Mohammed bin Salman before his father became king in 2015. But since then, the 32-year-old has become the most influential figure in the world's leading oil exporter Last year, the crown prince unveiled a wide-ranging plan to bring social and economic change to the oil-dependent kingdom. The anti-corruption committee was formed by royal decree and is headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman He recently said the return of ""moderate Islam"" waskey to his plans to modernise Saudi Arabia. Addressing an economic conference in Riyadh, he vowed to ""eradicate the remnants of extremism very soon"".

"UK 'misled' over Iraq War, says Brown","The UK was misled over former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's access to weapons of mass destruction, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown says US intelligence, which challenged the extent of Iraq's WMD stockpile, was not shared with the UK before it joined the Iraq War. In an extract from his memoir, the ex-Labour leader says ""we were not just misinformed, but misled"". Mr Brown says he became aware of the ""crucial"" paper after leaving office. The Iraq War - which divided British public opinion - began in March 2003, with the conflict and its aftermath claiming the lives of 179 UK troops. The UK joined the US-led invasion after both countries jointly accused Saddam Hussein of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having links to terrorism. Chilcot report: Findings at-a-glance Who is Gordon Brown?,external What Blair said to Bush in memos British intelligence from 2002, seen at the time by the then-Prime Minister Tony Blair and Mr Brown, suggested the country was capable of having such weapons. ""I was told they knew where the weapons were,"" Mr Brown writes. ""I remember thinking at the time that it was almost as if they could give me the street name and number where they were located."" But, Mr Brown says a report commissioned at the time by the then-US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ""forcibly challenged"" this view. He said it suggested other intelligence had relied ""heavily on analytic assumptions"" rather than hard evidence, and disproved Iraq's capability to make weapons of mass destruction. ""If I am right that somewhere within the American system the truth about Iraq's lack of weapons was known, then we were not just misinformed but misled on the critical issue,"" he writes in My Life, Our Times. Tony Blair ordered UK troops into battle in March 2003 A seven-year inquiry into the UK's involvement in the Iraq War found Saddam Hussein posed ""no imminent threat"" when the US and UK invaded. The Chilcot report also concluded that ""flawed"" intelligence started the war. According to Mr Brown, the UK may never have agreed to take part if the information had been shared. ""Given that Iraq had no usable chemical, biological or nuclear weapons that it could deploy and was not about to attack the coalition, then two tests of a just war were not met: war could not be justified."" Despite this, he did say some action was required due to the failure of Saddam Hussein complying with UN resolutions.

Anger over US coal role at climate talks,"Representatives of US coal companies are due to present at this year's climate talks The latest round of UN led climate talks have opened in Bonn with delegates from almost 200 countries in attendance. Over the next two weeks, negotiators hope to clarify the rulebook of the Paris climate agreement. It is the first major meeting since President Trump announced plans to take the US out of the Paris pact last June. Many delegates are unhappy with White House plans to promote fossil fuels here as a ""solution"" to climate change. An adviser to the president is expected to take part in a pro-coal presentation in the second week of this conference, which is  officially known asCOP23,,external Separately, a group of governors will say that the US is still committed to climate action despite Mr Trump's rejection of the Paris agreement. US quits Paris climate pact Five effects of US pullout from Paris climate deal Under the rules, the US cannot leave the agreement until 2020 so they have sent a team of negotiators to this meeting. President Trump declared in June that the US would withdraw from the ""unfair"" Paris pact The official US delegation, mainly career civil servants, may well be overshadowed, though, by other groups with very different visions for how the US should combat climate change. According to reports, members of the Trump administration will lend their support to an event to promote fossil fuels and nuclear power as solutions to climate change. Speakers from coal giant Peabody Energy, among others, will make a presentation to highlight the role that coal and other fuels can play in curbing the impacts of rising temperatures. A White House spokesman said in a statement that the discussion aimed to build on the administration's efforts to promote fossil fuels at the G20 meeting this year. ""It is undeniable that fossil fuels will be used for the foreseeable future, and it is in everyone's interest that they be efficient and clean,"" the spokesman said. The prospect of fossil fuel industries making their case at this meeting has angered some who will be attending. ""Fossil fuels having any role in tackling climate change is beyond absurd. It is dangerous,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development. ""These talks are no place for pushing the fossil fuel agenda. The US needs to come back to the table and help with the rapid cuts in emissions that the situation demands."" Long-time talks participant Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists added: ""It's not a credible solution, but that doesn't seem to bother them. ""They might even welcome some of the reaction to show to their base that they are fighting for America's interest and not this globalist malarkey."" Environmentalists point to the contradiction of the Trump administration championing fossil fuels while an authoritativeNational Climate Assessment report,external, released on the eve of COP23, is clear that CO2 from these fuels is the key cause of climate change. US climate report at odds with some in Trump team The report says: ""It is extremely likely that human activities, especially emissions of greenhouse gases, are the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century. For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence."" Other groups opposed to the Trump perspective will also be paying for a large pavilion at the talks. Fiji, which is chairing this year's talks, has experienced the impacts of extreme weather Delegations of US governors, mayors and business people, under theWe Are Still In coalition umbrella,external, will be in Bonn to tell negotiators that below the Federal level, much of America still supports the Paris agreement. The US Climate Alliance, which represents 14 states and one territory, says that it speaks for around 36% of the US population and if it were a nation state would be the third biggest economy in the world. One of the governors who will be on the ground in Bonn is Washington's Jay Inslee. ""We need to make sure that the world maintains confidence in our ability to move forward,"" he told reporters. ""So far, not one single nation state, city or county, municipality or school district have followed Donald Trump into the ranks of surrendering to climate change since he pulled out of Paris - his decision has energised our efforts."" This determination to remain part of Paris is also being reflected at city level in many parts of the US. ""Whatever 'America first' is supposed to mean, it absolutely does not mean America alone,"" said Mayor Lionel Johnson from the city of St Gabriel in Louisiana. ""My fellow mayors and I stand united and we stand with the international community to pursue solutions to the dramatic climate challenges we are facing together. Count us in!"" Apart from the confusion over who is speaking for the US, the talks will focus on establishing rules and guidelines for the Paris pact. These need to be agreed by the end of 2018. The talks are being chaired by Fiji, which is the first time a small island developing state has taken this role. As such, questions of climate impacts are likely to be in the spotlight, including the tricky question of loss and damage. This is a potential area of significant disagreement as the richer countries are strongly opposed to any implied legal liability for the damages caused by climate related extreme weather events. Around 20,000 delegates and visitors will attend the meeting over two weeks.

SNP minister quits,"A Scottish government minister has resigned over previous actions which he said were considered ""inappropriate"". Mark McDonald, the SNP MSP for Aberdeen Donside, said he was stepping down from his role as childcare and early years minister. He apologised and said his attempts to be ""humourous"" or ""friendly"" may have led others to become uncomfortable. He is one of two SNP members currently being investigated by the party over possible misconduct. It is understood the allegations against him are not criminal in nature. The other complaint being investigated by the SNP does not relate to a parliamentarian. Harman: ""This is not a witch hunt"" Westminster harrassment - allegations and denials In a statement he said: ""It has been brought to my attention that some of my previous actions have been considered to be inappropriate - where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behaviour might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions. ""My behaviour is entirely my responsibility and I apologise unreservedly to anyone I have upset or who might have found my behaviour inappropriate. ""In light of my position in government, I believe it would not be appropriate for me to continue to serve in my role in the Scottish government at this time and I have tendered my resignation as a minister. ""I hope that in taking this step neither any particular woman or my family will be the  focus of undue and unwarranted scrutiny. ""It has been an honour to serve in the Scottish government and I will continue to serve my constituents in Aberdeen Donside to the best of my ability."" A cross party meeting has been held at Holyrood to discuss improved ways of tackling sexual harassment A former Aberdeen City councillor, Mark McDonald was elected as a list MSP at Holyrood in 2011 and became a constituency MSP when he won the Aberdeen Donside by-election in 2013, following the death of Brian Adam. The 37-year-old was responsible fora members bill on high hedge disputes, which passed unanimously at Holyrood. He was appointed a minister in May 2016. Earlier this week First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Deputy First Minister John Swinney both warned men - including those in the SNP - to reflect on their behaviour as allegations of sexual harassment reached Holyrood. A spokesperson for the first minister said: ""Mark has taken the right action in apologising and recognising that in his current role it would be inappropriate for him to remain in government. ""He will continue to make a valuable contribution to parliament as the MSP for Aberdeen Donside. ""As the deputy first minister told parliament earlier in the week it is right that men take responsibility for their behaviour and it is to Mark's credit that he has done so."" A confidential phone line has been launched and an anonymised survey is to be carried out to determine the extent of sexual harassment at the Scottish Parliament. The measure was announced after Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh held an urgent meeting with representatives from each party including Nicola  Sturgeon. A Scottish government spokesperson said Mr McDonald tendered his resignation to the first minister on Saturday. ""The education secretary is responsible for all aspects of the education portfolio including those led by the minister for childcare and early years. The first minister will appoint a new minister in due course,"" the spokesperson added.

Call to cut beer duty 'to save pubs',"Beer duty should be cut by a penny in this month's Budget to help save pubs from closing, the British Beer and Pub Association (BPA) has said. It comes as sales of beer in the UK's pubs, bars and restaurants have fallen by the biggest margin for five years. The BPA said 35 million fewer pints of beer were sold in British pubs, bars and restaurants in the three months to September, compared with a year ago. In March,beer duty increasedby 2p a pint, the first rise in five years. Chancellor Philip Hammond will deliver his next Budget on Wednesday 22 November. The BPA warned that pubs will continue to close if the trend continues, blaming ""sky high"" business rates - particularly in London and the South East, where prices are higher still. Chief executive Brigid Simmonds said: ""When the government was cutting or freezing beer duty from 2013-15, sales of British beer stabilised, after years of steep decline. ""Beer has had a 39% tax rise in the past decade. With tax rates 14 times higher than in Germany, these levels are unsustainable."" While the number of breweries in Britain is up almost two-thirds in the past five years, the number of pubs continues to fall and is down 17% since 1996. Many are preferring to drink at home, with sales in supermarkets having overtaken those in pubs. The averageprice of a pint in the UK is now Â£3.60- up by 13p on 2016 - according to the Good Pub Guide. ""We need fair taxes for British beer, so that brewers and pub operators can invest in thriving pubs, and take advantage of new opportunities to export more beer around the world as we leave the EU,"" Mr Simmonds added.

"UK 'misled' over Iraq War, says BrownUS intelligence was not shared before the UK joined the fight, the former PM says in his memoir.11h11 hours agoUK","The UK was misled over former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein's access to weapons of mass destruction, former Prime Minister Gordon Brown has said. Mr Brown says US intelligence, which challenged the extent of Iraq's WMD stockpile, was not shared with the UK before it joined the Iraq War. In an extract from his memoir, the ex-Labour leader says ""we were not just misinformed, but misled"". Mr Brown says he became aware of the ""crucial"" paper after leaving office. The Iraq War - which divided British public opinion - began in March 2003, with the conflict and its aftermath claiming the lives of 179 UK troops.

But, Mr Brown says a report commissioned at the time by the then-US Defence Secretary Donald Rumsfeld ""forcibly challenged"" this view. He said it suggested other intelligence had relied ""heavily on analytic assumptions"" rather than hard evidence, and disproved Iraq's capability to make weapons of mass destruction. ""If I am right that somewhere within the American system the truth about Iraq's lack of weapons was known, then we were not just misinformed but misled on the critical issue,"" he writes in My Life, Our Times. Tony Blair ordered UK troops into battle in March 2003 A seven-year inquiry into the UK's involvement in the Iraq War found Saddam Hussein posed ""no imminent threat"" when the US and UK invaded. The Chilcot report also concluded that ""flawed"" intelligence started the war. According to Mr Brown, the UK may never have agreed to take part if the information had been shared. ""Given that Iraq had no usable chemical, biological or nuclear weapons that it could deploy and was not about to attack the coalition, then two tests of a just war were not met: war could not be justified.""

Stray fireworks injure 14 at display,"This video can not be played Fireworks shot towards the crowd at the display Fourteen people were injured at a bonfire event when fireworks malfunctioned and shot into the crowd. The display at the Antrobus Hotel in Amesbury, Wiltshire, on Saturday night was cancelled soon afterwards. A number of young children were among the 14 people injured, who were all treated at the scene. Wiltshire Council said the authority was investigating what happened at the display and would be liaising with the hotel. The Health and Safety Executive said it would only investigate if the council decided it was appropriate. The hotel said ""a single display box, containing multiple fireworks, malfunctioned"" and said it called an end to the display as soon as it happened. In a statement, it added: ""Regrettably, despite the safety cordon exceeding the manufacturer's guidelines, some projectiles ejected towards the crowd line.

""I thought that ain't right and then another one flew straight into the crowd."" Mr Foote said it had felt overcrowded and nobody was counting numbers on the door. ""There was a lot of panic and kids crying, it was quite scary,"" he added. ""We were crammed in and all we could do was turn our backs and shield our faces.""

Thousands join town's bonfire festivitiesAn effigy of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un was paraded through the streets of Lewes.1han hour agoSussex,"This video can not be played The annual celebration is one of the largest in the UK Tens of thousands of people joined bonfire celebrations in the East Sussex town of Lewes, despite measures to lower attendance. People had been warned by police not to go unless they were from the town. Roads were closed hours before the start of event, and train services were suspended within a five-mile radius. Sussex Police said about 80 people were treated for injuries, mostly minor. Officers made five arrests and issued three dispersal orders by 01:30 GMT. Ch Supt Neil Honnor said the arrests were for drink-driving, failing to comply with a dispersal order, possession of a knife and an assault. Police said it was thought about 60,000 people had attended the event. The force did say crowd numbers were an estimate because there was no official count. But Ch Supt Honnor said: ""That's far too many for crowd safety purposes."" An effigy of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un was paraded through the streets Members of Lewes' bonfire societies marched the town's narrow streets as the fireworks went off The annual celebration is one of the largest of its type in the UK Before the event, one of the groups involved agreed to tone down its costumes, after the leader of dance troupe Zulu Tradition, booked to perform at this year's event,said they were ""incredibly offensive"". Members of Lewes Borough Bonfire Society traditionally wear black face paint and extravagant accessories for the parade. Some locals have backed the group, commenting the tradition of painting faces had been going on for years.

She is to meet counterparts in the US government to discuss the issue. The tech companies have said they are doing their utmost to keep their young users safe. During Ms Rudd's trip she will attend a roundtable discussion joined by tech companies including Google, Facebook and Microsoft. The home secretary will welcome work that has been done to tackle online child sexual abuse, but will also say that more needs to be done at a ""far greater pace"" across the technology industry. Rudd to techies: Stop patronising us Message encryption a problem - Rudd Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday, Ms Rudd said: ""We've seen the real growth of child sexual exploitation internationally, and we're going to make sure that we work with the Americans to take action against it. ""We need to make sure [tech companies] put their technical know how into addressing it. ""Particularly working with smaller platforms where children go to game online, to meet each other; there are paedophiles working there. ""We need to make sure that internet companies work with us, in partnership, to change this."" Ms Rudd's comments come as new government figures show there was a 700% increase in the number of indecent images identified on technology company servers and flagged to law enforcement agencies between 2013 and 2017. Each month there are more than 400 arrests for indecent images of children offences in the UK and some 500 children are being protected from online sexual exploitation, the government said. Ms Rudd will also raise concerns about the use of messaging websites and apps, as well as video and image apps and websites, during her trip.

Iran rejects Lebanon PM's claims,"Mr Hariri's resignation opens up great uncertainty in Lebanon Iran says the surprise resignation of Lebanese Prime Minister Saad al-Hariri is part of a plot to stoke tensions in the region. An adviser to Iran's supreme leader accused the US and Saudi Arabia of being behind the move. Mr Hariri, in a televised broadcast from Saudi Arabia, accused Iran of sowing ""fear and destruction"" in several countries, including Lebanon. He said he was stepping down because he feared for his life. Mr Hariri's father, former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri, was assassinated in 2005. Correspondents say his sudden departure plunges Lebanon into a new political crisis and raises fears that it may be at the forefront of the regional rivalry between Shia power Iran and Sunni stronghold Saudi Arabia. Following the statement on Saturday, Iranian politicians lined up to denounce Mr Hariri's assertions. ""Hariri's resignation was done with planning by [US President] Donald Trump and Mohammed bin Salman, the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia,"" said Hussein Sheikh al-Islam, adviser to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Kahmenei. Iranian foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi, quoted by the official Irna news agency, said Mr Hariri's departure was aimed at creating tension in Lebanon and the region. He said Mr Hariri had repeated ""unrealistic and unfounded accusations"" and had aligned himself with ""those who want ill for the region"", singling out Israel, Saudi Arabia and the US. Mr Hariri, whose family is close to Saudi Arabia, has been prime minister since December 2016, after previously holding the position between 2009 and 2011. Mr Hariri's father, Rafik al-Hariri, was assassinated in 2005 ""We are living in a climate similar to the atmosphere that prevailed before the assassination of martyr Rafik al-Hariri,"" he said in the broadcast from the Saudi capital Riyadh. ""I have sensed what is being plotted covertly to target my life."" Rafik al-Hariri was killed by a bomb in 2005in an attack widely blamed on the Iran-backed Shia movement Hezbollah, which wields considerable power in Lebanon. Addressing ""Iran and its followers"" he said Lebanon would ""cut off the hands that wickedly extend into it"". What is Hezbollah? Read more about Lebanon Mr Hariri has made several recent visits to Saudi Arabia. His announcement came a day after a meeting in Beirut with Ali Akbar Velayati, an adviser to Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. After taking office last year, Mr Hariri promised a ""new era for Lebanon"" after two years of political deadlock. The coalition government he led brought together almost all of the main political parties in Lebanon, including Hezbollah.

"Saudis 'intercept missile' near capitalYemen's Houthi rebels, who are battling a Saudi-led coalition, say they were behind the launch.10h10 hours agoMiddle East","This video can not be played A Yemeni TV station released footage of what it claimed was a Riyadh-bound missile Saudi Arabia says it has intercepted a ballistic missile fired from Yemen, after a loud explosion was heard near Riyadh airport on Saturday evening. The missile was destroyed over the capital and fragments landed in the airport area, officials quoted by the official Saudi Press Agency said. A TV channel linked to Houthi rebels in Yemen said the missile was fired at the King Khalid International Airport. The civil aviation authority said that air traffic was not disrupted. Saudi forces have reported shooting down Houthi missiles in the past , though none has come so close to a major population centre. Witnessing Yemen's desperate suffering Terror of life in a city haunted by snipers Unpaid teachers strike as education crisis deepens Yemen conflict: Who is fighting whom? ""The missile was launched indiscriminately to target the civilian and populated areas,"" said Turki al-Maliki, a spokesman for the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen. ""Shattered fragments from the intercepted missile landed in an uninhabited area of the airport and there were no injuries."" Witnesses reported seeing parts of the missile in the airport's car park, Saudi broadcaster Al-Arabiya reported. Residents in the north of Riyadh said their windows were rattled by a loud blast on Saturday evening that was followed by the roar of low-flying aircraft. The Houthi-run Saba News in Yemen said the missile had been a Burkan H2. The rebel group is believed to have access to a stockpile of Scud ballistic missiles and home-grown variants. Saudi forces have previously brought them down with Patriot surface-to-air missiles bought from the US. The Houthis fired a missile towards Riyadh in May, a day before US President Donald Trump was due to arrive in the city for a visit, but it was shot down 200km (120 miles) from the capital. Yemen has been devastated by a war between forces loyal to the internationally recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi and those allied to the Houthi rebel movement. Saudi Arabia is leading a campaign to defeat the Houthis, and is the biggest power in an international air coalition that has bombed the rebel group since 2015. On Wednesday a suspected strike by the Saudi-led coalition killed at least 26 people at a hotel and market in northern Yemen, medics and local officials said. The coalition, which rights groups say has bombed schools, hospitals, markets and residential areas, said it struck a ""legitimate military target"". UN-brokered talks have failed to bring an end to the bloodshed in Yemen, which has claimed more than 8,600 lives and injured nearly 50,000 since the Saudi-led campaign began. The conflict has also left 20.7 million people in need of humanitarian assistance, created the world's largest food security emergency, and led to a cholera outbreak that is believed to have affected 884,000 people and caused 2,184 deaths.

Thousands join town's bonfire festivitiesAn effigy of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un was paraded through the streets of Lewes.12m13 minutes agoSussex,"This video can not be played The annual celebration is one of the largest in the UK Tens of thousands of people joined bonfire celebrations in the East Sussex town of Lewes, despite measures to lower attendance. People had been warned by police not to go unless they were from the town. Roads were closed hours before the start of event, and train services were suspended within a five-mile radius. Sussex Police said about 80 people were treated for injuries, mostly minor. Officers made five arrests and issued three dispersal orders by 01:30 GMT. Ch Supt Neil Honnor said the arrests were for drink-driving, failing to comply with a dispersal order, possession of a knife and an assault. Police said it was thought about 60,000 people had attended the event. The force did say crowd numbers were an estimate because there was no official count. But Ch Supt Honnor said: ""That's far too many for crowd safety purposes."" An effigy of North Korea leader Kim Jong-un was paraded through the streets Members of Lewes' bonfire societies marched the town's narrow streets as the fireworks went off The annual celebration is one of the largest of its type in the UK Before the event, one of the groups involved agreed to tone down its costumes, after the leader of dance troupe Zulu Tradition, booked to perform at this year's event,said they were ""incredibly offensive"". Members of Lewes Borough Bonfire Society traditionally wear black face paint and extravagant accessories for the parade.

George Bush Sr calls Trump a 'blowhard',"Both men, highly critical of Mr Trump, served as Republican presidents Former US Republican President George Bush Sr has confirmed he voted for Democrat Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election, labelling Donald Trump a ""blowhard"". His son, George W Bush, said he worries that ""I will be the last Republican president"", even though President Trump is a Republican. ""This guy doesn't know what it means to be president,"" the younger man said. The pair's comments come from a new book, titled The Last Republicans. Preview excerpts from the book were published by US media outlets. ""Blowhard"" is a casual term for a person who is boastful or blustering,the Oxford English Dictionary says,external, and it is usually meant as an insult. ""I don't like him. I don't know much about him, but I know he's a blowhard. And I'm not too excited about him being a leader,"" said George Bush Sr, who was president between 1989 and 1993. He also told the author of the book, Mark Updegrove, that he felt Mr Trump ran for the presidency because he had ""a certain ego"", in remarks reported by US media outlets including CNN and the New York Times. This video can not be played George W Bush recently decried developments in politics George W Bush, adding to his remarks that Mr Trump ""doesn't know what it means to be president,"" said ""you can either exploit the anger, incite it, or you can come up with ideas to deal with it."" The younger Bush's comments are in keeping with a speech he gave in late October widely seen as a critique of the new president, though it did not name him. During the 2016 presidential campaign, neither former president endorsed Donald Trump. But in the new book, George Bush Sr confirmed that he voted for the rival party's candidate in Hillary Clinton. George W Bush, however, said he simply left his presidential ballot blank. George W Bush - pictured with Mrs Clinton at Mr Trump's inauguration - left his ballot blank The book's title, Mr Updegrove told CNN,external, came from a remark made by George W Bush during the presidential election. As the previous Republican president before Barack Obama took office, he told the author: ""You know, I fear that I will be the last Republican president."" ""And it wasn't just about Hillary Clinton becoming president, as the Republican Party was having a difficult time finding itself. It was because Donald Trump represented everything that the Bushes abhorred,"" Mr Updegrove told CNN. White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders hit back at the former presidents in a statement. ""The American people voted to elect an outsider who is capable of implementing real, positive, and needed change - instead of a lifelong politician beholden to special interests,"" she said. ""If they were interested in continuing decades of costly mistakes, another establishment politician more concerned with putting politics over people would have won."" Meanwhile, former head of the Democratic National Committee, Donna Brazile, has claimed she seriously considered replacing Hillary Clinton with Vice-President Joe Biden as the party's presidential candidate during the campaign. Inextracts from her own book published by the Washington Post,external, she said Mrs Clinton's campaign had ""the odour of failure"" and alleges a huge array of failuresand incidents of mismanagement within the party. Ms Brazile was herself at the centre of a controversy whenshe fed the Clinton campaign a question in advance of a debateagainst Bernie Sanders during the race for the Democratic nomination.

"It's not a witch hunt, says Harman","Labour MP Harriet Harman has told BBC News that the string of allegations of sexual abuse and harassment against MPs is not a witch hunt. She said: ""There are a lot of men saying this has been blown out of all proportion, it's a witch hunt. No, it's not a witch hunt, it's long overdue."" Her comments follow the suspensions of a Conservative and a Labour MP. Meanwhile,SNP MSP Mark McDonald has quit as a Scottish government minister over ""inappropriate"" behaviour. Ina statement,externalhe said it had been brought to his attention that some of his ""previous actions have been considered to be inappropriate"". ""I apologise unreservedly to anyone I have upset or who might have found my behaviour inappropriate,"" Mr McDonald, who represents Aberdeen Donside at Holyrood, said. Conservative MPCharlie Elphickeand Labour's Kelvin Hopkins were suspended from their parties on Friday, while Defence SecretarySir Michael Fallon resignedearlier this week. On Saturday morning, Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, urged people ""not to rush to judgement"", telling BBC Radio 4's Today programme that he believes the scandal is turning into a ""witch hunt"". ""I don't think there's anybody who would seek to defend rape or sexual abuse in the context there's no proof that I can see yet of any wrongdoing. How does a member of Parliament refute that?"" What counts as inappropriate behaviour? Harassment in Westminster: the allegations and denials Tories publish new code of conduct On Friday, the Conservatives published anew code of conductand are immediately adopting a new complaints procedure. Mrs May is also meeting opposition party leaders on Monday to discuss proposals to bring forward a new grievance system for Westminster staff and MPs. Ms Harman, the former Labour deputy leader, said that she thought Prime Minister Theresa May took ""very bold action"" in relation to Sir Michael's resignation. Sir Michael, who quit office on Wednesday saying his general conduct fell short of expected standards, has ""categorically denied"" allegations over his conduct. This video can not be played The scandal is turning into a ""witch hunt"", says Tory MP Ms Harman told BBC Radio 4's Week in Westminster that Mrs May's actions have made her ""hopeful"" that the parties can work together to change standards. She said people were put off from making complaints for fear of being disloyal to their party and ""helping"" the other side. But now, she said, ""there's a bigger fight"". ""We're all tribal beasts, that's why we're there [in parliament] and that has dampened down any ability to speak out,"" she said. ""I think that's changed after this week."" Ms Harman said that Parliament has a ""sea change opportunity"" to address the issue - and to help those who speak out. She added: ""If you point your finger at a powerful man, they won't just sit there, they will fight back. So there will be some backlash about this amongst the corridors [of Westminster]."" Dover MP Charlie Elphicke denies any wrongdoing On Friday, Charlie Elphicke, a former party whip who has been the Conservative MP for Dover since 2010, was suspended by the party after ""serious allegations"" were referred to the police. Denying any wrongdoing in a post on Twitter, the married 46-year-old wrote: ""The party tipped off the press before telling me of my suspension. I am not aware of what the alleged claims are."" LabourMPs Clive Lewis and Kelvin Hopkins are being investigatedby the party over allegations about their behaviour. But Conservative MP Sir Roger Gale told BBC Radio 4: ""We're in danger of getting into a situation where nobody half bright, half sensible, half decent, will want to go into the House of Commons - and that will not be good for democracy. ""We should look at the facts...by all means throw book at them, but don't throw the book at them until the case is proven."" This video can not be played I was groped and flashed at - Emily Thornberry Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, told BBC Breakfast that the House of Commons has ""no real structure"" for complaints. She said it is ""the most unusual workplace"" where the rules around sexual harassment are ""lax if not non-existent"". ""In this sense it needs to get into line. Other big companies have a sexual harassment policy, they have a staff handbook. All those things do not exist for MPs"", she said. On top of that, she added, ""you've got a whole political culture which has thrived on favours and bullying"" as well as partisan ""one-upmanship"" where people are ""incredibly loyal to their parties"". This video can not be played Labour's shadow chancellor says Parliament must 'give women the confidence to work in safety' Alongside the new code of conduct and complaints procedure, the Conservatives have set up a a hotline for reporting potential breaches and a more detailed investigatory process. Labour has introduced a new complaints procedure, while the Liberal Democrats continue to review their complaints procedures. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said any complaints system has to apply to all political parties, and must be ""fair and objective"". ""There should be an element of independence [in the system], particularly for support as well, so people can feel confident about where they can report these things and at the same time how it can be dealt with."" Mrs May said Parliament must do its bit as well as the individual parties - as it was not fair to expect potentially vulnerable people to ""navigate different grievance procedures according to political party"". Lord Bew, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Today programme that the ""burning issue"" at stake is the reputation of parliament. He said it was vital that cases were not dealt with internally by the parties, but by those outside parliament who could ""give some reassurance to the public that this is not just another cover-up"".

Assembly sexual harassment 'ignored',"This video can not be played Cathy Owens says a male politician once tried to get into bed with her The harassment of women in Welsh politics has gone on for some years, a former government advisor has said. Cathy Owens, who runs political consultancy agency Deryn, spoke out about the issue and said a politician once tried to get into bed with her while staying overnight at her house. She was speaking to Sunday Politics Wales about thesexual misconduct scandalengulfing Westminster. Welsh party leaders willdiscuss the issueat the Senedd on Tuesday. 'Politician put his hand on my thigh' Harassment: Welsh Assembly review ordered Ms Owens said party leaders had been told about inappropriate behaviour but no action had been taken, adding some male politicians were ""sexual predators"". She said: ""I was very early on in my career, this was an elected representative, I made clear that nothing was going to happen, he was staying in the spare room, and sometime later [I remember him] coming into my bedroom and trying to get into my bed. ""In another situation someone has come into the taxi that I'm going home in."" Ms Owens said action needed to be taken to tackle the harassment faced by women in Welsh politics, saying the parties did not have the right procedures in place. ""These aren't random men flirting with women,"" she said. ""Thankfully we are talking about a small number of men who have used their positions and are sexual predators, they have used their position in politics knowing that the parties will protect them."" This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said sexual harassment at the assembly ""must not be tolerated"" It comes as former AMs have also said the sexual harassment of women ""goes on all the time"" at the Welsh assembly. Ex-politicians raised concerns about ""a lack of procedures"" and of colleagues ""turning a blind eye to appalling behaviour"". The assembly said no formal sexual harassment allegations had been made against an AM. One former AM spoke of a researcher who claimed she had woken up to find a male former assembly member undressing her. The ex-AM also said they had to step in to physically stop a colleague from harassing another woman researcher. Another former AM said it was difficult to report inappropriate behaviour in the assembly because it is such a small organisation. ""When you see someone behaving inappropriately, you're likely to know that person,"" they said. ""We tolerated things we shouldn't and turned a blind eye... but there wasn't a clear procedure for dealing with problems."" Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said any allegations of sexual harassment at the assembly should be taken seriously and systems must be put in place to make sure such behaviour is not tolerated. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said Ms Owens' experience made him ""sick to the pit of his stomach"" and such actions must ""not be tolerated"" in the future. Labour said it had written to constituency secretaries and women's officers with specific guidance about reporting complaints of sexual harassment. Plaid Cymru said it had put new infrastructure in place to deal with complaints more quickly and was reviewing its internal protocols and considering how it could strengthen them. The Conservatives said they were ""actively working with colleagues across the party to ensure that all the appropriate safeguards are in place to protect staff from harassment in all its forms"". A Liberal Democrat spokesman said: ""There are clear guidelines on how to make a complaint and in cases where the complainant doesn't wish to disclose their identity the pastoral care officer can act as the de facto complainant"". UKIP said it was reviewing its safeguarding procedures to ensure the protection of all who work with the party.

Green denies computer porn allegations,"Damian Green said the allegations were from a ""tainted and untrustworthy source"" Theresa May's most senior minister has denied a claim that police found pornography on a computer in his office during a raid in 2008. First Secretary of State Damian Green said ex-police chief Bob Quick's claims inthe Sunday Times,externalwere ""completely untrue"" and ""political smears"". And he said police had never told him that any improper material had been found on a parliamentary computer. Mr Quick said he ""stood"" by the claim and would take part in an inquiry. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Chris Pincher has resigned as a government whip and referred himself to police following newspaper allegations about his conduct made by a party activist. The revelations are the latest in a growing sexual misconduct scandal in Westminster. Chris Pincher is the MP for Tamworth in Staffordshire On Sunday, further details emerged about allegations against Sir Michael Fallon, who this weekresigned as defence secretaryover his behaviour. Growing number of MPs under scrutiny Labour MSP 'groped' by senior colleague Crabb investigated over lewd text claim The Observer,externalreported that he quit shortly after journalist Jane Merrick told Downing Street he had lunged at her and attempted to kiss her on the lips in 2003 after they had lunch together. And Tory MPs Daniel Poulter, Stephen Crabb and Daniel Kawczynski have been referred to the Conservative Party disciplinary committee after media allegations about their conduct. The allegation regarding Mr Green, who is effectively the prime minister's deputy, relates to an inquiry into Home Office leaks which briefly led to his arrest in 2008. Daniel Poulter, Stephen Crabb and Daniel Kawczynski have faced questions about their professional conduct Former Metropolitan Police Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick said on Sunday that his officers had found pornographic material on a computer in Mr Green's Commons office after they searched it as part of their controversial investigation - which resulted in no charges. The ex-anti-terror chief said he had made an appointment to speak to a senior official in the Cabinet Office, which last week launched an inquiry into an unrelated allegation against Mr Green, to discuss the matter. ""I bear no malice to Damian Green,"" he told BBC News. Mr Quick,who quit his role in 2009,externalafter inadvertently revealing secret documents, accepted he had not asked officers to report the matter at the time, saying they ""didn't expect to find the material"" and were in the midst of a ""very difficult inquiry with a lot of pressure to drop the case"". This video can not be played Andrew Marr asked Home Secretary Amber Rudd whether the centre of government was close to collapse But Mr Green said ""the allegations about the material and computer, now nine years old, are false, disreputable political smears"", adding that they ""amount to little more than an unscrupulous character assassination"". The Cabinet Office inquiry was triggered after journalist Kate Maltby, who is three decades younger than Mr Green, told the Times he ""fleetingly"" touched her knee during a meeting in a pub in 2015 and a year later sent her a ""suggestive"" text message after she was pictured wearing a corset in the newspaper. Mr Green said any allegation that he made sexual advances to Ms Maltby was ""untrue (and) deeply hurtful"". Two Tory MPs, Anna Soubry and Heidi Allen, have urged Mr Green to step aside pending the outcome of the investigation but Home Secretary Amber Rudd said her cabinet colleague had the right to defend himself. ""I do think that we shouldn't rush to allege anything until that inquiry has taken place,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr. More generally, she said abuse of power could not be tolerated and there needed to be a ""clearing out"" of Westminster to get rid of any such behaviour. What counts as inappropriate behaviour? Tories publish new code of conduct Welsh Assembly sexual harassment 'ignored' Meanwhile, Conservative MP Anna Soubry has said former Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon was ""responsible for his own downfall"" amid fresh claims about his past behaviour. Ms Merrick told the Observer she ""shrank away in horror"" when Sir Michael tried to kiss her when she was a 29-year-old reporter at the Daily Mail. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says there must be change following recent revelations of sexual harassment ""I felt humiliated, ashamed. Was I even guilty that maybe I had led him on in some way by drinking with him?"" she said. ""After years of having a drink with so many other MPs who have not acted inappropriately towards me, I now know I was not."" Friends of Sir Michael have not denied the allegation, but the BBC understands that his ministerial career ended because he could not guarantee there would be no further revelations after he admitted repeatedly touching another journalist's knee at a conference dinner 15 years ago. Ms Soubry praised the journalist's ""outstanding bravery"" in coming forward and said she had put her in touch with Downing Street after Ms Merrick had confided in her and Labour's Harriet Harman. This video can not be played Jane Merrick ""outstandingly brave"" for speaking out about Sir Michael Fallon - Conservative MP Anna Soubry Theresa May, she added, must ensure an independent complaints system immediately so victims of harassment and those accused of misconduct did not have to undergo ""trial by newspapers"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said this must be a ""turning point"" for how the whole political class behaves, telling activists that his party - under fire for how it has handled harassment and rape allegations - was not afraid to ""shine a spotlight"" on itself. ""We must say, no more. We must no longer allow women, or anyone else for that matter, to be abused in the workplace or anywhere else,"" he said.

SNP minister quits over 'previous actions',"A Scottish government minister has resigned over previous actions which he said were considered ""inappropriate"". Mark McDonald, the SNP MSP for Aberdeen Donside, said he was stepping down from his role as childcare and early years minister. He apologised and said his attempts to be ""humourous"" or ""friendly"" may have led others to become uncomfortable. He is one of two SNP members currently being investigated by the party over possible misconduct. It is understood the allegations against him are not criminal in nature. The other complaint being investigated by the SNP does not relate to a parliamentarian. Harman: ""This is not a witch hunt"" Westminster harrassment - allegations and denials In a statement he said: ""It has been brought to my attention that some of my previous actions have been considered to be inappropriate - where I have believed myself to have been merely humorous or attempting to be friendly, my behaviour might have made others uncomfortable or led them to question my intentions. ""My behaviour is entirely my responsibility and I apologise unreservedly to anyone I have upset or who might have found my behaviour inappropriate. ""In light of my position in government, I believe it would not be appropriate for me to continue to serve in my role in the Scottish government at this time and I have tendered my resignation as a minister. ""I hope that in taking this step neither any particular woman or my family will be the  focus of undue and unwarranted scrutiny. ""It has been an honour to serve in the Scottish government and I will continue to serve my constituents in Aberdeen Donside to the best of my ability."" A cross party meeting has been held at Holyrood to discuss improved ways of tackling sexual harassment A former Aberdeen City councillor, Mark McDonald was elected as a list MSP at Holyrood in 2011 and became a constituency MSP when he won the Aberdeen Donside by-election in 2013, following the death of Brian Adam. The 37-year-old was responsible fora members bill on high hedge disputes, which passed unanimously at Holyrood. He was appointed a minister in May 2016. Earlier this week First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Deputy First Minister John Swinney both warned men - including those in the SNP - to reflect on their behaviour as allegations of sexual harassment reached Holyrood. A spokesperson for the first minister said: ""Mark has taken the right action in apologising and recognising that in his current role it would be inappropriate for him to remain in government. ""He will continue to make a valuable contribution to parliament as the MSP for Aberdeen Donside. ""As the deputy first minister told parliament earlier in the week it is right that men take responsibility for their behaviour and it is to Mark's credit that he has done so."" A confidential phone line has been launched and an anonymised survey is to be carried out to determine the extent of sexual harassment at the Scottish Parliament. The measure was announced after Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh held an urgent meeting with representatives from each party including Nicola  Sturgeon. A Scottish government spokesperson said Mr McDonald tendered his resignation to the first minister on Saturday. ""The education secretary is responsible for all aspects of the education portfolio including those led by the minister for childcare and early years. The first minister will appoint a new minister in due course,"" the spokesperson added.

Saudi princes held in corruption purge,"Billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal is among those held The heir to the throne in Saudi Arabia has consolidated his hold on power with a major purge of the kingdom's political and business leadership. A new anti-corruption body, headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, detained 11 princes, four sitting ministers and dozens of ex-ministers. Prince Alwaleed bin Talal, a billionaire with investments in Twitter and Apple, is among those held. Separately King Salman replaced the national guard and the navy chiefs. The new anti-corruption committee has the power to issue arrest warrants and travel bans. Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said the status of the detainees would not influence ""the firm and fair application of justice"", AFP news agency reports. Saudi broadcasterAl-Arabiya said fresh investigations had been launched,externalinto the 2009 Jeddah floods and the outbreak of the Mers virus which emerged in Saudi Arabia in 2012 - but analysts see the detentions as a clear move by the crown prince to strengthen his power base. Who is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman? End of Saudi women driving ban reflects deep changes in society Saudi Arabia profile Analysis by Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent The events of Saturday night in Saudi Arabia are nothing short of seismic for that country. In a bold, pre-planned move, the 32-year old Crown Prince has removed the final obstacles to his gaining total control over the world's richest oil producer and home to the holiest shrines in Islam. Presented to the world as an anti-corruption drive, the arrests of princes, ministers and the billionaire tycoon Prince Alwaleed bin Talal have shocked Saudis unused to sudden change. The crown prince is largely popular, especially amongst young Saudis, but many older, more conservative citizens think he is moving too far too fast. He has started an unwinnable war in Yemen while still fighting the extremists of so-called Islamic State. He has also backed a damaging boycott of Gulf neighbour Qatar. But his supporters hail his efforts to modernise Saudi Arabia and, after decades of rule by old men, they welcome a fresh vision from a man who could well be king for the next 50 years. The owner of London's Savoy hotel isone of the richest men in the world, with a net worth of $17bn (Â£13bn),externalaccording to Forbes. Shares in Kingdom Holding, the investment firm owned by the prince, plunged 9.9% in early trade on the Saudi stock market after news of his detention emerged. The firm is one of Saudi Arabia's most important investors. Apart from Twitter and Apple, it has shares in Citigroup bank, the Four Seasons hotel chain and ride-sharing service Lyft. The Saudi prince made the news in the past for employing women, who make up two-thirds of his staff. But he was also known for his hundred-million-dollar desert resorts, where he employed dwarves for entertainment purposes. Two years ago he offered luxury cars to fighter pilots participating in a bombing campaign in Yemen, where the Saudi-led coalition continues to bomb Houthi rebels, killing 26 people in an attack on a  hotel and market on Wednesday. Profile: Prince Alwaleed bin Talal The Saudi prince who offered Bentleys to bombers Saudis 'intercept missile' near capital Prince Alwaleed once bought control of a hotel and a yacht from Donald Trump, when he had yet to enter politics, but clashed with him publicly on Twitter in 2015 over his decision to stand for president,the New York Times notes,external.

National guard minister Prince Miteb bin Abdullah and navy commander Admiral Abdullah bin Sultan bin Mohammed Al-Sultan were both replaced, with no official explanation given. Prince Miteb bin Abdullah has been replaced as head of the powerful national guard Prince Miteb, son of the late King Abdullah, was once seen as a contender for the throne and was the last member of Abdullah's branch of the family in the highest echelons of Saudi government. Those reported to have been detained include: Former Finance Minister Ibrahim al-Assaf, a board member of the Saudi Aramco oil company Economy Minister Adel Fakieh Former Riyadh governor Prince Turki bin Abdullah Former head of the royal court Khalid al-Tuwaijiri Bakr bin Laden, chairman of the Saudi Binladin construction group, and brother ofOsama bin Laden Some of the detainees are being held at the Ritz-Carlton hotel in the diplomatic quarter of Riyadh, sources in contact with the government told Reuters news agency. Few people outside Saudi Arabia had heard of Prince Mohammed bin Salman before his father became king in 2015. But since then, the 32-year-old has become the most influential figure in the world's leading oil exporter Last year, the crown prince unveiled a wide-ranging plan to bring social and economic change to the oil-dependent kingdom. The anti-corruption committee was formed by royal decree and is headed by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman He recently said the return of ""moderate Islam"" waskey to his plans to modernise Saudi Arabia. Addressing an economic conference in Riyadh, he vowed to ""eradicate the remnants of extremism very soon"".

Trump pitches for major Saudi oil float,"President Donald Trump has made a pitch to Saudi Arabia to float the world's biggest oil company in the US. He tweeted: ""Would very much appreciate Saudi Arabia doing their IPO of Aramco with the New York Stock Exchange. Important to the United States!"" The proposed share flotation will see 5% of the state-owned company sold in an Initial Public Offering next year. It is expected to list domestically and on at least one foreign exchange with New York and London vying for the deal. The Aramco IPO is expected to be the largest in history, raising around $100bn in revenue for the Saudi kingdom. If listed in London, it could be worth up to Â£56bn for the London Stock Exchange. Mr Trump was tweeting atthe beginning of an 11-day trip to Asiawhich will take the president and First Lady Melania Trump to Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines.

Prime Minister Theresa May met the boss of Saudi Aramco earlier this year. During a trip to Saudi Arabia in April, Mrs May held talks with chairman Khalid Al-Falih, who is also Saudi Arabia's energy minister. She was joined at the meeting by Xavier Rolet, chief executive of the London Stock Exchange. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), the UK City watchdog, is currently consulting on whether to create a new category for sovereign-controlled companies who wish to list on the London Stock Exchange. The proposal has prompted questions from both the Commons Treasury Select Committee and the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Committee over whether the FCA was politically influenced to alter the rules to help lure Saudi Aramco to London. What's the fuss about Saudi Aramco and the London market? MPs seek answers on Saudi Aramco listing Aramco flotation remains on track for 2018 In a letter to both committees,FCA chief executive Andrew Bailey admittedthat discussions with the world's biggest oil firm were held early this year. But he said: ""We do not think protections for investors will be weakened."" Under existing UK listing rules, every time a company does a deal with an investor who controls a stake of 10% or more in the business, the company must get shareholder approval. Relaxing this rule would mean Saudi Aramco could do deals with the Saudi government without shareholder approval. The Treasury and the FCA declined to comment; The London Stock Exchange was unavailable.
