Labour's economic plan in 10 points,"Labour's chancellor John McDonnell has unveiled a plan which it promises will deliver a ""irreversible shift in the balance of power and wealth in favour of working people"". So what is the party's plan? Labour want to spend a lot more money. They want to double ""investment"" spending - money spent on long-term projects, as opposed to day-to-day expenses such as paying civil servants' salaries. An extra Â£55bn a year on investment is certainly a huge amount of money. For comparison, the government was expected to spend Â£48.4bn on investment this year, according to the 2018 Budget. Capital investment in health this year is set at Â£6.7bn, and for education it is Â£5.1bn. Under Labour, there would be a Â£150bn ""social transformation fund"". This would pay for upgrades to schools, hospitals, social care facilities and council homes and would be spent over five years - an average of Â£30bn a year. In addition, a Â£250bn ""green transformation fund"" would be spent over ten years, averaging Â£25bn a year. This would be spent on projects to improve sustainability, such as energy and transport, and insulating existing homes. There is no doubt a long list of things in the UK which could do with improvement. To take the example of schools, a National Audit Office report in 2017 found that there were 178 schools in the UK in poor condition. The report found that it would cost Â£6.7bn to upgrade all the schools in England to a satisfactory condition, and another Â£7.1bn to upgrade them to good condition. However, the UK is already undertaking a number of significant construction projects - Crossrail, the Hinkley Point C nuclear power station, and HS2. This video can not be played HS2: How much work has already been done? Finding qualified workers to undertake more infrastructure projects would not be straightforward. Infrastructure projects take years to plan and approve before the first concrete gets poured. Experts warn that finding enough projects which are ready to start and offer good value for taxpayers' money might be problematic for whoever wins the election. ""If you promise more than is deliverable then you risk wasting money, however good the long-term intention is,"" said Paul Johnson, director of the IFS. Reality Check looked at the difficulties of investment spendinghere. John McDonnell says he wants to achieve ""an irreversible shift in the centre of gravity in political decision making and investment"" away from London to the North and other regions of the UK. The National Transformation Fund will be managed from a new department of the Treasury, based at an unspecified location in the North of England. And an element of the fund would be specifically managed and spent locally. As thisreport,externalshows, only a minority of civil servants - 83,500 out of 430,000 - are based in London. More than 50,000 are already based in the North-West. However, the majority of Treasury staff, and the most senior staff, are currently based in London. On top of its investment plans, Labour promises to make university tuition free, as the party did in its 2017 manifesto. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said at the time that scrapping tuition fees would add an extra Â£11bn a year to the amount the government has to borrow. In this election, the extra cost of doing this instead of keeping tuition fees at their current level of Â£9,250 would be lower because of a change in the way student loans are treated in the national accounts. Labour has promised to make university tuition free As much as 45% of student loans will never be repaid, and this now has to be counted as government spending. You can read more about the changesin this piece. Mr McDonnell said the National Transformation Fund would allow Labour to ""decarbonise as thoroughly and fast as our commitment to a just transition will allow"". In other words, it would reduce the amount of greenhouse gases the country produces. The most dramatic element of the plan announced so far is a scheme to improve the insulation of 27 million homes, which it estimates would cost Â£250bn, though only Â£60bn of that would come from government grants. It would increase investment in rail and offshore wind. In its 2017 manifesto, Labour said it was ""committed to ensuring that the national debt is lower at the end of the next Parliament than it is today"". Called the fiscal credibility rule, this commitment is designed to reassure investors that Labour is a reliable steward of the economy and would not let debt spiral out of control. On Thursday Labour said its target for borrowing would change significantly. Instead of promising to reduce the national debt, it would seek to improve ""the overall balance sheet"". Instead of targeting the national debt, they are targeting a different statistic called ""public sector net worth"". Though it sounds similar its consequences in practice would be profound. At the moment, if the government borrows Â£1m to build a road, that counts as Â£1m more added to the national debt. But under the new rule, the government now owns a new road which would be worth around Â£1m. The value of the new asset - the road - balances out the new debt, and public sector net worth hasn't changed at all. This means the government can borrow much more than it would have done under the old rules, as long as it uses that money to invest in an asset. Labour's plan to borrow an extra Â£55bn a year for the National Transformation Fund would have been next to impossible under the old rule. Also Labour's plans to borrow to nationalise some public utilities would be affordable under this plan, as they would bring the government an asset as well as a debt. Affordable, that is, as long as the government can find someone to lend it the money. Labour has said that it will fund this extra spending by borrowing money. It will issue long-dated government bonds - IOUs which attract an interest rate, but won't have to be paid back for many years. The government can currently borrow for 30 years for an effective interest rate of 1.25%, and many economists argue that it makes sense to borrow at such low rates for projects that will give a bigger return than it costs to fund them. It is likely that bond markets would be willing to lend the government this money, though the effective interest rate that investors demand might well rise as borrowing increases. The influential bond investor Pimcotold the Financial Times,externalthat the UK was one of its ""least favourite"" markets to invest in, because of the combination of low rates and big public spending increases in prospect. But even they did not expect a big increase in government borrowing costs. The National Investment Bank was an idea that also featured in Labour's 2017 manifesto, which it is committed to again. The bankwould have Â£250bn of lending power over 10 years,externaland would target small businesses that support the government's industrial strategy (such as energy-efficient housing and decarbonisation). While the bank would require an initial cash injection from government funds, Labour believes it would able to fund itself in the longer run. This could be done, for example, by raising money from outside investors. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the party's tax plans ""will affect 5% of the population - the rest of the population will benefit from it"". So how much do you have to earn to be in the 5%? HMRC figures from 2017,externalindicated that the top 5% of taxpayers earn more than Â£75,300.That's in line with Labour's previous remarksimplying that ""the rich"" are those earning more than about Â£70,000-80,000 a year. How many people is that? HMRC says that there were 31.2 million taxpayers in 2016-2017, so the top 5% being targeted would be about 1,560,000 people. ""Taxpayers"" covers most working people, but not anyone who earned less than the personal tax allowance of Â£11,200 that year. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Pienaar: A matter of mistrust?,"Are pork pies more common than humble pie in modern politics? Do party leaders and politicians - British ones, mind you, not just dodgy foreigners - ever lie? Well, you could perhaps duck the question and argue that our political leaders sometimes distort the truth. Or you could say they like to present only a useful portion of the whole picture. And you'd be right about that. But do they lie? Is the Queen's Speech required viewing in the Corbyn household? This week, if you even try to argue politicians never lie, you'd have to accept that Jeremy Corbyn, a dedicated, life-long republican, sits in front of the TV at home on 25 December and dutifully watches Her Majesty's Christmas message. Then you'd have to believe his loyal colleague Angela Rayner was right to say her boss maybe watched the Queen's Message on catch-up TV on Boxing Day. That was to explain Mr Corbyn's apparent claim that he somehow watched in the morning, hours before it's broadcast. What did the PM hear in Hertfordshire? Then, you'd need to accept Boris Johnson's word that, at the Nato summit in Hertfordshire on Friday, he had somehow never heard a word of his fellow national leaders huddling together in Buckingham Palace the previous evening, mocking US President Donald Trump. He was captured on camera standing with them at the time, and joining in the joke. I could go on. But I won't, because you'd arguably be asking the wrong question. Mr Johnson's critics coyly accuse him of maintaining a ""casual relationship with the truth"". But in fact it's fairer to say our politicians often have a transactional relationship with the truth. In different ways, they constantly trade-off their duty of service to honesty against their personal and political advantage and disadvantage. Sometimes it's a fine judgement. When it comes to such things as Mr Corbyn's viewing habits on Christmas Day, or whether Mr Johnson should have freely admitted gently mocking Donald Trump to the world's media at an international summit, how much do we really blame them? How high are Jo Swinson's hopes as the campaign comes to a close? If we're being honest, that is. So, maybe the real question this week is: has the line between truth and untruth been consciously blurred to the point that whatever may be left of any trust between people and politics is now in jeopardy? The answer to that, it's fair to argue this week, could be yes. If watching TV on Christmas Day or ducking a potentially embarrassing question about Mr Trump are forgivable, or a least understandable, the prime minister was taking a risk again on Sunday when he insisted in his Sky News interview with Sophy Ridge that there would be no border checks between Britain and the island of Ireland under his Brexit deal. Experts and his own fellow ministers admit that there'd have to be checks to comply with EU and international law, to guard against smuggling of endangered species, say, or unlawful trade with sanctioned regimes. They can't all be right. If Mr Johnson ends up back in office, and requiring the support of the Democratic Unionist Party to stay there, he'll have to confront the truth of this question and it won't be a comfortable moment. Mr Corbyn and his party's claim that Labour will tax only the richest 5% of society to pay for their expensive promises could also lead to a reckoning. The Institute for Fiscal Studies judges that the claim is implausible. John Swinney said Trident was a ""red line"" for the SNP All of this could perhaps be discounted were it not for the fact that the relationship between people and politics is already close to breaking point. A Kantar poll this week found around half (48%) of those intending to vote Conservative on Thursday felt the Tories were ""the best of a bad bunch"". About the same proportion (49%) said the same of Labour. The parties are running out of rope. To be fair, the Liberal Democrats' early campaign claim to be running to install Jo Swinson in Downing Street can't really be described as a lie. Just faintly absurd. She now says her aim is to make ""real progress"". In theory, the Lib Dems could gain only a small handful of seats on Thursday, even lose a couple, and still be very influential in a hung Parliament. And for the SNP, Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinneytold me on Pienaar's Politics on BBC 5 livethat his party's demand for unilateral nuclear disarmament and the removal of the Trident nuclear submarine base at Faslane would be a ""red line"" in negotiations with Labour, if Mr Corbyn ends up casting around for support. If it happens, that would be an interesting negotiation. Trace the leaders' travel map this week and Mr Johnson moved away from the North and towards the South-East and East for the first time. His poll ratings look reasonably good, but five of his six visits this week were to Conservative-held seats. Ms Swinson went to her first Lib Dem seat in Edinburgh West. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon visited her first Labour seat at Midlothian. Is there a subtext here? Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn prioritised visual impact over parliamentary maths. He spoke of big tech, for example, at an Amazon depot, and he talked about inequality in front of a statue of Robin Hood. Subtlety has its place. Just not on an election campaign.

Labour Budget to 'end austerity' in first 100 days,"This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""The budget that ends austerity once and for all"" John McDonnell has promised to ""end austerity"" in a speech setting out Labour's priorities for its first 100 days in government. The shadow chancellor vowed to ""remake government"" with a Budget on 5 February if his party wins this Thursday's election. He also detailed how newly nationalised water and energy firms would be run. The Tories are also pledging to increase public spending, but not on the same scale. They have criticised Labour's spending plans as ""reckless"", claiming they would lead to an economic crisis within months of the party taking office. Live: Latest from the campaign trail Kuenssberg: Will the parties pull off their experiments? PM targets Labour-Leave seats in final push Labour vows to 'transform' UK at manifesto launch Conservative leader Boris Johnson is visiting Labour-held seats which voted for Brexit in the north-east of England on Monday, with three days to go until polling day. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn will tour Labour target seats in the south of England. Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeonsaid she was confident an agreement on another Scottish independence vote could be donewith Labour, if it needed her party's support to form a government in the event of a hung parliament. But Mr Corbynhas ruled out supporting a Scottish independence referendumuntil after the next Holyrood election in 2021. As the parties begin their final push for votes, the Liberal Democrats are pledging to table legislation to stop Brexit immediately after the election by introducing two draft bills they say would pave the way for another EU referendum. Labour is proposing a big increase in spending on public services and social security, to be funded by higher taxes on companies and better-off workers, plus government borrowing. It is also planning to take train companies, Royal Mail, the water industry, and the big six energy firms into public ownership - and part-privatise BT Openreach. Speaking in London, Mr McDonnell said Labour's planned February Budget would mark ""the date when almost ten years of cuts will come to an end"". This video can not be played John Caudwell: ""Nearly every wealthy person I know, including me, is thinking of leaving the UK if Labour get in"" He said: ""In our first hundred days, we will start the process of bringing water and energy into public ownership. ""We'll set up boards to run them made up of you, the customer, and you, the worker, as well as representatives from local councils, metro mayors and others. ""We'll make sure decisions are taken locally by those who understand the services - those who use them and deliver them. Meetings will be public and streamed online with new transparency regulations set higher than ever before. ""So you can see if your road is being dug up, why, and for how long. And we'll create new People's Assemblies to hold these boards to account and give everyone the option of participating in how their utilities are run."" Labour's economic plan in 10 points He also outlined Labour's plans to invest in green industries, skills training and regional development, attempting to reverse the decline of manufacturing and the growth of ""dreary, exploitative, insecure and low-paid jobs"". He pledged that a National Transformation Fund Unit, based in the north of England, would be set up before Christmas. His party also wants to set up a National Investment Bank - which also featured in the party's 2017 manifesto - which would have Â£250bn to lend, with a focus on small businesses whose work ties in to the government's industrial strategy. Mr McDonnell defended his tax policy in the face of criticism from the telecoms tycoon John Caudwell, who said Labour's anti-billionaire rhetoric was ""destroying confidence"" and making wealthy people like him feel ""almost like pariahs"". The Phones4u founder told Radio 4's Today programme that some within Labour ""despised"" success and its economic plans were driven by ""envy"", suggesting that droves of entrepreneurs would leave the country if Mr Corbyn won power. In response, Mr McDonnell said his plans had been ""exaggerated"" by sections of the media. While he hoped the rich accepted they had a social responsibility to address the UK's ""grotesque"" levels of inequality, it was in the end a ""moral choice"" whether they wanted to stay in the UK or leave, he added. The Tories, Lib Dems and Labour all say they would take advantage of low interest rates to borrow money to invest in infrastructure. Labour and the Lib Dems would also increase corporation tax, while the Conservatives have scrapped a plan to reduce it. Labour says it would increase taxes on the top 5% of earners, those taking home Â£80,000 a year or more, although Mr Corbynhas conceded that some people on low incomescould also pay more tax under the party's plans. The Conservatives have pledged to freeze National Insurance, income tax and VAT rates and promised a tax cut in their first Budget by increasing the National Insurance threshold, so workers will not have to pay it until they earn Â£9,500.

"Johnson targets Labour Leave seats in final pushThe PM will visit four Brexit-voting Labour-held seats, three days before the election.","Boris Johnson has toured Brexit-voting Labour-held seats in north-east England, with three days to go before polling day. In a speech in Sunderland - 61% of which voted to Leave - the PM told voters: ""The Labour Party has let you down."" He attacked Parliament, saying it had ""delayed"" and ""denied"" Brexit. Mr Johnson will also travel to south-west England, where he will warn against voting for the pro-EU Lib Dems. At the event in Sunderland, Mr Johnson took questions from the public and the press. Live: Latest from the campaign trail Kuenssberg: Will the parties pull off their experiments? Election manifestos: Who should I vote for? A really simple guide to the UK general election Mr Johnson spoke of his ""oven-ready"" Brexit deal with the EU, saying the alternative to voting for the Conservatives was ""yet more delay"" and ""division and deadlock"". He criticised Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, arguing he did not have a credible Brexit plan, adding that every Conservative election candidate had pledged to support his own withdrawal deal with the EU. Mr Johnson also challenged Labour shadow chancellor John McDonnell's plans, which he said ""will put up taxes"" and be a ""recipe for disaster"". Meanwhile, Mr McDonnell promised todeliver a budget to ""end austerity""within its first 100 days if the party wins Thursday's election. In a speech in London setting out his priorities, he also pledged to get ""money moving out of Whitehall and the City"". The Conservative Party says the prime minister is intending to ""visit every region in England and Wales"" in the final three days of the election campaign, with a message that a vote for his party is a vote to ""get Brexit done and unleash Britain's potential"". Mr Johnson started the day at a fish market in Grimsby, one of a number of longstanding Labour areas that voted heavily to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum that both the Conservatives and the Brexit Party are targeting. The 13 key policies in the Conservative manifesto Where does Labour stand on Brexit? On his visit to Sunderland, Mr Johnson said it had been 1,264 days since the city voted to leave the EU. ""People voted to get out of the European Union - our democratic duty to do so. ""Our economy is suffering right now because of the uncertainty"" created by the Brexit delay, he said. Campaigners in Sunderland celebrate the 2016 EU referendum result Mr Johnson has repeatedly warned that the only alternative to a Conservative majority is a hung Parliament, with Mr Corbyn and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon forming a coalition and resulting in further referendums on Brexit and Scottish independence. Ms Sturgeonhas said she is confident an agreement on a second independence vote could be doneif Labour needed SNP support to form a government if there is a hung parliament. But Mr Corbynhas ruled out supporting a Scottish independence referendumuntil after the next Holyrood election in 2021. The Liberal Democrats are, meanwhile, pledging to table legislation to stop Brexit immediately after the election by introducing two draft bills they say would pave the way for another EU referendum. The first would enable the Electoral Commission to start the necessary consultation around a referendum question and lead campaign designation - and the second would provide a referendum on the government's Brexit deal versus remaining in the EU. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson told Radio 4's Today programme the ""most likely way"" to stop Brexit was through another vote as the possibility of her party winning power on its own and revoking Article 50 looked increasingly remote.

Johnson insists no NI-GB goods checks after Brexit,"Boris Johnson has insisted there will not be any checks for goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain under his Brexit deal. He told Sky News that a leaked Treasury analysis document was ""wrong"" to suggest this would be the case. His Brexit deal means there will be goods checks from GB to NI, but there has been confusion on whether there will be checks in the other direction. Labour said the PM's claims about his deal with the EU were ""fraudulent"". And DUP leader Arlene Foster said she still had concerns over the withdrawalagreement Mr Johnson reached with other European leadersin October. The comments come as the main political party leaders continue to push their pledges ahead of Thursday's general election. Reality Check: Will there be checks between GB and NI? PM 'misrepresenting' Brexit deal, says Corbyn LIVE: Final Sunday on the campaign trail General election 2019: A matter of mistrust? Under the PM's agreement, Northern Ireland would continue to follow many EU rules on food and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK would not. Northern Ireland would also continue to follow EU customs rules but would remain part of the UK's customs territory. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis: 'We are not going to have a border down the Irish sea' A government risk assessmentpublished in October said it would lead to new administration and checks on goods from west to east. But Mr Johnson has insisted Northern Irish businesses will not be hit with additional paperwork or fees, telling a BBC phone-in during the election campaign: ""We will make sure that businesses face no extra costs and no checks for stuff being exported from NI to GB."" No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM NI firms to declare GB-bound goods under new deal He has said the only checks would be on British exports to the Republic of Ireland going via Northern Ireland. But the BBC's Northern Ireland business and economics editor John Campbell said these comments ""do not accurately reflect what is in the deal"" and, because of EU law, products would have to be checked even if they were not going on to the Republic of Ireland. Boris Johnson is right to say that under his Brexit deal goods travelling east - from Northern Ireland into Great Britain - would be treated differently from goods travelling west - from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. But he's wrong to say there will no checks in either direction. That assertion runs counter to what is written in his own withdrawal agreement. Businesses sending goods from Northern Ireland into Great Britain will have to fill out export declaration forms - only a small piece of online bureaucracy, but still different from goods travelling elsewhere within the UK. From Great Britain to Northern Ireland, though, tariffs will have to be paid on goods if their final destination is - or could be - the Republic of Ireland, inside the EU. This will necessitate some form of checks. It's also important to remember that checks aren't just about customs. Under the prime minister's deal, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the rules of the EU single market for goods. And that means EU law requires checks on, for example, all food and animal products - at their point of entry. The more the UK diverges from EU rules, as Mr Johnson says he wants to be able to do, the more checks there will be. The internal Treasury document leaked on Friday laid all this out in more detail. The prime minister says it is all nonsense, but his own deal says something rather different. When asked on Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether there would be checks, in light of the leaked Treasury document, Mr Johnson replied: ""No, absolutely not. ""The deal we've done with the EU is a brilliant deal and it allows us to do all the things that Brexit was about, so it's about taking back control of our borders, money, laws. ""But unlike the previous arrangements, it allows the whole of the UK to come out of the EU, including Northern Ireland, and the only checks that there would be would be if something was coming from GB via Northern Ireland and was going on to the Republic, then there might be checks at the border into Northern Ireland."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reveals ""secret"" government Brexit report Asked if the government's document was therefore wrong and if his Brexit secretary - who in Octobersaid goods going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would be subject to exit declarations- was also wrong, Mr Johnson replied: ""Yes. ""Because there's no question of there being checks on goods going from NI to GB or GB to NI, because they are part of - if you look at what the deal is, we're part of the same customs territory and it's very clear that there should be unfettered access between Northern Ireland and the rest of GB. ""The only reason - this is another of these things that has been produced by the Labour Party as a kind of distraction."" Giving evidence to the House of Lords Exiting the EU committee in October, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay initially said he did not believe exit forms would be necessary for trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But he later conceded: ""The exit summary declarations will be required in terms of NI to GB."" When security minister Brandon Lewis was challenged on the subject of post-Brexit goods checks on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said: ""We have some checks now, with customs and live animals, things like that. ""It's right that we continue that. But we've been very clear - there will be no border down the Irish Sea. ""The UK as a whole will leave the European Union together and, of course, Northern Ireland itself will have that self-determination around things as we go forward."" DUP leader Ms Foster told BBC 5 live's Pienaar's Politics her party had a ""large concern"" about how it would be determined which goods travelling through Northern Ireland had the Irish Republic as the final destination. ""By definition you would need checks to see that that happens,"" she said. ""There have been differing views even within the Conservative Party as to what it meant."" Ms Foster said there had to be ""clarity in relation to that for those of us living in Northern Ireland, because, of course, Great Britain is our largest market by far, and we need to be able to, from an economic point of view, know what it's going to mean for us in the future"". At a press conference in London on Friday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the 15-page Treasury document - entitled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market - disproved Mr Johnson's claims there would be no checks, and showed his claims about his own deal were ""fraudulent"". He said it was ""hard evidence"" NI would be ""symbolically separated"" from the rest of the UK after Brexit. ""What we have here is a confidential report by Johnson's own government, marked 'official', 'sensitive', that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,"" he said.

Tonight's 90-minute debate on everything other than Brexit has finished, with five of the main parties taking part. Here are some of the things we learnt: Addressing the question of trust, which was put to each of the candidates, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""Back in 2010, we got this fundamentally wrong on tuition fees."" Presenter Cathy Newman interjects to say the Lib Dems broke a promise. ""We did,"" Ms Swinson says. ""We absolutely got it wrong."" ""I remember the feeling that I had when I sat in the meeting and it became clear to me what was going to happen,"" she says, adding she felt ""nauseous"". ""I vowed that never again was I going to be in that situation without speaking out."" The Lib Dem leader says she's learned she needs to be ""really clear that what I say is what I can do"". Channel 4 Cathy Newman cites a poll commissioned by Channel 4 which found just 10% of people surveyed felt politicians had been honest and trustworthy during the election campaign. Questions from the audience centre on the trustworthiness of politicians. The SNP's Philippa Whitford says she thinks it is ""a shame we don't have a representative from the Conservatives"". ""You need to look back at people who you elected last time or in 2010. Did they deliver what they said then? ""The Conservatives said that they would deliver 5,000 extra GPs but actually there's fewer."" Asked when was the last time that she lied, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""I have been known to be less than frank with my son about how many chocolate biscuits are left, it has to be said."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson comes under fire from her counterparts as she talks about poverty and hunger. She says there's still ""much more money"" that needs to go intouniversal credit - the major (and heavily criticised) welfare reform launched in 2010. And she tells a story about her child's school, which has started handing out bagels before classes begin in the morning to ensure no child starts the day hungry. The Lib Dems don't want to scrap universal credit - but Ms Swinson says she wants to see the policy of limiting welfare benefits to two children scrapped - something she describes as ""one of those cruellest measures"". Labour's Angela Rayner then interrupts her to say: ""You can't go here saying 'this is terrible, this is terrible', you voted for austerity, you created the bedroom tax."" (If you need a reminder, the so-called bedroom tax, introduced during the coalition government, sees working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need). Angela Rayner says Ms Swinson ""voted for austerity"" ""They don't want a bagel, they want a decent job so they can feed their own children!"" Ms Rayner says. ""They do, they do,"" Ms Swinson replies, adding that she's been ""very honest"" about the ""things we've got wrong"" in coalition. ""I'm absolutely sorry about the bedroom tax,"" she says. The SNP's Philippa Whitford joins in, saying ""wrong"" is wearing clothes that don't match and she says ""destroyed"" lives is ""a bit more than wrong"". Ms Swinson responds saying the Conservatives have showed ""many"" of their true colours after the coalition ended, adding she's sorry she didn't ""win all the battles"" when she was in government. We're back after another break (with some light relief with a trailer for the film Cats) and the next question for the five parties is on social care. A doctor from Bradford asks: ""We have an ageing population, do you think it is fair some people will have to sell their houses to pay for social care? ""We want a system where the funds can be there,"" says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""At the moment it is far too stretched. ""We need to have a mature debate across the country about how we are going to fund this. ""But we need to be able to do that on a cross-party basis, because this is a long-term issue."" Would she join Boris Johnson's cross-party social care talks? ""Absolutely,"" says Ms Swinson. Angela Rayner responds: ""I'm kind of hoping we'll be the one in government doing those discussions."" She adds that the discussion about social care is ""not just an economic argument"". She says ""it's about what type of country"" we want to be. ""When my nan was dying of cancer she said if I was a dog, you'd put me down,"" Ms Rayner adds. ""No old person should feel that way."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price wants social care to be funded in the same way as the NHS, by taxation. He asks Ms Rayner: ""Will you commit to free social personal care in Wales?"" She replies that Wales would have the funding to do that. The SNP's Philippa Whitford, who spent years working as a breast cancer surgeon on the NHS, says: ""You can't sort the problems in the NHS unless you're sorting the problems in social care."" She says: ""Free personal care is something that is cost-effective in the picture of the whole of the NHS. ""But it's also about the dignity of citizens."" Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party is pledging free personal care for the over 65s. But he says there is a wider discussion which will require some ""bold"" political decisions. ""We have got to talk about wealth and how we get that wealth back from the rampant inequality,"" he says. Reality Check The Channel 4 debate has been addressing a question on sentencing and prison numbers. The prison population in England and Wales is around 83,000, which is around 8,000 above the prisons service's own overcrowding limits. Channel 4 Another short break and the next question facing the party representatives is: ""Should we be taxing the top 5% earners more?"" The audience member might be referring to Labour's policy of raising income taxes for people earning over Â£80,000(you're in the top 5% of income taxpayers if your salary is Â£81,000 and above). ""Well you won't be shocked from me to say, yes,"" says Labour's Angela Rayner. She says she believes the country ""won't mind paying a little bit more"" if it means helping others such as the four million children living in poverty. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Angela Rayner go on to clash over whether their parties have costed some of their plans. ""You're making a plan for policies that if you get into government you cannot deliver,"" says Ms Swinson, while Ms Rayner says the Lib Dems' plan for free child care is not costed. Meanwhile, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party would save money by - among other policies - not renewing Trident nuclear deterrent, or through fossil fuel subsidies. ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now,"" he adds. Reality Check Angela Rayner says there are ""four million children living in poverty in our country"". There's no single measure of poverty but it's true to say there are around four million children living in low-income households, and it has increased slightly in the last few years. The question of how to tackle climate change is up next. The Greens'Jonathan Bartleysays he wants to see a carbon tax and wants the UK to be carbon-free by 2030. He says he was ""astonished"" how the topic didn't come up in the BBC's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson last week. ""There seems to be a lot of rhetoric but not much substance,"" he says. Labour'sAngela Raynerpoints out that Friends of the Earth ranked her party's manifesto as the greenest. But Mr Bartley quickly intervenes to say Greenpeace gave his Green Party the highest score. ""No, we're ambitious Jonathan, come on side,"" Ms Rayner shoots back. The Lib Dem'sJo Swinsonsays it's false to present tackling environmental problems as expensive. ""Actually saving the planet needn't cost the earth,"" she says. ""It really can be a win-win for us to tackle this climate emergency."" She gives the example of how tackling air pollution can save money as it reduces health problems. Plaid Cymru'sAdam Priceis quizzed about a potential tax on meat and the impact that might have on Welsh beef. ""Farmers shouldn't be demonised here, farmers care deeply about the environment,"" he says. ""They can make a positive contribution to decarbonisation."" But he says the issue of climate change is ""bigger than party politics"". ""We agree with that!"" says the Greens' Mr Bartley. Reality Check Privatisation and the NHS and the amount of money that goes to private providers have been raised in the Channel 4 debate. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. Reality Check Asked about nurses, Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the government cut the nursing bursary"". Nursing bursaries were cut in England. There's been a fall in people accepting places on courses since 2016. They've gone up in Scotland and Wales where the bursary remains. Channel 4 Everyone's had a quick break while the adverts have been on, but now we're back with host Cathy Newman who is asking the audience what they want to hear. The next question is on the subject of crime. Should convicted terrorists serve the whole of their sentence without the chance of early release? Plaid Cymru's Adam Price answers first, saying ""public protection needs to be at the heart of the policy"". But he adds that, in the most recent case at London Bridge, the lessons will only be known once there has been an investigation into what happened. ""So I think it's important not to rush to judgement in terms of that specific case."" Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the most important thing is that the public are kept safe"". She says prisons are ""overstuffed"" and ""lots of people re-offend on petty crime doing time for that"". She gets a brief clap after saying that if convicted terrorists need to spend 10 or 20 years in prison ""they should do that"" - but adds that rehabilitation must be part of the justice system. Ms Rayner says that when people are allowed out, then ""they have to be watched and monitored"". Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says there must be a proper assessment ""before anyone is released"". ""One of those grieving parents, David Merritt, he has called on politicians not to politicise his son's death,"" says Ms Swinson. Ms Rayner interjects: ""That's why I didn't mention that."" Ms Swinson says she is angry at Boris Johnson for ignoring Mr Merritt's request. Â© 2025 BBC.

Arrest after Manchester derby racist abuse claim,"United midfielder Fred said he was hit by an object during Saturday's derby A man has been arrested after objects and racist abuse appeared to be targeted at Manchester United players during Saturday's derby. Police said they received a report of a fan makingalleged racist gesturesin the game against Manchester City. City said they were working with police ""regarding an instance of objects being thrown on to the field of play"". A 41-year-old man has been held on suspicion of a racially aggravated public order and remains in custody. On Saturday, a man was filmed apparently making monkey gestures and sounds towards Manchester United players during the derby at City's Etihad Stadium. It happened as United midfielder Fred went to take a corner in the second half and appeared to be hit by an object hurled from the crowd. After the match, the 26-year-old Brazilian said: ""On the field, I didn't see anything. I saw it only in the locker room afterwards. The guys showed me. [A man] even threw a lighter and it hit me."" United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer and City boss Pep Guardiola condemned the incidents United boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer said: ""Fred and Jesse [Lingard] were in the corner, taking a corner, and I've seen the video, heard from the boys."" He said the apparent behaviour of the supporter caught on camera was ""unacceptable"". In a statement,,externalManchester City said they were working with police to identify offenders, adding: ""The club are also working with GMP regarding an instance of objects being thrown on to the field of play. ""The club operates a zero-tolerance policy regarding discrimination of any kind, and anyone found guilty of racial abuse will be banned from the club for life."" Fred later joined United players as they celebrated their 2-1 victory at City's Etihad Stadium After social media speculation that the person allegedly making the monkey gestures worked for the infrastructure firm Kier Group,the company tweeted,externalan employee had been suspended ""pending an investigation"". The company added: ""We're aware of a video circulating on social media. We take allegations and instances of racism very seriously and are currently investigating potential links between the individual involved and Kier. The FA said it would investigate the incident, while the Premier League said it ""will not tolerate discrimination in any form"". ""If people are found to have racially abused Premier League players they deserve to be punished and we will support any action taken by the authorities and the clubs,"" a Premier League spokesperson said. The incident comes a year after racism in football hit the headlines after City striker Raheem Sterling was subjected to racist abuse at Stamford Bridge, which led to a permanent ban for a Chelsea supporter. Sterling was also one of a number of England players who faced monkey chants and Nazi salutes in Euro 2020 qualifiers this year. Racism hit the headlines again when Raheem Sterling and other black players faced abuse in the past year Fred said the alleged incidents on Saturday showed ""we are still in a backward society"".

Would she join Boris Johnson's cross-party social care talks? ""Absolutely,"" says Ms Swinson. Angela Rayner responds: ""I'm kind of hoping we'll be the one in government doing those discussions."" She adds that the discussion about social care is ""not just an economic argument"". She says ""it's about what type of country"" we want to be. ""When my nan was dying of cancer she said if I was a dog, you'd put me down,"" Ms Rayner adds. ""No old person should feel that way."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price wants social care to be funded in the same way as the NHS, by taxation. He asks Ms Rayner: ""Will you commit to free social personal care in Wales?"" She replies that Wales would have the funding to do that. The SNP's Philippa Whitford, who spent years working as a breast cancer surgeon on the NHS, says: ""You can't sort the problems in the NHS unless you're sorting the problems in social care."" She says: ""Free personal care is something that is cost-effective in the picture of the whole of the NHS. ""But it's also about the dignity of citizens."" Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party is pledging free personal care for the over 65s. But he says there is a wider discussion which will require some ""bold"" political decisions. ""We have got to talk about wealth and how we get that wealth back from the rampant inequality,"" he says. Reality Check The Channel 4 debate has been addressing a question on sentencing and prison numbers. The prison population in England and Wales is around 83,000, which is around 8,000 above the prisons service's own overcrowding limits. Channel 4 Another short break and the next question facing the party representatives is: ""Should we be taxing the top 5% earners more?"" The audience member might be referring to Labour's policy of raising income taxes for people earning over Â£80,000(you're in the top 5% of income taxpayers if your salary is Â£81,000 and above). ""Well you won't be shocked from me to say, yes,"" says Labour's Angela Rayner. She says she believes the country ""won't mind paying a little bit more"" if it means helping others such as the four million children living in poverty. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Angela Rayner go on to clash over whether their parties have costed some of their plans. ""You're making a plan for policies that if you get into government you cannot deliver,"" says Ms Swinson, while Ms Rayner says the Lib Dems' plan for free child care is not costed. Meanwhile, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party would save money by - among other policies - not renewing Trident nuclear deterrent, or through fossil fuel subsidies. ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now,"" he adds. Reality Check Angela Rayner says there are ""four million children living in poverty in our country"". There's no single measure of poverty but it's true to say there are around four million children living in low-income households, and it has increased slightly in the last few years. The question of how to tackle climate change is up next. The Greens'Jonathan Bartleysays he wants to see a carbon tax and wants the UK to be carbon-free by 2030. He says he was ""astonished"" how the topic didn't come up in the BBC's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson last week. ""There seems to be a lot of rhetoric but not much substance,"" he says. Labour'sAngela Raynerpoints out that Friends of the Earth ranked her party's manifesto as the greenest. But Mr Bartley quickly intervenes to say Greenpeace gave his Green Party the highest score. ""No, we're ambitious Jonathan, come on side,"" Ms Rayner shoots back. The Lib Dem'sJo Swinsonsays it's false to present tackling environmental problems as expensive. ""Actually saving the planet needn't cost the earth,"" she says. ""It really can be a win-win for us to tackle this climate emergency."" She gives the example of how tackling air pollution can save money as it reduces health problems. Plaid Cymru'sAdam Priceis quizzed about a potential tax on meat and the impact that might have on Welsh beef. ""Farmers shouldn't be demonised here, farmers care deeply about the environment,"" he says. ""They can make a positive contribution to decarbonisation."" But he says the issue of climate change is ""bigger than party politics"". ""We agree with that!"" says the Greens' Mr Bartley. Reality Check Privatisation and the NHS and the amount of money that goes to private providers have been raised in the Channel 4 debate. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. Reality Check Asked about nurses, Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the government cut the nursing bursary"". Nursing bursaries were cut in England. There's been a fall in people accepting places on courses since 2016. They've gone up in Scotland and Wales where the bursary remains. Channel 4 Everyone's had a quick break while the adverts have been on, but now we're back with host Cathy Newman who is asking the audience what they want to hear. The next question is on the subject of crime. Should convicted terrorists serve the whole of their sentence without the chance of early release? Plaid Cymru's Adam Price answers first, saying ""public protection needs to be at the heart of the policy"". But he adds that, in the most recent case at London Bridge, the lessons will only be known once there has been an investigation into what happened. ""So I think it's important not to rush to judgement in terms of that specific case."" Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the most important thing is that the public are kept safe"". She says prisons are ""overstuffed"" and ""lots of people re-offend on petty crime doing time for that"". She gets a brief clap after saying that if convicted terrorists need to spend 10 or 20 years in prison ""they should do that"" - but adds that rehabilitation must be part of the justice system. Ms Rayner says that when people are allowed out, then ""they have to be watched and monitored"". Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says there must be a proper assessment ""before anyone is released"". ""One of those grieving parents, David Merritt, he has called on politicians not to politicise his son's death,"" says Ms Swinson. Ms Rayner interjects: ""That's why I didn't mention that."" Ms Swinson says she is angry at Boris Johnson for ignoring Mr Merritt's request. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tonight's 90-minute debate on everything other than Brexit has finished, with five of the main parties taking part. Here are some of the things we learnt: Addressing the question of trust, which was put to each of the candidates, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""Back in 2010, we got this fundamentally wrong on tuition fees."" Presenter Cathy Newman interjects to say the Lib Dems broke a promise. ""We did,"" Ms Swinson says. ""We absolutely got it wrong."" ""I remember the feeling that I had when I sat in the meeting and it became clear to me what was going to happen,"" she says, adding she felt ""nauseous"". ""I vowed that never again was I going to be in that situation without speaking out."" The Lib Dem leader says she's learned she needs to be ""really clear that what I say is what I can do"". Channel 4 Cathy Newman cites a poll commissioned by Channel 4 which found just 10% of people surveyed felt politicians had been honest and trustworthy during the election campaign. Questions from the audience centre on the trustworthiness of politicians. The SNP's Philippa Whitford says she thinks it is ""a shame we don't have a representative from the Conservatives"". ""You need to look back at people who you elected last time or in 2010. Did they deliver what they said then? ""The Conservatives said that they would deliver 5,000 extra GPs but actually there's fewer."" Asked when was the last time that she lied, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""I have been known to be less than frank with my son about how many chocolate biscuits are left, it has to be said."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson comes under fire from her counterparts as she talks about poverty and hunger. She says there's still ""much more money"" that needs to go intouniversal credit - the major (and heavily criticised) welfare reform launched in 2010. And she tells a story about her child's school, which has started handing out bagels before classes begin in the morning to ensure no child starts the day hungry. The Lib Dems don't want to scrap universal credit - but Ms Swinson says she wants to see the policy of limiting welfare benefits to two children scrapped - something she describes as ""one of those cruellest measures"". Labour's Angela Rayner then interrupts her to say: ""You can't go here saying 'this is terrible, this is terrible', you voted for austerity, you created the bedroom tax."" (If you need a reminder, the so-called bedroom tax, introduced during the coalition government, sees working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need). Angela Rayner says Ms Swinson ""voted for austerity"" ""They don't want a bagel, they want a decent job so they can feed their own children!"" Ms Rayner says. ""They do, they do,"" Ms Swinson replies, adding that she's been ""very honest"" about the ""things we've got wrong"" in coalition. ""I'm absolutely sorry about the bedroom tax,"" she says. The SNP's Philippa Whitford joins in, saying ""wrong"" is wearing clothes that don't match and she says ""destroyed"" lives is ""a bit more than wrong"". Ms Swinson responds saying the Conservatives have showed ""many"" of their true colours after the coalition ended, adding she's sorry she didn't ""win all the battles"" when she was in government. We're back after another break (with some light relief with a trailer for the film Cats) and the next question for the five parties is on social care. A doctor from Bradford asks: ""We have an ageing population, do you think it is fair some people will have to sell their houses to pay for social care? ""We want a system where the funds can be there,"" says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""At the moment it is far too stretched. ""We need to have a mature debate across the country about how we are going to fund this. ""But we need to be able to do that on a cross-party basis, because this is a long-term issue."" Would she join Boris Johnson's cross-party social care talks? ""Absolutely,"" says Ms Swinson. Angela Rayner responds: ""I'm kind of hoping we'll be the one in government doing those discussions.""

He says he was ""astonished"" how the topic didn't come up in the BBC's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson last week. ""There seems to be a lot of rhetoric but not much substance,"" he says. Labour'sAngela Raynerpoints out that Friends of the Earth ranked her party's manifesto as the greenest. But Mr Bartley quickly intervenes to say Greenpeace gave his Green Party the highest score. ""No, we're ambitious Jonathan, come on side,"" Ms Rayner shoots back. The Lib Dem'sJo Swinsonsays it's false to present tackling environmental problems as expensive. ""Actually saving the planet needn't cost the earth,"" she says. ""It really can be a win-win for us to tackle this climate emergency."" She gives the example of how tackling air pollution can save money as it reduces health problems. Plaid Cymru'sAdam Priceis quizzed about a potential tax on meat and the impact that might have on Welsh beef. ""Farmers shouldn't be demonised here, farmers care deeply about the environment,"" he says. ""They can make a positive contribution to decarbonisation."" But he says the issue of climate change is ""bigger than party politics"". ""We agree with that!"" says the Greens' Mr Bartley. Reality Check Privatisation and the NHS and the amount of money that goes to private providers have been raised in the Channel 4 debate. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. Reality Check Asked about nurses, Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the government cut the nursing bursary"". Nursing bursaries were cut in England. There's been a fall in people accepting places on courses since 2016. They've gone up in Scotland and Wales where the bursary remains. Channel 4 Everyone's had a quick break while the adverts have been on, but now we're back with host Cathy Newman who is asking the audience what they want to hear. The next question is on the subject of crime. Should convicted terrorists serve the whole of their sentence without the chance of early release? Plaid Cymru's Adam Price answers first, saying ""public protection needs to be at the heart of the policy"". But he adds that, in the most recent case at London Bridge, the lessons will only be known once there has been an investigation into what happened. ""So I think it's important not to rush to judgement in terms of that specific case."" Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the most important thing is that the public are kept safe"". She says prisons are ""overstuffed"" and ""lots of people re-offend on petty crime doing time for that"". She gets a brief clap after saying that if convicted terrorists need to spend 10 or 20 years in prison ""they should do that"" - but adds that rehabilitation must be part of the justice system. Ms Rayner says that when people are allowed out, then ""they have to be watched and monitored"". Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says there must be a proper assessment ""before anyone is released"". ""One of those grieving parents, David Merritt, he has called on politicians not to politicise his son's death,"" says Ms Swinson. Ms Rayner interjects: ""That's why I didn't mention that."" Ms Swinson says she is angry at Boris Johnson for ignoring Mr Merritt's request. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tonight's 90-minute debate on everything other than Brexit has finished, with five of the main parties taking part. Here are some of the things we learnt: Addressing the question of trust, which was put to each of the candidates, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""Back in 2010, we got this fundamentally wrong on tuition fees."" Presenter Cathy Newman interjects to say the Lib Dems broke a promise. ""We did,"" Ms Swinson says. ""We absolutely got it wrong."" ""I remember the feeling that I had when I sat in the meeting and it became clear to me what was going to happen,"" she says, adding she felt ""nauseous"". ""I vowed that never again was I going to be in that situation without speaking out."" The Lib Dem leader says she's learned she needs to be ""really clear that what I say is what I can do"". Channel 4 Cathy Newman cites a poll commissioned by Channel 4 which found just 10% of people surveyed felt politicians had been honest and trustworthy during the election campaign. Questions from the audience centre on the trustworthiness of politicians. The SNP's Philippa Whitford says she thinks it is ""a shame we don't have a representative from the Conservatives"". ""You need to look back at people who you elected last time or in 2010. Did they deliver what they said then? ""The Conservatives said that they would deliver 5,000 extra GPs but actually there's fewer."" Asked when was the last time that she lied, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""I have been known to be less than frank with my son about how many chocolate biscuits are left, it has to be said."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson comes under fire from her counterparts as she talks about poverty and hunger. She says there's still ""much more money"" that needs to go intouniversal credit - the major (and heavily criticised) welfare reform launched in 2010. And she tells a story about her child's school, which has started handing out bagels before classes begin in the morning to ensure no child starts the day hungry. The Lib Dems don't want to scrap universal credit - but Ms Swinson says she wants to see the policy of limiting welfare benefits to two children scrapped - something she describes as ""one of those cruellest measures"". Labour's Angela Rayner then interrupts her to say: ""You can't go here saying 'this is terrible, this is terrible', you voted for austerity, you created the bedroom tax."" (If you need a reminder, the so-called bedroom tax, introduced during the coalition government, sees working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need). Angela Rayner says Ms Swinson ""voted for austerity"" ""They don't want a bagel, they want a decent job so they can feed their own children!"" Ms Rayner says. ""They do, they do,"" Ms Swinson replies, adding that she's been ""very honest"" about the ""things we've got wrong"" in coalition. ""I'm absolutely sorry about the bedroom tax,"" she says. The SNP's Philippa Whitford joins in, saying ""wrong"" is wearing clothes that don't match and she says ""destroyed"" lives is ""a bit more than wrong"". Ms Swinson responds saying the Conservatives have showed ""many"" of their true colours after the coalition ended, adding she's sorry she didn't ""win all the battles"" when she was in government. We're back after another break (with some light relief with a trailer for the film Cats) and the next question for the five parties is on social care. A doctor from Bradford asks: ""We have an ageing population, do you think it is fair some people will have to sell their houses to pay for social care? ""We want a system where the funds can be there,"" says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""At the moment it is far too stretched. ""We need to have a mature debate across the country about how we are going to fund this. ""But we need to be able to do that on a cross-party basis, because this is a long-term issue."" Would she join Boris Johnson's cross-party social care talks? ""Absolutely,"" says Ms Swinson. Angela Rayner responds: ""I'm kind of hoping we'll be the one in government doing those discussions."" She adds that the discussion about social care is ""not just an economic argument"". She says ""it's about what type of country"" we want to be. ""When my nan was dying of cancer she said if I was a dog, you'd put me down,"" Ms Rayner adds. ""No old person should feel that way."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price wants social care to be funded in the same way as the NHS, by taxation. He asks Ms Rayner: ""Will you commit to free social personal care in Wales?"" She replies that Wales would have the funding to do that. The SNP's Philippa Whitford, who spent years working as a breast cancer surgeon on the NHS, says: ""You can't sort the problems in the NHS unless you're sorting the problems in social care."" She says: ""Free personal care is something that is cost-effective in the picture of the whole of the NHS. ""But it's also about the dignity of citizens."" Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party is pledging free personal care for the over 65s. But he says there is a wider discussion which will require some ""bold"" political decisions. ""We have got to talk about wealth and how we get that wealth back from the rampant inequality,"" he says. Reality Check The Channel 4 debate has been addressing a question on sentencing and prison numbers. The prison population in England and Wales is around 83,000, which is around 8,000 above the prisons service's own overcrowding limits. Channel 4 Another short break and the next question facing the party representatives is: ""Should we be taxing the top 5% earners more?"" The audience member might be referring to Labour's policy of raising income taxes for people earning over Â£80,000(you're in the top 5% of income taxpayers if your salary is Â£81,000 and above). ""Well you won't be shocked from me to say, yes,"" says Labour's Angela Rayner. She says she believes the country ""won't mind paying a little bit more"" if it means helping others such as the four million children living in poverty. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Angela Rayner go on to clash over whether their parties have costed some of their plans. ""You're making a plan for policies that if you get into government you cannot deliver,"" says Ms Swinson, while Ms Rayner says the Lib Dems' plan for free child care is not costed. Meanwhile, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party would save money by - among other policies - not renewing Trident nuclear deterrent, or through fossil fuel subsidies. ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now,"" he adds. Reality Check Angela Rayner says there are ""four million children living in poverty in our country"". There's no single measure of poverty but it's true to say there are around four million children living in low-income households, and it has increased slightly in the last few years. The question of how to tackle climate change is up next. The Greens'Jonathan Bartleysays he wants to see a carbon tax and wants the UK to be carbon-free by 2030.

""One of those grieving parents, David Merritt, he has called on politicians not to politicise his son's death,"" says Ms Swinson. Ms Rayner interjects: ""That's why I didn't mention that."" Ms Swinson says she is angry at Boris Johnson for ignoring Mr Merritt's request. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tonight's 90-minute debate on everything other than Brexit has finished, with five of the main parties taking part. Here are some of the things we learnt: Addressing the question of trust, which was put to each of the candidates, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""Back in 2010, we got this fundamentally wrong on tuition fees."" Presenter Cathy Newman interjects to say the Lib Dems broke a promise. ""We did,"" Ms Swinson says. ""We absolutely got it wrong."" ""I remember the feeling that I had when I sat in the meeting and it became clear to me what was going to happen,"" she says, adding she felt ""nauseous"". ""I vowed that never again was I going to be in that situation without speaking out."" The Lib Dem leader says she's learned she needs to be ""really clear that what I say is what I can do"". Channel 4 Cathy Newman cites a poll commissioned by Channel 4 which found just 10% of people surveyed felt politicians had been honest and trustworthy during the election campaign. Questions from the audience centre on the trustworthiness of politicians. The SNP's Philippa Whitford says she thinks it is ""a shame we don't have a representative from the Conservatives"". ""You need to look back at people who you elected last time or in 2010. Did they deliver what they said then? ""The Conservatives said that they would deliver 5,000 extra GPs but actually there's fewer."" Asked when was the last time that she lied, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""I have been known to be less than frank with my son about how many chocolate biscuits are left, it has to be said."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson comes under fire from her counterparts as she talks about poverty and hunger. She says there's still ""much more money"" that needs to go intouniversal credit - the major (and heavily criticised) welfare reform launched in 2010. And she tells a story about her child's school, which has started handing out bagels before classes begin in the morning to ensure no child starts the day hungry. The Lib Dems don't want to scrap universal credit - but Ms Swinson says she wants to see the policy of limiting welfare benefits to two children scrapped - something she describes as ""one of those cruellest measures"". Labour's Angela Rayner then interrupts her to say: ""You can't go here saying 'this is terrible, this is terrible', you voted for austerity, you created the bedroom tax."" (If you need a reminder, the so-called bedroom tax, introduced during the coalition government, sees working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need). Angela Rayner says Ms Swinson ""voted for austerity"" ""They don't want a bagel, they want a decent job so they can feed their own children!"" Ms Rayner says. ""They do, they do,"" Ms Swinson replies, adding that she's been ""very honest"" about the ""things we've got wrong"" in coalition. ""I'm absolutely sorry about the bedroom tax,"" she says. The SNP's Philippa Whitford joins in, saying ""wrong"" is wearing clothes that don't match and she says ""destroyed"" lives is ""a bit more than wrong"". Ms Swinson responds saying the Conservatives have showed ""many"" of their true colours after the coalition ended, adding she's sorry she didn't ""win all the battles"" when she was in government. We're back after another break (with some light relief with a trailer for the film Cats) and the next question for the five parties is on social care. A doctor from Bradford asks: ""We have an ageing population, do you think it is fair some people will have to sell their houses to pay for social care? ""We want a system where the funds can be there,"" says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""At the moment it is far too stretched. ""We need to have a mature debate across the country about how we are going to fund this. ""But we need to be able to do that on a cross-party basis, because this is a long-term issue."" Would she join Boris Johnson's cross-party social care talks? ""Absolutely,"" says Ms Swinson. Angela Rayner responds: ""I'm kind of hoping we'll be the one in government doing those discussions."" She adds that the discussion about social care is ""not just an economic argument"". She says ""it's about what type of country"" we want to be. ""When my nan was dying of cancer she said if I was a dog, you'd put me down,"" Ms Rayner adds. ""No old person should feel that way."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price wants social care to be funded in the same way as the NHS, by taxation. He asks Ms Rayner: ""Will you commit to free social personal care in Wales?"" She replies that Wales would have the funding to do that. The SNP's Philippa Whitford, who spent years working as a breast cancer surgeon on the NHS, says: ""You can't sort the problems in the NHS unless you're sorting the problems in social care."" She says: ""Free personal care is something that is cost-effective in the picture of the whole of the NHS. ""But it's also about the dignity of citizens."" Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party is pledging free personal care for the over 65s. But he says there is a wider discussion which will require some ""bold"" political decisions. ""We have got to talk about wealth and how we get that wealth back from the rampant inequality,"" he says. Reality Check The Channel 4 debate has been addressing a question on sentencing and prison numbers. The prison population in England and Wales is around 83,000, which is around 8,000 above the prisons service's own overcrowding limits. Channel 4 Another short break and the next question facing the party representatives is: ""Should we be taxing the top 5% earners more?"" The audience member might be referring to Labour's policy of raising income taxes for people earning over Â£80,000(you're in the top 5% of income taxpayers if your salary is Â£81,000 and above). ""Well you won't be shocked from me to say, yes,"" says Labour's Angela Rayner. She says she believes the country ""won't mind paying a little bit more"" if it means helping others such as the four million children living in poverty. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Angela Rayner go on to clash over whether their parties have costed some of their plans. ""You're making a plan for policies that if you get into government you cannot deliver,"" says Ms Swinson, while Ms Rayner says the Lib Dems' plan for free child care is not costed. Meanwhile, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party would save money by - among other policies - not renewing Trident nuclear deterrent, or through fossil fuel subsidies. ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now,"" he adds. Reality Check Angela Rayner says there are ""four million children living in poverty in our country"". There's no single measure of poverty but it's true to say there are around four million children living in low-income households, and it has increased slightly in the last few years. The question of how to tackle climate change is up next. The Greens'Jonathan Bartleysays he wants to see a carbon tax and wants the UK to be carbon-free by 2030. He says he was ""astonished"" how the topic didn't come up in the BBC's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson last week. ""There seems to be a lot of rhetoric but not much substance,"" he says. Labour'sAngela Raynerpoints out that Friends of the Earth ranked her party's manifesto as the greenest. But Mr Bartley quickly intervenes to say Greenpeace gave his Green Party the highest score. ""No, we're ambitious Jonathan, come on side,"" Ms Rayner shoots back. The Lib Dem'sJo Swinsonsays it's false to present tackling environmental problems as expensive. ""Actually saving the planet needn't cost the earth,"" she says. ""It really can be a win-win for us to tackle this climate emergency."" She gives the example of how tackling air pollution can save money as it reduces health problems. Plaid Cymru'sAdam Priceis quizzed about a potential tax on meat and the impact that might have on Welsh beef. ""Farmers shouldn't be demonised here, farmers care deeply about the environment,"" he says. ""They can make a positive contribution to decarbonisation."" But he says the issue of climate change is ""bigger than party politics"". ""We agree with that!"" says the Greens' Mr Bartley. Reality Check Privatisation and the NHS and the amount of money that goes to private providers have been raised in the Channel 4 debate. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. Reality Check Asked about nurses, Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the government cut the nursing bursary"". Nursing bursaries were cut in England. There's been a fall in people accepting places on courses since 2016. They've gone up in Scotland and Wales where the bursary remains. Channel 4 Everyone's had a quick break while the adverts have been on, but now we're back with host Cathy Newman who is asking the audience what they want to hear. The next question is on the subject of crime. Should convicted terrorists serve the whole of their sentence without the chance of early release? Plaid Cymru's Adam Price answers first, saying ""public protection needs to be at the heart of the policy"". But he adds that, in the most recent case at London Bridge, the lessons will only be known once there has been an investigation into what happened. ""So I think it's important not to rush to judgement in terms of that specific case."" Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the most important thing is that the public are kept safe"". She says prisons are ""overstuffed"" and ""lots of people re-offend on petty crime doing time for that"". She gets a brief clap after saying that if convicted terrorists need to spend 10 or 20 years in prison ""they should do that"" - but adds that rehabilitation must be part of the justice system. Ms Rayner says that when people are allowed out, then ""they have to be watched and monitored"". Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says there must be a proper assessment ""before anyone is released"". ""One of those grieving parents, David Merritt, he has called on politicians not to politicise his son's death,"" says Ms Swinson. Ms Rayner interjects: ""That's why I didn't mention that.""

Read the story in full here. During an election campaign, politicians of all stripes are keen to get their faces in as many places as possible - and today was no exception. They may not quite matchOscar selfie standards, but here's what today's leaders had to offer: Boris Johnson snapped a photo with his cabinet colleagues during a campaigning session at the Conservative Party's headquarters in London. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson stopped for a snap as she took to the streets in Sheffield for a canvassing session. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn posed with supporters at a party rally in Colwyn Bay, north Wales. James Cleverly says an investigation into prejudice in his party will get under way before the end of the year. Philippa Whitford, who is the SNP's health spokesperson in Westminster, says the problem with children living in poverty is that ""it will affect their entire lives"". Allow Twitter content?

Tonight's 90-minute debate on everything other than Brexit has finished, with five of the main parties taking part. Here are some of the things we learnt: Addressing the question of trust, which was put to each of the candidates, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""Back in 2010, we got this fundamentally wrong on tuition fees."" Presenter Cathy Newman interjects to say the Lib Dems broke a promise. ""We did,"" Ms Swinson says. ""We absolutely got it wrong."" ""I remember the feeling that I had when I sat in the meeting and it became clear to me what was going to happen,"" she says, adding she felt ""nauseous"". ""I vowed that never again was I going to be in that situation without speaking out."" The Lib Dem leader says she's learned she needs to be ""really clear that what I say is what I can do"". Channel 4 Cathy Newman cites a poll commissioned by Channel 4 which found just 10% of people surveyed felt politicians had been honest and trustworthy during the election campaign. Questions from the audience centre on the trustworthiness of politicians. The SNP's Philippa Whitford says she thinks it is ""a shame we don't have a representative from the Conservatives"". ""You need to look back at people who you elected last time or in 2010. Did they deliver what they said then? ""The Conservatives said that they would deliver 5,000 extra GPs but actually there's fewer."" Asked when was the last time that she lied, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""I have been known to be less than frank with my son about how many chocolate biscuits are left, it has to be said."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson comes under fire from her counterparts as she talks about poverty and hunger. She says there's still ""much more money"" that needs to go intouniversal credit - the major (and heavily criticised) welfare reform launched in 2010. And she tells a story about her child's school, which has started handing out bagels before classes begin in the morning to ensure no child starts the day hungry. The Lib Dems don't want to scrap universal credit - but Ms Swinson says she wants to see the policy of limiting welfare benefits to two children scrapped - something she describes as ""one of those cruellest measures"". Labour's Angela Rayner then interrupts her to say: ""You can't go here saying 'this is terrible, this is terrible', you voted for austerity, you created the bedroom tax."" (If you need a reminder, the so-called bedroom tax, introduced during the coalition government, sees working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need). Angela Rayner says Ms Swinson ""voted for austerity"" ""They don't want a bagel, they want a decent job so they can feed their own children!"" Ms Rayner says. ""They do, they do,"" Ms Swinson replies, adding that she's been ""very honest"" about the ""things we've got wrong"" in coalition. ""I'm absolutely sorry about the bedroom tax,"" she says. The SNP's Philippa Whitford joins in, saying ""wrong"" is wearing clothes that don't match and she says ""destroyed"" lives is ""a bit more than wrong"". Ms Swinson responds saying the Conservatives have showed ""many"" of their true colours after the coalition ended, adding she's sorry she didn't ""win all the battles"" when she was in government. We're back after another break (with some light relief with a trailer for the film Cats) and the next question for the five parties is on social care. A doctor from Bradford asks: ""We have an ageing population, do you think it is fair some people will have to sell their houses to pay for social care? ""We want a system where the funds can be there,"" says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""At the moment it is far too stretched. ""We need to have a mature debate across the country about how we are going to fund this. ""But we need to be able to do that on a cross-party basis, because this is a long-term issue."" Would she join Boris Johnson's cross-party social care talks? ""Absolutely,"" says Ms Swinson. Angela Rayner responds: ""I'm kind of hoping we'll be the one in government doing those discussions."" She adds that the discussion about social care is ""not just an economic argument"". She says ""it's about what type of country"" we want to be. ""When my nan was dying of cancer she said if I was a dog, you'd put me down,"" Ms Rayner adds. ""No old person should feel that way."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price wants social care to be funded in the same way as the NHS, by taxation. He asks Ms Rayner: ""Will you commit to free social personal care in Wales?"" She replies that Wales would have the funding to do that. The SNP's Philippa Whitford, who spent years working as a breast cancer surgeon on the NHS, says: ""You can't sort the problems in the NHS unless you're sorting the problems in social care."" She says: ""Free personal care is something that is cost-effective in the picture of the whole of the NHS. ""But it's also about the dignity of citizens."" Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party is pledging free personal care for the over 65s. But he says there is a wider discussion which will require some ""bold"" political decisions. ""We have got to talk about wealth and how we get that wealth back from the rampant inequality,"" he says. Reality Check The Channel 4 debate has been addressing a question on sentencing and prison numbers. The prison population in England and Wales is around 83,000, which is around 8,000 above the prisons service's own overcrowding limits. Channel 4 Another short break and the next question facing the party representatives is: ""Should we be taxing the top 5% earners more?"" The audience member might be referring to Labour's policy of raising income taxes for people earning over Â£80,000(you're in the top 5% of income taxpayers if your salary is Â£81,000 and above). ""Well you won't be shocked from me to say, yes,"" says Labour's Angela Rayner. She says she believes the country ""won't mind paying a little bit more"" if it means helping others such as the four million children living in poverty. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Angela Rayner go on to clash over whether their parties have costed some of their plans. ""You're making a plan for policies that if you get into government you cannot deliver,"" says Ms Swinson, while Ms Rayner says the Lib Dems' plan for free child care is not costed. Meanwhile, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party would save money by - among other policies - not renewing Trident nuclear deterrent, or through fossil fuel subsidies. ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now,"" he adds. Reality Check Angela Rayner says there are ""four million children living in poverty in our country"". There's no single measure of poverty but it's true to say there are around four million children living in low-income households, and it has increased slightly in the last few years. The question of how to tackle climate change is up next. The Greens'Jonathan Bartleysays he wants to see a carbon tax and wants the UK to be carbon-free by 2030. He says he was ""astonished"" how the topic didn't come up in the BBC's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson last week. ""There seems to be a lot of rhetoric but not much substance,"" he says. Labour'sAngela Raynerpoints out that Friends of the Earth ranked her party's manifesto as the greenest. But Mr Bartley quickly intervenes to say Greenpeace gave his Green Party the highest score. ""No, we're ambitious Jonathan, come on side,"" Ms Rayner shoots back. The Lib Dem'sJo Swinsonsays it's false to present tackling environmental problems as expensive. ""Actually saving the planet needn't cost the earth,"" she says. ""It really can be a win-win for us to tackle this climate emergency."" She gives the example of how tackling air pollution can save money as it reduces health problems. Plaid Cymru'sAdam Priceis quizzed about a potential tax on meat and the impact that might have on Welsh beef. ""Farmers shouldn't be demonised here, farmers care deeply about the environment,"" he says. ""They can make a positive contribution to decarbonisation."" But he says the issue of climate change is ""bigger than party politics"". ""We agree with that!"" says the Greens' Mr Bartley. Reality Check Privatisation and the NHS and the amount of money that goes to private providers have been raised in the Channel 4 debate. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. Reality Check Asked about nurses, Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the government cut the nursing bursary"". Nursing bursaries were cut in England. There's been a fall in people accepting places on courses since 2016. They've gone up in Scotland and Wales where the bursary remains. Channel 4 Everyone's had a quick break while the adverts have been on, but now we're back with host Cathy Newman who is asking the audience what they want to hear. The next question is on the subject of crime. Should convicted terrorists serve the whole of their sentence without the chance of early release? Plaid Cymru's Adam Price answers first, saying ""public protection needs to be at the heart of the policy"". But he adds that, in the most recent case at London Bridge, the lessons will only be known once there has been an investigation into what happened. ""So I think it's important not to rush to judgement in terms of that specific case."" Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the most important thing is that the public are kept safe"". She says prisons are ""overstuffed"" and ""lots of people re-offend on petty crime doing time for that"". She gets a brief clap after saying that if convicted terrorists need to spend 10 or 20 years in prison ""they should do that"" - but adds that rehabilitation must be part of the justice system. Ms Rayner says that when people are allowed out, then ""they have to be watched and monitored"". Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says there must be a proper assessment ""before anyone is released"". ""One of those grieving parents, David Merritt, he has called on politicians not to politicise his son's death,"" says Ms Swinson. Ms Rayner interjects: ""That's why I didn't mention that."" Ms Swinson says she is angry at Boris Johnson for ignoring Mr Merritt's request. Â© 2025 BBC.

Police probe alleged fraud at exams authority,"A police investigation has been launched into an alleged internal financial fraud at the Scottish Qualifications Authority. The probe relates to the quango's Glasgow office and the allegation is understood to involve a six-figure sum of money. The SQA said a ""suspected case of financial irregularity"" had been referred to the police. Police Scotland was first made aware of the fraud claims in June last year. The SQA's latest accounts refer to an ""instance of suspected financial irregularity"" and the 2017-18 report also highlights two cases of suspected financial irregularity which were under investigation internally. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said the force had ""received reports of possible fraudulent activities linked to a business in Glasgow"". She added: ""The circumstances are currently being investigated and no further comment will be made until this is complete."" A spokesman for the SQA said: ""A suspected case of financial irregularity has been referred to Police Scotland for investigation. ""It would be inappropriate for us to comment further."" Meanwhile, in a separate development, the authority has been forced to disclose details about the travel expenses of senior executives after theSunday Mail,externalraised the matter with the Scottish Information Commissioner. The SQA had argued publishing such details would put the security of its travelling staff at risk but the commissioner ruled publication was in the public interest. The paper's investigation highlighted a number of trips, including one for three executives to Saudi Arabia in 2015 which cost Â£17,000. It reportedly involved business class flights and a stay at ""one of the most luxurious hotels in the world"".

They may not quite matchOscar selfie standards, but here's what today's leaders had to offer: Boris Johnson snapped a photo with his cabinet colleagues during a campaigning session at the Conservative Party's headquarters in London. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson stopped for a snap as she took to the streets in Sheffield for a canvassing session. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn posed with supporters at a party rally in Colwyn Bay, north Wales. James Cleverly says an investigation into prejudice in his party will get under way before the end of the year. Philippa Whitford, who is the SNP's health spokesperson in Westminster, says the problem with children living in poverty is that ""it will affect their entire lives"". Allow Twitter content?

Tonight's 90-minute debate on everything other than Brexit has finished, with five of the main parties taking part. Here are some of the things we learnt: Addressing the question of trust, which was put to each of the candidates, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""Back in 2010, we got this fundamentally wrong on tuition fees."" Presenter Cathy Newman interjects to say the Lib Dems broke a promise. ""We did,"" Ms Swinson says. ""We absolutely got it wrong."" ""I remember the feeling that I had when I sat in the meeting and it became clear to me what was going to happen,"" she says, adding she felt ""nauseous"". ""I vowed that never again was I going to be in that situation without speaking out."" The Lib Dem leader says she's learned she needs to be ""really clear that what I say is what I can do"". Channel 4 Cathy Newman cites a poll commissioned by Channel 4 which found just 10% of people surveyed felt politicians had been honest and trustworthy during the election campaign. Questions from the audience centre on the trustworthiness of politicians. The SNP's Philippa Whitford says she thinks it is ""a shame we don't have a representative from the Conservatives"". ""You need to look back at people who you elected last time or in 2010. Did they deliver what they said then? ""The Conservatives said that they would deliver 5,000 extra GPs but actually there's fewer."" Asked when was the last time that she lied, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says: ""I have been known to be less than frank with my son about how many chocolate biscuits are left, it has to be said."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson comes under fire from her counterparts as she talks about poverty and hunger. She says there's still ""much more money"" that needs to go intouniversal credit - the major (and heavily criticised) welfare reform launched in 2010. And she tells a story about her child's school, which has started handing out bagels before classes begin in the morning to ensure no child starts the day hungry. The Lib Dems don't want to scrap universal credit - but Ms Swinson says she wants to see the policy of limiting welfare benefits to two children scrapped - something she describes as ""one of those cruellest measures"". Labour's Angela Rayner then interrupts her to say: ""You can't go here saying 'this is terrible, this is terrible', you voted for austerity, you created the bedroom tax."" (If you need a reminder, the so-called bedroom tax, introduced during the coalition government, sees working-age families in council or housing association homes docked housing benefit if they are deemed to have more bedrooms than they need). Angela Rayner says Ms Swinson ""voted for austerity"" ""They don't want a bagel, they want a decent job so they can feed their own children!"" Ms Rayner says. ""They do, they do,"" Ms Swinson replies, adding that she's been ""very honest"" about the ""things we've got wrong"" in coalition. ""I'm absolutely sorry about the bedroom tax,"" she says. The SNP's Philippa Whitford joins in, saying ""wrong"" is wearing clothes that don't match and she says ""destroyed"" lives is ""a bit more than wrong"". Ms Swinson responds saying the Conservatives have showed ""many"" of their true colours after the coalition ended, adding she's sorry she didn't ""win all the battles"" when she was in government. We're back after another break (with some light relief with a trailer for the film Cats) and the next question for the five parties is on social care. A doctor from Bradford asks: ""We have an ageing population, do you think it is fair some people will have to sell their houses to pay for social care? ""We want a system where the funds can be there,"" says Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""At the moment it is far too stretched. ""We need to have a mature debate across the country about how we are going to fund this. ""But we need to be able to do that on a cross-party basis, because this is a long-term issue."" Would she join Boris Johnson's cross-party social care talks? ""Absolutely,"" says Ms Swinson. Angela Rayner responds: ""I'm kind of hoping we'll be the one in government doing those discussions."" She adds that the discussion about social care is ""not just an economic argument"". She says ""it's about what type of country"" we want to be. ""When my nan was dying of cancer she said if I was a dog, you'd put me down,"" Ms Rayner adds. ""No old person should feel that way."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price wants social care to be funded in the same way as the NHS, by taxation. He asks Ms Rayner: ""Will you commit to free social personal care in Wales?"" She replies that Wales would have the funding to do that. The SNP's Philippa Whitford, who spent years working as a breast cancer surgeon on the NHS, says: ""You can't sort the problems in the NHS unless you're sorting the problems in social care."" She says: ""Free personal care is something that is cost-effective in the picture of the whole of the NHS. ""But it's also about the dignity of citizens."" Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party is pledging free personal care for the over 65s. But he says there is a wider discussion which will require some ""bold"" political decisions. ""We have got to talk about wealth and how we get that wealth back from the rampant inequality,"" he says. Reality Check The Channel 4 debate has been addressing a question on sentencing and prison numbers. The prison population in England and Wales is around 83,000, which is around 8,000 above the prisons service's own overcrowding limits. Channel 4 Another short break and the next question facing the party representatives is: ""Should we be taxing the top 5% earners more?"" The audience member might be referring to Labour's policy of raising income taxes for people earning over Â£80,000(you're in the top 5% of income taxpayers if your salary is Â£81,000 and above). ""Well you won't be shocked from me to say, yes,"" says Labour's Angela Rayner. She says she believes the country ""won't mind paying a little bit more"" if it means helping others such as the four million children living in poverty. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Angela Rayner go on to clash over whether their parties have costed some of their plans. ""You're making a plan for policies that if you get into government you cannot deliver,"" says Ms Swinson, while Ms Rayner says the Lib Dems' plan for free child care is not costed. Meanwhile, Green Party co-leader Jonathan Bartley says his party would save money by - among other policies - not renewing Trident nuclear deterrent, or through fossil fuel subsidies. ""If the climate were a bank, we would have bailed it out by now,"" he adds. Reality Check Angela Rayner says there are ""four million children living in poverty in our country"". There's no single measure of poverty but it's true to say there are around four million children living in low-income households, and it has increased slightly in the last few years. The question of how to tackle climate change is up next. The Greens'Jonathan Bartleysays he wants to see a carbon tax and wants the UK to be carbon-free by 2030. He says he was ""astonished"" how the topic didn't come up in the BBC's head-to-head debate between Jeremy Corbyn and Boris Johnson last week. ""There seems to be a lot of rhetoric but not much substance,"" he says. Labour'sAngela Raynerpoints out that Friends of the Earth ranked her party's manifesto as the greenest. But Mr Bartley quickly intervenes to say Greenpeace gave his Green Party the highest score. ""No, we're ambitious Jonathan, come on side,"" Ms Rayner shoots back. The Lib Dem'sJo Swinsonsays it's false to present tackling environmental problems as expensive. ""Actually saving the planet needn't cost the earth,"" she says. ""It really can be a win-win for us to tackle this climate emergency."" She gives the example of how tackling air pollution can save money as it reduces health problems. Plaid Cymru'sAdam Priceis quizzed about a potential tax on meat and the impact that might have on Welsh beef. ""Farmers shouldn't be demonised here, farmers care deeply about the environment,"" he says. ""They can make a positive contribution to decarbonisation."" But he says the issue of climate change is ""bigger than party politics"". ""We agree with that!"" says the Greens' Mr Bartley. Reality Check Privatisation and the NHS and the amount of money that goes to private providers have been raised in the Channel 4 debate. Out of a budget of more than Â£120bn a year, 7.3% was spent on private providers in England in 2017-18, according to government accounts. That's up from 5.3% in 2011-12. Reality Check Asked about nurses, Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the government cut the nursing bursary"". Nursing bursaries were cut in England. There's been a fall in people accepting places on courses since 2016. They've gone up in Scotland and Wales where the bursary remains. Channel 4 Everyone's had a quick break while the adverts have been on, but now we're back with host Cathy Newman who is asking the audience what they want to hear. The next question is on the subject of crime. Should convicted terrorists serve the whole of their sentence without the chance of early release? Plaid Cymru's Adam Price answers first, saying ""public protection needs to be at the heart of the policy"". But he adds that, in the most recent case at London Bridge, the lessons will only be known once there has been an investigation into what happened. ""So I think it's important not to rush to judgement in terms of that specific case."" Labour's Angela Rayner says ""the most important thing is that the public are kept safe"". She says prisons are ""overstuffed"" and ""lots of people re-offend on petty crime doing time for that"". She gets a brief clap after saying that if convicted terrorists need to spend 10 or 20 years in prison ""they should do that"" - but adds that rehabilitation must be part of the justice system. Ms Rayner says that when people are allowed out, then ""they have to be watched and monitored"". Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson says there must be a proper assessment ""before anyone is released"". ""One of those grieving parents, David Merritt, he has called on politicians not to politicise his son's death,"" says Ms Swinson. Ms Rayner interjects: ""That's why I didn't mention that."" Ms Swinson says she is angry at Boris Johnson for ignoring Mr Merritt's request. Â© 2025 BBC.

Dozens dead in Delhi bag factory fire,"This video can not be played The blaze broke out in a cramped corner of India's capital A large fire has swept through a bag factory in the Indian capital Delhi, killing 43 workers, officials say. The blaze broke out at the four-storey building in the city's congested old quarter early on Sunday morning. At least 100 people were sleeping inside the factory, which mainly makes school bags, when the fire started. More than 60 have been rescued. Prime Minister Narendra Modi called the fire ""horrific"" and sent his condolences. A local fire chief told BBC Hindi the building did not have a proper fire licence and was operating illegally as a factory. Local media reported that the owner of the factory, named as Rehan, had been arrested. One firefighter, Rajesh Shukla, washailed as a ""hero"" for saving 11 people,external- despite suffering injuries himself. This video can not be played The BBC spoke to victims' families, including a woman whose brother was in the factory as his child was born Delhi's firefighters received the first call about the fire at 05:22 local time on Sunday (23:52 GMT Saturday). The fire began on the lower storeys, spreading rapidly to the third floor where workers were sleeping. ""We woke up with cries and shouts for help,"" said Ronak Khan, a 17-year-old living next door. ""I saw people trapped. We asked them to come to the rooftop so that we could rescue them but they were not able to come up."" The area where the factory is located - Azad Market - is a web of narrow alleyways, which made it difficult to reach the blaze. Rescuers had to carry out victims on their shoulders one-by-one with firefighters cutting away window grills to access the building. Hidden lives behind India's construction boom The Mumbai fires people forgot about Seventeen die in Delhi hotel fire It is not clear what caused the blaze but an investigation has been ordered. An initial probe and eyewitnesses suggested a short circuit may have been to blame. Grief-stricken Mohammad Haider was close to his brother By Anant Prakash, BBC Hindi, Lok Nayak hospital, Delhi Mohammad Haider's brother Bablu worked in the factory. Haider says he rushed there and was told: ""Your brother has been saved."" ""I was relieved and rescued three to four other people. ""But then I learned that my brother was actually inside. Afterwards, I found him lying in the mortuary."" Mohammad Haider is shaking. Two other men are trying to console him. ""I had never thought that my brother would be separated from me this way,"" he says. ""Bablu used to inform me about everything in his life, whatever he was up to. ""Even when the fire started, he called me and said, 'Brother, please save me'. But I could not save him."" Victims' relatives have been scrambling for information. One man told India's PTI agency his brother was inside. ""I got a call from his friend informing that he has been injured in the incident. I have no clue which hospital he has been taken to,"" he said. Indian cities have often seen deadly fires, with poor planning and lax enforcement of safety regulations major factors. A cause for the blaze is yet to be determined Large crowds gathered nearby after the fire broke out Indian politicians have been expressing their horror at the blaze. ""The fire in Delhi's Anaj Mandi on Rani Jhansi Road is extremely horrific,"" Prime Minister Modi tweeted. ""My thoughts are with those who lost their loved ones. Wishing the injured a quick recovery. Authorities are providing all possible assistance at the site of the tragedy."" Home Minister Amit Shah called it a ""tragic loss of precious lives"".

Parties in final campaign push as election nears,"The main political party leaders are continuing to push their election pledges to voters, as the campaign enters its final few days. Conservative leader Boris Johnson says in an open letter that Thursday's poll is ""historic"" and a choice to ""move forwards"" after Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""chance to vote for hope"" and he had ""the most ambitious plan to transform our country in decades"". The UK goes to the polls on Thursday. Ahead of this, the candidates are travelling around the country in a bid to spread their election messages. Among the manifesto pledges being highlighted by the main UK parties on Sunday are: A Conservative promise to introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system to control unskilled migration A Labour plan to ""head off the social care crisis"" by offering free personal care for older people in England and an additional Â£10bn of funds by 2023-24 A ""regional rebalancing"" programme from the Lib Dems, which would see Â£50bn invested in infrastructure outside of London Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is warning that ""the very future of Scotland"" is at stake in the election. She is appealing to voters to back her party ""to escape Brexit, protect the NHS, and to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"". How do election spending plans compare? Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide A really simple guide to the UK general election LIVE: Election campaign And Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told Sky News her party was looking to make ""real progress"" by increasing its number of MPs on Thursday. She added: ""We will be absolutely working to stop Brexit, doing so in a co-operative way with others who share our values and share that goal."" Inhis letter to voters published in the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Johnson says the election will be one that ""shapes future decades"", urging voters to create a ""working Conservative majority government that will get Brexit done, end the uncertainty and allow Britain to move on"". The Conservatives have released some details about how their points-based immigration system would work. Writing in the Sunday Express, Home Secretary Priti Patel,external, said it would start in January 2021 and aimed to ""attract the best talent that our country and economy needs, while reducing overall numbers"". There would be fast-track entry to the UK for entrepreneurs and some people working for the NHS, and sector-specific schemes for low or unskilled workers to meet labour market shortages. The prime minister and members of the cabinet visited the Conservative Party's headquarters Speaking to Sky News, Mr Johnson declined to say if he would resign if he failed to win a majority in the House of Commons. He said: ""What I'm going to do is concentrate on the five days before us, because that is what I think the people of this country would expect."" In the same interview, the prime ministerinsisted there would not be any checks for goodstravelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain under his Brexit deal. A leaked Treasury analysis document was ""wrong"" to suggest this would be the case, he said. And in a short speech at the Conservative Party's headquarters, Mr Johnson warned his supporters that the ""horses can still change places"" in the final week of the campaign, saying: ""This is a close-fought election."" Jeremy Corbyn spoke at a rally at Bangor University in north Wales Meanwhile, Labour is restating its plan to help alleviate pressure in social care through the introduction of free personal care for older people. The party says its new funding will help working-age adults and pensioners with care costs, which will also be capped under the proposals. According to the King's Fund,external, providing free personal care would require an additional Â£6bn on top of planned spending by 2020-21, taking the social care budget to roughly Â£26bn. Labour is also talking about its own research on the issue, which it says shows 9,290 people have approached their local authority since April 2017 for help with care costs after draining their savings. At a rally at Bangor University in north Wales, Mr Corbyn attacked ""cruel"" Universal Credit - which his party has said it would scrap. He also repeated his pledge to compensate so-called Waspi women, who lost out on years of state pension payments when the retirement age was raised under the coalition government. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that Labour would ""transform our economy"" if it won a parliamentary majority at the election. He added: ""I want to make sure our economy works for everybody... It means transforming capitalism into a new form."" Mr Johnson says he wants to focus on people's priorities, including urgent investment in the NHS and action on the cost of living. Speaking ahead of the last stretch on the campaign trail, Mr Corbyn said Mr Johnson ""cannot be trusted to deliver Brexit, or anything else"". He said Labour would ""rescue"" the NHS and ""get Brexit sorted"". Jo Swinson has been campaigning in Sheffield Elsewhere, the Lib Dems said their plans would ""address the historic investment disparities between our nations and regions"". Its plans would boost railway electrification, increase the availability of charging points for electric vehicles and improve broadband access, the party added. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said: ""Neither Labour or the Tories can square their spending promises today with the cost of Brexit. They are writing promises on cheques that will bounce. ""Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit so we can invest billions across the UK, helping to tackle ingrained inequality."" On the campaign trail in Sheffield, Liberal Democrat leader Ms Swinson also encouraged her supporters to make a final push for votes, telling them: ""When you wake up and deliver those 'good mornings' when there's frost on the ground, I want you to know that everything that you do will make that difference.""

Are political clubs still political?,"On a street in the Nottinghamshire town of Arnold, there is a Liberal club, a Labour club and a Conservative club, all within a five-minute walk of one another. But how much do the people who patronise these establishments actually care about politics? There's an intense silence among the members of Arnold's Balfour Conservative Club as the president calls out numbers. That's because Wednesday night is bingo night - and bingo night is taken seriously. Certainly more seriously than politics. In the lull between the rounds, 82-year-old Shirley Wilmot, who has always voted Labour, says she's never really thought about the club's Conservative connections. ""I'm a member of the Liberal club and the Labour club as well,"" she says. ""But this is my favourite because it's so friendly. ""I go to the Liberal on a Saturday because they have two artists on, here on the Wednesday for the bingo and the Labour club on Sunday for the dinner. They're not political places."" The Labour club is seen by its regulars as a handy place to go for a cheap pint served by friendly staff Just down the road at the Arnold Labour Club, president John Wood, 60, would agree with that sentiment. He says its link to the party ended about 10 years ago and that the association had become ""damaging"". He is even looking to change the club's name. Of the nine people asked at the Labour club, not one could say they would definitely vote for the Labour Party, and a few know they certainly will not. Among them is Ann Rogers, 50, a member of a motorbike group which meets there weekly. ""I come for the friendly people and the amazing bar staff,"" she says. ""I've been here for four years and never heard anyone talk about politics. It's just a name over the door. It doesn't matter if you support Labour or Conservative, you're welcome here. ""I used to be an avid Labour supporter and always voted for them. I voted for them last election. But not this time. It's hard for me but I feel they've let us down, and I don't like Jeremy Corbyn."" Mr Wood says the club and local party used to support one another financially and political meetings were once held here. But he understands they went their separate ways well before he took over two years ago. He says some of his regulars refuse to become full club members because of the name and he has even been denied loans from banks and grants for renovation work because of the perceived political ties. ""I couldn't be tied to any party,"" Mr Wood says. ""The only one I've ever supported is UKIP. But I don't get involved and we never talk politics."" Instead, they host events ranging from coffee mornings for the elderly and a Parkinson's support group, to weddings and weekly discos. Inside are four rooms, each with its own bar. One room is dominated by a snooker table, and another has a skittles alley where members sometimes play against members of the Conservative club and the Liberal club - although the rivalry isn't fuelled by differing political allegiances. Alex Hunt says he has no idea who he will vote for on 12 December One of the team members is 27-year-old handyman Alex Hunt. Snooker cue in hand, he says: ""I love the company, all my friends are here, it's lively and you can drink. ""I used to be a member of the Liberal and Conservative club but they don't have the same atmosphere."" And what about politics? ""I've not got a clue who I'm voting for this election,"" he says. ""I don't know anything about politics. It just doesn't matter to me."" The club's bar manager, Paula Martin, says she gets a call about twice a month from people asking to speak to the local Labour candidate. A man came in a couple of weeks ago asking why there were no pictures at the club of the candidate, she says. ""I told him it's just not like that any more."" At both the Labour and Conservative clubs, located either side of an Asda supermarket, members pay Â£10 to join in their first year and Â£5 every year after In the Conservative club, there's also an absence of political chat and certainly no division along party lines. Indeed, a number of the Labour club's members and some of its bar staff are here to play ""sticky 13s"", a form of card bingo popular in Nottingham pubs. Unlike its Labour counterpart, the Balfour Conservative Club is still affiliated to the political party and pays an annual subscription to the Association of Conservative Clubs. Its rules state that every member should also be a member or supporter of the Conservative Party, but the secretary admits this is not something that is enforced these days. The same rulebook's stated aim is to ""promote the principles of Conservatism and the implementation of the Conservative Party's policies"", although this does not seem to go much further than hosting a few party meetings and a Christmas meal. The blue interior and a portrait of the early 20th Century prime minister Arthur Balfour suggest a Tory heritage - but one club member sitting below a picture of the Queen admits he now supports the Brexit Party. Club president Rob Whalley, 66, says the strength of its association with the Conservatives has weakened in the five decades he has been coming here. Club president Rob Whalley in front of a portrait of Arthur Balfour As he prepares to set up the bingo, he says: ""I don't talk politics at the club. The days when you were a member of just one of the political clubs are done. If we said you had to be a Conservative Party member to join, we'd have no-one in."" For the members, the subsidised pints, the friendly atmosphere, the snooker and pool tables seem to be the main draw. That's certainly the case for Labour supporter Andy Gallagher, who has come here for a game. ""This is the most convenient pool table - I don't care what the place is called,"" he says. ""I know I'm not the only Labour voter but we never discuss politics. ""If Boris Johnson walked in here I wouldn't talk to him but I'd not tell him to get out either."" Tony Barnsley: ""I do have a political opinion - I don't think politics works"" Back at the Labour club, 37-year-old industrial truck driver Tony Barnsley says he's been a member for the past four years, because the staff ""treat him well"" and ""pull a great pint of Stella"". But he has only voted once in his life, almost 20 years ago. ""If anyone tries to talk politics they walk out because no-one is bothered; they won't even listen to it,"" he says. ""If Jeremy Corbyn walked in here I'd say 'get me a drink'."" Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide What's the mood on the campaign trail?

General election 2019: A matter of mistrust?,"Are pork pies more common than humble pie in modern politics? Do party leaders and politicians - British ones, mind you, not just dodgy foreigners - ever lie? Well, you could perhaps duck the question and argue that our political leaders sometimes distort the truth. Or you could say they like to present only a useful portion of the whole picture. And you'd be right about that. But do they lie? Is the Queen's Speech required viewing in the Corbyn household? This week, if you even try to argue politicians never lie, you'd have to accept that Jeremy Corbyn, a dedicated, life-long republican, sits in front of the TV at home on 25 December and dutifully watches Her Majesty's Christmas message. Then you'd have to believe his loyal colleague Angela Rayner was right to say her boss maybe watched the Queen's Message on catch-up TV on Boxing Day. That was to explain Mr Corbyn's apparent claim that he somehow watched in the morning, hours before it's broadcast. What did the PM hear in Hertfordshire? Then, you'd need to accept Boris Johnson's word that, at the Nato summit in Hertfordshire on Friday, he had somehow never heard a word of his fellow national leaders huddling together in Buckingham Palace the previous evening, mocking US President Donald Trump. He was captured on camera standing with them at the time, and joining in the joke. I could go on. But I won't, because you'd arguably be asking the wrong question. Mr Johnson's critics coyly accuse him of maintaining a ""casual relationship with the truth"". But in fact it's fairer to say our politicians often have a transactional relationship with the truth. In different ways, they constantly trade-off their duty of service to honesty against their personal and political advantage and disadvantage. Sometimes it's a fine judgement. When it comes to such things as Mr Corbyn's viewing habits on Christmas Day, or whether Mr Johnson should have freely admitted gently mocking Donald Trump to the world's media at an international summit, how much do we really blame them? How high are Jo Swinson's hopes as the campaign comes to a close? If we're being honest, that is. So, maybe the real question this week is: has the line between truth and untruth been consciously blurred to the point that whatever may be left of any trust between people and politics is now in jeopardy? The answer to that, it's fair to argue this week, could be yes. If watching TV on Christmas Day or ducking a potentially embarrassing question about Mr Trump are forgivable, or a least understandable, the prime minister was taking a risk again on Sunday when he insisted in his Sky News interview with Sophy Ridge that there would be no border checks between Britain and the island of Ireland under his Brexit deal. Experts and his own fellow ministers admit that there'd have to be checks to comply with EU and international law, to guard against smuggling of endangered species, say, or unlawful trade with sanctioned regimes. They can't all be right. If Mr Johnson ends up back in office, and requiring the support of the Democratic Unionist Party to stay there, he'll have to confront the truth of this question and it won't be a comfortable moment. Mr Corbyn and his party's claim that Labour will tax only the richest 5% of society to pay for their expensive promises could also lead to a reckoning. The Institute for Fiscal Studies judges that the claim is implausible. John Swinney said Trident was a ""red line"" for the SNP All of this could perhaps be discounted were it not for the fact that the relationship between people and politics is already close to breaking point. A Kantar poll this week found around half (48%) of those intending to vote Conservative on Thursday felt the Tories were ""the best of a bad bunch"". About the same proportion (49%) said the same of Labour. The parties are running out of rope. To be fair, the Liberal Democrats' early campaign claim to be running to install Jo Swinson in Downing Street can't really be described as a lie. Just faintly absurd. She now says her aim is to make ""real progress"". In theory, the Lib Dems could gain only a small handful of seats on Thursday, even lose a couple, and still be very influential in a hung Parliament. And for the SNP, Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinneytold me on Pienaar's Politics on BBC 5 livethat his party's demand for unilateral nuclear disarmament and the removal of the Trident nuclear submarine base at Faslane would be a ""red line"" in negotiations with Labour, if Mr Corbyn ends up casting around for support. If it happens, that would be an interesting negotiation. Trace the leaders' travel map this week and Mr Johnson moved away from the North and towards the South-East and East for the first time. His poll ratings look reasonably good, but five of his six visits this week were to Conservative-held seats. Ms Swinson went to her first Lib Dem seat in Edinburgh West. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon visited her first Labour seat at Midlothian. Is there a subtext here? Meanwhile, Mr Corbyn prioritised visual impact over parliamentary maths. He spoke of big tech, for example, at an Amazon depot, and he talked about inequality in front of a statue of Robin Hood. Subtlety has its place. Just not on an election campaign.

Police probe alleged fraud at exams authorityAn investigation has been launched into an alleged six-figure fraud at the Scottish Qualifications Authority.,"A police investigation has been launched into an alleged internal financial fraud at the Scottish Qualifications Authority. The probe relates to the quango's Glasgow office and the allegation is understood to involve a six-figure sum of money. The SQA said a ""suspected case of financial irregularity"" had been referred to the police. Police Scotland was first made aware of the fraud claims in June last year. The SQA's latest accounts refer to an ""instance of suspected financial irregularity"" and the 2017-18 report also highlights two cases of suspected financial irregularity which were under investigation internally. A Police Scotland spokeswoman said the force had ""received reports of possible fraudulent activities linked to a business in Glasgow"". She added: ""The circumstances are currently being investigated and no further comment will be made until this is complete."" A spokesman for the SQA said: ""A suspected case of financial irregularity has been referred to Police Scotland for investigation. ""It would be inappropriate for us to comment further."" Meanwhile, in a separate development, the authority has been forced to disclose details about the travel expenses of senior executives after theSunday Mail,externalraised the matter with the Scottish Information Commissioner. The SQA had argued publishing such details would put the security of its travelling staff at risk but the commissioner ruled publication was in the public interest. The paper's investigation highlighted a number of trips, including one for three executives to Saudi Arabia in 2015 which cost Â£17,000. It reportedly involved business class flights and a stay at ""one of the most luxurious hotels in the world"".

Reality Check: Will there be NI-GB checks?,"The claim:Boris Johnson said goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain would only be checked if they are expected to be moved onwards into the Republic of Ireland. He told Sky News ""the only checks that there would be, would be if something was coming from GB via Northern Ireland and was going on to the Republic, then there might be checks at the border into Northern Ireland"". Reality Check verdict:Some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain will have to be checked even if they are staying in Northern Ireland. The Brexit Withdrawal Agreement signed in October means that Northern Ireland will remain part of a ""single regulatory zone"" with the Republic of Ireland, a zone that will apply EU rules. A Treasury documentleaked a few days agosuggested this would mean new checks on goods being traded between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. For example, the EU has particularly strict rules on importing ""products of animal origin"" - that is to say meat, fish and dairy products. Those products must enter the EU through a border inspection post where all shipments are subject to document checks and a high proportion are physically checked. Products of animal origin from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland would be subject to these checks whether they are destined to remain there or be moved to the Republic of Ireland. The island of Ireland is already a single regulatory zone for animal health. This means that all livestock entering Northern Ireland from GB is currently checked at the point of entry. What is in Boris Johnson's new deal with the EU? Johnson insists no NI-GB goods checks post-Brexit A few countries, such as New Zealand, have a deal with the EU where only 1% of consignments of meat and dairy product are checked. It is possible that the UK could negotiate a similar deal but it would not be able to get rid of checks entirely unless the whole of the UK was going to stay in the single market.

Parties in final campaign push,"The main political party leaders are continuing to push their election pledges to voters, as the campaign enters its final few days. Conservative leader Boris Johnson says in an open letter that Thursday's poll is ""historic"" and a choice to ""move forwards"" after Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""chance to vote for hope"" and he had ""the most ambitious plan to transform our country in decades"". The UK goes to the polls on Thursday. Ahead of this, the candidates are travelling around the country in a bid to spread their election messages. Among the manifesto pledges being highlighted by the main UK parties on Sunday are: A Conservative promise to introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system to control unskilled migration A Labour plan to ""head off the social care crisis"" by offering free personal care for older people in England and an additional Â£10bn of funds by 2023-24 A ""regional rebalancing"" programme from the Lib Dems, which would see Â£50bn invested in infrastructure outside of London Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is warning that ""the very future of Scotland"" is at stake in the election. She is appealing to voters to back her party ""to escape Brexit, protect the NHS, and to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"". How do election spending plans compare? Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide A really simple guide to the UK general election LIVE: Election campaign And Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told Sky News her party was looking to make ""real progress"" by increasing its number of MPs on Thursday. She added: ""We will be absolutely working to stop Brexit, doing so in a co-operative way with others who share our values and share that goal."" Inhis letter to voters published in the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Johnson says the election will be one that ""shapes future decades"", urging voters to create a ""working Conservative majority government that will get Brexit done, end the uncertainty and allow Britain to move on"". The Conservatives have released some details about how their points-based immigration system would work. Writing in the Sunday Express, Home Secretary Priti Patel,external, said it would start in January 2021 and aimed to ""attract the best talent that our country and economy needs, while reducing overall numbers"". There would be fast-track entry to the UK for entrepreneurs and some people working for the NHS, and sector-specific schemes for low or unskilled workers to meet labour market shortages. The prime minister and members of the cabinet visited the Conservative Party's headquarters Speaking to Sky News, Mr Johnson declined to say if he would resign if he failed to win a majority in the House of Commons. He said: ""What I'm going to do is concentrate on the five days before us, because that is what I think the people of this country would expect."" In the same interview, the prime ministerinsisted there would not be any checks for goodstravelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain under his Brexit deal. A leaked Treasury analysis document was ""wrong"" to suggest this would be the case, he said. And in a short speech at the Conservative Party's headquarters, Mr Johnson warned his supporters that the ""horses can still change places"" in the final week of the campaign, saying: ""This is a close-fought election."" Jeremy Corbyn spoke at a rally at Bangor University in north Wales Meanwhile, Labour is restating its plan to help alleviate pressure in social care through the introduction of free personal care for older people. The party says its new funding will help working-age adults and pensioners with care costs, which will also be capped under the proposals. According to the King's Fund,external, providing free personal care would require an additional Â£6bn on top of planned spending by 2020-21, taking the social care budget to roughly Â£26bn. Labour is also talking about its own research on the issue, which it says shows 9,290 people have approached their local authority since April 2017 for help with care costs after draining their savings. At a rally at Bangor University in north Wales, Mr Corbyn attacked ""cruel"" Universal Credit - which his party has said it would scrap. He also repeated his pledge to compensate so-called Waspi women, who lost out on years of state pension payments when the retirement age was raised under the coalition government. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that Labour would ""transform our economy"" if it won a parliamentary majority at the election. He added: ""I want to make sure our economy works for everybody... It means transforming capitalism into a new form."" Mr Johnson says he wants to focus on people's priorities, including urgent investment in the NHS and action on the cost of living. Speaking ahead of the last stretch on the campaign trail, Mr Corbyn said Mr Johnson ""cannot be trusted to deliver Brexit, or anything else"". He said Labour would ""rescue"" the NHS and ""get Brexit sorted"". Jo Swinson has been campaigning in Sheffield Elsewhere, the Lib Dems said their plans would ""address the historic investment disparities between our nations and regions"". Its plans would boost railway electrification, increase the availability of charging points for electric vehicles and improve broadband access, the party added. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said: ""Neither Labour or the Tories can square their spending promises today with the cost of Brexit. They are writing promises on cheques that will bounce. ""Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit so we can invest billions across the UK, helping to tackle ingrained inequality."" On the campaign trail in Sheffield, Liberal Democrat leader Ms Swinson also encouraged her supporters to make a final push for votes, telling them: ""When you wake up and deliver those 'good mornings' when there's frost on the ground, I want you to know that everything that you do will make that difference.""

Johnson insists no NI-GB goods checks post-Brexit,"Boris Johnson has insisted there will not be any checks for goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain under his Brexit deal. He told Sky News that a leaked Treasury analysis document was ""wrong"" to suggest this would be the case. His Brexit deal means there will be goods checks from GB to NI, but there has been confusion on whether there will be checks in the other direction. Labour said the PM's claims about his deal with the EU were ""fraudulent"". And DUP leader Arlene Foster said she still had concerns over the withdrawalagreement Mr Johnson reached with other European leadersin October. The comments come as the main political party leaders continue to push their pledges ahead of Thursday's general election. Reality Check: Will there be checks between GB and NI? PM 'misrepresenting' Brexit deal, says Corbyn LIVE: Final Sunday on the campaign trail General election 2019: A matter of mistrust? Under the PM's agreement, Northern Ireland would continue to follow many EU rules on food and manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK would not. Northern Ireland would also continue to follow EU customs rules but would remain part of the UK's customs territory. This video can not be played Brandon Lewis: 'We are not going to have a border down the Irish sea' A government risk assessmentpublished in October said it would lead to new administration and checks on goods from west to east. But Mr Johnson has insisted Northern Irish businesses will not be hit with additional paperwork or fees, telling a BBC phone-in during the election campaign: ""We will make sure that businesses face no extra costs and no checks for stuff being exported from NI to GB."" No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM NI firms to declare GB-bound goods under new deal He has said the only checks would be on British exports to the Republic of Ireland going via Northern Ireland. But the BBC's Northern Ireland business and economics editor John Campbell said these comments ""do not accurately reflect what is in the deal"" and, because of EU law, products would have to be checked even if they were not going on to the Republic of Ireland. Boris Johnson is right to say that under his Brexit deal goods travelling east - from Northern Ireland into Great Britain - would be treated differently from goods travelling west - from Great Britain into Northern Ireland. But he's wrong to say there will no checks in either direction. That assertion runs counter to what is written in his own withdrawal agreement. Businesses sending goods from Northern Ireland into Great Britain will have to fill out export declaration forms - only a small piece of online bureaucracy, but still different from goods travelling elsewhere within the UK. From Great Britain to Northern Ireland, though, tariffs will have to be paid on goods if their final destination is - or could be - the Republic of Ireland, inside the EU. This will necessitate some form of checks. It's also important to remember that checks aren't just about customs. Under the prime minister's deal, Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the rules of the EU single market for goods. And that means EU law requires checks on, for example, all food and animal products - at their point of entry. The more the UK diverges from EU rules, as Mr Johnson says he wants to be able to do, the more checks there will be. The internal Treasury document leaked on Friday laid all this out in more detail. The prime minister says it is all nonsense, but his own deal says something rather different. When asked on Sky News's Sophy Ridge on Sunday whether there would be checks, in light of the leaked Treasury document, Mr Johnson replied: ""No, absolutely not. ""The deal we've done with the EU is a brilliant deal and it allows us to do all the things that Brexit was about, so it's about taking back control of our borders, money, laws. ""But unlike the previous arrangements, it allows the whole of the UK to come out of the EU, including Northern Ireland, and the only checks that there would be would be if something was coming from GB via Northern Ireland and was going on to the Republic, then there might be checks at the border into Northern Ireland."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn reveals ""secret"" government Brexit report Asked if the government's document was therefore wrong and if his Brexit secretary - who in Octobersaid goods going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would be subject to exit declarations- was also wrong, Mr Johnson replied: ""Yes. ""Because there's no question of there being checks on goods going from NI to GB or GB to NI, because they are part of - if you look at what the deal is, we're part of the same customs territory and it's very clear that there should be unfettered access between Northern Ireland and the rest of GB. ""The only reason - this is another of these things that has been produced by the Labour Party as a kind of distraction."" Giving evidence to the House of Lords Exiting the EU committee in October, Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay initially said he did not believe exit forms would be necessary for trade between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. But he later conceded: ""The exit summary declarations will be required in terms of NI to GB."" When security minister Brandon Lewis was challenged on the subject of post-Brexit goods checks on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he said: ""We have some checks now, with customs and live animals, things like that. ""It's right that we continue that. But we've been very clear - there will be no border down the Irish Sea. ""The UK as a whole will leave the European Union together and, of course, Northern Ireland itself will have that self-determination around things as we go forward."" DUP leader Ms Foster told BBC 5 live's Pienaar's Politics her party had a ""large concern"" about how it would be determined which goods travelling through Northern Ireland had the Irish Republic as the final destination. ""By definition you would need checks to see that that happens,"" she said. ""There have been differing views even within the Conservative Party as to what it meant."" Ms Foster said there had to be ""clarity in relation to that for those of us living in Northern Ireland, because, of course, Great Britain is our largest market by far, and we need to be able to, from an economic point of view, know what it's going to mean for us in the future"". At a press conference in London on Friday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the 15-page Treasury document - entitled Northern Ireland Protocol: Unfettered Access to the UK Internal Market - disproved Mr Johnson's claims there would be no checks, and showed his claims about his own deal were ""fraudulent"". He said it was ""hard evidence"" NI would be ""symbolically separated"" from the rest of the UK after Brexit. ""What we have here is a confidential report by Johnson's own government, marked 'official', 'sensitive', that exposes the falsehoods that Boris Johnson has been putting forward,"" he said. ""This is cold, hard evidence that categorically shows the impact a damaging Brexit deal would have on large parts of our country, 15 pages that paint a damning picture of Johnson's deal on the issue of Northern Ireland in particular.""

Election spending plans compared,"TheInstitute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has been focusing on the spending pledgesfrom the Conservative Party, Labour Party and Liberal Democrats' manifestos. Even before the general election was called, the government had already set out plans for day-to-day public spending to rise by Â£34bn a year by 2024. So how much more do the parties intend to spend on top of these existing plans? Compared to Labour and the Liberal Democrats, the Conservative Party has set out the most modest plans for spending, by some distance. On top of existing government plans, the Conservatives are offering only an additional Â£2.9bn a year on day-to-day spending by 2024. Day-to-day spending is money that goes on wages and raw materials, like the cost of medicines and teachers' salaries. The single most expensive manifesto policy, coming in at Â£900m a year by 2024, is a planto increase the number of NHS nurses in England by 50,000.Out of this figure, the Conservatives say that 18,500 can be found by using policies to ensure fewer nurses leave the NHS. Day-to-day NHS spending in England would, under the Conservatives, increase by an average of 3.2% per year between now and 2024, the  IFS says. This is based on existing government plans to increase NHS spending by Â£20.5bn a year by 2024 (once adjusted for inflation). This particular spending commitment was announced before the election was called - so it is not costed in the manifesto. The IFS says the Conservatives' overall Â£2.9bn additional spending pledgewould leave spending on public services, apart from health, about 15% lower than it was at the start of the 2010s,,externalonce adjusted for inflation. As well as day-to-day spending, there is also spending on investment. This is money that goes on long-term things, like roads, bridges, school buildings and equipment. The Conservatives want an extra Â£8.1bn of investment spending, on top of current plans, by 2024. According to the IFS, this would be 15% higher than the Â£53.8bn pencilled in at the time of the last Budget. If delivered, it would be worth 2.4% of national income, higher than has been sustained at any point in the last 40 years. However, this is still smaller than the Labour and Lib Dems' proposals. Overall, the Conservatives are not intending to spend much more than what they have previously set out in government. But they argue that their spending plans are responsible and fully-costed. The Conservatives' plans will not change the overall tax take much: there will be modest reductions in National Insurance for individuals, but corporation tax cuts have been postponed. What is in the Conservative manifesto? Tory manifesto a 'steady as she goes' document The Labour Party has the most ambitious spending plan by far. By 2024, it would spend an additional Â£98bn a year on day-to-day expenditure, according to IFS analysis. Social care is the most expensive single Labour pledge, with Â£10.8bn being spent per year by 2024 to provide free personal care for over-65s in England. Another big ticket item is the cost of abolishing tuition fees and restoring maintenance grants, coming in at a net cost of Â£7.2bn by 2024. Since the publication of its manifesto, Labour has also announced a compensation package to women who lost out to changes in the state pension. Labourhas said its promise may cost Â£58bn- a figure which the IFS has since factored into its analysis, on the basis it is paid over four years. Paul Johnson, director of the IFS, told the BBC the compensation pledge ""drives a coach and horses"" through Labour's manifesto pledge to achieve a current budget surplus. That is when the amount of government revenue coming in matches the amount going on day-to-day spending. Why should we trust the IFS? Labour wants to increase spending on NHS England by an average of 3.8% a year, which is more generous than the Conservative Party. Labour would also double the level of spending on free childcare, the IFS says. According to the IFS analysis, Labour would also increase investment spending by Â£55bn a year, doubling current levels and substantially more than the Conservatives' offering. This includes the party's nationalisation plans on areas such as broadband. If Labour's plans are realised, overall spending would rise to a peacetime high. However, there is a question over whether such large sums of public sector spending could be ramped up so quickly. For example, are there enough people available to immediately start working on new investment projects? Labour plans the largest tax increases of all three parties. They are aimed at corporations and the wealthiest, although there has been debate about whether the burden will hit more than just the top 5% of earners. What is in the Labour manifesto? Labour's big-state, big-spend, transformation plan The Liberal Democrats have focused on childcare as their main area of spending. According to their own costings, they plan to spend an extra Â£13bn to provide free childcare in England by 2024. This would be more than four-and-a-half times higher than current plans. Overall, the party plans to spend an additional Â£37bn on day-to-day expenditure by 2024 - more than the Conservatives, but less than Labour. The Liberal Democrats have proposed an average increase of 3.7% a year on day-to-day NHS spending in England - similar to Labour's pledge and more than the Conservatives. Like the other two parties, the Lib Dems have also pledged a big increase in investment spending - an extra Â£26bn a year. Again, this places the party in-between the Conservative and Labour offerings. The Liberal Democrats will raise money by taxing income, frequent flyers and corporations. They say the rest of the cost will be met from the financial benefits of cancelling Brexit. Compared with Labour and the Conservatives plans, the IFS say the Lib Dems are the only party which would ""put debt on a decisively downward path"". What is in the Liberal Democrats manifesto?

Man missing overnight after two rescued in Clyde,"HM Coastguard and police are involved in the search off Gourock Rescuers have halted their search for a man missing in the Firth of Clyde on the west coast of Scotland. Two men were recovered from a vessel near Cardwell Bay, Gourock, on Saturday night. But one man, who was in a separate boat, has not been found during the search which has involved an RNLI lifeboat and coastguard helicopter. The Maritime and Coastguard Agency (MCA) said it had ""terminated"" the operation pending further information. The alarm was raised at about 23:35 on Saturday when Greenock Coastguard were called to two small drifting vessels. Two men aged 33 and 36 were helped from one of the boats by Helensburgh RNLI lifeboat. They were passed into the care of the Scottish Ambulance Service and the lifeboat returned to search for the third man on the second boat. A coastguard search and rescue helicopter, Police Scotland, Ministry of Defence police and coastguard teams from Kilgreggan and Greenock also joined the search. A RNLI spokesman said weather conditions at the time were poor with heavy rain, force five to seven winds and poor visibility. The search was stood down at 04:00 due to darkness and weather conditions,according to Greenock Coastguard,external. It resumed on Sunday though stormy weather conditions meant the helicopter could not take part. An MCA spokeswoman said they had carried out an extensive search of both shorelines in the area up towards the Erskine Bridge. However, the missing man had not been found. ""The decision has been taken to terminate the search, pending any further information,"" she added. ""Our thoughts are with the family at this time.""

"PM: We must find source of UK-US trade document leakLabour says the documents show the NHS would be ""for sale"" under a post-Brexit trade deal with the US.Election 2019","Jeremy Corbyn holds up the leaked documents at a press conference on 27 November Boris Johnson has said an investigation is needed into the source of leaked documents on UK-US trade negotiations posted on Reddit.

Parties in final campaign push as election nearsThe leaders make fresh appeals to voters - defining the poll as a chance to set the UK's future direction.,"The main political party leaders are continuing to push their election pledges to voters, as the campaign enters its final few days. Conservative leader Boris Johnson says in an open letter that Thursday's poll is ""historic"" and a choice to ""move forwards"" after Brexit. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was a ""chance to vote for hope"" and he had ""the most ambitious plan to transform our country in decades"". The UK goes to the polls on Thursday. Ahead of this, the candidates are travelling around the country in a bid to spread their election messages. Among the manifesto pledges being highlighted by the main UK parties on Sunday are: A Conservative promise to introduce an Australian-style points-based immigration system to control unskilled migration A Labour plan to ""head off the social care crisis"" by offering free personal care for older people in England and an additional Â£10bn of funds by 2023-24 A ""regional rebalancing"" programme from the Lib Dems, which would see Â£50bn invested in infrastructure outside of London Meanwhile, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon is warning that ""the very future of Scotland"" is at stake in the election. She is appealing to voters to back her party ""to escape Brexit, protect the NHS, and to put Scotland's future in Scotland's hands"". How do election spending plans compare? Who should I vote for? Election 2019 manifesto guide A really simple guide to the UK general election LIVE: Election campaign And Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson told Sky News her party was looking to make ""real progress"" by increasing its number of MPs on Thursday. She added: ""We will be absolutely working to stop Brexit, doing so in a co-operative way with others who share our values and share that goal."" Inhis letter to voters published in the Mail on Sunday,external, Mr Johnson says the election will be one that ""shapes future decades"", urging voters to create a ""working Conservative majority government that will get Brexit done, end the uncertainty and allow Britain to move on"". The Conservatives have released some details about how their points-based immigration system would work. Writing in the Sunday Express, Home Secretary Priti Patel,external, said it would start in January 2021 and aimed to ""attract the best talent that our country and economy needs, while reducing overall numbers"". There would be fast-track entry to the UK for entrepreneurs and some people working for the NHS, and sector-specific schemes for low or unskilled workers to meet labour market shortages. The prime minister and members of the cabinet visited the Conservative Party's headquarters Speaking to Sky News, Mr Johnson declined to say if he would resign if he failed to win a majority in the House of Commons. He said: ""What I'm going to do is concentrate on the five days before us, because that is what I think the people of this country would expect."" In the same interview, the prime ministerinsisted there would not be any checks for goodstravelling from Northern Ireland to Great Britain under his Brexit deal. A leaked Treasury analysis document was ""wrong"" to suggest this would be the case, he said. And in a short speech at the Conservative Party's headquarters, Mr Johnson warned his supporters that the ""horses can still change places"" in the final week of the campaign, saying: ""This is a close-fought election."" Jeremy Corbyn spoke at a rally at Bangor University in north Wales Meanwhile, Labour is restating its plan to help alleviate pressure in social care through the introduction of free personal care for older people. The party says its new funding will help working-age adults and pensioners with care costs, which will also be capped under the proposals. According to the King's Fund,external, providing free personal care would require an additional Â£6bn on top of planned spending by 2020-21, taking the social care budget to roughly Â£26bn. Labour is also talking about its own research on the issue, which it says shows 9,290 people have approached their local authority since April 2017 for help with care costs after draining their savings. At a rally at Bangor University in north Wales, Mr Corbyn attacked ""cruel"" Universal Credit - which his party has said it would scrap. He also repeated his pledge to compensate so-called Waspi women, who lost out on years of state pension payments when the retirement age was raised under the coalition government. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell BBC One's Andrew Marr Show that Labour would ""transform our economy"" if it won a parliamentary majority at the election. He added: ""I want to make sure our economy works for everybody... It means transforming capitalism into a new form."" Mr Johnson says he wants to focus on people's priorities, including urgent investment in the NHS and action on the cost of living. Speaking ahead of the last stretch on the campaign trail, Mr Corbyn said Mr Johnson ""cannot be trusted to deliver Brexit, or anything else"". He said Labour would ""rescue"" the NHS and ""get Brexit sorted"". Jo Swinson has been campaigning in Sheffield Elsewhere, the Lib Dems said their plans would ""address the historic investment disparities between our nations and regions"". Its plans would boost railway electrification, increase the availability of charging points for electric vehicles and improve broadband access, the party added. Liberal Democrat deputy leader Ed Davey said: ""Neither Labour or the Tories can square their spending promises today with the cost of Brexit. They are writing promises on cheques that will bounce. ""Every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit so we can invest billions across the UK, helping to tackle ingrained inequality."" On the campaign trail in Sheffield, Liberal Democrat leader Ms Swinson also encouraged her supporters to make a final push for votes, telling them: ""When you wake up and deliver those 'good mornings' when there's frost on the ground, I want you to know that everything that you do will make that difference.""
