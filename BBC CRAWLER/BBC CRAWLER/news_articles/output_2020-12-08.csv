England schools can shut for Christmas a day early,"Schools in England will be allowed to close a day early for Christmas to give teachers ""a proper break"" from identifying potential Covid-19 cases. Schools minister Nick Gibb told MPs that schools could schedule an inset day next Friday to allow ""six clear days"" before Christmas Eve. He said this would ensure teachers and heads do not have to engage with ""track and trace issues"" throughout the break. Teachers unions have been calling for flexibility over school term dates. Last month, the government had told schools in England not to change their Christmas holidays or close early this termin its Covid-19 Winter Plan.,external Government resists calls to shut England's schools What's happening with next year's exams? Speaking to a virtual education select committee, Mr Gibb said: ""We are about to announce that inset days can be used on Friday December 18, even if an inset day had not been originally scheduled for that day. ""We want there to be a clear six days so that, by the time we reach Christmas Eve, staff can have a proper break without having to engage in the track and trace issues."" Inset days - or in-service training days - mean teachers will be in schools for professional development but pupils will be absent. Unions have been asking for the government to give schools the flexibility to switch to remote learning for the final few days of term and reduce the risk of pupils and staff having to self-isolate over Christmas. Mr Gibb said that the government wanted schools to stay open until the end of term as it was the ""best place for young people for their education"", development and for their mental health. But he added: ""We want to make sure that they (school staff) can have a proper break over Christmas. We know they've been under huge stress. ""I don't think some of these senior leadership teams of schools have had a break at all since the pandemic began."" Schools will be allowed to finish term on Thursday next week, but there may be one less scheduled inset day in 2021 if they decide to do this, Mr Gibb added. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL), described the announcement of an inset day as a ""small concession"", saying they had hoped for ""more flexibility than has been granted"". ""A single day is better than nothing, but it still means that school and college leaders will have to continue contact tracing in the event of positive cases through to Wednesday December 23,"" he said. ""It also leaves them responsible, at very short notice, for informing families that they will need to self-isolate over the Christmas period."" He added that it was ""frustrating"" the government had taken so long to agree the decision as there was ""so little time left for schools to make the necessary arrangements"". Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT school leaders' union, said the move could still be ""insufficient"" to meet the needs of some families and schools. He added: ""A chaotic and disruptive end of term is still possible, especially in areas where there are large numbers of Covid cases and high levels of staff and pupil absence already.""

Queen seen with family for first time in pandemic,"Three generations of royals gathered at Windsor for a festive carol service The Queen has appeared alongside several other senior royals for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began. The monarch, 94, welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle following their royal train tour. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also attended the socially-distanced Christmas carol concert within the castle's grounds. The Earl and Countess of Wessex and Princess Anne were also there. It was confirmed last week that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburghwill spend Christmas ""quietly"" at Windsor, rather than Her Majesty's private estate at Sandringham in Norfolk. And rather than a gathering of senior royals as is traditional, the Queen and Prince Phillip, 99, will spend the festive period alone after considering ""all the appropriate advice"", according to Buckingham Palace. ""Like everyone they hope things will get back to normal in 2021,"" a palace spokesman said at the time. The Cambridge's trip on the royal trainsaw them thank key workers, volunteers and communities in Scotland, England and Wales. While there was veiled criticism from Welsh and Scottish ministers over its timing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the tour as a ""welcome morale boost"", No 10 said. On Tuesday, Prince William and Catherine told students in Cardiff they were still wrestling with their Christmas plans and had yet to decide where or with whom they would be. The couple have previously spent the festive period with Catherine's parents at their home in Berkshire. On the final day of their zig-zag three-day tour of Britain, the couple met undergraduates to hear about their mental health challenges during the pandemic in Wales, and they spoke with NHS workers in Reading. The Queen thanked the Salvation Army and other local volunteers at Tuesday evening's service at Windsor Castle At the end of Tuesday's performance, the Queen, chatted to her family in turn and as she turned to walk up the steps back inside the castle, Prince William said: ""Bye gran."" Commissioners Anthony and Gillian Cotterill, territorial leaders for The Salvation Army in the UK and Republic of Ireland, also came forward to speak to the Queen, who told them ""nobody's allowed to sing anymore"". Choirs are allowed to perform in the open air and Princess Anne told her mother: ""Oh, we can sing outside."" The Queen spoke animatedly to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall Mr Cotterill said afterwards: ""The Queen was saying she was just so happy we were able to play some carols because she thinks this will be the only time she'll be able to hear carols, and she was disappointed we didn't sing. "" ""Sometimes we're playing musicians and other times we're a choir. At an event like this, it's better to have the band as you can hear it for miles."" The Salvation Army's Regent Hall Band, based in London's busy Oxford Street, played Hark The Herald Angels Sing and The First Noel for the royal family. Mrs Cotterill added: ""I did see the Queen mouthing some of the words - so that was nice.""

Honda pauses production after UK port woes,"Japanese carmaker Honda has warned that production at its Swindon plant will be disrupted, after transport problems caused a shortage of parts. The plant operates on a ""just in time"" production system, where parts arrive at the factory when they are needed. Honda has told employees that it is currently experiencing vessel delays and congestion at UK ports. It will pause production on Wednesday ""due to transport-related parts delay"", the car giant said. ""The situation is currently being monitored with a view to restart production as soon as possible,"" Honda said. It is looking at other arrangements such as air freight. Congestion at UK container ports has been building up in recent weeks, causing problems initially at Felixstowe, but recently at Southampton and London Gateway as well. Port troubles leave UK bookseller with no books Swindon Honda closure date 'set in stone' The backlog has built up as companies increased orders after the initial pandemic lockdown, while some have looked to stockpile goods before the end of the Brexit transition period. Problems at the UK's container ports have been building up for weeks. Businesses have been complaining about consignments being delayed, or even ending up on the wrong side of the channel. Now a major manufacturer has admitted production will be disrupted. So what's gone wrong? Issues at Felixstowe, Britain's biggest container port have been evident for some time - blamed by hauliers on a vehicle booking system that they claimed simply didn't work, preventing them getting into the port. The Covid outbreak has also caused problems - which were exacerbated when thousands of containers of PPE imported on behalf of the government were simply left within the port for weeks, adding to the gridlock. And after the lockdown in the first half of the year, the volume of goods being imported has been much higher than normal. Congestion at Felixstowe has pushed more container traffic to Southampton and London Gateway - and now the situation in both of those ports is also reportedly getting worse. Honda is looking at air freight to ease its supply problems. The chances are other businesses may have to do the same. Congestion at England's ports is now so bad that some shipping firms have limited the amount of cargo they will bring to the UK. Consignments have reportedly been offloaded at continental ports such as Antwerp, Rotterdam and Zeebrugge. In a statement, Honda said: ""Honda of the UK Manufacturing has confirmed to employees that production will not run on Wednesday 9 December due to transport-related parts delays.""

Londoners 'must stick to rules' amid tier 3 fears,"This video can not be played Sadiq Khan: ""None of us want tier 3"" Londoners have been urged to ""stick by the rules"" amid fears the capital may be put into tier three restrictions following a rise in Covid-19 cases. Three in four of the capital's boroughsregistered an increase in coronavirus cases in the week to 4 December. Outer London now has a higher infection rate than some areas in tier three, according to Public Health England (PHE) figures. Officials are due to meet on 16 December to review the tier system. London has been under tier two restrictions since 2 December, after the month-long England wide lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked on an LBC radio phone-in whether the capital was close to going into tier three . ""My message to everybody in London is let's stick by the rules and not push the boundaries of the rules,"" he said. ""The case numbers are going up in parts of London, in parts of Essex, in parts of Kent, and we know what happens when case numbers go up, sadly more people end up in hospital and more people end up dying."" Mayor of London Sadiq Khan also called for people to ""continue to follow the rules"". PHE data shows 21 of London's 32 boroughs have infection rates higher than overall rate for England of 150 cases per 100,000 people. Taken together, London's outer boroughs have an infection rate of 205 cases per 100,000 - higher than the current rate in Leicestershire, Tees Valley or Bristol, all of which are in tier three restrictions. Should London be split into different Covid tiers? One London restaurant owner said entering tier three during Christmas ""could be the last nail in our coffin"". Under the rules, pubs and restaurants are allowed to open for a takeaway service only. Suleman Raza, who was named Curry King of the year in 2019, said: ""We've already lost so much business throughout the year we needed Christmas to be busy. ""We were looking forward to Christmas covering our losses."" Suleman Raza runs several restaurants in south and west London Robin Smith, chair of Berwick Street Traders, said ""if we go into tier three the West End is screwed"". Mr Smith, who owns several businesses in Soho, said ""we've nearly been getting back to business and getting money coming in this last week"". He added: ""If we lose it now we're done for. Soho and the West End has no residential base, so we're reliant on people coming in to shop, eat and use the hotels."" Shoppers embraced a pedestrianised Regent Street in central London on the first weekend of tier two restrictions Mr Khan said he was ""really worried"" about the impact moving into tier three would have on hospitality and shops. ""What none of us wants is to go into tier three. What none of us wants is for the virus to continue to spread,"" the mayor said. He added it was particularly worrying that the latest increase in numbers had come during the last national lockdown and he had spoken to the health secretary and borough leaders about the issue. Matt Hancock called on Londoners to ""stick by the rules"" to prevent more people ending up in hospital By Rob England, BBC England Data Unit Areas in the South East and London are now regularly seeing some of the highest coronavirus infection rates in England. Thirteen out of the 20 places with the highest rates were from these regions in the week to 4 December. A month ago, no areas from these regions were in the top 100. Kent accounts for eight of those 13 areas, with Swale currently seeing the highest infection rate in England of about 604 cases per 100,000 people. For context, the rate across England overall was just over 150 per 100,000 over the same period. In London, the borough of Havering saw the highest rate at 362 per 100,000 - and climbing. The virus in these regions seems to have been spreading prior to England's second national lockdown, with cases increasing three to four weeks ago. Many parts of the country saw a drop or levelling off in infections for a few weeks after this point, but more recently the virus has started to spread again. Shoppers flocked to high streets and shopping malls across London on the first weekend after restrictions eased but in numberswell below pre-pandemic levels. Any effect of an increase in contacts between people will not be seen for several days. Deaths of patients with coronavirus in London have dropped drastically from early April's peak. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for PHE, said: ""The latest data shows case rates are on the increase again in most London boroughs, including in the at-risk over 60s. ""Covid-19 behaves like clockwork - the more contact we have with others, the higher the chance of us catching or spreading the virus. ""If we want to keep infections down, every one of us needs to remain vigilant and follow the rules as we go about shopping, eating out or meeting friends outdoors.""

Biden vows 100m vaccinations in first 100 days,"This video can not be played ""Masking, vaccinations, opening schools"": Joe Biden's key goals for his first 100 days US President-elect Joe Biden has set a goal of 100 million Covid vaccinations in his first 100 days in office. He said his first months in office would not end the outbreak and gave few details on a rollout plan but he said he would change the course of Covid-19. Introducing his health team for when he takes office on 20 January, he urged Americans to ""mask up for 100 days"". On Tuesday, a report paved the way for a Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine to be approved and rolled out for Americans. Emergency authorisation for its use could be issued by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Thursday, with the country's top infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci sayingmass vaccination could start as soon as next week. Also on Tuesday, President Donald Trump attended a summit at the White House of his Covid-19 vaccination programme, Operation Warp Speed, and hailed the expected approval of vaccines. His administration hopes to vaccinate as many as 24 million people by mid-January. The US has recorded more than 15 million cases so far and 285,000 deaths,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external, both global highs. Many parts of the country are seeing peak infections, with record numbers of people in hospital, with some experts blaming travel by millions over the recent Thanksgiving holiday. Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US How many doses will be given to each US state Where has been hit hardest? At a news conference on Tuesday, Mr Biden laid out how he plans to address the pandemic in his first 100 days in office. That period is traditionally seen as a benchmark for new presidents to make their mark with new policies and ideas. He vowed to get ""at least 100 million Covid vaccine shots into the arms of the American people"". ""My first 100 days won't end the Covid-19 virus. I can't promise that. But we did not get into this mess quickly. We're not going to get out of it quickly,"" he said at the event in Delaware, giving few details of how the largest vaccination programme in US history would be carried out. This video can not be played One travel nurse's journey to US Covid hotspots Last week, Mr Biden complained he had been given no rollout plans by the Trump administration. Operation Warp Speed's top scientist Moncef Slaoui has still to meet the Biden team and is expected to do so this week. Getting children back to school would also be a priority, the president-elect said. Mr Biden also introduced California Attorney General Xavier Becerra as his nomination for health secretary and his choice of Rochelle Walensky as head of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Among his other aides will be Dr Anthony Fauci as chief Covid medical adviser. The expert also advised the Trump team and often fell foul of the president for his views. Getting 100 million vaccines to Americans in just over three months is not expected to be easy. The large geographical size of the US and the logistics of rolling out a new vaccine could present challenges in achieving the goal. Helen Branswell, senior writer on global health at US-based website Stat News, has described Mr Biden's plan as ""potentially realistic"" if the supplies of the drug are available and Mr Trump successfully begins the vaccination programme before his term ends. ""I think the early part of the vaccine delivery programme is going to be very bumpy in the US so by the time he [Mr Biden] takes office some of those bumps may have been levelled out a bit,"" Ms Branswell told the BBC. This video can not be played Five challenges of distributing a Covid-19 vaccine around the world Dr Fauci suggested the plan was ""bold but doable"", warning ""the road ahead will not be easy"". By comparison, 51.8% of Americans older than six months were vaccinated against flu in 2019-20,according to the CDC,external. The US population is 316 million people, which means that around 158 million people were given flu jabs between July 2019 and May 2020. In the UK, the government says it aims to vaccinate 800,000 people over the next few weeks after it beganthe world's first approved rollout of the vaccine. The event was mainly a celebration of Operation Warp Speed's efforts to get a vaccine to the American people. President Trump said of the expected vaccine approvals: ""They say it's somewhat of a miracle and I think that's true."" He added: ""Every American who wants the vaccine will be able to get the vaccine and we think by spring we're going to be in a position nobody would have believed possible just a few months ago."" This video can not be played Trump: ""Every American who wants the Covid vaccine will get it"" The president also signed an executive order aimed at ensuring that Americans had first priority in receiving doses. But it remains unclear how that will affect contracts that US companies have already signed with other countries. The Trump administration did sign up for an initial 100 million doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine but a member of the Pfizer board said the chance to buy more was turned down a number of times and more doses might not be available until June. The Operation Warp Speed team said its policy was to deal with a number of manufacturers of vaccines. US media reported the executive order reflected concern that supplies might not be enough. On Tuesday, US regulators confirmed the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine was 95% effective, paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use. The FDA found no safety concerns to stop approval of the vaccine. Although two doses are needed to offer full protection, the first jab prevented 89% of the most severe cases. Some side-effects such as redness or swelling at the injection site, short-term fatigue, headaches and muscle-pain were reported but were considered mild. US biotech firm Moderna has reported similar successes with its vaccine and it is also expected to get FDA approval before Christmas. Estimates of the cost of both vaccines are in-line with the flu jab, which is about $40 (Â£30) per person in the US. Mr Trump's government is taking steps to provide the vaccine at no cost to elderly people and those who receive government assistance for healthcare costs,according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS).,external Meanwhile, the coalition People's Vaccine Alliance warned thatrich countries were hoarding doses of Covid-19 vaccinesand people living in poor countries were set to miss out.

'State-sponsored' hack hits US cybersecurity firm,"FireEye did not say when the attack happened US cybersecurity firm FireEye says it has recently been attacked by a ""highly sophisticated threat actor"", believing the hacking was state-sponsored. In a blog,FireEye CEO Kevin Mandia said company tools used for testing customers' security had been stolen.,external ""The attacker primarily sought information related to certain government customers,"" he wrote. The blog did not say who might have carried out the attack. The firm and the FBI are investigating the hack. FireEye share price plunged following the company's acknowledgement of the hack. ""Based on my 25 years in cyber security and responding to incidents, I've concluded we are witnessing an attack by a nation with top-tier offensive capabilities,"" Mr Mandia said in Tuesday's blog, adding that the hack was ""different from the tens of thousands of incidents we have responded to throughout the years"". ""The attackers tailored their world-class capabilities specifically to target and attack FireEye. ""They used a novel combination of techniques not witnessed by us or our partners in the past,"" the blog said. California-based FireEye was set up in 2004. It specialises in investigating attacks in cyberspace against companies throughout the world. It is being described as one of the fastest-growing firms in the industry. Mr Mandia began his career in the US Air Force investigating the first major cyber attack on America's defence secrets by another state, the BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera reports. In that case, our correspondent says, the Russians were responsible and, even though Mr Mandia does not name names, Russia may well be the prime suspect this time. FireEye is a highly regarded outfit used by companies and governments around the world to protect them from hacking. So when the defenders themselves get hacked it sends a shiver down the spines of security experts. It isn't the first time a major cyber-security company has been hacked - but what is concerning here is that FireEye's so-called ""Red Team"" hacking weapons have been stolen. Like many cyber-security firms, FireEye has an offensive division that can be hired by companies and governments to carry out mock cyber attacks to help an organisation improve its defences. FireEye says its hacking tool chest has been plundered meaning that the thieves now have a potent collection of new techniques to draw upon. This has also happened before in the infamous Shadow Broker leaks in which hackers stole and shared cyber weapons developed by the US National Security Agency. This resulted in successful and devastating attacks on businesses and civilians all over the world. The saving grace here, perhaps, is that FireEye knows exactly what hacking tools they had and, hopefully how to defend against them. The race is on to get the warnings out there before the hackers take advantage.

Kuenssberg: Will Brexit dinner prove to be the last supper?,"Could it be the last supper? Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels for the first time in months on Wednesday night to sit and break bread with the EU Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen. It is more than a standard diplomatic dinner. It is possible that the encounter could be the moment at which the UK and the EU conclude that there cannot be a trade deal now, and that after decades of political and economic ties, efforts to say a polite political farewell have failed, with all theconsequences that might entail. The purpose of the dinner however is not to call a halt. But nor is the purpose to proclaim that a deal's been done. What you need to know about Brexit What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? PM heads to Brussels on Wednesday for Brexit talks The reason for the meeting is to see if both sides are willing in principle to tolerate the notion of budging, after the negotiations, and frankly negotiators, have been exhausted. If the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen can look each other in the eye and agree that there are still compromises to be had, then a deal is still possible. If they are willing to make that kind of pact - to say privately to each other, I'm willing to budge if you are too - then that would in theory allow technical talks to get going again. This wouldn't be any kind of changes to the formal mandates - the boundaries the negotiators have been set. But it could reset the dial, sending Lord Frost and Michel Barnier back to the table in the understanding that their political bosses might just be a touch more wiling to be flexible after all. TRAVEL RULES: How your holidays will change in 2021 NO DEAL YET: What are the sticking points in trade talks? BREXIT: Seven things that will change on 1 January In turn, that doesn't mean that a deal is going to be achieved. But it could tip the balance back towards the overall political imperatives of making this happen, and away from both sides' commitment to stick so closely to their principles. Here, the government's actions on the Northern Ireland protocol on Tuesday are a hint that they just might be willing to bend a little further. Equally however,settling the joint protocolmakes it easier for the government to minimise disruption if it walks away. So beware wise sages claiming it's definitive proof either way! Don't forget too, it's only this time last week that there was a sense we were moving towards a conclusion on both sides. But that was before some member states, with France as the hard man, toughened their approach, surprising the UK and setting the process back - although any change is still denied officially by the EU side. What we just can't know, however, is whether the leaders will be able to find common cause when they meet on Wednesday. There has been a real sense of ""you first"" in the last 24 hours, with both sides waiting to see what the other's next move would be. If there is a chance that a deal can be done, tomorrow night's dinner needs to produce at the very least a metaphorical statement of intent. But if the two leaders just aren't prepared to make a leap, it could yet be the last supper after all. P.S. It's interesting to note that when Theresa May was trying to manage these processes, she sometimes dashed off to see the individual leaders of the member states, or held phone calls with them, as did Boris Johnson sometimes. There was one notable explosion with German Chancellor Angela Merkel on a call last year, which now seems a century ago. It's understood that this time Boris Johnson's team was interested in the possibility of talking to Mrs Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in these vital few days themselves. But I'm told the EU wanted to keep everything channelled through one point of contact. Downing Street has denied the suggestion this afternoon that he wanted them to be on the call when he rang Mrs von der Leyen on Monday. But it seems there have been discussions about whether to have those separate discussions that have then not (so far) taken place. What does Australia have to do with Brexit?

Christmas comes early with 'record' grocery sales,"Grocery sales hit a record in November as people spent more during lockdown and started their Christmas shopping early, research indicates. Some Â£10.9bn was spent as eating and drinking out was restricted in England, market research firm Kantar said. It also found sales of goods such as turkeys jumped as people said they were determined to make this the ""best Christmas ever after a tough 2020"". But another analyst said some would cut back in December due to money fears. Kantar said the three days before non-essential retail and hospitality closed in England on 5 November were ""especially busy"" for grocers, with sales up by 17% that week. ""Limited opportunities to drink in pubs and restaurants, as well as an early eye on festivities, pushed alcohol spend 33% higher than in the same four weeks last year,"" added Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. Mr McKevitt said many people had also ""begun the countdown to Christmas 2020 already, using more time at home to go big on festive revelry"". ""Sales of turkeys, both whole birds and ready-to-roast joints, are up by 36% on last year, while more than Â£11m was spent on Christmas puddings."" Weekend shopping returns but numbers down on 2019 Shops offer festive discounts in battle for survival Seven things that may be different this Christmas However, he said mince pie sales were down by 8%, reflecting ""fewer opportunities to share a treat with friends and colleagues"". Kantar said more than six million households bought groceries online in November - the highest number to date. Underlining this, in the 12 weeks to 1 December, sales at online grocer Ocado climbed by 38% from a year earlier, making it the fastest growing of all the UK grocers. Its next closest competitors were Iceland, with sales up 21%, and Morrisons, up 13.7%. Supermarkets, which have remained open throughout the lockdowns, have seen their sales boom this year as people spend more time indoors and splash out on food. Sales have also been helped because many other retailers were closed. However, the supermarkets have faced criticism for taking government support while also paying dividends to shareholders, leading some of the biggest retailers to repay hundreds of millions of pounds each in business rates relief. Like Kantar, Nielsen forecasts even stronger grocery sales in December, with Â£1bn more spent on shop food and drink than last year. But it said one in four shoppers intended to spend less on Christmas groceries than usual, with half saying it was because they were entertaining less, and more than a third citing financial concerns. Mike Watkins, Nielsen's UK head of retailer and business insight, said: ""With the peak Christmas period fast approaching, there are limited opportunities for shoppers to entertain this year and any gatherings that do take place will be smaller. ""We can see that shoppers are preparing for this where they can - buying packaged grocery, alcohol and frozen food - and many have planned their online orders early.""

Man guilty of murdering teenager in woods,"Louise Smith had moved in with her aunt who is married to Shane Mays A man has been found guilty of the ""sexually-motivated"" murder of a teenager whose body he set on fire. Louise Smith, 16, was found dead at Havant Thicket, Hampshire, on 21 May - 13 days after she went missing. Shane Mays, 30, who is married to Louise's aunt, said he punched her in an argument but claimed she was alive when he left her in the woods. Mays, who admitted manslaughter, was convicted of murder by a jury at Winchester Crown Court. He showed no emotion as the verdict was read out, while cries of ""yes"" could be heard from the public gallery. Shane Mays will be sentenced on Wednesday morning Louise came to live with the couple in late April after an argument with her mother. Mays ""flirted"" with the ""anxious and vulnerable"" teenager, including tickling her feet in a video found on her phone, jurors heard. James Newton-Price QC, prosecuting, said Mays lured the teenager to a clearing on 8 May, attempted to sexually assault her and then killed her to ""silence"" her. This video can not be played Louise Smith filmed a video showing her killer Shane Mays tickling her feet Louise's body, which the court heard was ""dreadfully treated"" and burned, was found almost two weeks later after extensive searches by specialist teams. She had suffered ""repeated, heavy blows"" to the head but the cause of death could not be determined due to the fire, the jury was told. Giving evidence during his trial, Mays, of Ringwood House, Leigh Park, claimed the teenager lured him to the clearing so that they could talk alone but ended up in a violent argument about her drug use. Mays said he ""lost control"" as he punched her repeatedly as she lay on the ground. He claimed she was still alive and ""moaning"" as he walked away. But the prosecution said it was actually Mays who had persuaded Louise to walk with him to the woodland by offering her cannabis, with the aim of sexually assaulting her. He was later seen on CCTV calmly buying pizzas after murdering Louise. Louise's parents, Bradley Smith and Rebbecca Cooper, described the ""unbelievable pain"" of her loss Mays, who was assessed by a psychologist as having an extremely low IQ of 63, said he forgot what he had done until he was in prison on remand in June. In a statement following the verdict, Rebbecca Cooper, Louise's mother, said: ""No words can describe the loss we feel on a daily basis. She was our sunshine and is truly missed by all that knew her. ""...the pain inside is unbelievable, just knowing we will never see her again."" Louise's father, Bradley Smith, said in a statement: ""We all find it impossible to accept that we will never hear her voice or see her cheeky smile again. ""Our chance to see her grow up has been ripped away from us. As a father, I moved away to try and build a life for both of us. I'll never get a chance to share that with her. The loss of Louise has destroyed our family."" This video can not be played The last known footage of Louise Smith was shown in court Reacting to the verdict, Det Insp Adam Edwards said: ""It's brilliant to get justice for Louise's family and friends. They lost her in the most tragic of circumstances. ""The defilement of her body was shocking. It's something all officers at the scene will have to live with for the rest of their lives."" The teenager, who had a social worker, was descried as vulnerable during the trial. Jurors were shown a message she sent to her aunt - May's wife - in which she wrote: ""I have had an amazing life, I hate the fact I am so childish, it's only because I have not been able to be a child."" Following her death, Louise's family described her as a ""smiley, generous... typical 16-year-old girl"" who was training to be a veterinary nurse. They added: ""Louise... enjoyed spending time with her friends. She loved animals and being outdoors. ""She will be remembered as a smiley, generous person who loved her family and was loved by all."" Hampshire Safeguarding Children Partnership said it was undertaking a review of Louise's case. Mays will be sentenced on Wednesday morning.

Isle of Wight beach monolith mystery solved,"Mr Dunford said he used material from his work to create the monolith A designer has told the BBC he erected a monolith on a British beach in tribute to others which have popped up around the world. The pillar, similar to ones in the US and Romania, sparked global headlines after it was found on the Isle of Wight off the south coast of England. Tom Dunford, who lives on the island, said: ""I did it purely for fun."" The gleaming structure on Compton Beach has been attracting an influx of visitors since its discovery on Sunday. The reflective structure sparked a stir on social media about who put it there and why. Mr Dunford said he put the structure up at about 04:00 GMT on Sunday morning Mr Dunford, 29, from Fishbourne,told BBC Radio Solent: ""If the aliens were to come down I think they'd go for the safest place which is the Isle of Wight in tier 1 [Covid restrictions]. ""I was convinced it would be stolen in the first couple of hours."" Mr Dunford, who works for a design company, said: ""When I saw the first one pop up [in Utah] I thought it was brilliant, the second one popped up and I had a text from a friend which said 'you're the man that can do this on the island'. ""I'm absolutely fascinated in futuristic design, science and space. The actual idea sparked when I was walking back to the office and we had an old sheet of mirrored perspex."" Mr Dunford said he told a few trusted friends and relatives about his plan before he drove down to the beach at 04:00 GMT on Sunday to install it. ""I'm one of these guys, once I get a creative streak I have to just go for it,"" he added. Mr Dunford (pictured) said his gleaming structure was inspired by the monolith in Utah But he admitted he did not expect it to get the reaction it did. ""I'm going to leave it and let people take photos and go and collect it in a couple of days,"" he said. 'Magical' monolith appears on UK beach People have tracked down the mystery Utah monolith Mysterious metal monolith found in Utah desert The beach is being closely monitored to avoid a deluge of crowds, the National Trust has said. The trust, which is responsible for the site, said rangers would ""ensure the beach remains safe and does not become overcrowded"". The National Trust said visitor numbers to the beach would be monitored to ""to ensure the beach remains safe"" A metal monolith appeared briefly in the Utah desert late last month. It created wild speculation on social media and apparent copycats with two others found in southern California and Romania days later. An anonymous collective called The Most Famous Artist has taken credit for the monoliths in Utah and California - it posted an image of the Utah monolith on Instagram, with a 45,000 US dollar (Â£34,000) price tag.

Queen welcomes senior royals for Windsor carols,"Three generations of royals gathered at Windsor for a festive carol service The Queen has appeared alongside several other senior royals for the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began. The monarch, 94, welcomed the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge to Windsor Castle following their royal train tour. Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall also attended the socially-distanced Christmas carol concert within the castle's grounds. The Earl and Countess of Wessex and Princess Anne were also there. It was confirmed last week that the Queen and the Duke of Edinburghwill spend Christmas ""quietly"" at Windsor, rather than Her Majesty's private estate at Sandringham in Norfolk. And rather than a gathering of senior royals as is traditional, the Queen and Prince Phillip, 99, will spend the festive period alone after considering ""all the appropriate advice"", according to Buckingham Palace. ""Like everyone they hope things will get back to normal in 2021,"" a palace spokesman said at the time. The Cambridge's trip on the royal trainsaw them thank key workers, volunteers and communities in Scotland, England and Wales. While there was veiled criticism from Welsh and Scottish ministers over its timing, Prime Minister Boris Johnson hailed the tour as a ""welcome morale boost"", No 10 said. On Tuesday, Prince William and Catherine told students in Cardiff they were still wrestling with their Christmas plans and had yet to decide where or with whom they would be. The couple have previously spent the festive period with Catherine's parents at their home in Berkshire. On the final day of their zig-zag three-day tour of Britain, the couple met undergraduates to hear about their mental health challenges during the pandemic in Wales, and they spoke with NHS workers in Reading. The Queen thanked the Salvation Army and other local volunteers at Tuesday evening's service at Windsor Castle At the end of Tuesday's performance, the Queen, chatted to her family in turn and as she turned to walk up the steps back inside the castle, Prince William said: ""Bye gran."" Commissioners Anthony and Gillian Cotterill, territorial leaders for The Salvation Army in the UK and Republic of Ireland, also came forward to speak to the Queen, who told them ""nobody's allowed to sing anymore"". Choirs are allowed to perform in the open air and Princess Anne told her mother: ""Oh, we can sing outside."" The Queen spoke animatedly to Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall Mr Cotterill said afterwards: ""The Queen was saying she was just so happy we were able to play some carols because she thinks this will be the only time she'll be able to hear carols, and she was disappointed we didn't sing. "" ""Sometimes we're playing musicians and other times we're a choir. At an event like this, it's better to have the band as you can hear it for miles."" The Salvation Army's Regent Hall Band, based in London's busy Oxford Street, played Hark The Herald Angels Sing and The First Noel for the royal family. Mrs Cotterill added: ""I did see the Queen mouthing some of the words - so that was nice.""

The couple admitted they were still struggling over their plans for Christmas, telling students they did not know who to spend the festive season with. ""It is so difficult,"" William said. ""We are still trying to make plans. It's difficult to know what to do for the best."" William and Kate swap secret Santa gits as part of their visit to the Welsh capital Lily Faulkner, a 21-year-old second year politics and international studies student at Cardiff University, said afterwards: ""They were trying like the rest of us to make Christmas plans with their family and still weren't 100 per cent sure of what they were going to do or where they were going to be."" Law student Alice Holloway was one of the first in Cardiff to talk to the royal couple. ""One of the main things we talked about was the impact of the pandemic on student mental health,"" said the 20-year-old in her third year at Cardiff University. ""I told them the social isolation students are facing is causing a lot of wellbeing issues at the moment. They were genuinely interested which was lovely to see.""

LiveLive'End is in sight' as UK vaccinations under way9 minutes ago9 minutes ago Goodbye - and thanks for joining usGoodbye - and thanks for joining us12 minutes ago Re-cap: Latest from the UK and around the worldRe-cap: Latest from the UK and around the worldLive 'End is in sight' as UK vaccinations under way  9 minutes ago,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock hails the start of the UK's mass vaccination drive as ""a tribute to scientific endeavour, to human ingenuity"" Margaret Keenan, 90, the first to receive the Pfizer/BioNTech jab today, said it was ""the best early birthday present"" - she turns 91 next week Professor Stephen Powis of NHS England called it ""really, really emotional"" and ""a truly historic day"" PM Boris Johnson said the vaccine would make a ""huge difference"" but urged people to keep following the rules Hospital hubs across the UK will give the vaccine to the over-80s and some health and care staff The UK is first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine after regulators approved its use last week Meanwhile, researchers confirmed that the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine was safe and effective In Scotland, next year's Higher and Advanced Higher exams are to be cancelled after disruption to schools Globally 67.59 million people have been infected and 1.54 million have died, according to Johns Hopkins University Edited by Sean Fanning and Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage of coronavirus developments on Tuesday. It was edited by Sean Fanning and Holly Wallis, and written by George Bowden, Katie Wright, Ella Wills, Alex Therrien and Victoria Bisset. It's been a busy day for coronavirus news - here are the latest headlines from the UK and worldwide:   Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Senior NHS sources have told the BBC that thousands of vaccinations have taken place across the UK today - the first day of the roll out of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. NHS England meanwhile has urged people not to contact the NHS to request a vaccine but to wait instead to be contacted. This will happen if they are in a priority group, which includes the over 80s, care home workers and some health staff. Is this a needle which I see before me? William Shakespeare receiving his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine Margaret Keenan has made history by becoming the first person in the world to get a Covid-19 vaccine outside of a clinical trial, but if there's one name you'll associate with this day, it may not be hers. Enter William Shakespeare - not the writer, poet and playwright, but his 81-year-old namesake. This Shakespeare was the second person to be given a jab - and, guess what, he also comes from Warwickshire. ""Is this a needle which I see before me?"" the present-day Shakespeare might have asked, but his reaction was a little bit less, well, dramatic: he said he was ""pleased"" to be given the jab, and staff at University Hospital in Coventry had been ""wonderful"". Read more Reality Check An unfounded conspiracy theory about microchips and vaccines continues to be shared widely online The first Covid-19 vaccines have been administered today but some people are using this moment to spread misinformation online. Rumours and conspiracy theories â distinct from valid questions about the speed and efficacy of the various coronavirus vaccines â have been spreading for months. Weâve looked into the truth behind some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims, including:  Read the full story The launch of the national coronavirus vaccination programme reflects the best of the NHS, a senior leader has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccination programme was a ""remarkable achievement not just on the part of the scientists, the researchers, and the regulators, but today of pharmacists, nurses and doctors"". ""In many ways this is the NHS at its best, getting new vaccinations to vulnerable patients who need them for free,"" he added. And here's a little bit more from patients and health workers who've been among the first people to get Covid vaccinations. Jack Vokes, 98, who has cancer and has been in hospital for five weeks, described being the first person to be vaccinated in Bristol as ""a bit of excitement"". Vokes lives alone and hopes the vaccine will mean he is able to see more of his family, including his six granddaughters. ""I worry about my family more than me,"" he said. ""I live in hope that by the middle of next year we'll hopefully be living a normal life."" After getting the vaccine at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Kathleen Viney, 81, said she wouldn't be so scared to leave the house. ""It'll mean that I can go out more because at the moment I have been completely confined at home and have hardly any social life at all and now I will feel as though I'm a bit safer,"" she said. ""It will be nice to go out and have a meal and be able to do some shopping."" Viney said it took ""about two seconds"" to make up her mind when she was offered the vaccine. ""It would be very silly not to have it done,"" she said. ""There's nothing to be afraid of."" Read more stories here. This video can not be played The first person to receive the vaccine at a hospital in Slough was A&E consultant Dr Prem Premachandran, who is 64. He's worked at the Frimley
Health trust for 25 years and was shielding during the first wave of the pandemic. He said he was ""proud"" to get the jab. Schools in England will be allowed to take an inset day next Friday so staff have a ""proper break"" from identifying potential coronavirus cases ahead of Christmas, the schools standards minister has said. Nick Gibb told MPs that the government wants there to be a ""clear six days"" ahead of Christmas Eve so teachers and heads do not have to ""engage with track and trace issues"" throughout the festive break. The minister's comments came after a headteachers' union said giving schools the flexibility to switch to remote learning for the final few days of term next week was an ""obvious and straightforward solution"". But some schools had called for up to a week of remote learning to avoid self-isolation notifications happening on Christmas week. More on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine - which researchers have confirmed in the Lancet is safe and effective. It could also play a major role in fighting the pandemic, especially as the UK has ordered 100 million doses of it. It is cheaper than some of the other Covid vaccines and easier to store and distribute. UK regulators are currently considering whether the jab can be rolled out across the population. Health correspondent Laura Foster explains what the vaccine is and how it works. This video can not be played Earlier, we reported that a Welsh government minister said he would rather ""no-one was having unnecessary visits"" amid aroyal UK tour. Now Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's royal train tour is a ""welcome morale boost"", according to No 10. It comes after Downing Street officials initially refused to say it complied with coronavirus restrictions. The prime minister's official spokesman said the tour was a ""matter for the palace"". Challenged on whether the royal couple had complied with the rules, the spokesman said: ""I'm making the general point that we have set out the regionalised tier system that is now in place and the guidance that we are asking people to abide by."" In response to a suggestion that No 10 was refusing to give its backing to the couple's trip, the spokesman said: ""I would point you towards the palace."" But an hour after the comments in a Westminster briefing, a statement issued by No 10 confirmed Johnson's support. A No 10 spokesman said: ""The PM is delighted to see the warm reception the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have received on their hugely valuable train tour of England, Scotland and Wales. ""The tour will be a welcome morale boost to frontline workers who have done so much during the pandemic.""   The UK government has reported another 12,282 daily positive tests for coronavirus. There have also been a further 616 deaths, within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to have died to 62,033. Thatâs up from 189 deaths announced on Monday, although there is often a reporting lag over the weekend. Four lions at a zoo in Barcelona have tested positive for coronavirus. Three females - Zala, Nima and Run Run - and a male named Kiumbe were all tested after displaying mild symptoms. Two members of staff also tested positive for the virus last month, although it is not clear how the lions were infected. âThe lions were given veterinary care for their mild clinical condition - similar to a very mild flu condition - through anti-inflammatory treatment and close monitoring, and the animals responded well,â the zoo said in a statement, according to Reuters. The zoo added that the animals had had no contact with other animals. This is only the second documented case of big cats contracting the virus, afterfour tigers and three lions at Bronx Zoo in the US tested positive in April. Highers and Advanced Higher exams have been cancelled in Scotland next year, Scottish Education Secretary John Swinney announces. The AS and A-level equivalents will no longer take place due to disruption to learning during the pandemic. It follows a decision to cancel National 5 exams - equivalent to GCSEs - and replace them with teacher assessments and coursework. It was confirmed in a statement to the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Elisa Granato was one of the volunteers given the Oxford vaccine The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe and effective, giving good protection,researchers have confirmed in The Lancet journal. Most in the study were younger than 55, but the results so far indicate it does work well in older people too. The data also suggests it can reduce spread of Covid, as well protect against illness and death. The paper, assessed by independent scientists, sets out full results from advanced trials of over 20,000 people. Regulators, who will have seen the same data, are considering the jab for emergency use. Our Geneva correspondent Imogen Foulkes has been following a briefing by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, together with representatives from Pfizer BioNTech, Roche, Eli Lilley, and Johnson & Johnson. She's heard there are currently 300 vaccines in different stages of development: Pricing:The pharma companies present said they would be using a âthree-tierâ pricing policy for high, middle, and low income countries, with low income countries paying either a nominal price or nothing. Pricing will not, it was stressed, be adjusted upwards because demand currently far outstrips supply. Capacity and supply:With vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments, there are shortages. With vaccines in particular all the pharma representatives present agreed it would be the second half of next year before they were widely available. On testing, Severin Schwan of Roche said there were not enough tests to satisfy demand, and that therefore the idea of mass testing was not realistic at the moment. Thomas Cueni, CEO of IFMPA, said that because of shortages and the challenges in ramping up production, the next few months would be difficult, and that there is no alternative, for now, to social distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing. Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring People queue for testing at a local hospital There are fresh fears in China about a widespread outbreak of coronavirus as new cases have been confirmed in Chengdu, a major city in
southwestern Chinaâs Sichuan province. Chengdu has a population of approximately 16 million people, andthe city has confirmed five new symptomatic cases of the virus since yesterday,external. An elderly couple were confirmed to have the virus yesterday,external,
but today, a couple of elderly farmers and the 20-year-old grand-daughter of the
first couplehave also been confirmed as having the virus,external.
The latter had visited multiple bars and restaurants around the city, and so
these have been sealed off with police tape, and recent visitors have been told
to immediately get tested. Official media  say that schools and nurseries in Chengduâs Pidu District
have been suspended and the local government has locked down the gated communities of the latest
patients. Residents in these communities are also being tested. However, state media are dismissing ârumoursâ online that the city
is imminently going into lockdown.Global Times says that the city has entered âwartime modeâ,external, but the
official CCTV broadcastersays that Chengduâs airports and railway stations are operating as normal,external. Grocery sales hit a record in November in Englandas people spent more during lockdown and started their Christmas shopping early, research indicates. Some Â£10.9bn was spent as eating and drinking out was restricted in England, market research firm Kantar said. It also found sales of goods such as turkeys jumped as people said they were determined to make this the ""best Christmas ever after a tough 2020"". Alcohol sales were 33% higher than the same four weeks last year because of ""limited opportunities to drink in pubs and restaurants"", said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. However, he added that mince pie sales were down by 8%, reflecting ""fewer opportunities to share a treat with friends and colleagues"". Maryam AzwerBBC Monitoring Sri Lanka is currently in second wave Social media users in Sri Lanka have criticised a gathering,externalof thousands of people in the Kegalle district of the southern-central part of the
island, where samples of a potion which was claimed to offer immunity from Covid-19 were being
distributed. Public health inspectorssaid public gatherings were a violation,externalof Covid-19 regulations. The potion has been developed by Dhammika Bandara, who
claims to be a practitioner of the ""Hela"" school of indigenous
medicine. It was recently sampled by government officials, including Health
Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi. Local media have cited Bandara as saying,externalthat taking the
potion would make a person ""immune from Covid for the rest of their
lives"". There is no scientific evidence to back claims that
traditional medicines can offer immunity to coronavirus. Rasika Jayakody, former editor of the state-run Daily News,criticised Bandara for the gathering,external: ""People are lining up near the Kegalle residence of the
witch doctor who produced a 'cure' for #COVID19. #SriLanka Health Minister took
a sip of this medicine without any scientific or clinical evidence. This shows
the kind of damage an irresponsible govt. can inflict on a country"". Sri Lanka, which has seen 28,580 cases and 142 deaths from
the pandemic, is currently seeing a second wave. UK scientists are planning trials to see if giving people two different types of Covid vaccine, one after the other, might give better protection than two doses of one jab. This mix-and-match approach can go ahead only if another jab is approved by regulators, as has already happened with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The head of the UK's vaccine task force said trial designs were being prepared. ""It's an established process,"" Kate Bingham said. ""It's not being done because of supplies."" Read more here.

UK and EU reach deal over NI border checks,"Michael Gove and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ have been leading negotiations on implementing the withdrawal agreement The UK and EU have reached agreement on how rules in the Brexit divorce deal will be implemented, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland. The government says an ""agreement in principle"" has been found for issues including border control posts and the supply of medicines. Details of the agreement have not been published but are expected to be rubber stamped in the coming days. Separate negotiations to reach a post-Brexit trade deal are still ongoing. The UK left the EU in January but has continued to follow the same rules and regulations during what is known as the transition period. The new border arrangements will apply regardless of whether the two sides agree a deal to govern their trading relationship after the Brexit transition period ends on 31 December. The UK government also agreed to withdraw controversial clauses from its Internal Market Bill, which iscurrently going through parliament. Ministers had threatened to use the bill to introduce powers which could override parts of the Brexit divorce deal it signed last year - the withdrawal agreement, potentially breaking international law. It said it wanted a ""safety net"" to prevent a ""border down the Irish Sea"" in case talks with the EU broke down. The threat had risked jeopardising the separate negotiations over a UK-EU trade deal, which are heading into a crucial stage, but the UK has now dropped plans to put the powers into law. What is the Internal Market Bill? Brexit: Will the borders be ready? What happens if there's no trade deal? The agreement follows talks in Brussels between Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and EU commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, which have taken place alongside the negotiations over a new trade agreement. Speaking after the announcement, Mr Gove said he was ""delighted"" and thanked the EU team for their ""constructive and pragmatic approach"". Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Gove told reporters: ""We've agreed stability and security for Northern Ireland"", adding: ""We will be able to ensure unfettered access for goods which come from Northern Ireland to the UK"" and ""given certainty to businesses in Northern Ireland"". He said there ""will be some necessary checks on food and products of animal origin as they go into Northern Ireland""  but added these are checks that reflect the fact that the island of Ireland has always been treated as a single zone for animal health. Mr Gove added ""there will be a small number of precautionary checks on food products when they go into Northern Ireland"" but emphasised they would be ""as light touch as possible"". He said businesses in Northern Ireland would have the access to the ""best of both worlds"" access to the single market without infrastructure and at the same time ""unfettered access to the rest of the UK market"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the agreement had removed ""one big obstacle"" from the trade talks, and would create ""positive momentum"" for the negotiators. Speaking to reporters in Brussels, he added that the negotiating teams are ""still very far apart, and we are not hiding this from anyone"". Welcoming the news, Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney told RTE News the new border deal was a ""very important positive for the island of Ireland"". ""It's hopefully a signal that the British government is in a deal-making mood and we can carry some momentum from this,"" he added. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster said her Democrat Unionist Party would await details of the new agreement before passing judgement. She added it was important any new arrangements ensure Northern Irish businesses can trade freely with firms in Great Britain. The pledge from UK ministers to remove the powers comes just one day after they ordered Conservative MPs toreinstate them to the billon Monday. They had been removed from the bill by the House of Lords. This is a Brexit breakthrough. But not on those three sticking points we've heard so much about in the last few days: fishing rights, competition rules and enforcing any agreement. You may remember all of the rows over the last few years about the border on the island of Ireland: how do you keep it open, with Northern Ireland outside of the European Union, and the Republic within it? That is what this is about: working out mutually acceptable rules that will keep Northern Ireland more closely aligned to the EU than the rest of the UK. What has happened today is a necessary, but far from sufficient, step as the two sides attempt to reach a free trade deal. But one thing it unquestionably does is improve relations between the two sides - with the UK no longer threatening to breach the last deal it did with Brussels, the withdrawal agreement, at just the point it's trying to sort out the next one. The Brexit withdrawal agreement - or divorce deal - sets out the details of the UK's exit from the EU, which took place earlier this year. Northern Ireland is the only land border between the UK and the EU. Under an arrangement known as the Northern Ireland protocol - which is part of the withdrawal agreement - from January, goods will not need to be checked along the Irish border and the region will continue to enforce the EU's customs product standards rules. This means, in order to comply with EU requirements, some checks will be needed on certain goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales). In September,the EU expressed angerwhen the UK government published its Internal Market Bill, which would have enabled ministers to ignore some of the Northern Ireland protocol requirements. For example, it would have allowed ministers to override sections of the Brexit divorce deal specifying that companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would have to fill out export declaration forms. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Efforts to reach a UK-EU trade deal remain stalled over disagreements on fishing rights, business competition rules and how any deal would be enforced. Boris Johnson - who is due totravel to Brussels on Wednesdayin a bid to break the deadlock - has described the situation as ""very tricky"" but added that ""hope springs eternal"".

PM to meet EU chief on Wednesday for Brexit talks,"Boris Johnson is heading to Brussels on Wednesday for talks with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on a post-Brexit trade deal. The pair are under pressure to get an agreement before the UK stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. The dinner meeting comes after intensive talks between EU and UK officials ended in deadlock. Major disagreements remain on fishing rights, business competition rules and how a deal will be policed. Mr Johnson will work through a list of the major sticking points with Mrs von der Leyen, who is representing the leaders of the 27 EU nations. UK and EU reach deal over NI border checks What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? What happens if there's no trade deal? He will take part in Prime Minister's Questions before travelling to the Belgian capital. EU leaders are due to meet for a summit of their own on Thursday. A UK government source said ""political impetus"" would be required if the talks are to make any more progress. ""If we can make progress at a political level, it may allow Lord Frost and his team to resume negotiations over the coming days,"" the source added. EU sources told the BBC that EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier briefed the bloc's Europe ministers that talks were tilting towards no deal being reached before the deadline. The purpose of Wednesday's dinner is not to call a halt to talks. But nor is the purpose to proclaim that a deal's been done. The reason for the meeting is to see if both sides are willing in principle to tolerate the notion of budging, after the negotiations, and frankly negotiators, have been exhausted. If the prime minister and Mrs von der Leyen can look each other in the eye and agree that there are still compromises to be had, then a deal is still possible. If they are willing to make that kind of pact - to say privately to each other, I'm willing to budge if you are too - then that would in theory allow technical talks to get going again. Read more from Laura Earlier, Mr Johnson said he hoped the ""power of sweet reason"" will allow both sides to clinch an agreement before the end of the year. If an agreement is not reached and ratified by this date, the UK and EU could introduce import charges on each other's goods. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months.

If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? News of Wednesday's meeting comes as the UK announced it hadreached agreement with the EUon post-Brexit border checks and trading rules for Northern Ireland. It means UK has now dropped plans to override sections of its EU exit agreement it signed last year, which would have potentially broken international law. The government had previously said it needed the powers as a ""safety net"" to prevent a ""border down the Irish Sea"" in case talks with the EU over the border broke down. The agreement, the details of which have yet to be made public, follows talks in Brussels between Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove and EU commissioner MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, which have taken place alongside the negotiations over a new trade agreement. Speaking after the announcement, Mr Gove said he was ""delighted"" and thanked the EU team for their ""constructive and pragmatic approach"". Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the agreement had removed ""one big obstacle"" from the trade talks, and would create ""positive momentum"" for the negotiators. But he warned the two negotiating teams were ""still very far apart, and we are not hiding this from anyone"". The two sides are at loggerheads over the so-called ""level playing field"" - a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to follow EU rules closely in areas such as workers' rights and environmental regulations, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved. On fishing, the two sides are continuing to haggle over how much access European fishing boats should have to British waters, and how much they would be allowed to catch from next year.

What's happening with next year's exams?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe?,"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products. TheBritish Islamic Medical Association,externalsays there is negligible alcohol in it - no more than in bread, for example. How will the vulnerable be protected from Covid?

Sky presenter Burley apologises for Covid breach,"Kay Burley presents a daily breakfast show on Sky News Sky News presenter Kay Burley has apologised for an ""error of judgment"" after she ""inadvertently broke the rules"" around Covid-19 safety. Posting on Twitter, the journalist said she had been celebrating her 60th birthday at a ""Covid compliant"" restaurant on Saturday. She later ""popped into another"" venue to use the toilet. It's not clear what rule was broken through this action. An internal review is now under way, Sky has confirmed. ""On Saturday night I was enjoying my 60th birthday at a Covid compliant restaurant. I am embarrassed to say that later in the evening I inadvertently broke the rules,"" Ms Burley posted on Twitter. ""I had been waiting for a taxi at 11pm to get home.

Mt Everest grows by nearly a metre to new height,"Some geologists believe the 2015 earthquake may have changed Everest's height The world's highest mountain Mount Everest is 0.86m higher than had been previously officially calculated, Nepal and China have jointly announced. Until now the countries differed over whether to add the snow cap on top. The new height is 8,848.86m (29,032 ft). China's previous official measurement of 8,844.43m had put the mountain nearly four metres lower than Nepal's. Everest stands on the border between China and Nepal and mountaineers climb it from both sides. Officials at Nepal's foreign ministry and department of survey said surveyors from both countries had co-ordinated to agree on the new height. The agreement to jointly announce the new measurement of the Earth's highest point was made during Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to the Nepalese capital, Kathmandu last year. Chinese authorities had said previously Mount Everest should be measured to its rock height, while Nepalese authorities argued the snow on top of the summit should be included. The Chinese surveyors had calculated their figure after they measured the mountain in 2005. Nepal's government officials told the BBC in 2012 that they were under pressure from China to accept the Chinese height and therefore they had decided to go for a fresh measurement to ""set the record straight once and for all"". The 8,848m height Nepal had been using for Mount Everest was determined by the Survey of India in 1954, but for the first time the country has now conducted its own measurement of the summit. Four Nepalese land surveyors spent two years training for the mission, before heading to the summit. Chinese surveyors reached the summit in May - the only team to do so this year ""Before this, we had never done the measurement ourselves,"" Damodar Dhakal, spokesman at Nepal's department of survey, told the BBC. ""Now that we have a young, technical team [who could also go to the Everest summit], we could do it on our own,"" Mr Dhakal said. Nepal's lead surveyor Khimlal Gautam lost his toe due to frostbite while on the summit to install height-measuring equipment last year. ""For summiteers, scaling the highest peak means a great accomplishment. For us, it was just the beginning,"" Mr Gautam had told BBC Nepali after his return. ""Unlike other surveys of the Everest in the past, we chose 03:00 to minimise errors that could have been caused because of sunlight in the day time."" Why else hastheheight been questioned? Some geologists have suggested a major earthquake in 2015 may have had an impact on Mount Everest's height. The 7.8 magnitude earthquake killed nearly 9,000 people in Nepal, and caused an avalanche which buried parts of the base camp at the mountain. At least 18 climbers were killed. Two of Nepal's surveyors reached Everest's summit for the measurement Some geologists said the earthquake may have caused Everest's snow cap to shrink. Scientists had found that some other Himalayan peaks such as Langtang Himal, mostly to the north of Kathmandu and close to the epicentre, had reduced in height by approximately a metre after the earthquake. Why the summit can get so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Ex-soldier breaks record for 14 highest mountains Seven things you didn't know about Everest Others have argued that Mount Everest, like other Himalayan peaks, may have actually grown over time because of the shifting tectonic plates it sits on. But experts say major earthquakes can result in that process being reversed. ""The 2015 earthquake is also a major reason why we re-measured the mountain,"" said Mr Dhakal. The heights of mountains are measured with the mean sea level as the base. So it's less about working out the where the top is, than where the bottom would be. Nepal used the Bay of Bengal as its sea level, but India had already surveyed a point closer to Everest, near the India-Nepal border, from the bay, and was able to provide the Nepalese surveyors with the height at that point. From there, Nepal built a network of line-of-sight stations stretching nearly 250km (155 miles) to the point Everest first become visible, creating a chain of points it could measure and add together. The Chinese surveyors, according to the state-run China Daily, used the Yellow Sea in the eastern province of Shandong as their sea-level base. Chinese media say China used the Yellow Sea as the sea level base to measure the height of Everest Surveyors from both sides also used trigonometry formulas to calculate the height of the summit. The formulas they used calculate the height of a triangle by multiplying its base with its angles. But for all the clever ground work, someone still needs to be on top of the mountain. The Nepalese surveyors went up to the summit last year, while the Chinese surveyors went up in May, becoming the only team to reach the top in 2020, after Nepal suspended all expeditions during the coronavirus pandemic and China banned foreign travellers. Nepalese officials said they used 12 different lower peaks looking up at the Everest summit for their trigonometry calculations, to achieve a more precise result. Chinese media reported that Chinese surveyors used the same method. ""Once the surveyor's beacon had been placed on the summit, surveyors at stations around the summit measured the distance from the six points to the beacon, which meant at least six triangles could be calculated to determine the mountain's height,"" Jiang Tao, associate researcher at the Chinese academy of surveying and mapping, told the state-run China Daily. Both sides also used Global Navigation Satellite Systems to receive elevation data from numerous receivers in their calculations. Scientists had found that the Langtang range had dropped by around one metre due to the 2015 earthquake China has previously conducted two height measurements of Mount Everest - first in 1975 and then in 2005. Members of the second survey team installed a Chinese version of a GPS device on the summit, according to the Himalayan Database. This time the Chinese surveyors used China's BeiDou navigation satellite system, which is believed to be a rival to the US-owned Global Positioning System, or GPS. ""Using the system, snow depth, weather and wind speed would also be measured to help glacier monitoring and for ecological protection,"" China's state news agency Xinhua reported. Nepalese surveyors used GPS to make their calculations. ""We processed this data using internationally accepted methodology to determine the height of Mount Everest,"" Mr Dhakal told the BBC.

'Mix-and-match' vaccines to be tested,"UK scientists are planning trials to see if giving people two different types of Covid vaccine, one after the other, might give better protection than two doses of one jab. This mix-and-match approach can go ahead only if another jab is approved by regulators, as has already happened with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The head of the UK's vaccine task force said trial designs were being prepared. The news comes as the NHS starts its Covid mass vaccination programme. A 90-year-old woman, Margaret Keenan, has become the first person to be given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as part of the rollout across the UK. Ms Keenan, who is originally from Enniskillen, said: ""I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19. It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year."" That vaccine, given as two doses a few weeks apart, offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, according to data. Although that is a very impressive figure, experts want to explore whether the immune response can be strengthened further and made more durable with a mix-and-match ""heterologous boost"" approach. Kate Bingham, who chairs the vaccine task force, said: ""It's an established process. ""It's not being done because of supplies."" There isanother Covid jab that could soon be approvedby regulators - the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. This works in a slightly different way to the Pfizer jab which could make it a good companion for pairing, say scientists. ThePfizer vaccine uses a small amount of genetic code from the pandemic virusto teach the body how to fight off an infection, while the Oxford one is a genetically modified virus that has been altered so it won't cause infection but does carry information on how to beat Covid. The idea is to give people a shot of the Pfizer vaccine followed by a dose of the Oxford one a few weeks later or vice versa, rather than two doses of the same vaccine. The hope is that it will make the immune system produce two responses strongly - antibodies and T-cells - to combat Covid. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Safety data on Pfizer jab released by US,"The Pfizer/BioNtech vaccine must be stored at a temperature of -70C US regulators have confirmed the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid vaccine is 95% effective, paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found no safety concerns to stop approval of the vaccine. It is the first time this level of detail for the jab, which the UK has already started using for mass vaccination, has been published. The FDA will meet on Thursday to make a formal decision. The agency is yet to approve the vaccine, but has published a document stating the trial data was ""consistent"" with the recommendations set out in its emergency use guidance. The UK's regulatory body, the MHRA, approved the vaccine last week. This video can not be played Fauci: 'We need to be transparent and articulate on the vaccine' Both countries have had advanced rolling access to the information on the vaccine's safety and effectiveness. Last week Dr Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious disease expert,apologised for remarks that seemed to criticise the UK's vaccine approval process. He told the BBC then that the US process was ""one that takes more time than it takes in the UK. And that's just the reality. I did not mean to imply any sloppiness even though it came out that way."" Even at the time of his original remarks, he had said the US was only ""a couple of days"" behind. Pfizer vaccine is '94% effective in over-65s' First person receives Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine How will vaccines be distributed to US states? Thein depth material,external, published by the FDA, shows the vaccine is 95% effective against Covid-19, in keeping with the headlines published by the pharmaceutical company Pfizer. Although two doses are needed to offer full protection, the first jab prevented 89% of the most severe cases. And the vaccine gave similar levels of protection to people who had already had a Covid infection. The document, published ahead of the FDA's meeting on Thursday, stated the most common side effect experienced by people who received the vaccine was pain, redness or swelling at the injection site (generally the arm). That was followed by short-term fatigue, headache and muscle-pain. But beyond these mild effects, there was no notable difference in health conditions between the vaccinated and control groups during the study period. Pregnant women and under-16s were not included in those studied, and so the vaccine will not yet be approved for these groups. UK and US regulators have slightly different approval procedures for new vaccines. Both complete an internal assessment and consult an advisory board, but the FDA also looks at raw figures as well as trial write ups.

First Covid jab administered in NI,"Residents at Palmerston have welcomed the vaccines The first care home residents have been vaccinated against Covid-19 in Northern Ireland. Twenty-five men and women from Palmerston residential home in east Belfast were vaccinated on Tuesday morning. Thirty-five members of staff are in the process of getting the jab. Earlier on Tuesday, the first Covid-19 vaccination in Northern Ireland was administered. Sister Joanna Sloan - who will head up the vaccine roll out in Belfast - received the jab just after 08:00 GMT at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The roll outinvolves 70 hospital hubs across the UK which are gearing up to provide the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. On Tuesday, the Belfast Trust confirmed to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that 250 people had received the vaccination in Northern Ireland. Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, becamethe first person in the world to get the jab as part of a mass vaccination programme, She is originally from Enniskillen, County Fermanagh and called the vaccination the ""best early birthday present"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: First Covid-19 vaccine in NI given to nurse Palmerston is a purpose built dementia care home providing 24 hour care to older people in East Belfast. As well as the residents, 35 members of staff are in the process of  getting the jab. Speaking to BBC News NI, home manager Paul Johnston said it had been a ""good day"". The home had outbreaks of the virus in October but is now virus-free. Mr Johnston, who also was vaccinated, said it was only yesterday that he received the call from the Belfast Health Trust to arrange the vaccinations but was delighted and relieved to be able to protect the residents. ""We had to gain consent from the families - it has been full on but we are getting there,"" he said. ""Really it has been no different from administering the flu jab. It wasn't painful at all and so far so good with all the residents."" The Department of Health recorded 14 further deaths linked to Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking its total death toll to 1,073. It also confirmed 351 new positive cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number of positive cases in Northern Ireland to 55,795. In the Republic of Ireland, there was one further death linked to coronavirus reported, with 2,097 people having died in total. There were also 215 further confirmed cases of the virus, meaning there have been 74,682 cases recorded in the country since the pandemic began. The first recipient of the vaccine in Northern Ireland, Ms Sloan, will manage the Belfast Trust's vaccination centre. Speaking earlier on Tuesday, she said she felt emotional and proud to be part of history. This video can not be played Joanna Sloan on being the first person in NI to get a Covid-19 vaccine Meanwhile, a 90-year-old woman from Northern Irelandbecame the first person in the world to receive the vaccine outside trial conditions. Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said it was the ""best early birthday present"". The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one of a number that have been developed so far, withOxford-AstraZenecaandModernaseeking approval for their vaccines. Health Minister Robin Swann hailed the vaccination rollout as a ""game changer"". Mr Swann warned that distribution of the vaccine would be a massive logistical challenge - particularly in care homes, which will require 12,000 doses -  but he said those in care homes would start to receive the vaccine soon. The vaccine must be stored at about -70C and needs to be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge.

Vaccine rumours debunked What are the safety checks for vaccines? Stocks of the vaccine were transported to Northern Ireland via the Republic of Ireland, having arrived into Dublin port from Holyhead. They are being kept at an undisclosed central storage facility operated by a private company. Dr Alan Stout, chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee, warned the vaccine rollout did not symbolise the end of the pandemic. ""It is so important that people still follow the rules and follow the guidance,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. More than 600 volunteer vaccinators across Northern Ireland will be given the injection this week, ahead of the biggest inoculation programme in UK history. The UK will be the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine after regulators approved its use last week. About 25,000 doses were delivered to Northern Ireland last Friday. Vaccination will not be compulsory. Ministers have warned it could be Easter by the time restrictions are lifted in a significant way. The vaccine will be rolled out at seven sites across Northern Ireland: â¢Belfast Trust - Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast â¢South Eastern Trust - Ulster Hospital, Dundonald â¢Southern Trust - South Lake Leisure Centre, Craigavon â¢Northern Trust - Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Ballymena â¢Western Trust  - Foyle Arena, Londonderry, Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre, Enniskillen.

Higher exams to be cancelled for Scottish pupils,"This video can not be played Swinney: 'No Higher or Advanced Higher exams in 2021 Next year's Higher and Advanced Highers exams are to be cancelled in Scottish schools, it has been confirmed. Education Secretary John Swinney said the decision was based on the disruption that Covid has caused to the education system rather than safety concerns. The move means that pupils' final grades will be based on the judgement of their teachers. The country's National 5 exams have already been cancelled. There were more than 200,000 entries for Higher and Advanced Higher courses this year. The Scottish government had previously said a final decision on whether the exams would go ahead would not be taken until the middle of February. Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 Scottish school pupils have results upgraded School pupils join protests over SQA exam results But teaching unions had warned that timescale would be too late, with the EIS calling last week for an early decision to be made to cancel the exams and switch to an alternative assessment model. Mr Swinney told the Scottish Parliament that many pupils had already lost ""significant learning time"" through having to self-isolate in addition to the teaching time they lost before the summer holidays. And he said the level of disruption had not been equal - with pupils from the poorest backgrounds the most likely to have been affected. S6 pupil Carly said some of her friends have had to isolate two or three times Mr Swinney added: ""I am therefore announcing today that there will be no Higher or Advanced Higher exams in 2021. ""Instead we will adopt the new model that has been developed and base awards on teacher judgement of evidence of learner attainment. ""This is safe, it is fair, and it better recognises the reality of the disruption so many pupils have already had to their learning"". Mr Swinney also stressed that there would be no algorithms used to adjust the estimated grades put forward by teachers aftercontroversy about their use in deciding this year's results. Some pupils have told BBC Scotland that they were relieved the exams had been cancelled. They included Carly, an S6 pupil at Govan High School in Glasgow, who is studying Advanced Higher History, Higher Modern Studies and Higher Care and is hoping to do nursing at university. She said: ""It's been hard learning this year. I've had to isolate once but some of my friends have had to isolate two or three times. ""I feel relieved that exams are cancelled and can make sure that I am getting everything done that I need to and not just working towards something that's not going to happen."" Protests were held over this year's exams after some pupils had their results downgraded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority This year's exams were also cancelled due to the pandemic and lockdown, with the results initially decided using teacher estimated grades which the Scottish Qualifications Authority then moderated based on the past performance of different schools. There was an outcry and protests took place after it emerged that 125,000 of those teacher estimates were downgraded, with claims the system was unfair to children at schools with worse records in exams. The Scottish government then agreed to accept just the teacher estimates. Opposition parties have regularly accused the education secretary of ""dithering"" over key decisions, which they said had left pupils, staff and parents in the dark. Opposition parties have accused Mr Swinney of ""dithering"" over whether the exams should be held Scottish Conservative education spokesman Jamie Greene said Mr Swinney had failed to show leadership throughout the pandemic. He added: ""First it was the exams fiasco, then it was throwing the towel in over National 5 exams, and now he has dithered and delayed over Higher and Advanced Higher exams. ""By his own admission, the education secretary now accepts that it is our poorest students who have been deprived of their education this year. ""No wonder beleaguered teachers are writing in their droves to confirm they have completely lost confidence in John Swinney's abilities."" Parents group UsForThem Scotland said the ""inexcusably bad"" decision would have a ""terrible impact on childrens' futures"". The group's Jo Bisset said: ""The fact the Scottish government couldn't get its act together and run an exams diet tells you exactly how seriously the system takes children's interests in the short, medium and long term."" The announcement was welcomed by the EIS, Scotland's biggest teaching union, which described it as a ""common-sense decision that is in the best interests of students."" But the union also warned that agreement needed to be reached on the ""additional workload"" that would be created for teachers by the alternative assessment programme. Wales has cancelled all GCSE and A-level exams in 2021. Welsh Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for pupils due to the Covid pandemic. Grades will be decided using classroom assessments. In England, A-levels and GCSEs are due to go ahead next summer, starting three weeks later than usual. Plans for how to manage them in a pandemic are expected to be published later this week. Northern Ireland is planning to hold all exams in 2021, with its education minister, Peter Weir, saying they represented the ""fairest way of judging students"". The decision to cancel Highers and Advanced Higher exams is not straightforward. There are, of course, questions over the best way to ensure fairness towards students whose learning has been badly disrupted The original plan was to delay Highers and Advanced Highers by a few weeks and give a greater choice of questions. The hope was this would make up for any disruption. Many students have faced disruption. But could this disruption all have been anticipated when the original plan was announced two months ago? One challenge now is to ensure the system for awarding grades is seen as credible and robust. Nobody wants the real achievements of candidates questioned in future years because they didn't sit exams. It is also worth noting that most  new university students this year will not have sat exams since their National 5s in fourth year - and some may not have sat any at all.

"Food supply fears grow: 'It's too late, baby'","Food and drink supplies in the UK face more disruption after the end of the Brexit transition period than they did from Covid, the industry has said. ""There are 14 [working] days to go,"" the Food and Drink Federation's (FDF) chief executive, Ian Wright, told MPs. ""How on earth can traders prepare in this environment?"" he added. Noting that rules for sending goods from Welsh ports to Northern Ireland had only just been published, he said: ""It's too late, baby."" Uncertainty over a deal and new border checks would make it difficult to guarantee the movement of food through ports without delays, he said. Mr Wright was giving evidence to the Commons business committee on Brexit preparedness. He said there was a big concern that the problems would ""erode the confidence of shoppers in the supply chain"", adding: ""It has done very well over Covid and shoppers will expect the same thing over Brexit, and they may not see it."" PM: 'Sweet reason' can get us to post-Brexit deal NI food supply warnings 'taken very seriously' ""We can't be absolutely certain about the movement of food from the EU to the UK from 1 January for two reasons,"" Mr Wright said. ""One is checks at the border. The other is tariffs, and the problem with tariffs is, we don't know what they will be."" Mr Wright added: ""With just 14 working days to go, we have no clue what's going to happen in terms of whether we do or don't face tariffs. ""And that isn't just a big imposition. It's a binary choice as to whether you do business in most cases. My members will not know whether they're exporting their products after 1 January, or whether they'll be able to afford to import them and charge the price that the tariff will dictate."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Wright warned that while he expected Kent and Operation Brock to work ""reasonably well"", he was less confident about ports such as Holyhead, with goods heading to Northern Ireland. He called the Northern Ireland protocol a ""complete shambles"", adding: ""The idea that you can prepare for something as big as the change that's going to happen is ridiculous, it's a massive toll."" Mr Wright added that 43% of FDF members who supply Northern Ireland have said they were not going to do so in the first three months of next year. He told MPs that many companies had lost some of their customer base in the EU. ""The problem is, if there's any disruption to supply, you lose your customer pretty quickly and you do not get them back,"" he added. Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, told the committee that up to a quarter of the UK's financial activity was EU-related and that in the worst-case scenario, about 40% of that business could be lost. However, he added: ""We've not seen this vast shift in jobs and activity."" Instead, Brexit had acted as a ""strategic accelerator"", with firms taking action such as restructuring EU-based offices as standalone operations. Even so, he warned: ""This all comes ultimately at a cost."" Lloyd Mulkerrins of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that if tariffs were levied on parts and finished vehicles, the UK's car industry was likely to see a sales decline of 20% to 30%. Production would decline from as much as 1.6 million to just 800,000, he told the MPs. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"Public 'would reach same conclusion on Madeleine'Prosecutor says if public ""knew the evidence we had"" they would think Madeleine McCann was killed.","Madeleine McCann was three when she went missing in 2007 A prosecutor who believes Madeleine McCann was killed by a German sex offender says the public would reach the same conclusion if they ""knew the evidence we had"". Hans Christian Wolters told the BBC that while his team does not currently have enough evidence to charge Christian B, he is ""very confident"". Their prime suspect is in prison serving sentences in Germany for drug smuggling and rape. Madeleine disappeared in 2007. She was on holiday with her family in Praia da Luz, Portugal, at the time of her disappearance, the same resort where Christian B raped a 72-year-old American woman. Suspects' surnames are not usually revealed in Germany for privacy reasons. Who is the German suspect? The Madeleine McCann case: A timeline Although Christian B, 43, was identified as a suspect in June prosecutors do not have enough evidence to charge him. Mr Wolters said: ""If you knew the evidence we had you would come to the same conclusion as I do but I can't give you details because we don't want the accused to know what we have on him - these are tactical considerations."" The six-month investigation has yielded fresh evidence of other alleged crimes. Christian B lived in Portugal on and off for years and investigators now believe he may have committed at least three other sex crimes here - two of them against children, Mr Wolters said. He said charges may follow early next year. Mr Wolters said progress in the case of Madeleine was slower because of the logistical challenges posed by a disappearance now 13 years old in a different country. But he said his team was working to build a water tight case against him. Christian B recently lost an appeal against his rape conviction and will remain in prison for a seven-year sentence once his current drugs sentence ends in January. Mr Wolters said: ""I can't promise, I can't guarantee that we have enough to bring a charge but I'm very confident because what we have so far doesn't allow any other conclusion at all."" Last week, Met Police commissioner Dame Cressida Dick said that theMet's position had not changed since the summer, when the force said its investigation - Operation Grange - remained a missing person inquiry as there is no ""definitive evidence whether Madeleine is alive or dead"". Madeleine, from Rothley in Leicestershire, went missing from a holiday apartment in Praia da Luz, on 3 May 2007, shortly before her fourth birthday. Official records show Christian B has 17 previous convictions, including for rape and sexual abuse of children Christian B is currently serving a prison sentence for drug offences in Germany and lost an appeal last month against a further seven-year sentence for rape. He attacked the American woman in 2005 in the same area where Madeleine disappeared about 18 months later. Police believe he was regularly living in this part of Portugal between 1997 and 2007, staying in a camper van at the time he is suspected of abducting Madeleine.

Oxford vaccine 'safe and effective' study shows,"Elisa Granato was one of the volunteers given the Oxford vaccine The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe and effective, giving good protection, researchers have confirmed inThe Lancet,externaljournal. Most in the study were younger than 55, but the results so far indicate it does work well in older people too. The data also suggest it can reduce spread of Covid, as well as protect against illness and death. The paper, assessed by independent scientists, sets out full results from advanced trials of over 20,000 people. Regulators, who will have seen the same data, are considering the jab for emergency use. But there are still important questions about what dose to give, as well as who it will protect. When the interim trial results were made public in a press release about a fortnight ago, the researchers reported three efficacy levels for the vaccine - an overall effectiveness of 70%, a lower one of 62% and a high of 90%. That's because different doses of the vaccine were used in one part of the trial. Some volunteers were given shots that were half the strength than originally planned. Yet that ""wrong"" dose turned out to be a winner - giving 90% protection - while two standard doses gave 62%. Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine 'dosing error' explained The Lancet report reveals 1,367 people - out of many thousands in the trial - received the half dose followed by a full dose, which gave them 90% protection against getting ill with Covid-19. The relatively small numbers in this group mean it is hard to draw firm conclusions. None of that group were over the age of 55 though - and experts know it is older people who are most at risk of severe Covid illness. In terms of safety, there was one severe adverse event potentially related to the vaccine and another one - a high temperature - that is still being investigated. Both these participants are recovering and are still in the trial. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters The study also measured protection against asymptomatic infection by asking volunteers to do regular swabs to check if they had Covid without feeling unwell. More of these cases were seen in the group that did not receive the vaccine. Pascal Soriot, chief executive officer for AstraZeneca said: ""The results show that the vaccine is effective against Covid-19, with in particular no severe infections and no hospitalisations in the vaccine group, as well as safe and well tolerated. ""We have begun submitting data to regulatory authorities around the world for early approval and our global supply chains are up and running, ready to quickly begin delivering hundreds of millions of doses on a global scale at no profit."" Dr Charlie Weller, head of vaccines at Wellcome, said: ""Today marks another key milestone in the Covid-19 vaccine journey. ""Although we await the trial completion and full data, it is highly encouraging to see the data behind the interim results announced last month, including an analysis of the different dosing regimens. This suggests that this vaccine could prevent asymptomatic disease."" But some experts said the data could present regulators with a dilemma, with a relatively small cohort in the trial - which didn't contain any over-55s - getting a half-dose, which produced the best results. Dr Michael Head, senior research fellow in global health, from the University of Southampton, said the researchers ""were not yet able to fully assess how effective this vaccine is in elderly populations"" and this could have implications for the roll-out in older age groups. AstraZeneca executive vice-president Sir Mene Pangalos said adults of all ages needed to be vaccinated to make a ""dent"" in the pandemic. ""I realise the people that are most severely impacted by disease are the over-65s, over-75s, over-85s, but the reality is we need to actually have vaccines that immunise everyone from adolescence to the oldest adults to really dent the pandemic around the world,"" he said. What is the Oxford vaccine and how does it work? Covid-19: Oxford University vaccine is highly effective Meanwhile, the UK has started a mass vaccination campaign with another Covid jab made by Pfizer/BioNTech. On Tuesday Margaret Keenan, a 90-year-old grandmother,became the first person in the world to get the Pfizer Covid-19 jab as part of a mass vaccination programme.. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine could also play a major role in fighting the pandemic if it is approved soon. It is cheaper than some of the other Covid vaccines and easier to store and distribute. The UK government has pre-ordered 100 million doses of the Oxford vaccine, which uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the virus that causes Covid-19. AstraZeneca says it will make three billion doses for the world next year.

What happens if there's no trade deal?,"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year. In fact, talks are still ongoing on this issue. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

What is the Internal Market Bill?,"The government has said it is willing to drop parts of a controversial piece of legislation - the Internal Market Bill - which had the potential to further complicate the already tense trade talks between the UK and the EU. It contains measures relating to the way trade will be done between Northern Ireland and Great Britain in the future. They would only come into force if the UK and the EU failed to reach a trade deal. But they would overrule parts of the Brexit withdrawal agreement the UK signed with the EU last year. The House of Lordsvoted to remove the offending clausesfrom the bill in November but the House of Commons then voted to reinstate them. The government now says it is willing to withdraw them because of an ""agreement in principle"" on a range of issues affecting Northern Ireland. So, what is the controversy about? The withdrawal agreement (also known as the Brexit ""divorce deal"") includes a section - or protocol - on Northern Ireland, and it is now an international treaty. Article 4 of the agreement says the provisions of the treaty take legal precedence over anything in the UK's domestic law. So if any of the proposals in theInternal Market Bill,externalthat contradict the withdrawal agreement actually became law, it would breach the government's international obligations. That is what the Northern Ireland Secretary, Brandon Lewis referred to in September when he spoke about breaking international law in a ""very specific and limited way"". Breaking the law, though, is still breaking the law. The overall aim of the Northern Ireland protocol was to avoid the return of a ""hard"" land border between Northern Ireland, in the UK, and the Republic of Ireland, in the EU. All sides agreed they did not want the return of border checks - or other physical infrastructure - that could become a target. What is the Northern Ireland protocol? One of the solutions in the treaty was to keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods, unlike the rest of the United Kingdom. People protesting between Newry and Dundalk about a possible hard border, in March 2019 It promised to maintain unfettered access for Northern Ireland goods to the rest of the UK but also introduced new bureaucracy for trade across the Irish Sea. The way these measures will be implemented on the ground have been negotiated by UK and EU officials, who have been meeting in a joint committee for the past few months. If there was no agreement by the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020, and there was no free-trade deal, that is when parts of this new proposed legislation would have come into play. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. For example, the protocol states that companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) would have to fill out export declaration forms. But the government's Internal Market Bill would give ministers the right to overrule or ignore this part of EU customs law. Another part of the protocol says the UK has to follow EU rules on state aid - the financial support governments give to businesses - for goods related to Northern Ireland. But the Internal Market Bill would give ministers power to interpret what that means and says this should not be done in accordance with the case law of the European Court of Justice. The EU said this was trying to change parts of a recently-agreed international treaty unilaterally. And when the legislation was first published, US President-elect Joe Biden warned that the Good Friday peace agreement in Northern Ireland ""cannot become a casualty of Brexit"". But on 8 December, the UK and EU announced an""an agreement in principle"",externalon issues including border control posts, the supply of food and medicines and clarification around state aid in Northern Ireland. As a result, the government said it would drop the controversial clauses in the bill. The Internal Market Bill only deals with trade from Northern Ireland to Great Britain, but the debate about goods moving in the opposite direction is equally sensitive. The protocol says the joint committee is supposed to determine which goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland are ""at risk"" of being exported over the Irish border to the EU and should therefore have tariffs - taxes on imports - imposed on them. If there was no agreement between the two sides, then the default position would be tariffs paid on all goods. The UK had plans, due to be introduced in a Taxation Bill, to allow UK ministers to make unilateral decisions on which goods could be deemed as ""at risk"" - after 1 January. But, as a result of the ""agreement in principle"" - the government says these measures won't now be introduced. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

'Mix-and-match' Covid vaccines to be tested,"UK scientists are planning trials to see if giving people two different types of Covid vaccine, one after the other, might give better protection than two doses of one jab. This mix-and-match approach can go ahead only if another jab is approved by regulators, as has already happened with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The head of the UK's vaccine task force said trial designs were being prepared. The news comes as the NHS starts its Covid mass vaccination programme. A 90-year-old woman, Margaret Keenan, has become the first person to be given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as part of the rollout across the UK. Ms Keenan, who is originally from Enniskillen, said: ""I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19. It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year."" That vaccine, given as two doses a few weeks apart, offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, according to data. Although that is a very impressive figure, experts want to explore whether the immune response can be strengthened further and made more durable with a mix-and-match ""heterologous boost"" approach. Kate Bingham, who chairs the vaccine task force, said: ""It's an established process. ""It's not being done because of supplies."" There isanother Covid jab that could soon be approvedby regulators - the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. This works in a slightly different way to the Pfizer jab which could make it a good companion for pairing, say scientists. ThePfizer vaccine uses a small amount of genetic code from the pandemic virusto teach the body how to fight off an infection, while the Oxford one is a genetically modified virus that has been altered so it won't cause infection but does carry information on how to beat Covid. The idea is to give people a shot of the Pfizer vaccine followed by a dose of the Oxford one a few weeks later or vice versa, rather than two doses of the same vaccine. The hope is that it will make the immune system produce two responses strongly - antibodies and T-cells - to combat Covid. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

All's well that ends well? Shakespeare gets vaccine,"Is this a needle which I see before me? William Shakespeare receiving his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine Margaret Keenan has made history by becoming the first person in the world to get a Covid-19 vaccine outside of a clinical trial, but if there's one name you'll associate with this day, it may not be hers. Enter, pursued by puns, William Shakespeare. Not the writer, poet and playwright, but his 81-year-old namesake. This Mr Shakespeare was the second person to be given a jab - and, guess what, he also comes from Warwickshire. ""Much ado about nothing?"" It doesn't matter - ""all's well that ends well"". ""Is this a needle which I see before me?"" the present-day Shakespeare could have asked, but his reaction was a little bit less, well, dramatic: he said he was ""pleased"" to be given the jab, and staff at University Hospital in Coventry had been ""wonderful"". So, if Ms Keenan was patient 1A, was Mr Shakespeare ""Patient 2B or not 2B""? Theirs were the first of 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that will be dispensed in the coming weeks in the UK. First person receives Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine 'Hopefully next year we'll be living a normal life' 'Mix-and-match' Covid vaccines to be tested The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. ""Two doses, both alike in quantity,"" if we're allowed another pun - but here are some others on the day ""the taming of the flu"" began. Allow Twitter content?

Hopes for normal life next year,"The first Covid vaccinationshave begun to take place across the UK. Throughout the morning, patients and health workers at some 50 hospitals around the country have had the jab. This video can not be played Margaret Keenan was given the vaccine by May Parsons, at University Hospital in Coventry Grandmother Margaret Keenan initially thought it was a joke when hospital staff told her she would be the first person to get the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. ""It hasn't sunk in yet,"" she said. ""At the moment I don't know how I feel, just so strange and so wonderful really."" Ms Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said it was ""the best early birthday present I could wish for"". ""It means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year,"" she added. She said she did not mind the media attention and was not nervous about being vaccinated. ""Hopefully it'll help other people come along and do what I did, and try and do the best to get rid of this terrible thing."" Aubrey Bass, from Buckinghamshire, said 2020 had been ""the worst year of my life"", after his wife died in March. The 96-year old has been isolating alone since then. ""It's been pretty miserable being on my own,"" he added. He said he was ""terribly excited"" to receive a call asking if he wanted to be vaccinated. ""Next year I've got two great-grandchildren coming so I'll be able to go and see them. That's going to be marvellous."" Dr Hari Shukla was the first of around 100 people to be vaccinated in Newcastle, along with his wife Ranjan. ""I feel proud that I have had this privilege of participating in this very important activity,"" he said. ""I don't take this for granted because hundreds of people have worked for this vaccine day and night to make sure we got the vaccines in good time, so the lives of people can be saved."" Dr Shukla was born in Uganda and came to the UK in 1974. He was director of the Tyne and Wear Racial Equality Council, and has been honoured with a CBE and named a Hero of the City of Newcastle for his work in race relations. He said he wanted to use his position in the community to tell others the vaccine was safe. ""I'm saying go for it. It's very important you have it, it's wonderful and the way it has been produced, all the work they have done, it's the best vaccine you could ever have."" Jack Vokes, 98, has cancer and has been in hospital for five weeks - but will soon be fit to go home. He described being the first person to be vaccinated in Bristol as ""a bit of excitement"". Mr Vokes lives alone and hopes the vaccine will mean he is able to see more of his family, including his six granddaughters. ""I worry about my family more than me,"" he said. ""I live in hope that by the middle of next year we'll hopefully be living a normal life."" Mick Newell, who works in operating theatres at Salford Royal Infirmary, contracted Covid-19 in February and was quickly admitted to ICU. ""I stayed there for nine days being looked after by my colleagues,"" he recalled. ""It was a pretty scary time."" He said of the NHS vaccination programme: ""It's unbelievable, isn't it? There's people been shielding at home since February - this offers them some hope, they can finally see some light at the end of tunnel. ""They'll start going back to a semblance of life and take us into whatever this new normal is."" Mr Newell, 60, said that just because the vaccine is new doesn't mean it should be written off. ""We should put our trust in the NHS like we do everyday,"" he added. After getting the vaccine at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Kathleen Viney, 81, said she wouldn't be so scared to leave the house. ""It'll mean that I can go out more because at the moment I have been completely confined at home and have hardly any social life at all and now I will feel as though I'm a bit safer,"" she said. ""It will be nice to go out and have a meal and be able to do some shopping."" Ms Viney was going into the hospital for a cancer check-up and said it took ""about two seconds"" to make up her mind when she was offered the vaccine. ""It would be very silly not to have it done,"" she said. ""There's nothing to be afraid of."" Sister Joanna Sloan, a 28-year-old nurse from Dundrum in County Down, said she felt ""privileged"" to be the first person to receive the vaccine in Northern Ireland. ""This feels like the last hurdle towards keeping people safe, myself and everyone around me,"" she told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. Ms Sloan, who will head up the vaccine roll-out in Belfast, had to put her wedding on hold due to the pandemic. She's now looking forward to telling her five-year-old daughter about having the vaccine. ""I want her to be proud, I want all my family and friends to be proud,"" she said.

Scotland's toughest Covid restrictions to be eased,"Pubs, restaurants and non-essential shops have been closed across much of the west of Scotland since 20 November All 11 areas living under Scotland's toughest level four coronavirus restrictions are to be downgraded to level three, it has been confirmed. The move means that non-essential shops and many other businesses across much of western and central Scotland will be able to reopen from Friday. More than two million people have been subject to the level four restrictions since 20 November. Infection rates in all 11 council areas have fallen since then. It has also been confirmed that three level three areas - Inverclyde, Falkirk and Angus - will move down to level two. And both Dumfries and Galloway and the Scottish Borders willmove to level onefrom level two. All of the country's other council areas will remain in their current levels. Have the level four restrictions worked? What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? What level is your council area in? Retail premises which have been closed under the level four restrictions will be allowed to re-open from 06:00 on Friday, with the other restrictions being eased from 18:00 on the same day. But hospitality businesses in level three areas must close their doors by 18:00 - meaning they will have to wait until Saturday to welcome back customers for food and non-alcoholic drinks. Announcing the changes in the Scottish Parliament, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon urged people to ""continue to exercise care and caution"". And she said that travel restrictions will remain in place, meaning that people should not travel in or out of level three areas unless it is essential. People living outside of Glasgow should therefore not travel to the city for Christmas shopping when stores reopen on Friday, for example. Ms Sturgeon added: ""As we know from our experience of Covid so far, progress can very easily go into reverse. ""So please continue to abide by the rules. That means, in particular, not visiting other people's houses."" The first minister also told MSPs that she considered moving Edinburgh down to level two - but the closeness to the Christmas period meant that this did not happen. She also said the government was closely monitoring Clackmannanshire, which is remaining in level three for now despitehaving the highest number of confirmed casesper 100,000 in the country. Ms Sturgeon said it was thought that the sharp rise in case numbers could be attributed to a mass testing pilot that is being carried out there, adding: ""The issue is more cases being identified rather than a rise in transmission."" There had been concern that Aberdeen and Aberdeenshire could move from level two to level three - but Ms Sturgeon said cases in both areas had dropped slightly in recent days. However, she said the situation would be monitored very carefully, with a move to level three not being ruled out in the weeks ahead. The first minister said further support for businesses affected by the restrictions would be announced on Wednesday. Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said businesses in areas such as Edinburgh, which have relatively low case numbers, would find it a ""bitter pill to swallow"" that restrictions would not be eased because ""ironically they might get too much trade"" ahead of Christmas. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard also criticised the decision not to move Edinburgh down to level two when the data appeared to show the infection was under greater control there than in other parts of the country. The first vaccinations against the virus started on Tuesday morning The announcement on the country's restriction levels came as vaccinations began at sites across Scotland. An initial batch of 65,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine arrived in Scotland at the weekend - with those who will be giving the vaccine to others being the first to be injected with it. Ms Sturgeon said the vaccination programme presents the ""beginning of the end"" of the pandemic. But she urged people to continue to think about how to keep themselves and others safe in the meantime. The deaths of a further 33 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours, alongside an additional 692 positive tests.

Fears of Brexit empty food shelves 'growing',"Food and drink supplies in the UK face more disruption after the end of the Brexit transition period than they did from Covid, the industry has said. ""There are 14 [working] days to go,"" the Food and Drink Federation's (FDF) chief executive, Ian Wright, told MPs. ""How on earth can traders prepare in this environment?"" he added. Noting that rules for sending goods from Welsh ports to Northern Ireland had only just been published, he said: ""It's too late, baby."" Uncertainty over a deal and new border checks would make it difficult to guarantee the movement of food through ports without delays, he said. Mr Wright was giving evidence to the Commons business committee on Brexit preparedness. He said there was a big concern that the problems would ""erode the confidence of shoppers in the supply chain"", adding: ""It has done very well over Covid and shoppers will expect the same thing over Brexit, and they may not see it."" PM: 'Sweet reason' can get us to post-Brexit deal NI food supply warnings 'taken very seriously' ""We can't be absolutely certain about the movement of food from the EU to the UK from 1 January for two reasons,"" Mr Wright said. ""One is checks at the border. The other is tariffs, and the problem with tariffs is, we don't know what they will be."" Mr Wright added: ""With just 14 working days to go, we have no clue what's going to happen in terms of whether we do or don't face tariffs. ""And that isn't just a big imposition. It's a binary choice as to whether you do business in most cases. My members will not know whether they're exporting their products after 1 January, or whether they'll be able to afford to import them and charge the price that the tariff will dictate."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Wright warned that while he expected Kent and Operation Brock to work ""reasonably well"", he was less confident about ports such as Holyhead, with goods heading to Northern Ireland. He called the Northern Ireland protocol a ""complete shambles"", adding: ""The idea that you can prepare for something as big as the change that's going to happen is ridiculous, it's a massive toll."" Mr Wright added that 43% of FDF members who supply Northern Ireland have said they were not going to do so in the first three months of next year. He told MPs that many companies had lost some of their customer base in the EU. ""The problem is, if there's any disruption to supply, you lose your customer pretty quickly and you do not get them back,"" he added. Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, told the committee that up to a quarter of the UK's financial activity was EU-related and that in the worst-case scenario, about 40% of that business could be lost. However, he added: ""We've not seen this vast shift in jobs and activity."" Instead, Brexit had acted as a ""strategic accelerator"", with firms taking action such as restructuring EU-based offices as standalone operations. Even so, he warned: ""This all comes ultimately at a cost."" Lloyd Mulkerrins of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that if tariffs were levied on parts and finished vehicles, the UK's car industry was likely to see a sales decline of 20% to 30%. Production would decline from as much as 1.6 million to just 800,000, he told the MPs. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"Christchurch massacre 'unpreventable', says inquiry","Armed guards outside Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand An inquiry into the Christchurch massacre has found a series of failures ahead of the 2019 attack, but concluded the tragedy was unpreventable. The inquiry was launched after white supremacist Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people at two mosques in March 2019. It found he had been able to accumulate a massive trove of weapons, with authorities failing to enforce proper checks on firearms licences. It further found officials were overly focused on Islamist terrorism. However, correcting these failures would not have stopped the Australian national, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole earlier this year, from carrying out the attack, it said. What's more, the patchwork of clues discovered by police after the massacre - including his steroid abuse, a hospital admission after he accidentally shot himself, and visits to far-right websites - would not have proved enough to predict the attack. ""The commission found no failures within any government agencies that would have allowed the terrorist planning and preparation to be detected,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said afterthe release of the report.,external ""But they did identify many lessons to be learnt and significant areas that require change."" This video can not be played Ardern: 'Muslim New Zealanders should be safe' She highlighted ""failings within the firearms licensing regime"" and ""inappropriate concentration of resources"" on a perceived level of Islamist threats. ""While the commission made no findings that these issues would have stopped the attack, these were failings nonetheless and, for that, on behalf of the government I apologise."" The people killed as they prayed Christchurch killer to stay in jail until he dies The report includes a list of recommendations which the government said it would all accept, including establishing a new national intelligence and security agency and a proposal for the police to better identify and respond to hate crimes. The government also plans to create an ethnic community ministry and a graduate programme for ethnic communities. The imam of the Al Noor Mosque, one of the two places of worship targeted, said the report confirmed that authorities had been overly suspicious of the Muslim community instead of protecting it. ""We've known for a long time that the Muslim community has been targeted with hate speech and hate crimes - this report shows that we are right,"" Gamal Fouda said. ""The report shows that institutional prejudice and unconscious bias exists in government agencies and that needs to change."" He stressed that the changes recommended in the report should now be used to rebuild the trust between the Muslim community and the police. Aya Al-Umari, whose brother died in the attack, told the BBC that the report's recommendations highlighted ""all the right areas"". ""That is mainly: improving New Zealand's counter terrorism efforts, the firearm licensing, the social cohesion and New Zealand's response to the increasing diversity of our population,"" Ms Al-Umari said. She also said she hoped New Zealand's experience would provide lessons to other countries, noting that the response would have to be at an individual level as well. ""We each play a part in reducing hate crimes and reducing our unconscious bias. That escalates to what we saw on March 15 last year."" This video can not be played 'I can't forgive my attacker' However, the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand criticised the report for what they said was a lack of transparency. ""There are multiple areas of evidence that have not been investigated, and questions raised by IWCNZ have been ignored,"" the group said. ""We find it concerning that the commissioners found systemic failures and an inappropriate concentration of resources towards Islamic terrorism, and yet state that these would not have made a difference to the terrorist being detected prior to the event."" The Australian national, who lived off his savings and a large inheritance from his father, got a firearms licence and began buying rifles, shotguns and ammunition soon after he arrived in New Zealand in 2017. Later that year, he told a doctor he had been taking steroids and was injecting testosterone several times a week. The doctor warned against this, but no further treatment followed. Over the following years, he visited far-right websites and occasionally posted right-wing material on his Facebook page. He also donated money to far-right groups overseas. In 2018, he wounded himself in a firearms accident and was worried that seeking treatment might alert the police. He eventually went to hospital but his injury did no raise suspicion and was not reported. In the run-up to the attack, he tried to conceal some of his digital footprint, but investigators were able to track in some detail his reconnaissance efforts, planning and preparation for the attack on 15 March. None of the details uncovered by police after the massacre stood out at the time as something which would have raised suspicion from authorities, the report found. On 15 March, the Australian attacker opened fire on worshippers inside the Al Noor mosque, broadcasting the attack on Facebook Live via a headcam he was wearing. He then drove to the Linwood Islamic Centre where he shot people outside and then shot at the windows. A man from inside the centre rushed outside and picked up one of the attacker's shotguns before chasing him away. This video can not be played The BBC report from the day of the shootings Police officers then chased and arrested the gunman. After his arrest, the attacker told police that his plan was to burn down mosques after his initial attack and he wished he had done so. During his sentencing in August this year, the court heard that he had planned to target another mosque, but was detained by officers on the way. Earlier this year, the attacker wassentenced to life in prison without parole. The judge called his actions ""inhuman"", saying he had ""showed no mercy"". The massacre also prompted New Zealand to reform its gun laws. Less than a month after the shootings, the country's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms. The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme. New Zealanders handed in their semi-automatic weapons While there was widespread praise for how New Zealand dealt with the tragedy in the aftermath, there was also criticism that authorities might have ignored warnings that hate crimes against the Muslim community were escalating. In response to that, the government launched the the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the massacre.  It is the highest level of independent inquiry available under New Zealand law. The report took about 18 months to compile and contains interviews with hundreds of people including security agencies, Muslim community leaders and international experts. ""Ultimately, this roughly 800-page report can be distilled into one simple premise,"" Ms Ardern said. ""Muslim New Zealanders should be safe. Anyone who calls New Zealand home, regardless of race, religion, sex or sexual orientation should be safe.""

Have Scotland's level four restrictions worked?,"A review of Scotland's Covid-19 levels system will be announced later. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has already confirmed that the 11 council areas subject to the highest tier of restrictions will all move to lower levels on Friday. The toughest restrictions were imposed to bring down case numbers in Scotland's Covid hotspots - but they came at a cost, with hospitality and non-essential shops required to close, among other measures. Have the restrictions succeeded in driving down rates of Covid-19 over the last three weeks? The Scottish government has referred many times to areas of Scotland showing ""stubbornly"" high rates of Covid-19 - and the level four restrictions were designed to bring these rates down. Some councils in level four - such as Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire - have had a high number of cases per 100,000 for a prolonged period. Others, such as Stirling, have seen a more recent surge in cases. Sturgeon confirms level 4 curbs will end on Friday Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Ministers use a number of measures when deciding which level a local authority should be in, including the pressure on local hospitals and the forecast growth in cases, but a key indicator is the weekly number of cases per 100,000 people. On 20 November, when the 11 local authorities entered level four, the areas were mainly neatly arranged into their assigned tiers. Looking at the most recent reliable figures, a more complex picture has emerged. Clackmannanshire - a level three area - now sits at the top of the chart, followed by Argyll and Bute, which is in level two - though it is possible this figure ismainly down to the outbreak at the Faslane nuclear submarine base. Stirling and West Dunbartonshire now have rates lower than many level two and three areas. This chart uses figures from 3 December, as the latest data often underestimates the number of positive tests. So how have rates changed in the level four areas? There's an easy headline to this - all 11 local authorities have seen declines in the weekly rate per 100,000 people. Stirling has seen the biggest fall in cases with a 58% drop in cases, followed by West Lothian with a 40% cut. Any decrease in infection rates is good news - but it's important to place these declines in context. If we take the four local authorities at the top of the chart on 20 November, three of them (Glasgow, North Lanarkshire and South Lanarkshire) were already seeing sustained declines in case rates. Glasgow in particular saw its cases finally start to decline in early November after remaining at high levels for a number of weeks. The city has actually been under some form of extra restrictions since 1 September,when a ban on indoor visiting was introduced,external. Pubs and restaurantshave also been closed for much of the central beltsince 9 October. The positivity rate is the percentage of tests that come back positive, and it's another key measure for the Scottish government. If you take a seven-day average of the rate on 20 November and compare that with 3 December, rates are mainly down across the 11 level four councils. There has been very little change in East Ayrshire and South Ayrshire. And in West Lothian - where the total number of cases has fallen significantly - the positivity rate has actually gone up from 5.5% to 8.3%. Potentially this could be because health authorities are tackling a clear cluster of cases and so testing is very targeted. The positivity rate is important because the World Health Organisation considers it a key measure when judging the status of a Covid-19 outbreak within a country. The organisation says that if less than 5% of samples from a comprehensive testing system return a positive result over two weeks thenit is one indication of an epidemic is under control,external. The average rate for the whole of Scotland on 3 December was 5.2% - so six of the level four areas were above that. There are 10 local authorities currently in level three, including Edinburgh and Dundee. Looking over the same period, two of them - Clackmannanshire and North Ayrshire - have seen the weekly average of Covid cases per 100,000 people rise. In Clackmannanshire, infection rates rose by almost 43% between 20 November and 3 December, with provisional figures indicating they may increase further in the coming days. Across Scotland, cases are continuing to fall - going down from 139 weekly cases per 100,000 people on 20 November, to 101 on 3 December, despite the rises in some hotspot areas. The use of Scotland's tough level four restrictions may not be solely responsible for beginning to drive rates down - but the figures seem to indicate it has kept rates mainly moving downwards. The question now is whether the measure has done enough to prevent a possible post-Christmas surge in cases from spiralling out of control. Scotland's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said public health advisors felt there was ""quite a lot of risk coming"", as more than two million people prepared to move to less severe restrictions this Friday. ""Retail will open and we're slightly concerned about that, and the other thing we're worried about is Christmas,"" he toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme. ""Those two things together make us cautious about the rest of the changes that will be possible today... We would ask people not to rush - just to be careful.""

PM: 'Sweet reason' can get us to post-Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Brexit situation ""very tricky"" Boris Johnson has said he hopes the ""power of sweet reason"" will allow the UK and EU to reach a post-Brexit trade deal this week. The prime minister is to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in Brussels in the coming days, as a deadline for agreement nears. He told the BBC the situation was ""very tricky"" but ""hope springs eternal"". The two sides still disagree on fishing rights, business competition rules and how any deal would be enforced. They are racing to strike an agreement before the UK is due to stop following EU trading rules when the Brexit transition period finishes on 31 December. On Tuesday, EU sources told the BBC the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier told the bloc's Europe ministers trade talks were now tilting towards no deal being reached before the deadline. What happens if there's no trade deal? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? If an agreement is not reached and ratified by 31 December, the UK and EU could introduce import charges on each other's goods. Separately,the UK and EU have reached agreement on how rules in the Brexit withdrawal agreementwill be implemented, particularly in relation to Northern Ireland, following lengthy discussions in recent months. Mr Johnson and Ms von der Leyen will hold a face-to-face meeting, after a 40-minute phone call on Monday failed to produce a breakthrough on the two sides' future relationship. They promised to discuss ""remaining differences"", which the UK and EU negotiating teams - led by Lord Frost and Michel Barnier - have not been able to bridge despite a week of intense talks. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The leaders of the 27 EU member states will also discuss future UK-EU trade at a Brussels summit on Thursday. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Johnson said: ""I'm always hopeful, but I've got to be honest with you, the situation at the moment is very tricky."" But he added that ""hope springs eternal"" and said: ""You've got to be optimistic. You've got to believe there's the power of sweet reason."" Fears of Brexit 'food supply disruption growing' Mr Johnson also warned: ""We will see where we get to in the course of the next two days, but I think the UK government's position is that we are willing to engage at any level, political or otherwise, we are willing to try anything. ""But there are just limits beyond which no sensible, independent government or country could go and people have got to understand that."" He later told his cabinet that an agreement ""must maintain the core principles of sovereignty and control"" and the UK would thrive whatever the outcome. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? Mr Barnier and Lord Frost met earlier on Tuesday in Brussels to draw up a list of outstanding differences. The UK negotiator will return to London to update the prime minister. After briefing ambassadors from the EU's 27 member states,Mr Barnier tweeted,external: ""Full unity. We will never sacrifice our future for the present. Access to our market comes with conditions."" Michael Roth, Germany's Europe minister, said the outcome of the leaders' meeting was ""totally uncertain"" given there had been ""no substantial progress"" in recent weeks and ""fundamental disagreements"" remained. The EU has suggested negotiations could continue after 1 January if no deal was agreed by then but Downing Street insisted the process had to finish this month. Labour welcomed the decision to keep talking, but said the PM should have become involved at an earlier stage. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the so-called""level playing field""- a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to follow EU rules closely in areas such as workers' rights and environmental regulations, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved. On fishing, the EU is warning that, without ongoing access to UK waters for its fleets, UK fishermen will no longer have special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters should be under its control as a sovereign country. The UK has signed an interim agreement with Norway and Iceland to support trade in goods and minimise costs to businesses and consumers from the start of 2021. The government said the ""continuity"" deal meant UK exporters and importers would operate on the same terms as now, with no taxes or duties on 95% of Norwegian goods and 90% of Icelandic goods - including fish fillets. It is hoped the deal, which also includes safeguards on the flow of personal data and recognition of professional qualifications, will help pave the way for a full trade agreement next year. Trade between the UK and the two Nordic countries, which are both members of the European Economic Area, is worth more than Â£27bn.

Why is fishing so important?,"France will begin legal action against the UK in January over the issue of post-Brexit fishing licences, according to a French minister. Tensions have been growing between the UK and France, as both sides try to sort out the politically-charged matter of how to agree fishing rights after Brexit. Under a new post-Brexit trade deal (which came into force at the start of 2021), EU members states' boats need licences to fish in UK and Jersey waters and UK boats need them to fish in the waters of EU member states. Licences are granted to boats that can prove they have fished in a particular area between 1 February 2017 and 31 January 2020. Requiring proof in this way is normal practice in fisheries management and there are often disputes about the evidence. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels, which come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, find it more difficult to provide this kind of proof. The UK National Federation of Fisherman's Organisations (NFFO)says that,externalsorting legitimate boats that are struggling to find the necessary evidence from the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation is a normal exercise ""best done through quiet dialogue and far from excitable politicians"". In October, the UK and Jersey denied licences to dozens of French boats. On 11 December,external, Jersey ministers gave permanent licences to another five French vessels, taking the total number to 130. That leaves 33 vessels which have temporary licences that are due to expire on 31 January 2022, and 54 applications which have been rejected. A British trawler wasseized by Francein October because it was not on an EU list of vessels that had been granted licences to fish in French waters. The UK government said the trawler had been granted a licence but it was unclear why it was not on the list. The vessel wassubsequently released. The dispute is also about licences for small boats to fish in territorial waters between six and 12 nautical miles from Britain. On 15 December,the UK government said,externalit had received 50 applications for French boats under 12 metres to fish in that zone and that it had issued 19 licences. On 1 December,Guernsey announced,externalthat it had issued licences to 40 boats, it had rejected 15 applications and that it would be issuing another three licences ""in due course"". France made various threats about what would happen if more licences were not issued. Subsequently there was what UK Environment Secretary George Eustice called a ""big de-escalation"" of the row with ""constructive talks"" with France. Then, on 19 November, French President Macron told reporters: ""We have not got what we wanted,"" and added: ""We will not yield."" On 26 November, French fishermen took their own action, including blocking access to French ports for British boats and blocking trucks at the Eurotunnel freight terminal. On 23 December, French Europe Minister Clement Beaune told France 2 television that, in early January, France would be taking its complaints to the special tribunal set up as part of the Brexit agreements. The post-Brexit trade deal,externaloutlines new rules on fishing: EU boats will continue to fish in UK waters for some years to come But UK fishing boats will get a greater share of the fish from UK waters That shift in the share will be phased in between 2021 and 2026, with most of the quota transferred in 2021 After that, there'll be annual negotiations to decide how the catch is shared out between the UK and EU The UK would have the right to completely exclude EU boats after 2026 But the EU could respond with taxes on exports of British fish to the EU or by denying UK boats access to EU waters Both sides agreed that 25% of EU boats' fishing rights in UK waters will be transferred to the UK fishing fleet over a period of five years. This is known as the ""adjustment period"", giving EU fleets time to get used to the new arrangements. The EU wanted it to be longer, the UK wanted it to be shorter - it looks like they've met somewhere in the middle, with an end date of 30 June 2026. The EU fishing quota, which is the amount of fish that EU boats are allowed to catch in UK waters, will be reduced by 15% in the first year and 2.5 percentage points each subsequent year. By 2026, it is estimated that UK boats will have access to an extra Â£145m of fishing quota every year. In 2019, British vessels caught 502,000 tonnes of fish, worth around Â£850m, inside UK waters. The document also sets out details of how each species of fish will be shared out between the UK and the EU during the transition. The UK fleet can expect increases in quota for 57 out of the 90 types of fish caught in UK waters every year. But quota shares for some species like Channel cod, of which EU boats (mainly from France) catch more than 90% each year, will remain unchanged. After the end of the adjustment period in June 2026, there will be annual talks to set the amount EU fishing boats can catch in UK waters (and vice versa) and theoretically the UK could decide to completely withdraw access to its waters for EU vessels, although the EU would be likely to restrict access to its markets and fish to UK fishermen. UK fishermen sell a large proportion of their catch to the EU so access to EU markets is important. In 2019, the UK fishing industry exported more than 333,000 tonnes of fish to the EU. That accounted for nearly half of the total catch of the UK fishing fleet and roughly three quarters of total fish exports from the UK. Some parts of the industry - such as shellfish - are totally dependent on such exports. Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Reality Check: Is Trump right about the Brexit deal?

Fears of Brexit 'food supply disruption growing',"Food and drink supplies in the UK face more disruption after the end of the Brexit transition period than they did from Covid, the industry has said. ""There are 14 [working] days to go,"" the Food and Drink Federation's (FDF) chief executive, Ian Wright, told MPs. ""How on earth can traders prepare in this environment?"" he added. Noting that rules for sending goods from Welsh ports to Northern Ireland had only just been published, he said: ""It's too late, baby."" Uncertainty over a deal and new border checks would make it difficult to guarantee the movement of food through ports without delays, he said. Mr Wright was giving evidence to the Commons business committee on Brexit preparedness. He said there was a big concern that the problems would ""erode the confidence of shoppers in the supply chain"", adding: ""It has done very well over Covid and shoppers will expect the same thing over Brexit, and they may not see it."" PM: 'Sweet reason' can get us to post-Brexit deal NI food supply warnings 'taken very seriously' ""We can't be absolutely certain about the movement of food from the EU to the UK from 1 January for two reasons,"" Mr Wright said. ""One is checks at the border. The other is tariffs, and the problem with tariffs is, we don't know what they will be."" Mr Wright added: ""With just 14 working days to go, we have no clue what's going to happen in terms of whether we do or don't face tariffs. ""And that isn't just a big imposition. It's a binary choice as to whether you do business in most cases. My members will not know whether they're exporting their products after 1 January, or whether they'll be able to afford to import them and charge the price that the tariff will dictate."" Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January 2020, but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months. Talks are happening:The UK and the EU have until 31 December 2020 to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights. If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes. What happens next with Brexit? Mr Wright warned that while he expected Kent and Operation Brock to work ""reasonably well"", he was less confident about ports such as Holyhead, with goods heading to Northern Ireland. He called the Northern Ireland protocol a ""complete shambles"", adding: ""The idea that you can prepare for something as big as the change that's going to happen is ridiculous, it's a massive toll."" Mr Wright added that 43% of FDF members who supply Northern Ireland have said they were not going to do so in the first three months of next year. He told MPs that many companies had lost some of their customer base in the EU. ""The problem is, if there's any disruption to supply, you lose your customer pretty quickly and you do not get them back,"" he added. Miles Celic, chief executive of TheCityUK, told the committee that up to a quarter of the UK's financial activity was EU-related and that in the worst-case scenario, about 40% of that business could be lost. However, he added: ""We've not seen this vast shift in jobs and activity."" Instead, Brexit had acted as a ""strategic accelerator"", with firms taking action such as restructuring EU-based offices as standalone operations. Even so, he warned: ""This all comes ultimately at a cost."" Lloyd Mulkerrins of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said that if tariffs were levied on parts and finished vehicles, the UK's car industry was likely to see a sales decline of 20% to 30%. Production would decline from as much as 1.6 million to just 800,000, he told the MPs. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

Under-18s to be banned from lottery scratchcards,"The age limit for playing the National Lottery is set to be raised from 16 to 18 from next October as the government moves to crackdown on gambling. The government has pledged a ""major and wide-ranging review"" of the sector, which may include limits on online stakes and restrictions on advertising. Betting firms could also be banned from sponsoring football shirts. The current legislation, established in 2005, was ""an analogue law in a digital age"", the government said. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the industry had ""evolved at breakneck speed"" and the aim of the review was to tackle ""problem gambling in all its forms to protect children and vulnerable people"". The age threshold for playing the National Lottery - including scratchcards -  will rise from October 2021. Before that, online sales to 16 and 17-year-olds will stop in April 2021. ""We're committed to protecting young people from gambling-related harm, which is why we are raising the minimum age for the National Lottery,"" said sport minister Nigel Huddleston. ""Patterns of play have changed since its inception, with a shift towards online games, and this change will help make sure the National Lottery, although already low-risk, is not a gateway to problem gambling."" Lockdown 'a disaster' for problem gamblers Gambling on credit cards banned The government is canvassing views on the legislation in the form of a call for evidence, which will run for 16 weeks until the end of March 2021. The Gambling Commission's role and powers will also be looked at, as will promotional offers and whether extra protections for children and young adults are needed. Mr Huddleston told the Commons the review would seek to ""strike a careful balance"" between individual freedom and protecting the vulnerable. Shadow sports minister Alison McGovern welcomed the announcement, but said it was ""disappointing"" that the government had taken so long. In 2018, Paddy Power Betfair was fined Â£2.2m for failing to stop stolen money being gambled on its website and not protecting customers showing signs of problem gambling. Ian Proctor, UK chairman of its parent company Flutter, told the BBC that gambling rules did need to be updated for the digital age. But he warned of ""unintended consequences"" if regulations were not thought through and said that grassroots sports could suffer if sponsorship was restricted. ""We take [problem gambling] incredibly seriously... but let's also get this in a little bit of context,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""For millions of people every week, they enjoy a bet, it's a leisure activity, it gives people a lot of pleasure. For some people it's not, for a small minority. And we need to make gambling safer for those people."" The review of all the apparatus gambling companies use to attract customers - sponsorship, marketing, online promotion and stakes - should be extremely bad news for those companies. This morning, however, the share prices of William Hill and Flutter, the two largest gambling outfits listed on the London market, have scarcely budged. The review was, up to a point, priced in - investors knew it was coming, and its likely scope had been well telegraphed in advance. Shareholders may also reflect that while the government has talked tough on gambling restrictions in the past, reforms have often been watered down, and the companies themselves have been able to develop their businesses in ways not anticipated by regulators. These companies are also less affected by British regulatory developments than in the past. Flutter, the home of SkyBet, Betfair and Paddy Power, is now a FTSE 100 multinational, with operations across the world and the ability to switch investment where it sees fit. William Hill, founded in London between the world wars when gambling was illegal, is being bought by an American company, Caesars Entertainment. The Gambling Commission has imposed big fines on other gambling operators in recent years. In March,online betting firm Betway paid a penalty of Â£11.6mfor failings over customer protection and money-laundering checks, while in Aprilcasino operator Caesars Entertainment UK was hit with a Â£13m penaltyfollowing a ""catalogue"" of social responsibility and money laundering failures. But in June, Parliament'sPublic Accounts Committee described the Gambling Commission as ""toothless""and said it had an ""unacceptably weak understanding"" of the harms of gambling. The review will also examine the actions that customers can take where they feel operators have breached social responsibility requirements. The aim is to ensure customer protection is at the heart of the regulations, while giving those that gamble safely the freedom to do so, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). ""Whilst millions gamble responsibly, the Gambling Act is an analogue law in a digital age... the industry has evolved at breakneck speed,"" said Mr Dowden. Jo Stevens, Labour's shadow culture secretary, said it was ""disappointing that the government has taken more than a year to launch this review, during which time more people have suffered with gambling addiction and without getting vital support"". The Gambling Health Alliance (GHA), an umbrella group for 50 charities and academics, has called for the review to focus on the damage gambling can do to public health. The group's chair, Duncan Stephenson, said for the past 15 years, the public had been at the mercy of a gambling industry which has taken advantage of ""sluggish and inadequate"" regulation. ""We have seen the devastating effects of this on lives lost and ruined, with gambling companies shamelessly exploiting the young and vulnerable, making obscene amounts of money at the expense of some of our most deprived communities,"" he said. The GHA is calling for gambling to be ""de-normalised"", and for a ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship in sports. ""Just as we have rightly taken steps to ramp up the regulation of other harmful products such as tobacco and junk food, we now need to do the same with gambling,"" Mr Stephenson said. Former gambling addict Matt Zarb-Cousin, who runs the Clean Up Gambling campaign group, said: ""This wide-ranging review is a long overdue opportunity to clean up our outdated gambling laws, which are incompatible with the smartphone era."" The gambling review follows a range of measures introduced by the government to protect consumers from the risk of gambling-related harm. Last year, the maximum stake that can be played onfixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT)was cut from Â£100 to Â£2. And in September, the government launched a consultation to explore young people's experiences ofloot boxes in video games.

Biden picks ex-general as defence secretary,"General Lloyd Austin would need a special waiver from Congress because he retired less than seven years ago US President-elect Joe Biden has chosen retired General Lloyd Austin as his defence secretary. If approved, the 67-year-old who retired in 2016 would become the first African-American to lead the Pentagon. He would need a congressional waiver as seven years are required between active duty and becoming military chief. Mr Biden has been facing calls including from Democratic Asian, Black and Latino caucuses to nominate minorities to senior cabinet posts. Veteran Pentagon official MichÃ¨le Flournoy, who would have been the first woman to hold the position, had also been considered a front-runner - as well as Jeh Johnson, a former Pentagon general counsel and former secretary of homeland security. What Biden's new foreign policy team tells us Four-star Gen Austin served under the Obama administration, leading the US Central Command, whose area of responsibility includes the Middle East, Central Asia and part of South Asia, between 2013 and 2016. He was the main military architect of the US-led offensive against the Islamic State group in Iraq and Syria. Before that he was vice-chief of staff of the Army and the last commanding general of the US forces in Iraq. During these years he worked closely with Mr Biden, who was vice-president in the Barack Obama administration. In anAtlantic magazine op-ed,externaldefending his choice, Mr Biden wrote: ""I've spent countless hours with him, in the field and in the White House Situation Room. I've sought his advice, seen his command, and admired his calm and his character. He is the definition of a patriot."" Gen Austin has a reputation for strong leadership and for avoiding the public eye, giving few interviews and opting to not speak publicly about military operations. Joe Biden and Gen Lloyd Austin - pictured here in Iraq in 2011 - worked closely together during the Obama administration Gen Austin had once been viewed as a long-shot candidate,externalbut in recent days emerged as a top-tier contender and a safe choice. But the nomination could draw criticism from some progressive groups over Gen Austin's position in recent years as a member of the board of directors of defence contractor Raytheon and opposition from lawmakers in Congress who favour a clear civilian control of the Pentagon. The required congressional waiver has been granted only twice, most recently in the case of James Mattis, the retired Marine general who served as President Donald Trump's first defence secretary. Asking Congress to issue the needed waiver, Mr Biden wrote: ""The next secretary of defence will need to immediately quarterback an enormous logistics operation to help distribute Covid-19 vaccines widely and equitably. ""Austin oversaw the largest logistical operation undertaken by the Army in six decades - the Iraq drawdown."" The president-elect offered and Gen Austin accepted the post on Sunday, reports said. News of the nomination emerged ahead of a meeting between Mr Biden, Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and civil rights groups on Tuesday. Rev Al Sharpton, the civil rights activist, said the decision was ""a step in the right direction but not the end of the walk"". This video can not be played How are Biden voters in a Trump heartland dealing with the election aftermath? The decision comes two weeks after Mr Biden announced other senior members of his national security team. Mr Biden defeated Republican President Trump in the 3 November election.

'Cold water swim obliterated my short-term memory',"Sue Hodge says people should not be put off sea swimming but wants them to know the risks A woman who lost her short-term memory after swimming in the sea last month has said people should not be put off. Sue Hodge, 66, has no memory of going in the sea or even driving to Newquay in Cornwall for a swim on 18 November. Her friend noticed she appeared ""vacant"" and confused after the short swim and called an ambulance to take her to hospital. Her next memory was seven hours later and medics told her the cold water had triggeredtransient global amnesia,external. Sea swimming has become increasingly popular during 2020 while indoor pools have largely remained closed. A woman-only sea swimming group in Newquay had 25 members at the start of the year, and now has more than 2,000. Sea swimming is known to have significant mental and physical health benefits Mrs Hodge said: ""We went swimming at about 16:00, and the next thing I remember is waking up in A&E at 23:00. The nurse told me I'd had an amnesic episode. ""My long-term memory was fine but I couldn't remember anything about what had happened. I couldn't remember even coming into Newquay for the swim, all of that was just obliterated, gone. ""The consultant who spoke to me said this can be caused through cold water, and so it must have been that which triggered it."" Sue Semley called an ambulance after becoming concerned for her friend She said she would be avoiding the sea for now ""because I would like for it not to happen again"" but said that others ""should still do it, because it is really good fun and the after-effects are great"". Mrs Hodge was swimming with her friend Sue Semley, who said: ""She was just staring. I called her name and she was just staring and she didn't know where she was, and became increasingly agitated."" Mrs Semley and other swimmers in the group said they had never seen anybody react in this way to cold water previously. Explaining what she enjoyed about swimming in the sea, Mrs Semley said: ""I just love the way it makes you feel. The cold water makes you feel incredible and really sets you up for the day."" Swimmers are advised to make sure they can warm up quickly after getting out of the sea Professor Mike Tipton, from the Extreme Environments Laboratory at the University of Portsmouth, said: ""There's an enormous number of people now doing it (sea swimming). ""We are not trying to stop people because exercising is really important, but we must do it safely. ""We should realise that we are a tropical animal and want to be in 28 degree air and going into 10 degree water is probably the biggest stress you can pose on the body."" Allow Twitter content?

Shareholders may also reflect that while the government has talked tough on gambling restrictions in the past, reforms have often been watered down, and the companies themselves have been able to develop their businesses in ways not anticipated by regulators. These companies are also less affected by British regulatory developments than in the past. Flutter, the home of SkyBet, Betfair and Paddy Power, is now a FTSE 100 multinational, with operations across the world and the ability to switch investment where it sees fit. William Hill, founded in London between the world wars when gambling was illegal, is being bought by an American company, Caesars Entertainment. The Gambling Commission has imposed big fines on other gambling operators in recent years. In March,online betting firm Betway paid a penalty of Â£11.6mfor failings over customer protection and money-laundering checks, while in Aprilcasino operator Caesars Entertainment UK was hit with a Â£13m penaltyfollowing a ""catalogue"" of social responsibility and money laundering failures. But in June, Parliament'sPublic Accounts Committee described the Gambling Commission as ""toothless""and said it had an ""unacceptably weak understanding"" of the harms of gambling. The review will also examine the actions that customers can take where they feel operators have breached social responsibility requirements. The aim is to ensure customer protection is at the heart of the regulations, while giving those that gamble safely the freedom to do so, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). ""Whilst millions gamble responsibly, the Gambling Act is an analogue law in a digital age... the industry has evolved at breakneck speed,"" said Mr Dowden. Jo Stevens, Labour's shadow culture secretary, said it was ""disappointing that the government has taken more than a year to launch this review, during which time more people have suffered with gambling addiction and without getting vital support"". The Gambling Health Alliance (GHA), an umbrella group for 50 charities and academics, has called for the review to focus on the damage gambling can do to public health. The group's chair, Duncan Stephenson, said for the past 15 years, the public had been at the mercy of a gambling industry which has taken advantage of ""sluggish and inadequate"" regulation. ""We have seen the devastating effects of this on lives lost and ruined, with gambling companies shamelessly exploiting the young and vulnerable, making obscene amounts of money at the expense of some of our most deprived communities,"" he said. The GHA is calling for gambling to be ""de-normalised"", and for a ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship in sports. ""Just as we have rightly taken steps to ramp up the regulation of other harmful products such as tobacco and junk food, we now need to do the same with gambling,"" Mr Stephenson said. Former gambling addict Matt Zarb-Cousin, who runs the Clean Up Gambling campaign group, said: ""This wide-ranging review is a long overdue opportunity to clean up our outdated gambling laws, which are incompatible with the smartphone era."" The gambling review follows a range of measures introduced by the government to protect consumers from the risk of gambling-related harm. Last year, the maximum stake that can be played onfixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT)was cut from Â£100 to Â£2. And in September, the government launched a consultation to explore young people's experiences ofloot boxes in video games.

Children 'at risk' from encrypted message apps,"By age 12, 90% of children use an online messaging app - despite a 13+ age requirement Encryption of online messages could make it harder to police child abuse and grooming online, the children's commissioner for England has warned. End-to-end encryption is a privacy feature that makes it impossible for anyone except the sender and recipient to read messages sent online. Commissioner Anne Longfield said it also prevented police from gathering evidence to prosecute child abusers. But digital rights groups see it as an essential part of online privacy. Facebook, which is behind the most popular messaging apps children use, already offers end-to-end encryption for Whatsapp. It has added an opt-in version to its Messenger service, with plans to make it the default for all its platforms. That could include Instagram, which does not yet have it. Ms Longfield's warning came as she launched a new report looking at how children used online messaging apps. It found the vast majority of children aged eight and over used some sort of messaging service. That includes 60% of eight-year-olds and 90% of 12-year-olds, despite the main such apps having an age restriction of at least 13, if not older. Child protectors urge Facebook encryption rethink Child abuse images being traded via apps More than a third of children surveyed for the report said they had received a message that made them feel uncomfortable. One in 10 talk to strangers online, and one in 20 have shared videos or photos of themselves with strangers. Ms Longfield said the report ""shows how vigilant parents need to be, but also how the tech giants are failing to regulate themselves and so are failing to keep children safe"". She is calling on the government to make the big tech firms responsible when it introduces the long-delayed Online Harms Bill, with large fines for companies that breach their ""duty of care"". She has warned against classifying encrypted messaging as ""private communications"". Doing so could offer an exemption for the tech giants on their duty of care, she said. That ""could be a cynical attempt on the part of some tech firms to side-step sanctions and litigation"" she warned. A spokesman for the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport responded: ""Children will be at the heart of our new online harms laws with tough sanctions on social media platforms that fail to protect young people from harm. ""We are clear that firms should only implement end-to-end encryption if it can be done without preventing action against child abuse."" Ever since Mark Zuckerberg announced in March 2019 that end-to-end encryption was going to become standard across Facebook's messaging platforms, the criticism of the plan has got ever louder. Mr Zuckerberg himself has admitted that the move could harm the fight against child abuse. ""You're fighting that battle with at least a hand tied behind your back,"" he told a Facebook staff meeting. Now the Children's Commissioner has joined those warning of the damaging effects of making messages too secret. But her broadside may be aimed less at the tech firms than at the government, which she and other critics feel has dragged its heels on the issue of regulating online content. A year and a half after the publication of  the Online Harms White Paper, there is still no clarity about when it will be turned into law and what sort of sanctions might be in it. This week saw Labour's Margaret Hodge, a victim of online abuse, call for either an end to anonymity on social media or for directors of the platforms to be made liable for defamatory posts. The critics' shopping list for measures against the tech giants is getting longer. Meanwhile, ministers must try to work out what is practicable as well as desirable. The commissioner says that end-to-end encryption should not be applied at all to children's accounts, and that tech companies should ""retain the ability to scan for child sexual abuse material"". ""It's time for the government to show it hasn't lost its nerve and that it is prepared to stand up to the powerful internet giants, who are such a big part in our children's lives,"" she said. This video can not be played What is encryption? Digital rights organisations, however, have long argued that encryption is essential. The Open Rights Group,externalaccuses the government of using the Online Harms Bill to weaken security for everyone, warning that a ban on encryption ""would create a degree of surveillance and government intrusion that simply should not be tolerated in a democratic society"". TheElectronic Frontier Foundation,external, meanwhile, says encryption ""is one of the most powerful tools individuals have for maintaining their digital privacy and security in an increasingly insecure world"". Facebook, as the owner of three messaging apps, said that child exploitation has ""no place on our platforms"" and that it has been ""developing news ways"" to prevent and detect abuse. But it remains in favour of encryption, with added anti-abuse features. ""End-to-end encryption is already the leading technology used by many services to keep people safe"", a spokesman said. ""Through a combination of advanced technology and user reports, WhatsApp bans around 250,000 accounts each month suspected of sharing child exploitative imagery.""

"Christchurch massacre 'unpreventable', says inquiryBut the report reveals there were a series of failures ahead of the 2019 attack in New Zealand.","Armed guards outside Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand An inquiry into the Christchurch massacre has found a series of failures ahead of the 2019 attack, but concluded the tragedy was unpreventable. The inquiry was launched after white supremacist Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people at two mosques in March 2019. It found he had been able to accumulate a massive trove of weapons, with authorities failing to enforce proper checks on firearms licences. It further found officials were overly focused on Islamist terrorism. However, correcting these failures would not have stopped the Australian national, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole earlier this year, from carrying out the attack, it said. What's more, the patchwork of clues discovered by police after the massacre - including his steroid abuse, a hospital admission after he accidentally shot himself, and visits to far-right websites - would not have proved enough to predict the attack. ""The commission found no failures within any government agencies that would have allowed the terrorist planning and preparation to be detected,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said afterthe release of the report.,external ""But they did identify many lessons to be learnt and significant areas that require change."" This video can not be played Ardern: 'Muslim New Zealanders should be safe' She highlighted ""failings within the firearms licensing regime"" and ""inappropriate concentration of resources"" on a perceived level of Islamist threats. ""While the commission made no findings that these issues would have stopped the attack, these were failings nonetheless and, for that, on behalf of the government I apologise."" The people killed as they prayed Christchurch killer to stay in jail until he dies The report includes a list of recommendations which the government said it would all accept, including establishing a new national intelligence and security agency and a proposal for the police to better identify and respond to hate crimes. The government also plans to create an ethnic community ministry and a graduate programme for ethnic communities. The imam of the Al Noor Mosque, one of the two places of worship targeted, said the report confirmed that authorities had been overly suspicious of the Muslim community instead of protecting it. ""We've known for a long time that the Muslim community has been targeted with hate speech and hate crimes - this report shows that we are right,"" Gamal Fouda said. ""The report shows that institutional prejudice and unconscious bias exists in government agencies and that needs to change."" He stressed that the changes recommended in the report should now be used to rebuild the trust between the Muslim community and the police. Aya Al-Umari, whose brother died in the attack, told the BBC that the report's recommendations highlighted ""all the right areas"". ""That is mainly: improving New Zealand's counter terrorism efforts, the firearm licensing, the social cohesion and New Zealand's response to the increasing diversity of our population,"" Ms Al-Umari said. She also said she hoped New Zealand's experience would provide lessons to other countries, noting that the response would have to be at an individual level as well. ""We each play a part in reducing hate crimes and reducing our unconscious bias. That escalates to what we saw on March 15 last year."" This video can not be played 'I can't forgive my attacker' However, the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand criticised the report for what they said was a lack of transparency. ""There are multiple areas of evidence that have not been investigated, and questions raised by IWCNZ have been ignored,"" the group said. ""We find it concerning that the commissioners found systemic failures and an inappropriate concentration of resources towards Islamic terrorism, and yet state that these would not have made a difference to the terrorist being detected prior to the event."" The Australian national, who lived off his savings and a large inheritance from his father, got a firearms licence and began buying rifles, shotguns and ammunition soon after he arrived in New Zealand in 2017. Later that year, he told a doctor he had been taking steroids and was injecting testosterone several times a week. The doctor warned against this, but no further treatment followed. Over the following years, he visited far-right websites and occasionally posted right-wing material on his Facebook page. He also donated money to far-right groups overseas. In 2018, he wounded himself in a firearms accident and was worried that seeking treatment might alert the police. He eventually went to hospital but his injury did no raise suspicion and was not reported. In the run-up to the attack, he tried to conceal some of his digital footprint, but investigators were able to track in some detail his reconnaissance efforts, planning and preparation for the attack on 15 March. None of the details uncovered by police after the massacre stood out at the time as something which would have raised suspicion from authorities, the report found. On 15 March, the Australian attacker opened fire on worshippers inside the Al Noor mosque, broadcasting the attack on Facebook Live via a headcam he was wearing. He then drove to the Linwood Islamic Centre where he shot people outside and then shot at the windows. A man from inside the centre rushed outside and picked up one of the attacker's shotguns before chasing him away. This video can not be played The BBC report from the day of the shootings Police officers then chased and arrested the gunman. After his arrest, the attacker told police that his plan was to burn down mosques after his initial attack and he wished he had done so. During his sentencing in August this year, the court heard that he had planned to target another mosque, but was detained by officers on the way. Earlier this year, the attacker wassentenced to life in prison without parole. The judge called his actions ""inhuman"", saying he had ""showed no mercy"". The massacre also prompted New Zealand to reform its gun laws. Less than a month after the shootings, the country's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms. The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme. New Zealanders handed in their semi-automatic weapons While there was widespread praise for how New Zealand dealt with the tragedy in the aftermath, there was also criticism that authorities might have ignored warnings that hate crimes against the Muslim community were escalating. In response to that, the government launched the the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the massacre.  It is the highest level of independent inquiry available under New Zealand law. The report took about 18 months to compile and contains interviews with hundreds of people including security agencies, Muslim community leaders and international experts. ""Ultimately, this roughly 800-page report can be distilled into one simple premise,"" Ms Ardern said. ""Muslim New Zealanders should be safe. Anyone who calls New Zealand home, regardless of race, religion, sex or sexual orientation should be safe.""

A quick guide to what's happening with Brexit,"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

'Others deserve the jab before me',"Laura Nuttall was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2018 ""I'm still getting out there and I'm trying to live my life, despite Covid."" Two years ago, when Laura Nuttall was 18, she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. She has had surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and is now undergoing immunotherapy treatment in Germany. Laura's immunocompromised, which means her immune system is weak and might be unable to fight infections and other diseases. ""I obviously take precautions, maybe more seriously than others, the 20-year-old student tells Newsbeat. ""It's nerve wracking"", her mum Nicola says. ""I am very conscious that if Laura was to get Covid, I have no idea how badly it might hit her."" Mum Nicola and daughter Laura disagree about when she should get the Covid-19 vaccine Laura says she feels like she's ""doing fine"" and wants others, particularly older people, to get the Covid-19 vaccine before she does. ""I feel like there are people that deserve the vaccine, before I get it."" Her mum disagrees. ""I would feel a lot happier, knowing that she'd had the vaccine and was protected,"" she says. NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the safety checks for vaccines? When Laura was diagnosed, doctors gave her 12 to 18 months to live. Nicola says having a vaccine sooner would give Laura a bit more freedom, flexibility and more confidence. ""I don't want her to stop living her life and stop socialising - I don't want her to have to stay in. ""I think it's so important to know that she's had the vaccine early and we're not going to have to wait, it could be the best part of half a year before she gets a turn."" At the moment, they don't know when Laura will get the vaccine, as she mayfourth or sixth on the list of priorities. ""It's the worst thing you can ever imagine being told, that your daughter has a terminal diagnosis,"" Nicola says. ""It's been hugely traumatic to see Laura go through surgery and radiotherapy, to lose her hair, and have to go through chemotherapy every month for 12 months."" Although she says it's been tough, Laura has always been very positive. ""There's no rollercoaster ride like this one, it's horrific. ""It turns your stomach. ""But there have been highs, like the things we've done."" Laura and her mum Nicola have been on loads of adventures - and even attended a film premiere The family decided to start a bucket list of things to do in 2019. ""I took a gap year - a kind of an enforced gap year - and I did wonderful things,"" Laura says. She travelled - going on safari in South Africa and taking trips to Amsterdam and New York. She monster trucks, drove buses, spent a day with the police, went to football matches, watched beans being made in the Heinz factory and went fishing with Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse. Laura Nuttall went fishing with Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse She even got to meet Michelle Obama. ""I was kind of doing those just to make a statement that my life would not be limited by having cancer. ""I'm really glad that we managed to get out and do all the crazy stuff that we did. ""Having those memories to look back gives me a boost when I feel low during Covid."" Now Laura is in her second year at Manchester University studying politics, philosophy and economics. Until she gets the vaccine she says she's ""being sensible"" but continuing to live her life. Laura had loads of adventures in 2019, including going on a monster truck Looking back at 2019, Nicola and Laura say they feel thankful they did it all before the pandemic, as they don't know whether they'll have the time or opportunity to continue their family adventures. ""We have made good use of the time we had and I'm really glad it happened last year when we were able to do so many things that we couldn't do this year,"" Nicola says.

Twenty-five men and women from Palmerston residential home in east Belfast were vaccinated on Tuesday morning. Thirty-five members of staff are in the process of getting the jab. Earlier on Tuesday, the first Covid-19 vaccination in Northern Ireland was administered. Sister Joanna Sloan - who will head up the vaccine roll out in Belfast - received the jab just after 08:00 GMT at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The roll outinvolves 70 hospital hubs across the UK which are gearing up to provide the Pfizer/BioNTech jab. On Tuesday, the Belfast Trust confirmed to BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme that 250 people had received the vaccination in Northern Ireland. Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, becamethe first person in the world to get the jab as part of a mass vaccination programme, She is originally from Enniskillen, County Fermanagh and called the vaccination the ""best early birthday present"". This video can not be played Coronavirus: First Covid-19 vaccine in NI given to nurse Palmerston is a purpose built dementia care home providing 24 hour care to older people in East Belfast. As well as the residents, 35 members of staff are in the process of  getting the jab. Speaking to BBC News NI, home manager Paul Johnston said it had been a ""good day"". The home had outbreaks of the virus in October but is now virus-free. Mr Johnston, who also was vaccinated, said it was only yesterday that he received the call from the Belfast Health Trust to arrange the vaccinations but was delighted and relieved to be able to protect the residents. ""We had to gain consent from the families - it has been full on but we are getting there,"" he said. ""Really it has been no different from administering the flu jab. It wasn't painful at all and so far so good with all the residents."" The Department of Health recorded 14 further deaths linked to Covid-19 on Tuesday, taking its total death toll to 1,073. It also confirmed 351 new positive cases of Covid-19, bringing the total number of positive cases in Northern Ireland to 55,795. In the Republic of Ireland, there was one further death linked to coronavirus reported, with 2,097 people having died in total. There were also 215 further confirmed cases of the virus, meaning there have been 74,682 cases recorded in the country since the pandemic began. The first recipient of the vaccine in Northern Ireland, Ms Sloan, will manage the Belfast Trust's vaccination centre. Speaking earlier on Tuesday, she said she felt emotional and proud to be part of history.

Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said it was the ""best early birthday present"". The Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine is one of a number that have been developed so far, withOxford-AstraZenecaandModernaseeking approval for their vaccines. Health Minister Robin Swann hailed the vaccination rollout as a ""game changer"". Mr Swann warned that distribution of the vaccine would be a massive logistical challenge - particularly in care homes, which will require 12,000 doses -  but he said those in care homes would start to receive the vaccine soon. The vaccine must be stored at about -70C and needs to be transported in special boxes, packed in dry ice. Once delivered, it can be kept for up to five days in a fridge. NI woman gets first Covid-19 vaccine outisde trial conditions Mass vaccination programme begins Who will be the first to get the vaccine? Vaccine rumours debunked What are the safety checks for vaccines? Stocks of the vaccine were transported to Northern Ireland via the Republic of Ireland, having arrived into Dublin port from Holyhead. They are being kept at an undisclosed central storage facility operated by a private company. Dr Alan Stout, chairman of Northern Ireland's GP committee, warned the vaccine rollout did not symbolise the end of the pandemic. ""It is so important that people still follow the rules and follow the guidance,"" he told BBC Radio Foyle. More than 600 volunteer vaccinators across Northern Ireland will be given the injection this week, ahead of the biggest inoculation programme in UK history. The UK will be the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine after regulators approved its use last week. About 25,000 doses were delivered to Northern Ireland last Friday. Vaccination will not be compulsory. Ministers have warned it could be Easter by the time restrictions are lifted in a significant way. The vaccine will be rolled out at seven sites across Northern Ireland: â¢Belfast Trust - Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast â¢South Eastern Trust - Ulster Hospital, Dundonald â¢Southern Trust - South Lake Leisure Centre, Craigavon â¢Northern Trust - Seven Towers Leisure Centre, Ballymena â¢Western Trust  - Foyle Arena, Londonderry, Omagh Leisure Centre and Lakeside Leisure Centre, Enniskillen.

The EuroMillions winners who have given away Â£60m,"Frances and Patrick Connolly wrote a list of 50 friends and family members who they wanted to help A Northern Ireland couple who won Â£115m in the EuroMillions lottery two years ago have already given away more than half to loved ones, charity and those in need during the Covid-19 pandemic. Frances and Patrick Connolly have handed out Â£60m sincetheir jackpot in the 2019 New Year's Day draw. It was the biggest ever EuroMillions win in NI. National Lottery operator Camelot said it was one of the biggest giveaways it has seen. The couple from Moira, County Down, wrote a list of 50 friends and family members who they wanted to help. Since then they have extended their generosity in various ways, including setting up two charitable foundations - the Kathleen Graham Trust in Northern Ireland, named after Frances' mother, and the PFC Trust in County Durham, where they now live. Frances Connolly said the last two years had been ""a total joyride"" Other good deeds include buying gifts for 1,000 pensioners who will be in hospital on Christmas Day and purchasing hundreds of electronic tablets so elderly care home residents can video call their families. They have also paid for a young refugee boy to continue to travel to his secondary school for the rest of his education. Mrs Connolly described the last two years as an ""absolutely manic whirlwind and a total, total joyride from start to finish"". She said they were speaking out now to draw attention to the charitable work being done by so many at the end of a challenging year. ""People need to be celebrated,"" she said. ""Not me, not by any stretch of the imagination, but by me talking I could draw attention to the fact that, actually, we're a nation of heroes here."" Following their big win, their list of family and friends to help included their daughters, Mrs Connolly's three sisters and two brothers and Mr Connolly's three sisters. They also gave all their nieces and nephews money to buy their own homes. This year much of their focus has been on helping those on the Covid-19 frontline. Mrs Connolly bought new sewing machines for a group in NI when she heard they were making personal protective equipment (PPE) for health workers. Mr Connolly, who owns a number of plastics manufacturing factories, also arranged for supplies for a charity that was using 3D printers to make visors. Back in Northern Ireland, the couple funded hot meal deliveries, Â£50 thank you vouchers for 150 front-line workers, provided laptops for vulnerable secondary school pupils to distance learn, contributed to a befriending service for those living alone and helped with a teddy bear's picnic for 400 families. Meanwhile the couple, who famously celebrated their win with a cup of tea, have resisted the jet-set lifestyle of new millionaires. They now live in a five-bedroom bungalow in County Durham - albeit with a tennis court and a swimming pool - but this was a more modest option compared to the castle and 15-bed stately home, complete with its own village, that were offered to them. When visiting their daughter in New Zealand, they choose not to fly first class - settling for business class instead - reasoning that the cost could help a young couple to pay off a mortgage. Mr Connolly has chosen to continue to work while Mrs Connolly, who formerly worked in education and now runs their charities, recently treated herself to a brand new car, an E-Pace Jaguar, but said she only bought it new because she could not find a second-hand electric vehicle. ""We've no need for supercars and I'm so proud that our daughters also drive second-hand cars,"" she said. ""It's something that does the job and there's no need to be flash.""

Under-18s banned from lottery amid gambling review,"The age limit for playing the National Lottery is set to be raised from 16 to 18 from next October as the government moves to crackdown on gambling. The government has pledged a ""major and wide-ranging review"" of the sector, which may include limits on online stakes and restrictions on advertising. Betting firms could also be banned from sponsoring football shirts. The current legislation, established in 2005, was ""an analogue law in a digital age"", the government said. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the industry had ""evolved at breakneck speed"" and the aim of the review was to tackle ""problem gambling in all its forms to protect children and vulnerable people"". The age threshold for playing the National Lottery - including scratchcards -  will rise from October 2021. Before that, online sales to 16 and 17-year-olds will stop in April 2021. ""We're committed to protecting young people from gambling-related harm, which is why we are raising the minimum age for the National Lottery,"" said sport minister Nigel Huddleston. ""Patterns of play have changed since its inception, with a shift towards online games, and this change will help make sure the National Lottery, although already low-risk, is not a gateway to problem gambling."" Lockdown 'a disaster' for problem gamblers Gambling on credit cards banned The government is canvassing views on the legislation in the form of a call for evidence, which will run for 16 weeks until the end of March 2021. The Gambling Commission's role and powers will also be looked at, as will promotional offers and whether extra protections for children and young adults are needed. Mr Huddleston told the Commons the review would seek to ""strike a careful balance"" between individual freedom and protecting the vulnerable. Shadow sports minister Alison McGovern welcomed the announcement, but said it was ""disappointing"" that the government had taken so long. In 2018, Paddy Power Betfair was fined Â£2.2m for failing to stop stolen money being gambled on its website and not protecting customers showing signs of problem gambling. Ian Proctor, UK chairman of its parent company Flutter, told the BBC that gambling rules did need to be updated for the digital age. But he warned of ""unintended consequences"" if regulations were not thought through and said that grassroots sports could suffer if sponsorship was restricted. ""We take [problem gambling] incredibly seriously... but let's also get this in a little bit of context,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""For millions of people every week, they enjoy a bet, it's a leisure activity, it gives people a lot of pleasure. For some people it's not, for a small minority. And we need to make gambling safer for those people."" The review of all the apparatus gambling companies use to attract customers - sponsorship, marketing, online promotion and stakes - should be extremely bad news for those companies. This morning, however, the share prices of William Hill and Flutter, the two largest gambling outfits listed on the London market, have scarcely budged. The review was, up to a point, priced in - investors knew it was coming, and its likely scope had been well telegraphed in advance. Shareholders may also reflect that while the government has talked tough on gambling restrictions in the past, reforms have often been watered down, and the companies themselves have been able to develop their businesses in ways not anticipated by regulators. These companies are also less affected by British regulatory developments than in the past. Flutter, the home of SkyBet, Betfair and Paddy Power, is now a FTSE 100 multinational, with operations across the world and the ability to switch investment where it sees fit. William Hill, founded in London between the world wars when gambling was illegal, is being bought by an American company, Caesars Entertainment. The Gambling Commission has imposed big fines on other gambling operators in recent years. In March,online betting firm Betway paid a penalty of Â£11.6mfor failings over customer protection and money-laundering checks, while in Aprilcasino operator Caesars Entertainment UK was hit with a Â£13m penaltyfollowing a ""catalogue"" of social responsibility and money laundering failures. But in June, Parliament'sPublic Accounts Committee described the Gambling Commission as ""toothless""and said it had an ""unacceptably weak understanding"" of the harms of gambling. The review will also examine the actions that customers can take where they feel operators have breached social responsibility requirements. The aim is to ensure customer protection is at the heart of the regulations, while giving those that gamble safely the freedom to do so, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). ""Whilst millions gamble responsibly, the Gambling Act is an analogue law in a digital age... the industry has evolved at breakneck speed,"" said Mr Dowden. Jo Stevens, Labour's shadow culture secretary, said it was ""disappointing that the government has taken more than a year to launch this review, during which time more people have suffered with gambling addiction and without getting vital support"". The Gambling Health Alliance (GHA), an umbrella group for 50 charities and academics, has called for the review to focus on the damage gambling can do to public health. The group's chair, Duncan Stephenson, said for the past 15 years, the public had been at the mercy of a gambling industry which has taken advantage of ""sluggish and inadequate"" regulation. ""We have seen the devastating effects of this on lives lost and ruined, with gambling companies shamelessly exploiting the young and vulnerable, making obscene amounts of money at the expense of some of our most deprived communities,"" he said. The GHA is calling for gambling to be ""de-normalised"", and for a ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship in sports. ""Just as we have rightly taken steps to ramp up the regulation of other harmful products such as tobacco and junk food, we now need to do the same with gambling,"" Mr Stephenson said. Former gambling addict Matt Zarb-Cousin, who runs the Clean Up Gambling campaign group, said: ""This wide-ranging review is a long overdue opportunity to clean up our outdated gambling laws, which are incompatible with the smartphone era."" The gambling review follows a range of measures introduced by the government to protect consumers from the risk of gambling-related harm. Last year, the maximum stake that can be played onfixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT)was cut from Â£100 to Â£2. And in September, the government launched a consultation to explore young people's experiences ofloot boxes in video games.

'Mix-and-match' Covid vaccines to be testedTrials are being planned in the UK to see if combining Covid vaccines might give the best protection.Health,"UK scientists are planning trials to see if giving people two different types of Covid vaccine, one after the other, might give better protection than two doses of one jab. This mix-and-match approach can go ahead only if another jab is approved by regulators, as has already happened with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The head of the UK's vaccine task force said trial designs were being prepared. The news comes as the NHS starts its Covid mass vaccination programme. A 90-year-old woman, Margaret Keenan, has become the first person to be given the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine as part of the rollout across the UK. Ms Keenan, who is originally from Enniskillen, said: ""I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19. It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year after being on my own for most of the year."" That vaccine, given as two doses a few weeks apart, offers up to 95% protection against Covid-19 illness, according to data. Although that is a very impressive figure, experts want to explore whether the immune response can be strengthened further and made more durable with a mix-and-match ""heterologous boost"" approach. Kate Bingham, who chairs the vaccine task force, said: ""It's an established process. ""It's not being done because of supplies."" There isanother Covid jab that could soon be approvedby regulators - the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine. This works in a slightly different way to the Pfizer jab which could make it a good companion for pairing, say scientists. ThePfizer vaccine uses a small amount of genetic code from the pandemic virusto teach the body how to fight off an infection, while the Oxford one is a genetically modified virus that has been altered so it won't cause infection but does carry information on how to beat Covid. The idea is to give people a shot of the Pfizer vaccine followed by a dose of the Oxford one a few weeks later or vice versa, rather than two doses of the same vaccine. The hope is that it will make the immune system produce two responses strongly - antibodies and T-cells - to combat Covid. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

PM to meet EU chief in bid to save Brexit deal,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels later this week to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a last-ditch bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. It comes after a 90-minute phone call between the two leaders on Monday failed to produce a breakthrough. In a joint statement, they said the conditions for a deal were ""not there"". ""Significant differences"" remained on fishing, business competition rules and governance of any deal, they added. ""We asked our chief negotiators and their teams to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days,"" the leaders said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Wednesday or Friday appeared the ""most likely"" dates. Labour welcomed the decision to keep talking, but shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the prime minister should have been ""more engaged in these negotiations months ago rather than leaving it to the 11th hour"". What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart Lord Frost have been locked in intensive talks for the past week. They will meet again on Tuesday to draw up a list of outstanding differences. And on Thursday, EU leaders will meet at a summit in Brussels. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? A senior UK government source said: ""Talks are in the same position now as they were on Friday. We have made no tangible progress. It's clear this must now continue politically."" They added that the government did not ""consider this process to be closed"" but ""things are looking very tricky and there's every chance we are not going to get there"". The UK and EU have been trading for years without paying tariffs or doing customs or border checks. Rules have stayed the same despite the UK leaving the EU on 31 January, but that is all set to change at the start of next year. If an agreement is not reached and ratified by 31 December, the UK and EU could introduce import charges on each other's goods. The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility has said leaving the EU customs union and single market without a trade deal could lead to a 2% reduction in national income next year. True, there is only a tiny circle of people who know exactly what is going on. But the messages coming out from the centre are that much more than a nip and tuck is required to get this done. The leaders haven't asked their negotiators to have another go. They've asked them to sit down and make a list of all the things that are wrong. In tone, it's very different to previous such moments, when they were required to put the icing on a cake that was very nearly baked. Read more from Laura here. News of the upcoming meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen came as a bit of a relief to those close to the EU negotiating team. There's been a sense of frustration building for months now at the circular nature of talks. EU and UK negotiators say they've gone over and over the three main sticking points: fish, competition regulations and how to police a deal, if one is ever reached. There's been mutual, mounting frustration at the perceived intransigence of the other side and a questioning of whether sitting down together one more time to repeat the same arguments - again - could ever be the solution. Political intervention at the highest level has long been needed, to give a nod and a wink to negotiators to agree the difficult compromises, or to get involved in person. Phone calls between the prime minister and the European Commission president (who represents all 27 EU countries in this case) have seemed inconclusive so far. Face-to-face, this could be different. The two leaders might finally find agreement, give the decisive push to get there, or maybe jointly admit that this deal can't be done now. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the so-called""level playing field""- a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to follow EU rules closely in areas such as workers' rights and environmental regulations, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved. On fishing, the EU is warning that, without ongoing access to UK waters for its fleets, UK fishermen will no longer have special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters should be under its control as a sovereign country. The UK and EU, however, appear to be moving closer tosettling a dispute over last year's Withdrawal Agreementwhich, if resolved, would clear one potential obstacle to a trade deal. Shortly before the two leaders spoke on the phone, the UK said it was willing to remove parts of the Internal Market Bill, legislation would give it the power to override the Brexit deal in defiance of international law. The UK said a solution which would render the measures unnecessary could be found within days following separate discussions in Brussels involving Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. But later on Monday, MPs voted toreinstate the measures, which were taken out by the House of Lords last month, as a ""fall back"" option in case there is no agreement.

What happens if there's no deal?,"With time running out for the UK and EU to reach a trade agreement - and with the prospect of no deal looming - the government has been talking about an ""Australian-style"" relationship with the EU in the future. Boris Johnson has frequently mentioned Australia, and has also said the UK should ""get ready to trade on WTO terms"". Whichever form of words you use, they are euphemisms for the same thing: a no-deal outcome. Australia trades with the EU under the basic rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO) because it does not currently have a free trade agreement with the EU. But it is trying to negotiate one. ""Australians wouldn't regard our trade relationship with Europe as a satisfactory one,"" the former Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull told the BBC. He warned the UK to""be careful what you wish for"". Under WTO rules, tariffs (or taxes) are automatically applied to the trade in goods between Australia and the EU. But even though there is no overall free trade deal, the two sides do have a series of agreements on things like wine exports and product standards, which make trade a little easier. If the UK's talks with the EU were to break down abruptly, the UK would not have any such agreements. With no deal, in other words, the UK would be facing an even more limited trading relationship with the EU than Australia has (the strictest limits would be on trade involving Great Britain - Northern Ireland would be treated differently). On top of that, it is important to remember that trade between Australia and the EU is very different to trade between the UK and the EU. Australia is on the other side of the world, whereas the UK is the EU's next-door neighbour. That means Australia doesn't do nearly as much trade with the EU as the UK does. And it doesn't rely on the EU, in the way the UK does, for the operation of just-in-time supply chains in sectors such as cars, pharmaceuticals and food. So, border checks and delays - which happen much more when you don't have trade deals - have far less impact on EU-Australia trade than they would on EU-UK trade. Even so, Australia is trying to upgrade its relationship with the EU - the two sides have been negotiating a free trade deal since 2018. Mr Turnbull told BBC Question Time, ""Australians would not regard our trade relationship with Europe as being a satisfactory one...there are very big barriers to Australian exports of agriculture products in particular and a lot of friction in the system in terms of services."" The EU is the UK's biggest single trading partner.In 2019, it accounted for:,external 43% of UK exports 51% of UK imports As an EU member state, the UK was part of its trading system - the customs union and the single market. This means there are no tariffs on goods, and minimal border checks. Because of the post-Brexit transition period, the UK is still in this system until the end of December. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Both sides have until then to reach a new free-trade agreement, which would get rid of tariffs and quotas (limits on the number of goods traded) but not new border bureaucracy. If they can't, then they'd have to trade on WTO rules - as Australia does. The WTO is the place where countries negotiate the rules of international trade - there are 164 members and if they don't have free-trade agreements with each other, they trade under basic ""WTO rules"". The WTO headquarters are in Geneva Every member has a list of tariffs and quotas that they apply to other countries with which they don't have a deal. These are known as WTO schedules. Yes, examples include the United States, China and Brazil. In fact, it's any country with which the EU has not signed a free-trade deal. That's when WTO rules kick in. But, like Australia, those big economies don't just rely on basic WTO rules - they have all done other deals with the EU to help facilitate trade. The US, for example, has at least 20 agreements with the EU that help regulate specific sectors, covering everything from wine and bananas to insurance and energy-efficiency labelling. The government has said repeatedly that it wants a free-trade deal along the lines of the one the EU has with Canada. What is a 'Canada-style' trade deal? But the UK and the EU have been trying to negotiate an agreement that would have no tariffs or quotas at all. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Whereas the EU's deal with Canada does include tariffs and quotas (on some agricultural produce for example) and it had to be negotiated line by line over a long period of time. What happens if there's no trade deal? Under WTO rules, tariffs would be imposed on all imported goods, apart from in Northern Ireland, which is subject to a separate agreement with the EU. The average EU tariff is pretty low (about 2.8% for non-agricultural products) but in some sectors tariffs can be quite high. Cars coming from manufacturers in the UK would be taxed at 10%, with some agricultural tariffs even higher - rising to an average of more than 35% for dairy products. This would have a big impact on some UK businesses selling their goods to the EU. The UK would do the same, and impose its tariffs on imported EU goods which would have a big impact on some European companies. The government has alreadyreleased details,externalof the tariffs it will charge from January 2021 to countries with which there is no free trade deal. In some areas, they will be imposed to protect British producers - in the car sector, for example, and on most agricultural products, to avoid ""additional disruption for UK farmers and consumers"". That will lead to higher prices in the UK for some EU goods. But the government is also removing some of the tariffs it has been charging as part of the EU - in areas, for example, where there isn't that much domestic UK production that needs protecting. Here are some items that are having their tariffs cut to zero. It's important to remember that the WTO's ""most favoured nation"" rules limit room for manoeuvre in the event of no deal. The UK couldn't for example lower tariffs for the EU alone, in order to keep trade going. It would have to treat the rest of the world in the same way, which could lead to cheap imports flooding the UK economy, and harming domestic businesses. It's not just about tariffs - there are also what are called ""non-tariff barriers"". In many areas of the economy they are far more important. Non-tariff barriers include things like product standards, safety regulations and sanitary checks on food and animals. Many of them will apply with or without a deal, but businesses that trade with Europe fear that no deal in particular would lead to lengthy delays and extra costs. Eventually negotiations on some kind of deal would have to begin again, but that could take some time. All of this refers only to the trade in goods. The trade in services between the UK and the EU is also of critical importance. The kind of trade deal the two sides have been trying to negotiate wouldn't say very much about services anyway. But no deal would be an even greater challenge. And companies on both sides would be having to adjust to an abrupt change at the same time as trying to deal with the impact of coronavirus.

"'The vaccine's here, but I'm scared of needles'","Raelene Goody suffered from severe needle phobia as a child A mass vaccination programme against Covid-19 is set to begin in the UK on Tuesday. While the government is working to ease the fears of those who are worried about safety, some people have a more primal fear - needles. ""My heart would be racing. My mind saying, 'calm down, it's going to be fine' but also, 'it's terrifying, it's going to really hurt you'. Then 'you don't know this person, so you can't trust them'. I would be thinking of ways to get away from it."" Raelene Goody, 31, who has cystic fibrosis, an inherited condition that causes lung infections and problems digesting food, regularly requires injections, including an annual flu jab. But from the age of four to her late teens, she suffered from severe needle phobia that would leave her ""shaking"" and often meant she had to be sedated. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? How does the Pfizer vaccine work? The vaccine - your questions answered ""It's like when you are really scared of something like spiders and snakes and you want to run away. It's a similar feeling, except it is a needle,"" she says. ""Apparently I punched my dad in the face once, but I was so petrified I can't remember it."" Raelene's severe phobia of injections, known as trypanophobia, in her younger years is not uncommon. Some others have a more general fear of needles, known as belonephobia. Studies show such a fear is highest in children and decreases with age. Nevertheless, it affects up to 10% of the overall population, according to charity Anxiety UK. Despite her phobia, Raelene, from West Sussex, was still able to go through with her flu vaccination each year, although it could sometimes take hours to administer the jab.  3.5%-10%of general population have needle phobia anxiety disorder 80%(approx) of adults with needle phobia reported first-degree relative exhibits same fear ""I had to have it. If you don't have the flu jab and you get the flu it would be worse than getting a chest infection [which reduces lung function in people with cystic fibrosis],"" she says. ""You could actually die."" She has been prioritised for the Covid-19 vaccination, as a clinically extremely vulnerable person, for similar reasons. And she says there were ways she was able to get through her flu jabs at the height of her phobia. A friendly nurse would visit her at home and her parents would be present for reassurance. This video can not be played Terrified of injections Immunisations with the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, approved by the British medicines regulator, the MHRA, are due to start this week in the UK for people in somehigh-priority groups,external. People will be vaccinated via injection twice - 21 days apart - and full immunity starts seven days after the second dose. As it stands, there is no alternative to the needle. All Covid-19 vaccines have to be given via injection. Could it mean some people might choose to opt out of the vaccine because of their fear of needles? The Department of Health has not released any specific guidance around needle phobia and the coronavirus vaccine. People with concerns around vaccinations should contact their local healthcare provider, according to NHS England, which is expected to release vaccine guidance in the coming days. Prof Heidi Larson, who runs the Vaccine Confidence Project at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, says needle anxiety and phobia are an issue for some people around vaccination ""in general"", and ""may be the case for the Covid-19"" vaccine as well. But it's not expected to be ""the dominant cause of hesitancy"". Surveys and social media monitoring suggest there are a mix of reasons for people's concern, she adds, such as worries about the speed it was developed. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? So what can you do if you have a needle phobia? Methods of coping with needle phobia can vary from person to person, with treatments includingcognitive behavioural therapy,external, andclinical hypnotherapy,external. There are also self-help methods. Anxiety UK advises self-administered behavioural exposure - a technique where individuals expose themselves to the situation they are phobic about in a gradual manner. There arethree steps in the process,external: Relaxation- which could be by practising progressive muscle relaxation, breathing exercises or meditation Developing an anxiety hierarchy or ""fear ladder""- write down a list of all of the situations related to needles that you fear, arranged in order of difficulty Pairing relaxation with the situations detailed in your hierarchy- by climbing the ladder (thinking about or acting out each step) from bottom to top, exposing yourself to the fear for a tolerable amount of time before taking time to relax Guy's and St Thomas' Hospital in London also recommendstrying applied tension,external, a technique to increase blood pressure levels back to normal to avoid fainting. Raelene has overcome her needle phobia, although she still has some lingering anxiety about having IV lines after a traumatic experience having one inserted. It's problematic, she says, because people with cystic fibrosis ""deal with having needles all the time for blood tests, IVs, CT scans"". ""It's something that happens to you a lot, so people will think you just deal with it but it's not as simple as that,"" she says. ""People have had traumatic experiences, and there's trauma there that will freak them out."" Reflecting on her fears, she says there will likely be people with needle phobia who are too scared to get the coronavirus vaccine. But she says ""there will also be some that will feel the same way, but are also terrified of getting coronavirus. ""Knowing that can kill you, people will be terrified - but able to fight through it."" Information and advice:You can findmore information on how to get help for phobias here,external.

'Covid killed my wife - so I'm testing a new vaccine',"While one Covid vaccine has been approved for use in the UK and two are awaiting approval, many more are still being tested. The UK has pre-ordered 60 million doses of the Novavax vaccine, which is currently undergoing phase three trials. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary talked to one man about the personal tragedy that prompted him to volunteer for the injection. Pauline Demaline was fit and healthy and only 56 years old when she fell ill with Covid-19 in March. But within days of going into hospital she was dead. She worked as a parish administrator at the Holy Trinity parish church in Skipton and it may be here that she caught the virus, in the early days of the pandemic. She and her husband, Nigel, were very careful. They didn't go out much and Nigel would do the shopping early in the day, when the shops were quiet. But Pauline had to go into work and would sometimes meet other parishioners - couples about to get married, for example, and their parents. At a certain point, she began feeling tired. ""It seemed like she would be exhausted when she finished work,"" says Nigel. ""She came home and lay down on the settee. I don't think she had a temperature, but she felt rotten. She had a bit of trouble with breathing but thought it was her normal asthma. ""People were telling her to see a doctor but she wouldn't go. She thought she'd be all right, that it would pass."" A recent photograph of Pauline Eventually Nigel forced Pauline to get help. ""I said to her, 'You've got three choices: I can either get you to the doctor's, I can call an ambulance, which you'd hate, or I can take you down to accident and emergency.' Our neighbour across the road, Rachel, was home. So she had the dogs and I took Pauline to the hospital, not knowing that that was the last time she was going to leave the house."" At accident and emergency she was given a Covid test and put on an isolation ward. That test came back negative and doctors were preparing to move her but then an X-ray of her chest made them change their mind. ""It was about four hours later that the consultant came back to say sorry, it was a false negative,"" Nigel says. ""He said they were experiencing about 75% false negatives at that point, because the tests that they were doing were so new."" Then Pauline's condition deteriorated very fast. ""The next time the consultant saw me and my son he said it's not a matter of if she'll die, it's a matter of when she'll die. We asked about the timescale and he said two days, maybe three days at most. And that was the first time that I suddenly thought, 'This is serious. This is real.'"" Pauline went into hospital on Wednesday 25 March. The conversation with the consultant happened on the Friday. On Sunday Nigel and his son spent all day with Pauline, who was by now having great difficulty breathing, and on Monday 30 March she died. ""Just after Pauline died - and this is something I've never shown anyone else - I took a picture of her, of how unwell she was,"" Nigel says. ""And I look at it quite regularly because it reminds me of how she was, and it's so sad - that was how she was after her last breath. It's just something to hang on to, and of all the photos I have it's the one that upsets me the most, but gives me the most comfort. The memory is not out of reach. It's not out of grasp. It's there. It's really tangible. I can look at it."" The couple met when Nigel was 16 and Pauline was 15. He'd left school and joined the forces as a musician, and in July 1979 his military band was in the Isle of Man to celebrate the 1,000th anniversary of the island's parliament, while Pauline was on holiday there with a friend. They met on the sea front in Douglas, when Nigel recognised Pauline's friend from their home town. The following year he joined other members of his regiment, the 16th/5th The Queen's Royal Lancers, stationed near the East German border, and in 1982 they married. ""We were very young but it was such a natural thing to do,"" Nigel says. Nigel and Pauline always loved to travel They had seven more years of Army life before moving to Silsden in West Yorkshire. Nigel worked in the motor trade and initially Pauline went to work for North Yorkshire Police in Harrogate. When she was asked to commute further, to a different office, she got the job at the church. ""She told me later that she'd always known we'd marry, even when she was just 15 and we started our relationship. I thought we were going into our 80s together,"" Nigel says. He had always assumed that he would die first. Pauline's only health problem was asthma which had been well-managed since childhood. ""It's so overwhelming - the feeling of futility sort of sweeps across you,"" Nigel says. ""You think, 'I couldn't do anything!' I wanted to do something but I couldn't."" Nigel doesn't know if he was infected with Covid at the time of Pauline's death - he wasn't tested - but because he visited her at the Airedale General Hospital near Keighley, he had to isolate for two weeks afterwards, and now wonders whether he did then have some symptoms. ""That period is all a bit of a haze. I think I've blacked a lot of it out,"" he says. ""But I cried so much. I'd be sat there, the television would be on, and I couldn't tell you what I watched. I'd also be waking up in the early hours of the morning and my chest felt tight. Was it grief? Or was it that I had Covid, but just had very mild symptoms? I don't know."" It was Nigel's grief that spurred him on to become one of the first volunteers for a vaccine trial at Bradford Royal Infirmary, when he saw an appeal for volunteers on Facebook. ""I clicked on it without giving it a second thought. I thought, 'I need to be doing that.' I just felt the urge and the need to do it,"" he says. ""I wanted to do something to help. I really didn't want anybody else to go through what I was going through."" And this is how I came to meet Nigel at one of the hospital's Monday vaccine clinics acouple of months later. I told him he was doing a wonderful thing. ""People have been saying I'm brave - I'm not,"" he replied. ""I can't do anything else but be brave. You've got to get on with life. I want to feel like I'm doing something."" The Novavax trial that Nigel is taking part in is the first of two that we plan to run in Bradford, and will be followed in January, by a trial of the Sanofi Pasteur vaccine developed with GlaxoSmithKline. Why are we doing this when the results from the Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine trials have been so good? Well, the more options we have to vaccinate the world's seven billion inhabitants, the better. This will help ensure we have effective vaccines for different population groups, provide safe alternatives should one of the vaccines turn out to have unexpected side effects, drive down cost (which is crucial for low- and middle-income countries) and offer simpler options for manufacture and distribution. There are some 200 candidate vaccines in development and more than 40 now going through clinical trials. The goal, in all cases, is to trigger our bodies to produce antibodies that will coat the virus and stop it from having its deadly effect, but never before has such an array of new technologies been used. Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Listen to The NHS Front Lineon BBC Soundsandthe BBC World Service Or read the previous online diary entry:The Yorkshire cemetery struggling to keep up with burials Click hereto listen to Nigel Demaline's story on Radio 4's The Untold Check out all the diary entries on the BBC Radio 4 website The traditional approach pursued by the Oxford/AZ team is to develop a weakened virus to trigger this response in the same way as a natural infection would. The novel Pfizer and Moderna vaccines stimulate antibodies by using Covid-19 messenger RNA (a single-stranded molecule of RNA) to prompt our own cells to produce a harmless piece of the spike protein found on the surface of the coronavirus, which also leads to the production of antibodies. The Novavax vaccine has been developed in the US and is being trialled in the UK on 10,000 volunteers. It uses proteins extracted from the coronavirus spike to trigger the body's immune response, and like the Oxford vaccine it has the important advantage of being stable at normal fridge temperatures, so does not require expensive transport or storage solutions. This will be vital in less developed countries. The real heroes of this remarkable triumph of science, though, are not the scientists or the clinical researchers, but the thousands of trial volunteers who have stepped forward, like Nigel, to be human guinea pigs. Every Monday I have the privilege of seeing their courage and altruism. My colleague Dinesh Saralaya taking a blood sample from a Novavax volunteer I take consent from each participant, conduct a physical examination and take blood tests for antibodies. The volunteer then gets randomised to either the active vaccine or a placebo of saline solution. It is a double-blind trial, so I don't know what they get and the participant doesn't know. After three weeks they return for a booster and then get followed up after three, six and 12 months. The vaccine is successful if it causes no serious side effects and if only a small proportion of those who receive it later come down with Covid-19. But whenever the participants return to the clinic their blood is also tested for antibodies. If they have high levels of antibodies for a long period, that is a good sign. When Nigel came back for his booster injection, he was keen to know whether the blood taken on his first visit showed signs of antibodies, which would have revealed whether he had been infected with the virus around the same time as Pauline. I explained that I couldn't tell him, because I didn't know - this being a double-blind trial - and also because if he were to learn whether he had antibodies, this could affect his behaviour and therefore influence the outcome of the trial. Pauline's funeral had to be delayed for two weeks, while Nigel was isolating. There was then a very small service for just her five closest family members, though it was all videoed and there was a live link so that other friends and relatives could watch online. In his eulogy, Nigel began by explaining why the service had begun with Every Day Hurts by Sad CafÃ©, a memory of the time when he was living in Germany and she was in the UK. ""This was the first single I bought for Pauline and represented the fact that we were 300 miles apart and I missed her profoundly,"" he said. He ended by noting that many people would miss her now, and that he would most of all. ""Forty years together has had a profound effect on my life, and I will be very sad for many years to come,"" he said. ""Pauline, I always have and will always love you dearly. Rest in Peace and sleep soundly my love."" Pauline and Yorkshire terrier Harry, in 2006 By a tragic coincidence, Nigel had suffered another loss almost simultaneously, when one of the family's two dogs, Harry, a Yorkshire terrier, died in his sleep. ""They were both cremated on the same day, 15 April, and I got calls from the funeral director and the vet's on the same day to pick up the ashes,"" Nigel says. ""I came home with my wife in one carrier bag and our dog in the other."" At the back of the church there's a headstone marking where Pauline's ashes are laid, with the inscription: ""Pauline Demaline, 1964 to 2020. Dear wife, mother and nanna, beloved by family, cherished by friends."" ""And she was cherished,"" says Nigel. ""I'd like to think she's there. I like to think of spirits there. And I just try to talk to her - to tell her the news, what's been happening, how people are, and thinking that she's listening."" He thinks Pauline would approve of the vaccine trial. ""I think she would be proud of what we're doing, and although it's too late for her she would be hoping it works for everybody.""

Japan to fund AI matchmaking to boost birth rateAuthorities hope artificial intelligence may be better at spotting successful potential couples.Asia,"Japan has one of the world's lowest fertility rates Japan plans to boost its tumbling birth rate by funding artificial intelligence matchmaking schemes to help residents find love. From next year it will subsidise local governments already running or starting projects that use AI to pair people up. Last year the number of babies born in Japan fell below 865,000 - a record low. The fast-greying nation has long been searching for ways to reverse one of the world's lowest fertility rates. Boosting the use of AI tech is one of its latest efforts. 'Jaw-dropping' world fertility rate crash expected Japanese women at a crossroads Next year the government plans to allocate local authorities 2bn yen ($19m, Â£14m) to boost the birth rate, reported AFP news agency. Many already offer human-run matchmaking services and some have introduced AI systems in the hope they will perform a more sophisticated analysis of the standardised forms where people submit their details. A few of the existing systems are limited to considering criteria such as income and age, only producing a result if there is an exact match. Local media say that the funding aims to allow authorities to harness more costly advanced systems that take into account factors like hobbies and values. ""We are especially planning to offer subsidies to local governments operating or starting up matchmaking projects that use AI,"" a cabinet official told AFP. ""We hope this support will help reverse the decline in the nation's birthrate."" Japan's population is projected to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Policymakers are racing to ensure the country's contracting workforce can meet the expanding costs of welfare. Sachiko Horiguchi, a socio-cultural and medical anthropologist at Japan's Temple University, thinks there are better ways for the government to bump up the birth rate than subsidising AI matchmaking - such as helping young people earning low wages. Shepointed to a recent report which suggests a link,externalbetween lower income levels and the loss of interest in romantic relationships among young Japanese adults. ""If they're not interested in dating, the matchmaking would likely be ineffective,"" Dr Horiguchi told the BBC. ""If we are to rely on technologies, affordable AI robots taking over household or childcare tasks may be more effective."" Analysts have long pointed towards the lack of support for working mothers in Japan, where there are strong expectations women will do all the housework and raise children alongside doing their jobs. The government has said it wants to encourage more women into full-time employment in recent years but the gender gap has grown.

"Millwall won't take knee before QPR matchPlayers will stand arm-in-arm on Tuesday in a ""show of solidarity for football's fight against discrimination"".","Millwall players were booed when they took a knee before Saturday's match against Derby Millwall players will not take a knee before Tuesday's Championship fixture against QPR but will stand arm-in-arm in a ""show of solidarity for football's fight against discrimination"". It comes after some Millwall fans booed the players taking a knee before Saturday's defeat by Derby at The Den. Players of both teams will collectively hold up an anti-racism banner. Millwall's regular shirt sponsor will be replaced with the logo of anti-discrimination body Kick It Out. In a statement, Millwall said: ""Millwall believe that this gesture, which the club hopes to repeat with other visiting teams in the coming weeks and months, will help to unify people throughout society in the battle to root out all forms of discrimination. ""Millwall have a zero-tolerance policy against racial and all other forms of discrimination and want to again make clear to anybody who holds such views that you are not welcome at this football club. Millwall's stance, as always, is that anybody found guilty of racial abuse is banned for life."" The decision came after a meeting on Monday between both clubs, Kick It Out, Show Racism The Red Card, the Professional Footballers' Association (PFA), the Football Association (FA) and the English Football League (EFL). In a statement, the EFL welcomed the decision of both clubs to ""continue to raise awareness of inequality and discrimination facing society"". ""Discrimination in any form is unacceptable and not welcome within our game or our communities - not today or any day,"" the statement said. ""Players often receive widespread criticism and negativity for merely doing their jobs but here they are leading the way, trying to effect positive change and they should be applauded for taking a stand, showing solidarity and setting an example for others to follow."" This video can not be played Taking the knee is showing solidarity, not a political statement - Southgate Some QPR players will take the kneebefore Tuesday's game at The Den, despite having stopped the gesture earlier this season after director of football Les Ferdinand said its impact had ""been diluted"". Players, officials and staff at Premier League and EFL games have been taking a knee pre-match since football restarted in June in order to show their support for the Black Lives Matter movement for racial equality. The Den was able to host 2,000 home fans for the first time this season after the second national lockdown was lifted but the return of spectators was overshadowed by the booing, with which Millwall said they were""dismayed and saddened"". The Millwall Supporters' Club said the booing was not motivated by racism, but instead in opposition to the political views held by the Black Lives Matter organisation. The FA has confirmed it is investigating the incident at Millwall, and a similar one atColchester United's League Two game against Grimsby Town. If it finds that the actions were discriminatory, the clubs could face fines. Speaking on BBC Radio 5 Live's Monday Night Club, former England defender Micah Richards said booing is ""not acceptable"". ""Millwall fans, from their point of view, this whole movement is becoming political. They're saying they don't think the players at their club should want to kneel because of what Black Lives Matter represents in their mind,"" he said. ""If they're booing that, it's not acceptable, but it's free speech and that is their opinion, but I think people are taking Black Lives Matter in a different context and changing the actual narrative of what it's all about. ""When the players are taking the knee they are not saying black lives matter and they are any better than white lives, they are trying to say it's a stand for equality and unity and that is why they are taking the knee."" BBC Sport football reporter Simon Stone Sources described this evening's meeting as ""difficult but productive"". It is understood the PFA was critical of the EFL's perceived lack of involvement, a feeling many at the club share, having told it beforehand of what they feared was likely to happen at The Den on Saturday. There are many unanswered questions for football and Millwall in particular and evidently solutions will not be easy. However, the sense of desperation hanging round the club on Monday has now been replaced by a mixture of trepidation and optimism. No-one at the club can be entirely sure of what will happen when the QPR players take a knee as planned before kick-off but the noises among fans on social media who backed the booing on Saturday is that these measures should be supported. Millwall can only hope this is what happens. Because if what happened on Saturday is repeated, even insiders know the damage to the club will be catastrophic.

Lottery player age to rise amid gambling crackdown,"The age limit for playing the National Lottery is set to be raised from 16 to 18 from next October as the government moves to crackdown on gambling. The government has pledged a ""major and wide-ranging review"" of the sector, which may include limits on online stakes and restrictions on advertising. Betting firms could also be banned from sponsoring football shirts. The current legislation, established in 2005, was ""an analogue law in a digital age"", the government said. Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the industry had ""evolved at breakneck speed"" and the aim of the review was to tackle ""problem gambling in all its forms to protect children and vulnerable people"". The age threshold for playing the National Lottery - including scratchcards -  will rise from October 2021. Before that, online sales to 16 and 17-year-olds will stop in April 2021. ""We're committed to protecting young people from gambling-related harm, which is why we are raising the minimum age for the National Lottery,"" said sport minister Nigel Huddleston. ""Patterns of play have changed since its inception, with a shift towards online games, and this change will help make sure the National Lottery, although already low-risk, is not a gateway to problem gambling."" Lockdown 'a disaster' for problem gamblers Gambling on credit cards banned The government is canvassing views on the legislation in the form of a call for evidence, which will run for 16 weeks until the end of March 2021. The Gambling Commission's role and powers will also be looked at, as will promotional offers and whether extra protections for children and young adults are needed. Mr Huddleston told the Commons the review would seek to ""strike a careful balance"" between individual freedom and protecting the vulnerable. Shadow sports minister Alison McGovern welcomed the announcement, but said it was ""disappointing"" that the government had taken so long. In 2018, Paddy Power Betfair was fined Â£2.2m for failing to stop stolen money being gambled on its website and not protecting customers showing signs of problem gambling. Ian Proctor, UK chairman of its parent company Flutter, told the BBC that gambling rules did need to be updated for the digital age. But he warned of ""unintended consequences"" if regulations were not thought through and said that grassroots sports could suffer if sponsorship was restricted. ""We take [problem gambling] incredibly seriously... but let's also get this in a little bit of context,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""For millions of people every week, they enjoy a bet, it's a leisure activity, it gives people a lot of pleasure. For some people it's not, for a small minority. And we need to make gambling safer for those people."" The review of all the apparatus gambling companies use to attract customers - sponsorship, marketing, online promotion and stakes - should be extremely bad news for those companies. This morning, however, the share prices of William Hill and Flutter, the two largest gambling outfits listed on the London market, have scarcely budged. The review was, up to a point, priced in - investors knew it was coming, and its likely scope had been well telegraphed in advance. Shareholders may also reflect that while the government has talked tough on gambling restrictions in the past, reforms have often been watered down, and the companies themselves have been able to develop their businesses in ways not anticipated by regulators. These companies are also less affected by British regulatory developments than in the past. Flutter, the home of SkyBet, Betfair and Paddy Power, is now a FTSE 100 multinational, with operations across the world and the ability to switch investment where it sees fit. William Hill, founded in London between the world wars when gambling was illegal, is being bought by an American company, Caesars Entertainment. The Gambling Commission has imposed big fines on other gambling operators in recent years. In March,online betting firm Betway paid a penalty of Â£11.6mfor failings over customer protection and money-laundering checks, while in Aprilcasino operator Caesars Entertainment UK was hit with a Â£13m penaltyfollowing a ""catalogue"" of social responsibility and money laundering failures. But in June, Parliament'sPublic Accounts Committee described the Gambling Commission as ""toothless""and said it had an ""unacceptably weak understanding"" of the harms of gambling. The review will also examine the actions that customers can take where they feel operators have breached social responsibility requirements. The aim is to ensure customer protection is at the heart of the regulations, while giving those that gamble safely the freedom to do so, according to the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). ""Whilst millions gamble responsibly, the Gambling Act is an analogue law in a digital age... the industry has evolved at breakneck speed,"" said Mr Dowden. Jo Stevens, Labour's shadow culture secretary, said it was ""disappointing that the government has taken more than a year to launch this review, during which time more people have suffered with gambling addiction and without getting vital support"". The Gambling Health Alliance (GHA), an umbrella group for 50 charities and academics, has called for the review to focus on the damage gambling can do to public health. The group's chair, Duncan Stephenson, said for the past 15 years, the public had been at the mercy of a gambling industry which has taken advantage of ""sluggish and inadequate"" regulation. ""We have seen the devastating effects of this on lives lost and ruined, with gambling companies shamelessly exploiting the young and vulnerable, making obscene amounts of money at the expense of some of our most deprived communities,"" he said. The GHA is calling for gambling to be ""de-normalised"", and for a ban on gambling advertising and sponsorship in sports. ""Just as we have rightly taken steps to ramp up the regulation of other harmful products such as tobacco and junk food, we now need to do the same with gambling,"" Mr Stephenson said. Former gambling addict Matt Zarb-Cousin, who runs the Clean Up Gambling campaign group, said: ""This wide-ranging review is a long overdue opportunity to clean up our outdated gambling laws, which are incompatible with the smartphone era."" The gambling review follows a range of measures introduced by the government to protect consumers from the risk of gambling-related harm. Last year, the maximum stake that can be played onfixed-odds betting terminals (FOBT)was cut from Â£100 to Â£2. And in September, the government launched a consultation to explore young people's experiences ofloot boxes in video games.

Japan to fund AI matchmaking to boost birth rate,"Japan has one of the world's lowest fertility rates Japan plans to boost its tumbling birth rate by funding artificial intelligence matchmaking schemes to help residents find love. From next year it will subsidise local governments already running or starting projects that use AI to pair people up. Last year the number of babies born in Japan fell below 865,000 - a record low. The fast-greying nation has long been searching for ways to reverse one of the world's lowest fertility rates. Boosting the use of AI tech is one of its latest efforts. 'Jaw-dropping' world fertility rate crash expected Japanese women at a crossroads Next year the government plans to allocate local authorities 2bn yen ($19m, Â£14m) to boost the birth rate, reported AFP news agency. Many already offer human-run matchmaking services and some have introduced AI systems in the hope they will perform a more sophisticated analysis of the standardised forms where people submit their details. A few of the existing systems are limited to considering criteria such as income and age, only producing a result if there is an exact match. Local media say that the funding aims to allow authorities to harness more costly advanced systems that take into account factors like hobbies and values. ""We are especially planning to offer subsidies to local governments operating or starting up matchmaking projects that use AI,"" a cabinet official told AFP. ""We hope this support will help reverse the decline in the nation's birthrate."" Japan's population is projected to fall from a peak of 128 million in 2017 to less than 53 million by the end of the century. Policymakers are racing to ensure the country's contracting workforce can meet the expanding costs of welfare. Sachiko Horiguchi, a socio-cultural and medical anthropologist at Japan's Temple University, thinks there are better ways for the government to bump up the birth rate than subsidising AI matchmaking - such as helping young people earning low wages. Shepointed to a recent report which suggests a link,externalbetween lower income levels and the loss of interest in romantic relationships among young Japanese adults. ""If they're not interested in dating, the matchmaking would likely be ineffective,"" Dr Horiguchi told the BBC. ""If we are to rely on technologies, affordable AI robots taking over household or childcare tasks may be more effective."" Analysts have long pointed towards the lack of support for working mothers in Japan, where there are strong expectations women will do all the housework and raise children alongside doing their jobs. The government has said it wants to encourage more women into full-time employment in recent years but the gender gap has grown. Japan ranked 121st out of 153 countries in a 2019 report on gender equality by the World Economic Forum, slipping down 11 places from the year before. This video can not be played In Japan, many men still want their wives to stay at home rather than have their own careers as well, says the BBC's Mariko Oi 'Jaw-dropping' world fertility rate crash expected Japan minister U-turns on birth-rate gaffe Japanese women at a crossroads At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Vaccine rumours debunked,"We've looked into some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims - everything from alleged plots to put microchips into people to the supposed re-engineering of our genetic code. The fear that a vaccine will somehow change your DNA is one we've seen aired regularly on social media. The BBC asked three independent scientists about this. They said that the coronavirus vaccine would not alter human DNA. Some of the newly created vaccines, includingthe one now approved in the UK developed by Pfizer/BioNTech,use a fragment of the virus's genetic material - or messenger RNA. ""Injecting RNA into a person doesn't do anything to the DNA of a human cell,"" says Prof Jeffrey Almond of Oxford University. It works by giving the body instructions to produce a protein which is present on the surface of the coronavirus. The immune system then learns to recognise and produce antibodies against the protein. Claims that Bill Gates plans to use a vaccine to ""manipulate"" or ""alter"" human DNA have been widely shared This isn't the first time we've looked into claims that a coronavirus vaccine will supposedly alter DNA.We investigated a popular video spreading the theoryback in May. Posts have noted that messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccine technology ""has never been tested or approved before"". It is true that no mRNA vaccine has been approved before now, but multiple studies of mRNA vaccines in humans have taken place over the last few years. And, since the pandemic started, the vaccine has been tested on tens of thousands of people around the world and has gone through a rigorous safety approval process. Like all new vaccines, it has to undergo rigorous safety checks before it can be recommended for widespread use. What are the safety checks for vaccines? In Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical trials, vaccines are tested in small numbers of volunteers to check they are safe and to determine the right dose. In Phase 3 trials they are tested in thousands of people to see how effective they are. The group who received the vaccine and a control group who have received a placebo are closely monitored for any adverse reactions - side-effects. Safety monitoring continues after a vaccine has been approved for use. Next, a conspiracy theory that has spanned the globe. It claims that the coronavirus pandemic is a cover for a plan to implant trackable microchips and that the Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates is behind it. There is no vaccine ""microchip"" and there is no evidence to support claims that Bill Gates is planning for this in the future. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation told the BBC the claim was ""false"". One TikTok user created a video about being ""microchipped"" and called a vaccine the ""mark of the beast"" Rumours took hold in March when Mr Gates said in an interview that eventually ""we will have some digital certificates"" which would be used to show who'd recovered, been tested and ultimately who received a vaccine. He made no mention of microchips. This led to one widely shared article headlined: ""Bill Gates will use microchip implants to fight coronavirus."" The article makes reference to a study, funded by The Gates Foundation, into a technology that could store someone's vaccine records in a special ink administered at the same time as an injection. However, the technology is not a microchip and is more like an invisible tattoo. It has not been rolled out yet, would not allow people to be tracked and personal information would not be entered into a database, says Ana Jaklenec, a scientist involved in the study. The billionaire founder of Microsoft has been the subject of many false rumours during the pandemic. He's been targeted because of his philanthropic work in public health and vaccine development. Despite the lack of evidence, in May aYouGov poll of 1,640 people,externalsuggested 28% of Americans believed Mr Gates wanted to use vaccines to implant microchips in people - with the figure rising to 44% among Republicans. Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? How will I get the coronavirus vaccine? Covid vaccine update: When will one be ready? We've seen claims that vaccines contain the lung tissue of an aborted fetus. This is false. ""There are no fetal cells used in any vaccine production process,"" says Dr Michael Head, of the University of Southampton. One particular video that was posted on one of the biggest anti-vaccine Facebook pages refers to a study which the narrator claims is evidence of what goes into the vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University. But the narrator's interpretation is wrong - the study in question explored how the vaccine reacted when introduced to human cells in a lab. Confusion may have arisen because there is a step in the process of developing a vaccine that uses cells grown in a lab, which are the descendants of embryonic cells that would otherwise have been destroyed. Thetechnique was developed in the 1960s, and no fetuses were aborted for the purposes of this research. Many vaccines are made in this way, explains Dr David Matthews, from Bristol University, adding that any traces of the cells are comprehensively removed from the vaccine ""to exceptionally high standards"". The developers of the vaccine at Oxford University say they worked with cloned cells, but these cells ""are not themselves the cells of aborted babies"". The cells work like a factory to manufacture a greatly weakened form of the virus that has been adapted to function as a vaccine. But even though the weakened virus is created using these cloned cells, this cellular material is removed when the virus is purified and not used in the vaccine. We've seen arguments against a Covid-19 vaccine shared across social media asking why we need one at all if the chances of dying from the virus are so slim. A meme shared by people who oppose vaccination put the recovery rate from the disease at 99.97% and suggested getting Covid-19 is a safer option than taking a vaccine. BBC Bitesize: Finding the facts in a pandemic A meme using images of rapper Drake has been used to promote false vaccine claims To begin with, the figure referred to in the meme as the ""recovery rate"" - implying these are people who caught the virus and survived - is not correct. About 99.0% of people who catch Covid survive it, says Jason Oke, senior statistician at the University of Oxford. So around 100 in 10,000 will die - far higher than three in 10,000, as suggested in the meme. However, Mr Oke adds that ""in all cases the risks very much depend on age and do not take into account short and long-term morbidity from Covid-19"". It's not just about survival. For every person who dies, there are others who live through it but undergo intensive medical care, and those who sufferlong-lasting health effects. This can contribute to a health service overburdened with Covid patients, competing with a hospital's limited resources to treat patients with other illnesses and injuries. Concentrating on the overall death rate, or breaking down the taking of a vaccine to an individual act, misses the point of vaccinations, says Prof Liam Smeeth of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. It should be seen as an effort by society to protect others, he says. ""In the UK, the worst part of the pandemic, the reason for lockdown, is because the health service would be overwhelmed. Vulnerable groups like the old and sick in care homes have a much higher chance of getting severely ill if they catch the virus"".

'V-day' as first people due to get Covid jab,"The first people in the UK are set to receive a coronavirus jab on what has been dubbed ""V-Day"", as a mass vaccination programme begins. About 70 hospital hubs across the UK are gearing up to give the Pfizer/BioNTech jab to the over-80s and some health and care staff. The programme aims to protect the most vulnerable and return life to normal. Grandfather-of-nine Dr Hari Shukla, 87, said he was ""delighted to be doing my bit"" by getting the jab on Tuesday. ""I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help,"" said Dr Shukla, who will receive his jab at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle with his wife, Ranjan. The UK will be the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine afterregulators approved its use last week. Vaccination will not be compulsory. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was now ""light at the end of the tunnel"". ""We will look back on today, V-day, as a key moment in our fightback against this terrible disease,"" he added. Those administering the vaccine will be the first to receive jabs inScotland, while health workers will be first in line inWalesandNorthern Ireland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Today marks a huge step forward in the UK's fight against coronavirus."" But he added: ""As the programme ramps up in the weeks and months ahead, it is as important as ever to keep to theCovid Winter Plan,external- following the rules in your area and remember the basics of hands, face and space."" Ministers have warned it could be Easter by the time restrictions are lifted in a significant way. Race relations campaigner Dr Hari Shukla, who was made a CBE in 2016, will be among the first to receive the Covid vaccine NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccinations were a""decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus""and will continue ""at least until spring"", urging people to be ""very careful"" before then. More than 60,000 people in the UK have died after being infected with Covid-19,according to government figures,external. The government has secured800,000 doses of this vaccineto start with, but orders have been placed for 40 million in total, enough for 20 million people as two courses are needed. The majority of that is not expected to become available until next year, although government sources said another four million doses should arrive in the country by the end of the year. These freezers, at a secure location in the UK, can each hold more than more than 80,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine The government had initially been promised 10 million doses by the end of December, but problems with manufacturing mean the supply is going to be slower than originally hoped for. Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doses have been arriving in the UKover the past few days from Belgium, where it is made, and sent to the network of hospitals that will carry out the vaccinations. Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said there had been an ""incredible effort"" to start the vaccination programme so quickly given that the vaccine was only approved for use in the UK last week. ""This is our wonderful NHS in action,"" he added. Hospital patients over the age of 80 are among the first people who will get the jab on Tuesday, along with the NHS staff who are carrying out the vaccinations. Some of the most at-risk NHS staff will also be offered the vaccine and, in the coming days, care homes will be able to book their staff in for vaccination. But rollout of the jab has been complicated by the need to store it at -70C and that it comes in packs of 975 doses, which cannot yet be split into smaller batches. That has meantit has not been possible to offer it to care home residents in the first phase of rollout, despite the government's vaccine advisers designating them the highest priority. Care home vaccinations to start 'within two weeks' 'The vaccine is here. But I'm scared of needles' 'Others deserve Covid vaccine before me' The NHS is awaiting guidance from the drugs regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, to see what steps are needed to allow these batches to be split and sent to individual care homes. That is expected to come in mid-December, which will pave the way for the vaccine to be offered to care homes and distributed to more than 1,000 designated GP centres. Mass vaccination centres at conference centres, sports stadiums and leisure centres are also expected to be established next year. The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Most of the side-effects are very mild, similar to the side-effects after any other vaccine, and usually last for a day or so. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people. But it is not yet known how long the immunity it provides lasts, or whether it stops people from passing the virus on to others. Clive Dix, deputy chair of the government's vaccine taskforce, said: ""We may have to vaccinate every year like we do for the flu."" But he said getting to this point was a ""great achievement"" as vaccine development could take 10 years, but had been achieved in 10 months. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area The hope is that the bulk of the most vulnerable groups will be offered a coronavirus jab in the first few months of 2021. But achieving that is likely to require approval of a second vaccine made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The government has pre-ordered 100 million doses of that jab, which is easier to distribute because is does not need to be kept in ultra-cold storage and is made in the UK.The MHRA is currently assessing the data from trials on that vaccine. Vaccination to protect people from coronavirus in the UK has been promised to all over-50s, as well as younger adults with underlying health conditions - about 25 million people in total.

"PM to meet EU chief in bid to save Brexit dealThe UK and EU say ""significant differences"" still remain as the leaders prepare to talk face-to-face.UK PoliticsComments","UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson will travel to Brussels later this week to meet European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen in a last-ditch bid to reach a post-Brexit trade deal. It comes after a 90-minute phone call between the two leaders on Monday failed to produce a breakthrough. In a joint statement, they said the conditions for a deal were ""not there"". ""Significant differences"" remained on fishing, business competition rules and governance of any deal, they added. ""We asked our chief negotiators and their teams to prepare an overview of the remaining differences to be discussed in a physical meeting in Brussels in the coming days,"" the leaders said. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Wednesday or Friday appeared the ""most likely"" dates. Labour welcomed the decision to keep talking, but shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said the prime minister should have been ""more engaged in these negotiations months ago rather than leaving it to the 11th hour"". What happens if there's a no-deal Brexit? Why is fishing important in Brexit trade talks? Brexit: What is a level playing field? EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier and his UK counterpart Lord Frost have been locked in intensive talks for the past week. They will meet again on Tuesday to draw up a list of outstanding differences. And on Thursday, EU leaders will meet at a summit in Brussels. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? A senior UK government source said: ""Talks are in the same position now as they were on Friday. We have made no tangible progress. It's clear this must now continue politically."" They added that the government did not ""consider this process to be closed"" but ""things are looking very tricky and there's every chance we are not going to get there"". The UK and EU have been trading for years without paying tariffs or doing customs or border checks. Rules have stayed the same despite the UK leaving the EU on 31 January, but that is all set to change at the start of next year. If an agreement is not reached and ratified by 31 December, the UK and EU could introduce import charges on each other's goods. The UK's Office for Budget Responsibility has said leaving the EU customs union and single market without a trade deal could lead to a 2% reduction in national income next year. True, there is only a tiny circle of people who know exactly what is going on. But the messages coming out from the centre are that much more than a nip and tuck is required to get this done. The leaders haven't asked their negotiators to have another go. They've asked them to sit down and make a list of all the things that are wrong. In tone, it's very different to previous such moments, when they were required to put the icing on a cake that was very nearly baked. Read more from Laura here. News of the upcoming meeting between Boris Johnson and Ursula von der Leyen came as a bit of a relief to those close to the EU negotiating team. There's been a sense of frustration building for months now at the circular nature of talks. EU and UK negotiators say they've gone over and over the three main sticking points: fish, competition regulations and how to police a deal, if one is ever reached. There's been mutual, mounting frustration at the perceived intransigence of the other side and a questioning of whether sitting down together one more time to repeat the same arguments - again - could ever be the solution. Political intervention at the highest level has long been needed, to give a nod and a wink to negotiators to agree the difficult compromises, or to get involved in person. Phone calls between the prime minister and the European Commission president (who represents all 27 EU countries in this case) have seemed inconclusive so far. Face-to-face, this could be different. The two leaders might finally find agreement, give the decisive push to get there, or maybe jointly admit that this deal can't be done now. The UK and EU are at loggerheads over the so-called""level playing field""- a set of shared rules and standards to ensure businesses in one country do not have an unfair advantage over their competitors in others. Brussels wants the UK to follow EU rules closely in areas such as workers' rights and environmental regulations, but the UK says the goal of Brexit is to break free from following common rules and reassert national sovereignty. And the two sides disagree on how any future trading disputes should be resolved. On fishing, the EU is warning that, without ongoing access to UK waters for its fleets, UK fishermen will no longer have special access to EU markets to sell their goods. But the UK argues that what goes on in its own waters should be under its control as a sovereign country. The UK and EU, however, appear to be moving closer tosettling a dispute over last year's Withdrawal Agreementwhich, if resolved, would clear one potential obstacle to a trade deal. Shortly before the two leaders spoke on the phone, the UK said it was willing to remove parts of the Internal Market Bill, legislation would give it the power to override the Brexit deal in defiance of international law. The UK said a solution which would render the measures unnecessary could be found within days following separate discussions in Brussels involving Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. But later on Monday, MPs voted toreinstate the measures, which were taken out by the House of Lords last month, as a ""fall back"" option in case there is no agreement.

"MPs reinsert controversial powers to Brexit billBut in a possible compromise, ministers said they could remove the measures if trade talks succeed.UK PoliticsComments","MPs have voted to reinstate controversial sections of a new law to allow ministers to override sections of the UK's Brexit divorce deal. The House of Lords previously voted to take them out - but MPs backed government plans to put them back in during a vote on Monday. The EU has warned the issue could jeopardise the ongoing talks on a post-Brexit trade deal. But earlier, the UK signalled a possible compromise over the measures. Ministers said they would be prepared to remove clauses which, if they became law, would supplant agreements with the EU relating to goods moving between Britain and Northern Ireland and subsidies for Northern Irish firms. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said the timing of the move, which came just before Boris Johnson spoke to European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen, seemed to be ""a rather public olive branch"". It has since been confirmed that the prime minister will travel to Brusselslater this week in a last-ditch effort to break the deadlock in talks over a trade deal. UK and EU negotiators are currently trying to reach an agreement before the UK stops following EU trading rules on 31 December. Brexit happened but rules didn't change at once:The UK left the European Union on 31 January but leaders needed time to negotiate a deal for life afterwards - they got 11 months Talks are on again:The UK and the EU have until 31 December to agree a trade deal as well as other things, such as fishing rights If there is no deal:Border checks and taxes will be introduced for goods travelling between the UK and the EU. But deal or no deal, we will still see changes What happens next with Brexit? Prior to the debate, the UK government said it would be willing to take the clauses out of the bill - or nullify their effect - if they could reach a solution with the EU in the coming days. In a statement, No 10 said it was committed to the full implementation of the Northern Ireland Protocol in a ""pragmatic, proportionate way which recognises Northern Ireland's place in the UK's customs territory, and upholds the Good Friday Agreement in all its dimensions"". ""If the solutions being considered in those discussions are agreed, the UK government would be prepared to remove clause 44 of the UK Internal Market Bill, concerning export declarations,"" it added. ""The UK government would also be prepared to deactivate clauses 45 and 47, concerning state aid, such that they could be used only when consistent with the UK's rights and obligations under international law."" The bill would enable ministers to ignore certain requirements concerning Northern Ireland as set out in the Brexit deal (or withdrawal agreement)reached by leaders in 2019. For example, under the Brexit deal, companies moving goods from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would have to fill out export declaration forms, but ministers would be able to overrule this. The bill also allows ministers to reinterpret rules on the financial support government gives to businesses in Northern Ireland. UK-EU talks resume in final push for trade deal Brexit: What is the Internal Market Bill? The week ahead in Parliament Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has acknowledged the bill breaks international law ""in a specific and limited way"". The EU has previously said the introduction of the bill had ""seriously damaged trust"" andbegan legal proceedings against the UK. However, Downing Street says the law provides a ""safety net"" in the event the two sides fail to reach a trade deal. The bill has to be approved by both houses in Parliament. Now that MPs have rejected the Lords' changes, the bill will return to the House of Lords on Wednesday. Peers will decide whether or not to reinsert their amendments, in a process known as ""ping pong"". Earlier, Business Minister Paul Scully said it was critical for the measures in question to be kept in the bill as a ""fall back option"" to protect the UK's territorial integrity. Belfast harbour in Northern Ireland For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband said the legislation had been ""absolutely savaged"" in the Lords and it was no surprise the ""beginnings of the climbdown"" were now happening. ""Three months of posturing and undermining our reputation and three hours before the debate begins, we see the preparation being made for the brakes being applied before we go over the cliff,"" he said. ""I am not going to give the government any credit for it and I don't take their word for it either."" He also warned the bill would lead to a ""constitutional punch-up"" amid concerns of a power grab by Westminster from Scotland and Wales. The bill could also affect talks for a trade deal between the US and UK with US President-Elect Joe Biden appearing to express concern. On Wednesday, MPs will also get the chance to debate and vote on the Taxation Bill,which contains more powers for the UK to break legal requirementsin the withdrawal agreement around the customs border with the Irish Republic. No 10 said the contents of the bill, which unlike the Internal Market Bill will not need the consent of the House of Lords, would be ""kept under review"" in light of the discussions with the EU.

"'V-day' as first people due to get Covid jabAbout 70 hospital hubs in the UK are gearing up to give the Pfizer/BioNTech jab to over-80s and some health and care staff, after regulators approved the vaccine's use last week.UK","The first people in the UK are set to receive a coronavirus jab on what has been dubbed ""V-Day"", as a mass vaccination programme begins. About 70 hospital hubs across the UK are gearing up to give the Pfizer/BioNTech jab to the over-80s and some health and care staff. The programme aims to protect the most vulnerable and return life to normal. Grandfather-of-nine Dr Hari Shukla, 87, said he was ""delighted to be doing my bit"" by getting the jab on Tuesday. ""I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help,"" said Dr Shukla, who will receive his jab at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle with his wife, Ranjan. The UK will be the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine afterregulators approved its use last week. Vaccination will not be compulsory. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was now ""light at the end of the tunnel"". ""We will look back on today, V-day, as a key moment in our fightback against this terrible disease,"" he added. Those administering the vaccine will be the first to receive jabs inScotland, while health workers will be first in line inWalesandNorthern Ireland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Today marks a huge step forward in the UK's fight against coronavirus."" But he added: ""As the programme ramps up in the weeks and months ahead, it is as important as ever to keep to theCovid Winter Plan,external- following the rules in your area and remember the basics of hands, face and space."" Ministers have warned it could be Easter by the time restrictions are lifted in a significant way. Race relations campaigner Dr Hari Shukla, who was made a CBE in 2016, will be among the first to receive the Covid vaccine NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccinations were a""decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus""and will continue ""at least until spring"", urging people to be ""very careful"" before then. More than 60,000 people in the UK have died after being infected with Covid-19,according to government figures,external. The government has secured800,000 doses of this vaccineto start with, but orders have been placed for 40 million in total, enough for 20 million people as two courses are needed. The majority of that is not expected to become available until next year, although government sources said another four million doses should arrive in the country by the end of the year. These freezers, at a secure location in the UK, can each hold more than more than 80,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine The government had initially been promised 10 million doses by the end of December, but problems with manufacturing mean the supply is going to be slower than originally hoped for. Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doses have been arriving in the UKover the past few days from Belgium, where it is made, and sent to the network of hospitals that will carry out the vaccinations. Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said there had been an ""incredible effort"" to start the vaccination programme so quickly given that the vaccine was only approved for use in the UK last week. ""This is our wonderful NHS in action,"" he added. Hospital patients over the age of 80 are among the first people who will get the jab on Tuesday, along with the NHS staff who are carrying out the vaccinations. Some of the most at-risk NHS staff will also be offered the vaccine and, in the coming days, care homes will be able to book their staff in for vaccination. But rollout of the jab has been complicated by the need to store it at -70C and that it comes in packs of 975 doses, which cannot yet be split into smaller batches. That has meantit has not been possible to offer it to care home residents in the first phase of rollout, despite the government's vaccine advisers designating them the highest priority. Care home vaccinations to start 'within two weeks' 'The vaccine is here. But I'm scared of needles' 'Others deserve Covid vaccine before me' The NHS is awaiting guidance from the drugs regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, to see what steps are needed to allow these batches to be split and sent to individual care homes. That is expected to come in mid-December, which will pave the way for the vaccine to be offered to care homes and distributed to more than 1,000 designated GP centres. Mass vaccination centres at conference centres, sports stadiums and leisure centres are also expected to be established next year. The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Most of the side-effects are very mild, similar to the side-effects after any other vaccine, and usually last for a day or so. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people. But it is not yet known how long the immunity it provides lasts, or whether it stops people from passing the virus on to others. Clive Dix, deputy chair of the government's vaccine taskforce, said: ""We may have to vaccinate every year like we do for the flu."" But he said getting to this point was a ""great achievement"" as vaccine development could take 10 years, but had been achieved in 10 months. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area The hope is that the bulk of the most vulnerable groups will be offered a coronavirus jab in the first few months of 2021. But achieving that is likely to require approval of a second vaccine made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The government has pre-ordered 100 million doses of that jab, which is easier to distribute because is does not need to be kept in ultra-cold storage and is made in the UK.The MHRA is currently assessing the data from trials on that vaccine. Vaccination to protect people from coronavirus in the UK has been promised to all over-50s, as well as younger adults with underlying health conditions - about 25 million people in total.

Breaking|Breaking newsFirst patient receives Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine,"This video can not be played Margaret Keenan was given the vaccine by May Parsons, at University Hospital in Coventry A UK grandmother has become the first person in the world to be given the Pfizer Covid-19 jab as part of a mass vaccination programme. Margaret Keenan, who turns 91 next week, said the injection she received at 06:31 GMT was the ""best early birthday present"". It was the first of 800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine that will be dispensed in the coming weeks. Up to four million more are expected by the end of the month. Hubs in the UK are starting the rollout by vaccinating the over-80s and some health and care staff. Senior NHS sources told the BBC ""thousands of vaccinations"" had taken place across the UK on Tuesday. 'Hopefully next year we'll be living a normal life' 'Mix-and-match' Covid vaccines to be tested 'V-day' as first people have Covid jab Dubbing the day ""V-day"", Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was ""a tribute to scientific endeavour and human ingenuity and to the hard work of so many people. ""Today marks the start of the fightback against our common enemy, the coronavirus,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, on a visit to a London hospital to see some of the first people getting the jab, said getting vaccinated was ""good for you and good for the whole country"". Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Today we should all allow ourselves a smile - but we must not drop our guard."" On Tuesday, the UK government reported a further 616 people had died within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total, by that measure, to 62,033. A further 12,282 people tested positive for the virus. This video can not be played How the vaccine rollout unfolded â and how a certain William Shakespeare was involved At University Hospital, Coventry, matron May Parsons administered the very first injection to Ms Keenan. ""I feel so privileged to be the first person vaccinated against Covid-19,"" said Ms Keenan, who is originally from Enniskillen, Co Fermanagh. ""It's the best early birthday present I could wish for because it means I can finally look forward to spending time with my family and friends in the new year, after being on my own for most of the year. ""My advice to anyone offered the vaccine is to take it. If I can have it at 90, then you can have it too,"" she added. Scotland's toughest Covid restrictions to be eased Covid deaths 'above worst case scenario' in Wales Further Covid-19 restrictions in NI 'not ruled out' Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director of NHS England, who witnessed the ""historic moment"", said: ""We couldn't hug her but we could clap, and everybody did so in the room."" An emotional Sister Joanna Sloan said she had been looking forward to the vaccine for so long Throughout the day, patients and health workers at some 50 hospitals around the UK have been getting the jab: Sister Joanna Sloan, who will head up the vaccine rollout in Belfast,received the first vaccine administered in Northern Ireland, just after 08:00 GMT at the Royal Victoria Hospital In Wales, a nervousCraig Atkins, 48, from Ebbw Vale, became the first person to get the jab. It was ""scary"" but he could smile now, the care home worker said Consultant anaesthetist Dr Katie Stewart was among the first people in Scotland to get the jab, saying there was something to celebrate after ""a very long hard year"" looking after Covid patients and staying apart to protect each other The UK is the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine afterregulators approved its use last week. On Tuesday,US regulators confirmed the vaccine is 95% effective, paving the way for it to be approved for emergency use. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine has alsobeen found to be ""safe and effective"", according to a paper published on Tuesday and assessed by independent scientists. This video can not be played Matt Hancock says he is thrilled but warns that people must still stick to the rules Speaking in the Commons, the health secretary stressed people did not need to apply for the vaccine. He said the NHS would be in touch with those eligible and urged them to ""please step forward for your country"". Mr Hancock went on to warn that there was ""still a long march ahead"", saying there were ""worrying signs"" of the virus growing in Essex, London and Kent. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' New data released by national statisticians for the week ending 27 November showed that of the 14,106 deaths registered in the UK, nearly 3,400 involved Covid. This is 20% higher than the five-year average but similar to the percentages seen in the past two weeks. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens called the first vaccinations ""remarkable achievement"", but cautioned it was a ""first step"" and ""incredibly important"" people continued to act sensibly. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: 'It will gradually make a huge, huge difference... but we haven't defeated this virus yet"" On a visit to London's Guy's Hospital, the prime minister spoke to 81-year-old Lyn Wheeler, who was the first to receive the vaccine there. ""It is really very moving to hear her say she is doing it for Britain, which is exactly right - she is protecting herself, but also helping to protect the entire country,"" Mr Johnson said. Earlier, he thanked the NHS, volunteers and ""all of the scientists who worked so hard to develop this vaccine"". Labour's shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth said it was ""absolutely fabulous"" to see people getting the vaccine and thanked everyone involved in making it happen. Some800,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine have been secured by the governmentto be administered in the coming weeks - although vaccination is not compulsory. Orders have been placed for 40 million in total - enough for 20 million people, as two courses are needed. However, most supplies are not expected to become available until next year. Mr Hancock said he expected it to take ""several weeks"" to get the first group of health workers, care staff and over-80s vaccinated. This is a momentous day, but make no mistake the NHS faces a huge task in rolling out this vaccine. First, there needs to be a smooth supply - and already there are reports of manufacturing problems, which means the UK is expecting less than half of the 10 million doses of the Pfizer jab it was planning for by the end of the year. The fact it needs to be kept in ultra-cold storage and in batches of 975 units is an added complication that has meant it cannot yet be taken into care homes to vaccinate residents - the very highest priority group - or sent out to GPs to run vaccination clinics in the community. NHS bosses hope to receive guidance from the regulator next week on how to get around this. But these factors illustrate why the UK is still pinning its hopes on a second vaccine developed by Oxford University. That one can be kept in fridges and so is easier to distribute, is British-made and - what is more - there is an ever-growing stockpile ready to use. If that vaccine gets the green light from regulators, there will be a genuine hope the first few months of 2021 will see rapid progress in offering jabs to the most vulnerable people, so the UK can return to something closer to normality.

It was edited by Sean Fanning and Holly Wallis, and written by George Bowden, Katie Wright, Ella Wills, Alex Therrien and Victoria Bisset. It's been a busy day for coronavirus news - here are the latest headlines from the UK and worldwide:   Hugh PymBBC News Health Editor Senior NHS sources have told the BBC that thousands of vaccinations have taken place across the UK today - the first day of the roll out of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. NHS England meanwhile has urged people not to contact the NHS to request a vaccine but to wait instead to be contacted. This will happen if they are in a priority group, which includes the over 80s, care home workers and some health staff. Is this a needle which I see before me? William Shakespeare receiving his first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine Margaret Keenan has made history by becoming the first person in the world to get a Covid-19 vaccine outside of a clinical trial, but if there's one name you'll associate with this day, it may not be hers. Enter William Shakespeare - not the writer, poet and playwright, but his 81-year-old namesake. This Shakespeare was the second person to be given a jab - and, guess what, he also comes from Warwickshire. ""Is this a needle which I see before me?"" the present-day Shakespeare might have asked, but his reaction was a little bit less, well, dramatic: he said he was ""pleased"" to be given the jab, and staff at University Hospital in Coventry had been ""wonderful"". Read more Reality Check An unfounded conspiracy theory about microchips and vaccines continues to be shared widely online The first Covid-19 vaccines have been administered today but some people are using this moment to spread misinformation online. Rumours and conspiracy theories â distinct from valid questions about the speed and efficacy of the various coronavirus vaccines â have been spreading for months. Weâve looked into the truth behind some of the most widely shared false vaccine claims, including:  Read the full story The launch of the national coronavirus vaccination programme reflects the best of the NHS, a senior leader has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccination programme was a ""remarkable achievement not just on the part of the scientists, the researchers, and the regulators, but today of pharmacists, nurses and doctors"". ""In many ways this is the NHS at its best, getting new vaccinations to vulnerable patients who need them for free,"" he added. And here's a little bit more from patients and health workers who've been among the first people to get Covid vaccinations. Jack Vokes, 98, who has cancer and has been in hospital for five weeks, described being the first person to be vaccinated in Bristol as ""a bit of excitement"". Vokes lives alone and hopes the vaccine will mean he is able to see more of his family, including his six granddaughters. ""I worry about my family more than me,"" he said. ""I live in hope that by the middle of next year we'll hopefully be living a normal life."" After getting the vaccine at Derriford Hospital in Plymouth, Kathleen Viney, 81, said she wouldn't be so scared to leave the house. ""It'll mean that I can go out more because at the moment I have been completely confined at home and have hardly any social life at all and now I will feel as though I'm a bit safer,"" she said. ""It will be nice to go out and have a meal and be able to do some shopping."" Viney said it took ""about two seconds"" to make up her mind when she was offered the vaccine. ""It would be very silly not to have it done,"" she said. ""There's nothing to be afraid of."" Read more stories here. This video can not be played The first person to receive the vaccine at a hospital in Slough was A&E consultant Dr Prem Premachandran, who is 64. He's worked at the Frimley
Health trust for 25 years and was shielding during the first wave of the pandemic. He said he was ""proud"" to get the jab. Schools in England will be allowed to take an inset day next Friday so staff have a ""proper break"" from identifying potential coronavirus cases ahead of Christmas, the schools standards minister has said. Nick Gibb told MPs that the government wants there to be a ""clear six days"" ahead of Christmas Eve so teachers and heads do not have to ""engage with track and trace issues"" throughout the festive break. The minister's comments came after a headteachers' union said giving schools the flexibility to switch to remote learning for the final few days of term next week was an ""obvious and straightforward solution"". But some schools had called for up to a week of remote learning to avoid self-isolation notifications happening on Christmas week. More on the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine - which researchers have confirmed in the Lancet is safe and effective. It could also play a major role in fighting the pandemic, especially as the UK has ordered 100 million doses of it. It is cheaper than some of the other Covid vaccines and easier to store and distribute. UK regulators are currently considering whether the jab can be rolled out across the population. Health correspondent Laura Foster explains what the vaccine is and how it works. This video can not be played Earlier, we reported that a Welsh government minister said he would rather ""no-one was having unnecessary visits"" amid aroyal UK tour. Now Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's royal train tour is a ""welcome morale boost"", according to No 10. It comes after Downing Street officials initially refused to say it complied with coronavirus restrictions. The prime minister's official spokesman said the tour was a ""matter for the palace"". Challenged on whether the royal couple had complied with the rules, the spokesman said: ""I'm making the general point that we have set out the regionalised tier system that is now in place and the guidance that we are asking people to abide by."" In response to a suggestion that No 10 was refusing to give its backing to the couple's trip, the spokesman said: ""I would point you towards the palace."" But an hour after the comments in a Westminster briefing, a statement issued by No 10 confirmed Johnson's support. A No 10 spokesman said: ""The PM is delighted to see the warm reception the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have received on their hugely valuable train tour of England, Scotland and Wales. ""The tour will be a welcome morale boost to frontline workers who have done so much during the pandemic.""   The UK government has reported another 12,282 daily positive tests for coronavirus. There have also been a further 616 deaths, within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to have died to 62,033. Thatâs up from 189 deaths announced on Monday, although there is often a reporting lag over the weekend. Four lions at a zoo in Barcelona have tested positive for coronavirus. Three females - Zala, Nima and Run Run - and a male named Kiumbe were all tested after displaying mild symptoms. Two members of staff also tested positive for the virus last month, although it is not clear how the lions were infected. âThe lions were given veterinary care for their mild clinical condition - similar to a very mild flu condition - through anti-inflammatory treatment and close monitoring, and the animals responded well,â the zoo said in a statement, according to Reuters. The zoo added that the animals had had no contact with other animals. This is only the second documented case of big cats contracting the virus, afterfour tigers and three lions at Bronx Zoo in the US tested positive in April. Highers and Advanced Higher exams have been cancelled in Scotland next year, Scottish Education Secretary John Swinney announces. The AS and A-level equivalents will no longer take place due to disruption to learning during the pandemic. It follows a decision to cancel National 5 exams - equivalent to GCSEs - and replace them with teacher assessments and coursework. It was confirmed in a statement to the Scottish Parliament on Tuesday afternoon. Read more here. Elisa Granato was one of the volunteers given the Oxford vaccine The Oxford/AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is safe and effective, giving good protection,researchers have confirmed in The Lancet journal. Most in the study were younger than 55, but the results so far indicate it does work well in older people too. The data also suggests it can reduce spread of Covid, as well protect against illness and death. The paper, assessed by independent scientists, sets out full results from advanced trials of over 20,000 people. Regulators, who will have seen the same data, are considering the jab for emergency use. Our Geneva correspondent Imogen Foulkes has been following a briefing by the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers, together with representatives from Pfizer BioNTech, Roche, Eli Lilley, and Johnson & Johnson. She's heard there are currently 300 vaccines in different stages of development: Pricing:The pharma companies present said they would be using a âthree-tierâ pricing policy for high, middle, and low income countries, with low income countries paying either a nominal price or nothing. Pricing will not, it was stressed, be adjusted upwards because demand currently far outstrips supply. Capacity and supply:With vaccines, diagnostics, and treatments, there are shortages. With vaccines in particular all the pharma representatives present agreed it would be the second half of next year before they were widely available. On testing, Severin Schwan of Roche said there were not enough tests to satisfy demand, and that therefore the idea of mass testing was not realistic at the moment. Thomas Cueni, CEO of IFMPA, said that because of shortages and the challenges in ramping up production, the next few months would be difficult, and that there is no alternative, for now, to social distancing, mask wearing, and hand washing. Kerry Allen, BBC Monitoring People queue for testing at a local hospital There are fresh fears in China about a widespread outbreak of coronavirus as new cases have been confirmed in Chengdu, a major city in
southwestern Chinaâs Sichuan province. Chengdu has a population of approximately 16 million people, andthe city has confirmed five new symptomatic cases of the virus since yesterday,external. An elderly couple were confirmed to have the virus yesterday,external,
but today, a couple of elderly farmers and the 20-year-old grand-daughter of the
first couplehave also been confirmed as having the virus,external.
The latter had visited multiple bars and restaurants around the city, and so
these have been sealed off with police tape, and recent visitors have been told
to immediately get tested. Official media  say that schools and nurseries in Chengduâs Pidu District
have been suspended and the local government has locked down the gated communities of the latest
patients. Residents in these communities are also being tested. However, state media are dismissing ârumoursâ online that the city
is imminently going into lockdown.Global Times says that the city has entered âwartime modeâ,external, but the
official CCTV broadcastersays that Chengduâs airports and railway stations are operating as normal,external. Grocery sales hit a record in November in Englandas people spent more during lockdown and started their Christmas shopping early, research indicates. Some Â£10.9bn was spent as eating and drinking out was restricted in England, market research firm Kantar said. It also found sales of goods such as turkeys jumped as people said they were determined to make this the ""best Christmas ever after a tough 2020"". Alcohol sales were 33% higher than the same four weeks last year because of ""limited opportunities to drink in pubs and restaurants"", said Fraser McKevitt, head of retail and consumer insight at Kantar. However, he added that mince pie sales were down by 8%, reflecting ""fewer opportunities to share a treat with friends and colleagues"". Maryam AzwerBBC Monitoring Sri Lanka is currently in second wave Social media users in Sri Lanka have criticised a gathering,externalof thousands of people in the Kegalle district of the southern-central part of the
island, where samples of a potion which was claimed to offer immunity from Covid-19 were being
distributed. Public health inspectorssaid public gatherings were a violation,externalof Covid-19 regulations. The potion has been developed by Dhammika Bandara, who
claims to be a practitioner of the ""Hela"" school of indigenous
medicine. It was recently sampled by government officials, including Health
Minister Pavithra Wanniarachchi. Local media have cited Bandara as saying,externalthat taking the
potion would make a person ""immune from Covid for the rest of their
lives"". There is no scientific evidence to back claims that
traditional medicines can offer immunity to coronavirus. Rasika Jayakody, former editor of the state-run Daily News,criticised Bandara for the gathering,external: ""People are lining up near the Kegalle residence of the
witch doctor who produced a 'cure' for #COVID19. #SriLanka Health Minister took
a sip of this medicine without any scientific or clinical evidence. This shows
the kind of damage an irresponsible govt. can inflict on a country"". Sri Lanka, which has seen 28,580 cases and 142 deaths from
the pandemic, is currently seeing a second wave. UK scientists are planning trials to see if giving people two different types of Covid vaccine, one after the other, might give better protection than two doses of one jab. This mix-and-match approach can go ahead only if another jab is approved by regulators, as has already happened with the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. The head of the UK's vaccine task force said trial designs were being prepared. ""It's an established process,"" Kate Bingham said. ""It's not being done because of supplies."" Read more here.

'Others deserve the vaccine before me',"Laura Nuttall was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer in 2018 ""I'm still getting out there and I'm trying to live my life, despite Covid."" Two years ago, when Laura Nuttall was 18, she was diagnosed with terminal brain cancer. She has had surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and is now undergoing immunotherapy treatment in Germany. Laura's immunocompromised, which means her immune system is weak and might be unable to fight infections and other diseases. ""I obviously take precautions, maybe more seriously than others, the 20-year-old student tells Newsbeat. ""It's nerve wracking"", her mum Nicola says. ""I am very conscious that if Laura was to get Covid, I have no idea how badly it might hit her."" Mum Nicola and daughter Laura disagree about when she should get the Covid-19 vaccine Laura says she feels like she's ""doing fine"" and wants others, particularly older people, to get the Covid-19 vaccine before she does. ""I feel like there are people that deserve the vaccine, before I get it."" Her mum disagrees. ""I would feel a lot happier, knowing that she'd had the vaccine and was protected,"" she says. NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the safety checks for vaccines? When Laura was diagnosed, doctors gave her 12 to 18 months to live. Nicola says having a vaccine sooner would give Laura a bit more freedom, flexibility and more confidence. ""I don't want her to stop living her life and stop socialising - I don't want her to have to stay in. ""I think it's so important to know that she's had the vaccine early and we're not going to have to wait, it could be the best part of half a year before she gets a turn."" At the moment, they don't know when Laura will get the vaccine, as she mayfourth or sixth on the list of priorities. ""It's the worst thing you can ever imagine being told, that your daughter has a terminal diagnosis,"" Nicola says. ""It's been hugely traumatic to see Laura go through surgery and radiotherapy, to lose her hair, and have to go through chemotherapy every month for 12 months."" Although she says it's been tough, Laura has always been very positive. ""There's no rollercoaster ride like this one, it's horrific. ""It turns your stomach. ""But there have been highs, like the things we've done."" Laura and her mum Nicola have been on loads of adventures - and even attended a film premiere The family decided to start a bucket list of things to do in 2019. ""I took a gap year - a kind of an enforced gap year - and I did wonderful things,"" Laura says. She travelled - going on safari in South Africa and taking trips to Amsterdam and New York. She monster trucks, drove buses, spent a day with the police, went to football matches, watched beans being made in the Heinz factory and went fishing with Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse. Laura Nuttall went fishing with Bob Mortimer and Paul Whitehouse She even got to meet Michelle Obama. ""I was kind of doing those just to make a statement that my life would not be limited by having cancer. ""I'm really glad that we managed to get out and do all the crazy stuff that we did. ""Having those memories to look back gives me a boost when I feel low during Covid."" Now Laura is in her second year at Manchester University studying politics, philosophy and economics. Until she gets the vaccine she says she's ""being sensible"" but continuing to live her life. Laura had loads of adventures in 2019, including going on a monster truck Looking back at 2019, Nicola and Laura say they feel thankful they did it all before the pandemic, as they don't know whether they'll have the time or opportunity to continue their family adventures. ""We have made good use of the time we had and I'm really glad it happened last year when we were able to do so many things that we couldn't do this year,"" Nicola says.

Uber sheds self-driving cars to focus on profits,"Uber's self-driving car programme met with setbacks after a deadly crash in Arizona in 2018 Uber is selling its driverless car subsidiary to start-up Aurora Technologies, abandoning a unit that Uber's founder once hailed as critical to the future of the firm. Aurora, founded in 2017,said the deal,externalwill help it ""accelerate"" its mission to make self-driving cars a reality. Uber will invest $400m in the Amazon-backed company, giving it a 26% stake. Its chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also serve on Aurora's board, following closure of the deal. Despite the sale of its driverless car subsidiary known as Advanced Technologies Group, Uber said it remained interested in the sector, with plans to collaborate with Aurora when it comes to launching driverless cars on its network. ""Few technologies hold as much promise to improve people's lives with safe, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation as self-driving vehicles,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. ""For the last five years, our phenomenal team ... has been at the forefront of this effort - and in joining forces with Aurora, they are now in pole position to deliver on that promise even faster."" Developing driverless technology was a key priority when Uber's founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick was leading the ride hailing firm, since he saw it as a way to reduce costs. But the programme hit setbacksafter one of its cars was involved in a deadly crash in Arizona, though officials blamed human error for the accident and declined to bring criminal charges against the company. The driverless car unit was also tangled up in legal fights overallegations of technology theft. Mr Khosrowshahi, who replaced Mr Kalanick as the boss of Uber in 2017, has refocused the firm on taxi and food delivery services as he pushes to make Uber profitable. The deal with Aurora values Uber's Advanced Technologies Group at roughly $4bn, down from the $7.5bn it was estimated to be worth last year, according to Reuters. It is expected to be completed in the first three months of 2021,Uber said,external. Aurora, led by veterans of driverless car efforts at Google and Uber, says it has previously received ""significant investment"" from Amazon, which is known to be exploring the possibility of driverless delivery vehicles. South Korean carmaker Hyundai has also backed Aurora, which has offices in four US cities.

"Family 'didn't know about toxic air' before deathPollution likely contributed to the fatal asthma attack of Ella Kissi-Debrah, 9, an inquest hears.","Ella Kissi-Debrah lived 25 metres from the South Circular Road in south-east London The mother of a nine-year-old girl who died following an asthma attack says she ""would have moved"" if she had known how dangerous local air pollution was. Ella Kissi-Debrah, who lived near the South Circular Road in Lewisham, south-east London, died in 2013. A 2018 report found unlawful levels of pollution likely contributed to a fatal asthma attack. At a new inquest into Ella's death Rosamund Adoo Kissi-Debrah said her daughter was ""the centre of our world"". Ms Kissi-Debrah said ""moving would have been the first thing"" the family would have done if they had known the risks air pollution posed to Ella. She told the inquest she knew about car fumes but had never heard of nitrogen oxides (NOx) - one of the most dangerous forms of air pollution.As they did not know of the risks posed by air pollution Ms Kissi-Debrah said she never spoke to doctors about moving. Ms Kissi-Debrah branded air pollution ""a public health emergency"", and called for more education about its dangers. Ella was classified as disabled due to her respiratory problems Ella was first taken to hospital in 2010 after a coughing fit and subsequently admitted to hospital 27 times. Ms Kissi-Debrah said that by the summer of 2012, Ella was classified as disabled. She often had to carry Ella by piggyback to get her around. Ella was seen by consultants at six different hospitals in the years before her death. On the day before Ella died Ms Kissi-Debrah described her daughter ""screaming"" as she left her with paramedics. ""When I saw her in the ambulance I knew she was going to have a seizure, she was so bad,"" Ms Kissi-Debrah said. 'Did air pollution kill my daughter?' Tracking the toxic air that's killing millions Dad's mission to cut toxic air at school Describing the efforts of doctors to resuscitate Ella on the night of her death, she said: ""They tried and they tried and they tried."" Ella died at 03:27 on 15 February 2013. Rosamund Adoo Kissi-Debrah said she did not know how dangerous local levels of pollution were before her daughter's death An inquest in 2014, which focused on Ella's medical care, concluded her death was caused by acute respiratory failure and severe asthma.But a 2018 report said it was likely unlawful levels of pollution, which were detected at a monitoring station one mile from Ella's home, contributed to her fatal asthma attack. Ella may become the first person in the UK for whom air pollution is listed as the cause of death. The hearing continues.

Covid forces Davos forum to move to SingaporeThe World Economic Forum says the pandemic makes it hard to guarantee participants would stay safe in Europe.,"Singapore is a long way from the snow-capped peaks of the Swiss Alps The World Economic Forum, which usually hosts a glitzy annual meeting for political and business leaders in the Swiss ski resort of Davos, has moved next year's event to Singapore. The forum says it's making the change to safeguard health and safety. ""In light of the current situation with regards to Covid-19 cases, it was decided that Singapore was best placed to hold the meeting,"" it said. Singapore has largely been seen as managing the crisis successfully. Its health ministry says there are currently 28 people being treated in hospital for the coronavirus, but none are in intensive care, and there are no cases in the community. Singapore's death toll for Covid-19 stands at 29. But the country remains under ""phase two"" restrictions, which means gatherings are capped at five people and working from home is still the default for most companies. Singapore's Trade Minister Chan Chun Sing said the Forum's decision to hold the meeting in the country was ""an affirmation of Singapore's ability to provide a safe, neutral and conducive venue for global leaders to meet"". Safety measures could include tests on arrival and contact tracing of attendees, the government said. Breakfast panels are a staple of the Davos summit The in-person World Economic Forum annual meeting is planned to take place in Singapore from 13-16 May, before returning to Switzerland in 2022. It will be only the second time the event has been held outside Davos in its history. In 2002, the forum was organised in New York to show solidarity with the US after the 9/11 terror attacks. Free bobble hats and nine other facts about Davos Klaus Schwab, who founded the forum in the 1970s, said a global leadership summit would be crucial to address the global recovery from the pandemic.

How do I know it's safe?,"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.

Uber sheds self-driving cars to focus on profitsDriverless cars were one seen as core to the company's future but lately it's focused on rides and food.Business,"Uber's self-driving car programme met with setbacks after a deadly crash in Arizona in 2018 Uber is selling its driverless car subsidiary to start-up Aurora Technologies, abandoning a unit that Uber's founder once hailed as critical to the future of the firm. Aurora, founded in 2017,said the deal,externalwill help it ""accelerate"" its mission to make self-driving cars a reality. Uber will invest $400m in the Amazon-backed company, giving it a 26% stake. Its chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi will also serve on Aurora's board, following closure of the deal. Despite the sale of its driverless car subsidiary known as Advanced Technologies Group, Uber said it remained interested in the sector, with plans to collaborate with Aurora when it comes to launching driverless cars on its network. ""Few technologies hold as much promise to improve people's lives with safe, accessible, and environmentally friendly transportation as self-driving vehicles,"" Mr Khosrowshahi said. ""For the last five years, our phenomenal team ... has been at the forefront of this effort - and in joining forces with Aurora, they are now in pole position to deliver on that promise even faster."" Developing driverless technology was a key priority when Uber's founder and former chief executive Travis Kalanick was leading the ride hailing firm, since he saw it as a way to reduce costs. But the programme hit setbacksafter one of its cars was involved in a deadly crash in Arizona, though officials blamed human error for the accident and declined to bring criminal charges against the company. The driverless car unit was also tangled up in legal fights overallegations of technology theft. Mr Khosrowshahi, who replaced Mr Kalanick as the boss of Uber in 2017, has refocused the firm on taxi and food delivery services as he pushes to make Uber profitable. The deal with Aurora values Uber's Advanced Technologies Group at roughly $4bn, down from the $7.5bn it was estimated to be worth last year, according to Reuters. It is expected to be completed in the first three months of 2021,Uber said,external. Aurora, led by veterans of driverless car efforts at Google and Uber, says it has previously received ""significant investment"" from Amazon, which is known to be exploring the possibility of driverless delivery vehicles.

"Christchurch massacre 'unpreventable', says inquiryHowever, a report reveals inquiry a series of failures ahead of the 2019 attack.Asia","Armed guards outside Al Noor mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand An inquiry into the Christchurch massacre has found a series of failures ahead of the 2019 attack, but concluded the tragedy was unpreventable. The inquiry was launched after white supremacist Brenton Tarrant killed 51 people at two mosques in March 2019. It found he had been able to accumulate a massive trove of weapons, with authorities failing to enforce proper checks on firearms licences. It further found officials were overly focused on Islamist terrorism. However, correcting these failures would not have stopped the Australian national, who was sentenced to life in prison without parole earlier this year, from carrying out the attack, it said. What's more, the patchwork of clues discovered by police after the massacre - including his steroid abuse, a hospital admission after he accidentally shot himself, and visits to far-right websites - would not have proved enough to predict the attack. ""The commission found no failures within any government agencies that would have allowed the terrorist planning and preparation to be detected,"" New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said afterthe release of the report.,external ""But they did identify many lessons to be learnt and significant areas that require change."" This video can not be played Ardern: 'Muslim New Zealanders should be safe' She highlighted ""failings within the firearms licensing regime"" and ""inappropriate concentration of resources"" on a perceived level of Islamist threats. ""While the commission made no findings that these issues would have stopped the attack, these were failings nonetheless and, for that, on behalf of the government I apologise."" The people killed as they prayed Christchurch killer to stay in jail until he dies The report includes a list of recommendations which the government said it would all accept, including establishing a new national intelligence and security agency and a proposal for the police to better identify and respond to hate crimes. The government also plans to create an ethnic community ministry and a graduate programme for ethnic communities. The imam of the Al Noor Mosque, one of the two places of worship targeted, said the report confirmed that authorities had been overly suspicious of the Muslim community instead of protecting it. ""We've known for a long time that the Muslim community has been targeted with hate speech and hate crimes - this report shows that we are right,"" Gamal Fouda said. ""The report shows that institutional prejudice and unconscious bias exists in government agencies and that needs to change."" He stressed that the changes recommended in the report should now be used to rebuild the trust between the Muslim community and the police. Aya Al-Umari, whose brother died in the attack, told the BBC that the report's recommendations highlighted ""all the right areas"". ""That is mainly: improving New Zealand's counter terrorism efforts, the firearm licensing, the social cohesion and New Zealand's response to the increasing diversity of our population,"" Ms Al-Umari said. She also said she hoped New Zealand's experience would provide lessons to other countries, noting that the response would have to be at an individual level as well. ""We each play a part in reducing hate crimes and reducing our unconscious bias. That escalates to what we saw on March 15 last year."" This video can not be played 'I can't forgive my attacker' However, the Islamic Women's Council of New Zealand criticised the report for what they said was a lack of transparency. ""There are multiple areas of evidence that have not been investigated, and questions raised by IWCNZ have been ignored,"" the group said. ""We find it concerning that the commissioners found systemic failures and an inappropriate concentration of resources towards Islamic terrorism, and yet state that these would not have made a difference to the terrorist being detected prior to the event."" The Australian national, who lived off his savings and a large inheritance from his father, got a firearms licence and began buying rifles, shotguns and ammunition soon after he arrived in New Zealand in 2017. Later that year, he told a doctor he had been taking steroids and was injecting testosterone several times a week. The doctor warned against this, but no further treatment followed. Over the following years, he visited far-right websites and occasionally posted right-wing material on his Facebook page. He also donated money to far-right groups overseas. In 2018, he wounded himself in a firearms accident and was worried that seeking treatment might alert the police. He eventually went to hospital but his injury did no raise suspicion and was not reported. In the run-up to the attack, he tried to conceal some of his digital footprint, but investigators were able to track in some detail his reconnaissance efforts, planning and preparation for the attack on 15 March. None of the details uncovered by police after the massacre stood out at the time as something which would have raised suspicion from authorities, the report found. On 15 March, the Australian attacker opened fire on worshippers inside the Al Noor mosque, broadcasting the attack on Facebook Live via a headcam he was wearing. He then drove to the Linwood Islamic Centre where he shot people outside and then shot at the windows. A man from inside the centre rushed outside and picked up one of the attacker's shotguns before chasing him away. This video can not be played The BBC report from the day of the shootings Police officers then chased and arrested the gunman. After his arrest, the attacker told police that his plan was to burn down mosques after his initial attack and he wished he had done so. During his sentencing in August this year, the court heard that he had planned to target another mosque, but was detained by officers on the way. Earlier this year, the attacker wassentenced to life in prison without parole. The judge called his actions ""inhuman"", saying he had ""showed no mercy"". The massacre also prompted New Zealand to reform its gun laws. Less than a month after the shootings, the country's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms. The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme. New Zealanders handed in their semi-automatic weapons While there was widespread praise for how New Zealand dealt with the tragedy in the aftermath, there was also criticism that authorities might have ignored warnings that hate crimes against the Muslim community were escalating. In response to that, the government launched the the Royal Commission of Inquiry into the massacre.  It is the highest level of independent inquiry available under New Zealand law. The report took about 18 months to compile and contains interviews with hundreds of people including security agencies, Muslim community leaders and international experts. ""Ultimately, this roughly 800-page report can be distilled into one simple premise,"" Ms Ardern said. ""Muslim New Zealanders should be safe. Anyone who calls New Zealand home, regardless of race, religion, sex or sexual orientation should be safe.""

What would no deal mean?,"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year. In fact, talks are still ongoing on this issue. Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

'V-day' as first people due to get Covid jabThe first people are due to be given the Pfizer/BioNTech jab as vaccination of all over-50s begins.,"The first people in the UK are set to receive a coronavirus jab on what has been dubbed ""V-Day"", as a mass vaccination programme begins. About 70 hospital hubs across the UK are gearing up to give the Pfizer/BioNTech jab to the over-80s and some health and care staff. The programme aims to protect the most vulnerable and return life to normal. Grandfather-of-nine Dr Hari Shukla, 87, said he was ""delighted to be doing my bit"" by getting the jab on Tuesday. ""I feel it is my duty to do so and do whatever I can to help,"" said Dr Shukla, who will receive his jab at the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle with his wife, Ranjan. The UK will be the first country in the world to start using the Pfizer vaccine afterregulators approved its use last week. Vaccination will not be compulsory. What are the safety checks for vaccines? Who will get the Covid vaccine first? NHS staff: 'Vaccine is a game changer' Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was now ""light at the end of the tunnel"". ""We will look back on today, V-day, as a key moment in our fightback against this terrible disease,"" he added. Those administering the vaccine will be the first to receive jabs inScotland, while health workers will be first in line inWalesandNorthern Ireland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""Today marks a huge step forward in the UK's fight against coronavirus."" But he added: ""As the programme ramps up in the weeks and months ahead, it is as important as ever to keep to theCovid Winter Plan,external- following the rules in your area and remember the basics of hands, face and space."" Ministers have warned it could be Easter by the time restrictions are lifted in a significant way. Race relations campaigner Dr Hari Shukla, who was made a CBE in 2016, will be among the first to receive the Covid vaccine NHS England's chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said the vaccinations were a""decisive turning point in the battle against coronavirus""and will continue ""at least until spring"", urging people to be ""very careful"" before then. More than 60,000 people in the UK have died after being infected with Covid-19,according to government figures,external. The government has secured800,000 doses of this vaccineto start with, but orders have been placed for 40 million in total, enough for 20 million people as two courses are needed. The majority of that is not expected to become available until next year, although government sources said another four million doses should arrive in the country by the end of the year. These freezers, at a secure location in the UK, can each hold more than more than 80,000 doses of the Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine The government had initially been promised 10 million doses by the end of December, but problems with manufacturing mean the supply is going to be slower than originally hoped for. Refrigerated containers holding the vaccine doses have been arriving in the UKover the past few days from Belgium, where it is made, and sent to the network of hospitals that will carry out the vaccinations. Chris Hopson of NHS Providers, which represents hospitals, said there had been an ""incredible effort"" to start the vaccination programme so quickly given that the vaccine was only approved for use in the UK last week. ""This is our wonderful NHS in action,"" he added. Hospital patients over the age of 80 are among the first people who will get the jab on Tuesday, along with the NHS staff who are carrying out the vaccinations. Some of the most at-risk NHS staff will also be offered the vaccine and, in the coming days, care homes will be able to book their staff in for vaccination. But rollout of the jab has been complicated by the need to store it at -70C and that it comes in packs of 975 doses, which cannot yet be split into smaller batches. That has meantit has not been possible to offer it to care home residents in the first phase of rollout, despite the government's vaccine advisers designating them the highest priority. Care home vaccinations to start 'within two weeks' 'The vaccine is here. But I'm scared of needles' 'Others deserve Covid vaccine before me' The NHS is awaiting guidance from the drugs regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, to see what steps are needed to allow these batches to be split and sent to individual care homes. That is expected to come in mid-December, which will pave the way for the vaccine to be offered to care homes and distributed to more than 1,000 designated GP centres. Mass vaccination centres at conference centres, sports stadiums and leisure centres are also expected to be established next year. The vaccine is given as two injections, 21 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity begins to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect seven days after the second dose. Most of the side-effects are very mild, similar to the side-effects after any other vaccine, and usually last for a day or so. The vaccine was 95% effective for all groups in the trials, including elderly people. But it is not yet known how long the immunity it provides lasts, or whether it stops people from passing the virus on to others. Clive Dix, deputy chair of the government's vaccine taskforce, said: ""We may have to vaccinate every year like we do for the flu."" But he said getting to this point was a ""great achievement"" as vaccine development could take 10 years, but had been achieved in 10 months. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area The hope is that the bulk of the most vulnerable groups will be offered a coronavirus jab in the first few months of 2021. But achieving that is likely to require approval of a second vaccine made by Oxford University and AstraZeneca. The government has pre-ordered 100 million doses of that jab, which is easier to distribute because is does not need to be kept in ultra-cold storage and is made in the UK.The MHRA is currently assessing the data from trials on that vaccine. Vaccination to protect people from coronavirus in the UK has been promised to all over-50s, as well as younger adults with underlying health conditions - about 25 million people in total.

Patients who are also entitled tothe respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccine,externalwill not usually be given it at the same time as a flu or Covid jab. However, pregnant women can have the RSV vaccine at the same time as the Covid jab. What are the symptoms of the new XEC Covid variant and is it spreading in the UK? Vaccines from two companies are currently in use across the UK: Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. People are advised to take whichever vaccine they are offered, as both provide protection against severe illness or death. AstraZenecapulled its Covid vaccine worldwidebecause of the surplus of updated vaccines from its competitors. At the firm's request, in May 2024, the European Medicines Authoritywithdrew authorisation for the vaccine,,externalwhich is no longer being manufactured or supplied. Covid vaccine safety - What we know NHS England: About the Covid vaccination,external A number of High Street chemists and private clinics sell and administer the Pfizer Covid vaccine directly to the public. The cost varies from about Â£45 to Â£99. You need to be aged 12 or above, and must not have had a Covid vaccine in the previous three months. You also need to talk to a health professional to check that it is suitable. A protein-based booster vaccine made by Novavax, which works differently to the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, is also available. Moderna is hoping to launch a combinedflu and Covid vaccinein 2025 or 2026, afterthe jab passed a vital part of final-stage scientific checksin June 2024. Pfizer and BioNTech are testing a similar two-in-one mRNA vaccine against flu and Covid. If you have Covid, or think you might, the NHS recommendsdelaying vaccination until you feel better.,external It also advises postponing if you have a high temperature or feel otherwise unwell with any illness.

How do I know the Covid vaccine is safe?How does the Pfizer vaccine work?Will a vaccine give us our old lives back?,"More than 60% of the world's population - 4.8 billion people - have received at least one dose of coronavirus vaccine. There are different approved types and brands available and all have undergone rigorous testing and safety checks. Safety trials begin in the lab, with tests and research on cells and animals, before moving on to human studies. The principle is to start small and only move to the next stage of testing if there are no outstanding safety concerns. When will I get a coronavirus vaccine? If the safety data from the labs is good, scientists can check the vaccine or treatment is effective. That means tests on large numbers of volunteers - about 40,000 in the case of Pfizer-BioNTech,the first to be approved in the UK. Half are given the vaccine and the other half a placebo jab. The researchers and participants are not told which group is which, until after the results, to avoid bias. This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given All of the work and findings are checked and verified independently. The Covid vaccine trials happened at breakneck speed, but they didn't skip any steps - they were able to move faster because so many people were involved and other projects were put aside. Approval is only given if regulators are happy that a vaccine is safe and effective. Checks continue after approval to make sure there are no further side effects or long-term risks. In the UK, independent experts on the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation decide how best to use a vaccine and who should get it after approval by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency. Scientists hope to tweak coronavirus vaccines to ensure they continue to offer high protection as new variants of the disease emerge. The UK's drug regulator says new vaccines can befast-tracked for approvalif needed. No corners will be cut, with safety paramount. But lengthy clinical trials with thousands of volunteers will not be needed. Instead, data from existing studies and ongoing real-world use could be used. Pfizer-BioNTech's vaccine (and Moderna's) uses bits of genetic code to cause an immune response. These are called mRNA vaccines. They do not alter human cells, but merely present the body with instructions to build immunity to Covid. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine uses a harmless virus altered to look a lot more like the pandemic virus. Vaccines sometimes contain other ingredients, like aluminium, that make the vaccine stable or more effective. Vaccines do not give you a disease. Instead, they teach your body's immune system to recognise and fight the infection they have been designed to protect against. Some people do experience mild to moderate symptoms after being vaccinated. This is not the disease itself, but the body's response to the vaccine. Common reactions,externalthat may affect more than one in 10 people and typically get better within days include chills, tiredness and aching muscles. It is rare to find that health problems occurring following a vaccine are actually caused by the vaccine itself. Events may be coincidental and unrelated to vaccination. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has beenlinked to very rare cases of blood clots,external. This is not proof that the vaccine is to blame. Covid infection itself can also make clots more likely and they can occur naturally too. The chance of this happening to an individual is still extremely low, but as a precaution, younger age groups in the UK have been offered alternative Covid vaccines. Allergic reactions to vaccines are rare. For any approved vaccine, the ingredients arelisted.,external There have been serious but treatable allergic reactions in a very small number of people given the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine. As a precaution, the MHRA says people with a history of significant allergic reactions to any of the ingredients in this vaccine should not currently have this jab. Be aware that anti-vaccine stories are spread online through social media. These posts are not based on scientific advice (or blend facts with misinformation). People will still be offered the jab even if they have had Covid in the past. That's because natural immunity may not be long-lived and immunisation could offer more protection. Guidance,externalsays there are no safety concerns about giving jabs to people with ""long"" Covid either. But people who are currently unwell with Covid-19 should not receive the vaccine until they have recovered. Some vaccines, such as the shingles vaccine and the children's nasal flu vaccine, can contain pork gelatine. The Covid vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca do not contain this, or any other animal products.

How does the Pfizer vaccine work?Will a vaccine give us our old lives back?,"The Pfizer/BioNTech coronavirus vaccine is one of two being rolled out across the UK. The government aims to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by mid-February and has got off to a strong start, with more than four million jabs administered. The vaccine trains the immune system to fight coronavirus. It is a new type of jab called an RNA vaccine and uses a tiny fragment of the virus's genetic code. This starts making part of the virus inside the body, which the immune system recognises as foreign and starts to attack. The genetic material is encased in a tiny protective bubble of fat to get it into cells. The exact ingredients of the vaccine have not been made public, but other vaccines can contain other ingredients, like aluminium, to make them stable or more effective. This video can not be played How will the new Pfizer vaccine work? This is the first RNA vaccine to be approved for use in humans. The concept has been researched before and people have been given them in clinical trials for other diseases. The vaccine will be considered by regulatory agencies around the world, who will decide whether the jab can be approved for use. NHS frontline staff, care home residents and workers, and the over 80s are first in line to receive the two vaccines being rolled out in the UK - Pfizer and Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab. About half of over-80s in the UK have now been vaccinated. People in England in their 70s, and those listed as clinically extremely vulnerable, are now beginning to receiving their offers of a jab. Out of the nine priority groups, those aged 50-54 are at the bottom of the current list. There will be a second phase, which will offer the vaccine to the other groups in the population. The vaccine was initially delivered in hospitals. It is now also being administered through GPs and care homes, as well as local vaccination centres in venues such as sports halls andmass vaccination hubsin places like cathedrals and sports halls. However, there are logistical challenges for the Pfizer vaccine: It must be keptat -70C during transportation The jab must be thawed before it is given to a patient It can be stored in a normal fridge for a few days before being used How do the Covid vaccines compare? It is impossible to know and we will find out only by waiting. If immunity does not last then it may be necessary to have annual vaccines, as we do for flu. The vaccine appears to protect 94% of adults over 65 years old and data from its phase three trial suggestsit works equally well in people of all ages and ethnicities. Early evidencesuggests the Pfizer vaccine is likely to protect against a coronavirus variant that is spreading around the UK. Some people - such as those with a weak immune system - will not be able to have the vaccine. Nothing in medicine is 100% safe - even something we take without thinking, like paracetamol, poses risks. The data so far is reassuring - trials on 43,500 people discovered no safety concerns, although mild side effects, such as headaches and muscle aches, have been reported. If there were highly dangerous and common consequences of this vaccination, they should have become apparent. However, rarer side effects may emerge as millions of people are immunised. Hopefully yes, but not for some time. If enough people are immune then the virus would stop spreading and we would not need other measures. However, the manufacture and distribution of a vaccine will take some time. So testing, lockdowns, social distancing, and mask wearing are going to be a feature of our lives for a while yet. The vaccine has been designed and developed by Pfizer and BioNtech, and they own the intellectual property. They already have the manufacturing capacity to produce 1.3 billion doses by the end of this year, but could partner with others to increase capacity even further. We do not know if the vaccine stops you catching and spreading the virus or just stops you from getting ill. We also don't know how protective the vaccine is in different age groups. These will be crucial for understanding how it will be used. About a dozen vaccines are in the final development stages. The Oxford University/AstraZeneca jab is also being used in the UK, and supplies of the approved Moderna vaccine should arrive in the spring.
