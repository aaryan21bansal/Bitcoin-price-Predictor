Russian athletes suspended for Worlds,"The Russian Anti-Doping Agency has been under investigation by Wada since last year Russia will miss this summer's World Championships after athletics' governing body voted to extend their suspension from international competition for state-sponsored doping. However, some Russians may be able to compete under a neutral banner, if they can satisfy testing criteria. Russia was suspended by the IAAF in November 2015, meaning athletes missed the Rio Olympics last year. The country is now not expected to be fully reinstated until November. London will host the World Championships between 4-13 August. The decision to extend Russia's suspension came at an IAAF Council meeting in Monaco on Monday. Independent chairman of the IAAF Taskforce, Rune Andersen,told the council,externalthat the Russian Track and Field Federation (Rusaf) was unlikely to be reinstated until the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) declared the Russian Anti-Doping Agency (Rusada) code-compliant, probably in November. However, the taskforce said concerns still exist about drug-testing procedures in Russia. This video can not be played Lord Coe denies misleading select committee MPs More than 1,000 Russian athletes were part of a state-sponsored doping programme between 2011 and 2015, according to the McLaren report, commissioned by Wada andpublished in December. Athletes who can follow strict IAAF criteria and show they are clean may be allowed to compete - but not under a Russian flag. The IAAF said so far this year, 35 Russians had applied to compete as neutrals. At the meeting, IAAF president Lord Coe also said that all nationality switches by athletes would be frozen. He said the current rules were ""no longer fit for purpose"" and new proposals would be written up. Andersen said that there is still limited testing of Russian track and field at a national level and there continued to be ""troubling incidents"", although the situation is improving. However, he said that in January 2017: Five athletes had withdrawn from a national competition after hearing that drug testing would be taking place; Bottles being shipped to foreign laboratories for testing were opened and screened in at least one case; Russian authorities have refused to release samples that have been screened in Moscow so the IAAF can test them further; Testers are still being denied access to 'closed cities' - military facilities where some athletes train. ""Our priority is to return clean athletes to competition but we must all have confidence in the process,"" said Briton Coe. ""Clean Russian athletes have been badly let down by their national system. We must ensure they are protected and that those safeguards give confidence to the rest of the world that there is a level playing field of competition when Russians return."" The IAAF has put together a ""roadmap"" that Russia must follow before athletes can once again take part in international competition. It includes: Russia providing an ""appropriate official response"" addressing points raised in the McLaren report; Drug testing being ""carried out without any further adverse incidents or difficulties""; Rusaf taking ""demonstrable and practical"" steps to improve clean sport; Rusada being reinstated as ""a truly autonomous, independent and properly resourced national anti-doping organisation"". Athletes are now banned from changing nationalities following a proposal by Coe, who said athletics was ""vulnerable"" to the practice. ""It has become abundantly clear with regular multiple transfers of athletes, especially from Africa, that the present rules are no longer fit for purpose,"" he said. The IAAF Council was told African talent was effectively being put up for sale to different nations. Hamad Kalkaba Malboum, Africa area group representative on the IAAF Council, said: ""The present situation is wrong. What we have is a wholesale market for African talent open to the highest bidder. ""Lots of the individual athletes concerned, many of whom are transferred at a young age, do not understand that they are forfeiting their nationality."" At December's European Cross Country Championships, the top two finishers in both the senior men's and women's races were Kenya-born athletes representing Turkey.

Super Bowl show,"Did Lady Gaga nail it? First things first: is Lady Gaga OK? She was last seen dropping the mic, grabbing a flying football and seemingly jumping into a deep pit. That all came at the end of 13 minutes of frantic action that started on the roof of a stadium in Houston, saw her plummet down to ground level before apparently running a few kilometres. All while singing, and fitting in one costume change. Not bad. The consensus was that Lady Gaga nailed it - it being the half-time show of the Super Bowl, the big date in any American football fan's diary. In doing so, she followed such names as the Rolling Stones, Michael Jackson and Beyonce (more on her later.) But there was one big question before the game: how political would her show be? So, naturally, our first question is: In the past, Lady Gaga has not been shy in addressing the questions that matter most to her, most notably LGBTQ issues. The show took place barely two weeks since the inauguration of Donald Trump, who is reported to have been preparing an executive order rolling back LGBTQ rights. And given that her showcame a year after Beyonce's blistering, politically-charged half-time show,all the expectations were that Gaga's show would be a platform for some sort of pointed message. Lady Gaga did some acrobatics, before dropping her mic and disappearing somewhere in a pit So in the end, it was perhaps a bit of a surprise that there was not a more explicit message delivered. It was what she had promised, to be fair. ""The only statements that I'll be making during the half-time show are the ones that I've been consistently making throughout my career,"" she had said. And so it proved. There were no dancers dressed as Black Panthers, a la Beyonce. But we did get a brief introduction incorporating the lyrics of Woody Guthrie ""This land is your land/This land is my land"" and the Pledge of Allegiance ""One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."" To those seeking a political statement from Lady Gaga, it did the job. And it will have appeared purely as a patriotic message to everyone else. So win-win. But one moment did stand out for those watching - one of the six songs she delivered was a message to all those who feel excluded, Born This Way. ""No matter gay, straight or bi/Lesbian, transgendered life/I'm on the right track baby/I was born to survive."" (It may not have been a coincidence that this song was chosen, given the presence in the stadium of Vice-President Mike Pence, a bete noire of the LGBTQ movement). Apparently not. In the build-up to the Super Bowl, this was actually a concern ofthe right-wing organisation Infowars.,external There were no immediate reports by Houston Police of Satanic activity on Sunday night. Well, this is one place where there was an unmistakable message, on a weekend in which a ban on new arrivals to the US from seven Muslim-majority nations was blocked by a judge. That message was: ""We're all one nation together, and we respect where people come from and the journey they took to get here."" This was most obvious in the advert by Airbnb showing people of different colours under the hashtag #weaccept -an ad apparently produced in only a few days last week.,external ""We believe no matter who you are, where you're from, who you love or who you worship, we all belong,"" the advert said. ""The world is more beautiful the more you accept."" The company, which has been attacked in the past for not being inclusive enough, went on to announce a programme to support refugees. It was obvious too, in the advert for a lumber company showing the journey made by a family from Central America to the States (a longer version posted online shows them arriving at a huge wall, only to find someone had built a door into it). And it was obvious too in the advert by a leading beer company showing the (no doubt fictionalised) struggle its founder had in moving to the US. All reports in Florida, where Mr Trump was on a brief trip, indicate he did not watch the whole match. He did not tweet his opinion of Lady Gaga's show. What happened on the field was equally dramatic. The team in white from Boston made an astonishing recovery, coming back from 28-3 down in the third quarter to beat the team in red from Atlanta in the first overtime in Super Bowl history.

High security,"Francisco Fernandez and his business are little known Most people have never heard of a Swiss man called Francisco Fernandez, but tens of millions of us rely on him to look after our money. An unassuming 53-year-old who likes playing the piano in his spare time, he is responsible for the security of $4 trillion (Â£3.2tn) of bank deposits around the world. Mr Fernandez is the founder and boss of a company that is as little known as he is - Avaloq. The Swiss business and its 2,500 employees may fly under the radar, but it is one of the world's largest providers of banking software. Its systems are used by more than 450 banks around the world, including the UK's Barclays, HSBC, and Royal Bank of Scotland, plus Deutsche Bank, Societe Generale, UBS and Nomura. As you'd expect, Avaloq takes security very seriously, especially protecting banks from cyber-attack. To help make its software as secure as possible, the company has a novel approach - it pays technology firms in Israel to attack it. Avaloq says it sees off thousands of cyber-attacks every year With a number of hi-tech Israeli companies at the forefront of protecting against hacking, Avaloq uses them to test its defences. Mr Fernandez says: ""The Israelis are very, very good, they [the young tech workers] are coming out of active military service, and they are brilliant. ""We regularly appoint them to attack our systems in a controlled way, and then with their help we try to make our systems bulletproof. ""We do our homework, security is a constant thing... we get thousands of attacks per year but so far, touch wood, we have never had an intrusion into our systems."" For a company that today enjoys annual revenues of more than $500m (Â£351m), Avaloq has come a long way since 1991 when Mr Fernandez led a $200,000 management buyout of the computer department of Swiss bank BZ Bank. At the time the department had just five members of staff, but Mr Fernandez had big ambitions. Avaloq's technology uses cloud computing He says he had long recognised that the software used by most banks across the world was both overly complicated and unstable, yet also too expensive. His idea was to produce a simpler but stronger universal software system that could be used by multiple banks. So with a small amount of money coming in from a single bank customer and some additional consulting work, Mr Fernandez and his team set to work on building their software system. It took them five years. ""Building a comprehensive banking system takes time,"" says Mr Fernandez. When the software was finally ready to be sold to banks, Avaloq found that the notoriously risk-averse Swiss banking sector was reluctant to take a chance on a start-up business that by then still had only 20 employees. The company is based in Zurich Mr Fernandez says that many people thought it would be a ""mission impossible"" for Avaloq to find a buyer for its new software, but then thanks to a contact he was able to showcase it to no less than Switzerland's central bank, the Swiss National Bank. The central bank was impressed enough to buy the software, which within six months saw five commercial Swiss banks follow suit. Overseas banks soon came on board too. Today Avaloq offers banks two services - the use of its software, or a more intensive service whereby it also takes over the running of a bank's computer system. Some 17% of banks (holding $700bn of funds) now opt for the latter, which uses cloud computing technology. The business remains owned by its staff Avaloq makes its money through continuing licence fees, and apart from a 10% stake held by a Swiss bank, the company is owned by its employees. Of its 2,500 members of staff, 500 are programmers. In addition to a main base in Zurich, it also has offices in Edinburgh and as far afield as Manila, the capital of the Philippines. Instead of staff getting individual bonus payments for hitting personal targets, all workers get a bonus if the company meets its annual objective, be that revenue growth or extended geographic reach. Mr Fernandez says his family background helped give him the will to achieve in life Antony Peyton, deputy editor of trade paper Banking Tech, tells the BBC: ""Avaloq's success can be attributed to chief executive Francisco Fernandez's astute leadership, and the Avaloq Banking Suite, its core software offering for private banks."" Mr Fernandez is the son of Spanish refugees who fled the dictatorship of General Franco and settled in the Swiss city of Lucerne before he was born. He says his background played a large part in his decision to take a risk and launch Avaloq. ""My parents were fugitives after the Spanish Civil War, and that culture, of leaving your country, and having the guts to come out of your comfort zone, is very much in my DNA. ""As a child we couldn't afford a car, TV or central heating, but growing up in Switzerland was a huge privilege, and I was able to attend ETH Zurich, one of the best [universities] in the world for computer science. ""I feel privileged to have the top job at Avaloq, but I don't take anything for granted.""

Bercow defends chop for clerks' wigs,"This video can not be played Speaker Bercow said it would make things 'less stuffy' John Bercow has defended the decision that Commons clerks will no longer have to wear wigs, after one MP likened the move to an ""executive order"". The Speaker announced the clerks, who advise him on conduct and constitutional issues, would also no longer wear wing collars and white tie. Conservative Sir Gerald Howarth said the tradition of wearing wigs went back ""several centuries"". But Mr Bercow said there was an even older tradition of not wearing wigs. He announced the changes on Monday, but added that clerks would keep part of their garb - black gowns, to signify they are experts on procedure and constitutional issues. Mr Bercow said changes to clothing and headgear represented the ""overwhelming view"" of clerks themselves. They would ""convey to the public a marginally less stuffy and forbidding image of this chamber at work"". But Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, raised a point of order, telling the Commons: ""I was surprised by [the] statement, which had the sort of appearance of an executive order."" He added that traditional clerks' dress was ""key to the dignity of the House"" and had been so ""for several centuries"", adding that MPs ""should discuss this"". Mr Bercow replied that it was ""a matter that can properly be decided by the Speaker"", adding that the House of Commons Commission had approved the changes, which clerks themselves had suggested. He said that, if one went back more than a ""couple of hundred years"", the situation was different from that presented by Sir Gerald, and that ""several centuries ago"", clerks ""did not wear wigs"". Mr Bercow has refrained from wearing a wig himself in the Commons since becoming Speaker in 2009, as did his predecessors Michael Martin and Betty Boothroyd.

Gun salutes for Queen's Sapphire Jubilee,"This video can not be played The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery fire a gun salute in Green Park A 41-gun salute has been fired in London's Green Park to mark the Queen's 65 years on the throne. Gun salutes also took place in Cardiff, Edinburgh and York. The Queen has become the first British monarch to reach a sapphire jubilee, after becoming theUK's longest-reigning monarchin 2015, aged 89. A portrait of the Queen by British photographer David Bailey has been reissued for the anniversary. In the photo, the Queen wears sapphire jewellery given to her by King George VI as a wedding gift in 1947. The portrait was among a series taken by Bailey in 2014, with one releasedfor the Queen's 88th birthday that year. The Queen has become the first British monarch to reach their Sapphire Jubilee In the portrait, the Queen, who is now 90, wears a necklace made of 16 large, oblong sapphires surrounded by diamonds, with a matching pair of drop earrings. Over the years, she has added to the gifts from her father with a tiara and a bracelet to complement the original jewellery. The world's longest-reigning monarchs It is tradition for the Queen to spend the Accession Day - as the anniversary of the day she became monarch is officially known - in private at her Sandringham Estate, in Norfolk, and return to Buckingham Palace a few days later. King Sobhuza II of Swaziland reigned for 82 years - the longest verifiable reign of any monarch in recorded history. He led Swaziland through independence until his death in 1982. King Bhumibol Adulyadej of Thailand had ruled for 70 years when he died last October. He began his reign aged just 18 years old. Franz Joseph I was Emperor of Austria and King of Hungary, Croatia and Bohemia for 67 years until his death in 1916. His nephew was Archduke Franz Ferdinand, who was assassinated in 1914. King Louis XIV of France reigned for 72 years before his death in 1715. He became king, aged four, after his father's death. Prime Minister Theresa May offered her congratulations, hailing the Queen as ""truly an inspiration to all of us"". The prime minister said: ""I know the nation will join with me today in celebrating and giving thanks for the lifetime of service Her Majesty the Queen has given to our country and to the Commonwealth."" Mrs May said it was ""a testament to her selfless devotion to the nation"" that the Queen had made clear she did not want official celebrations to mark the historic milestone. The monarch, pictured in 1953, leaving Westminster Abbey after the Coronation By Peter Hunt, BBC diplomatic and royal correspondent Longevity for a hereditary head of state has brought many milestones. She is Britain's longest reigning monarch, having overtaken her great great grandmother, Victoria, in 2015. Today, after 23,742 days on the throne, it's the start of the first sapphire jubilee in British history. For the Queen, it's a moment for contemplation rather than celebration - as it is also the anniversary of her father's death. In the coming months and years, she will, inevitably, do less and other royals will take on more - most notably Prince William, once he finishes his job as an air ambulance pilot in the summer. The 90-year-old working monarch has another significant moment on the horizon. In November, she and Prince Philip will mark 70 years of marriage. Read more from Peter Hunt here In London, royal gun salutes commemorated the occasion across the capital. A 41-gun salute was fired by the King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery in Green Park at midday and a 62-gun salute by the Honourable Artillery Company was fired at the Tower of London at 13:00 GMT. Larger-scale jubilee celebrations are expected to be reserved for the Platinum Jubilee in 2022, when the monarch will mark 70 years.

Voting data sheds light on referendum,"The BBC has obtained a more localised breakdown of votes from nearly half of the local authorities which counted EU referendum ballots last June. This information provides much greater depth and detail in explaining the pattern of how the UK voted. The key findings are: The data confirms previous indications that local results were strongly associated with the educational attainment of voters - populations with lower qualifications were significantly more likely to vote Leave. (The data for this analysis comes from one in nine wards) The level of education had a higher correlation with the voting pattern than any other major demographic measure from the census The age of voters was also important, with older electorates more likely to choose Leave Ethnicity was crucial in some places, with ethnic minority areas generally more likely to back Remain. However this varied, and in parts of London some Asian populations were more likely to support Leave The combination of education, age and ethnicity accounts for the large majority of the variation in votes between different places Across the country and in many council districts we can point out stark contrasts between localities which most favoured Leave or Remain There was a broad pattern in several urban areas of deprived, predominantly white, housing estates towards the urban periphery voting Leave, while inner cities with high numbers of ethnic minorities and/or students voted Remain Around 270 locations can be identified where the local outcome was in the opposite direction to the broader official counting area, including parts of Scotland which backed Leave and a Cornwall constituency which voted Remain Postal voters appear narrowly more likely to have backed Remain than those who voted in a polling station A statistical analysis of the data obtained for over a thousand individual local government wards confirms how the strength of the local Leave vote was strongly associated with lower educational qualifications. Wards where the population had fewer qualifications tended to have a higher Leave vote, as shown in the chart. If the proportion of the local electorate with a degree or similar qualification was one percentage point lower, then on average the leave vote was higher by nearly one percentage point. Using ward-level data means we can compare voting figures in this way to the local demographic information collected in the 2011 census. Of the main census statistics, this is the one with the greatest association with how people voted. In statistical terms the level of educational qualifications explains about two-thirds of the variation in the results between different wards. The correlation is strong, whether based on assessing graduate and equivalent qualifications or lower-level ones. This ward-by-ward analysis covers 1,070 individual wards in England and Wales whose boundaries had not changed since the 2011 census, about one in nine of the UK's wards. We had very little ward-level data from Scotland, and none from Northern Ireland. It should be noted, however, that many ward counts also included some postal votes from across the counting area, and therefore some variation between wards will have been masked by the random allocation of postal votes for counting. This makes the results less accurate geographically, but we can still use the information to explore broad national and local patterns. Adding age as a second factor significantly helps to further explain voting patterns. Older populations were more likely to vote Leave. Education and age combined account for nearly 80% of the voting variation between wards. Ethnicity is a smaller factor, but one which also contributed to the results. Adding that in means that now 83% of the variation in the vote between wards is explained. White populations were generally more pro-Leave, and ethnic minorities less so.  However, there were some interesting differences between London and elsewhere. The ethnic dimension is particularly interesting when examining the outliers on the graph that compares the Leave vote to levels of education. Some wards in Birmingham illustrate the pattern of ethnic minority populations being more likely to support Remain. There are numerous wards towards the bottom left of the graph where electorates with lower educational qualifications nevertheless produced low Leave and high Remain votes. This is where the link between low qualifications and Leave voting breaks down. It turns out that these exceptional wards have high ethnic minority populations, particularly inBirminghamand Haringey in north London. In contrast, there are virtually no dramatic outliers on the other side of the line, where comparatively highly educated populations voted Leave. Only one point on the graph stands out - this is Osterley and Spring Grove in Hounslow, west London, a mainly ethnic minority ward which had a Leave vote of 63%. While this figure does include some postal votes, they are not nearly enough to explain away this unusual outcome. In fact, in Ealing and Hounslow, west London boroughs with many voters of Asian origin, the ethnic correlation was in the other direction to the national picture: a higher number of Asian voters was associated with a higher Leave vote. This powerful link to educational attainment could stem from the lower qualified tending to feel less confident about their prospects and ability to compete for work in a competitive globalised economy with high levels of migration. On the other handsome commentators,externalsee it as primarily reflecting a ""culture war"" or ""values conflict"", rather than issues of economics and inequality. Research shows that non-graduates tend to take less liberal positions than graduates on a range of social issues from immigration and multi-culturalism to the death penalty. The former campaign director of Vote Leave, Dominic Cummings,argues,externalthat the better educated are more prone to holding irrational political opinions because they are more driven by fashion and a group mentality. Of course this assessment does not imply that Leave voters were almost all poorly educated and old, and Remain voters well educated and young. The Leave side obviously attracted support from many middle class professionals, graduates and younger people. Otherwise it couldn't have won. While there was undoubtedly a lot of voting which cut across these criteria, the point of this analysis is to explore how different social groups most probably voted - and it is clear that education, age and ethnicity were crucial influences. After these three key factors are taken into account, adding in further demographic measures from the census does little to increase the explanation of UK-wide voting patterns. However, this does not reflect the distinctively more pro-Remain voting in Scotland, since we are short of Scottish data at this geographical level. It is clear as well that in a few specific locations high student numbers were also very relevant. To a certain extent, using the level of educational qualifications as a measure combines both class and age factors, with working class and older adults both tending to be less well qualified. But the association between education and the voting results is stronger than the association between social or occupational class and the results. This is still true after taking the age of the local population into account. This suggests that voters with lower qualifications were more likely to back Leave than the better qualified, even when they were in the same social or occupational class. Brexit Live - updates including MPs debating bill EU referendum results in detail All you need to know about Brexit The existence of a significant connection between Leave voting and lower educational qualifications had already beensuggested,externalby analysis of the published referendum results from the official counting areas. The data we have obtained strengthens this conclusion, because voting patterns can now be compared to social statistics from the 2011 census at a much more detailed geographical level than by the earlier studies. The BBC analysis is also consistent with opinion polling (for example, fromLord Ashcroft,external,Ipsos Mori,externalandYouGov,external) that tried to identify the characteristics of Leave and Remain voters. The data we have collected can be used to illustrate the sort of places where the Leave and Remain camps did particularly well: it is hard to imagine a more glaring social contrast than that between the deprived, poorly educated housing estates of Brambles and Thorntree in Middlesbrough, and the privileged elite colleges of Market ward in central Cambridge. It is important to bear in mind, however, that most of the voting figures mentioned below also include some postal votes, so they should be treated as approximate rather than precise.  It is also important to note that the examples are limited to the places for which we were able to obtain localised information, which was only a minority of areas. The rest of the country may well contain even starker instances. Of the 1,283 individual wards for which we have data, the highest Leave vote was 82.5% in Brambles and Thorntree, a section of east Middlesbrough with many social problems. Ward boundaries have changed since the 2011 census, but in that survey the Thorntree part of the area had the lowest proportion of people with a degree or similar qualification of anywhere in England and Wales, at only 5%. Andaccording to Middlesbrough council,external, the figure for the current Brambles and Thorntree ward is even lower, at just 4%. Second highest was 80.3% in Waterlees Village, a poor locality within Wisbech, Cambridgeshire. This area has seen a major influx of East European migrants who have been doing low-paid work in nearby food processing factories and farms, with tensions between them and British residents. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Leave votes were congregated in Middlesbrough, Canvey Island in Essex, Skegness in coastal Lincolnshire, and Havering in east London. The highest Remain vote was 87.8% in Market ward in central Cambridge, an area with numerous colleges and a high student population, in a city which was strongly pro-Remain. This was followed by Ashley ward  (85.6%) in central Bristol, a district featuring ethnic diversity, gentrification and alternative culture. Next highest was Northumberland Park (85.0%) in Haringey, north London, which has a substantial black population. Other wards with available data which had the strongest Remain votes were generally located in Cambridge, Bristol and the multi-ethnic London boroughs of Haringey and Lambeth. The count for Ashburton in Croydon, south London, split 50-50 exactly, with both Leave and Remain getting 3,885 votes, but that did include some postal ballots. As for being nearest to the overall result, the combined count of Tulketh and University, neighbouring wards near the centre of Preston, was 51.92% for leave, very close to the UK wide figure of 51.89%. The individual ward of Barnwood in Gloucester had Leave at 51.94%. Both figures however contain some postal votes. Given that a few councils provided even more detailed data down to the level of polling districts, it is possible to identify some very small localities that were nicely representative of the national picture. The 527 voters in the neighbouring districts of Kirk Langley and Mackworth in Amber Valley in Derbyshire, whose two ballot boxes were counted together, produced a leave proportion of 51.99%. And this figure is not contaminated by any postal votes. So journalists (or anyone else for that matter) who seek a microcosm of the UK should perhaps visit theMundy Arms pub,externalin Mackworth, the location for that district's polling station. Similarly, the 427 voters in the combined neighbouring polling districts of Chiddingstone Hoath and Hever Four Elms to the south of Sevenoaks in Kent delivered a leave vote of 51.6% (again, without any postal votes). The data obtained points to 269 areas of various sizes (wards, clusters of wards or constituencies) which had a different Leave/Remain outcome compared to the official counting area of which they were part. This consists of 150 areas which backed Remain but were part of Leave-voting counting areas; and 119 in the other direction. The detailed information therefore gives us an understanding of how the electorate voted which is more variegated than the officially published results. Scotland voted to Remain - but some wards backed Leave, analysis shows Every one of Scotland's 32 counting areas came down on the Remain side. Yet, despite the fact that most Scottish councils did not give us much detailed information, we can nevertheless identify a few smaller parts of the country which actually backed Leave. A cluster of six wards in the Banff and Buchan area in north Aberdeenshire had a strong Leave majority of 61%. There is much local discontent within the fishing industry of this coastal district about the EU's common fisheries policy. An Taobh Siar agus Nis, a ward at the northern end of the Isle of Lewis in Na h-Eileanan an Iar (Western Isles), also voted Leave, if very narrowly. And at a smaller geographical level, in Shetland the 567 voters in the combined polling districts of Whalsay and South Unst had an extremely high Leave vote of 81%. The island of Whalsay is a fishing community, where EU rules have been controversial and in 2012numerous skippers were heavily fined for major breaches of fishing quotas,external. EalingandHounsloware neighbouring multi-ethnic boroughs in the west of London with large Asian populations, where - in contrast to the national picture - non-white ethnicity was associated with voting Leave, particularly in Ealing. Both boroughs shared a varied internal pattern of prosperous largely white areas voting strongly Remain, poorer largely white areas preferring Leave, and the Asian areas tending to be more evenly split. Ealingvoted 60% Remain, with Southfield ward hitting 76%, but in contrast the Southall wards which are over 90% ethnic minority were close to 50-50. InHounslowthe richer wards in Chiswick in the east of the area voted heavily Remain (73%), but the poorer largely white wards at the opposite western end in Feltham and Bedfont voted Leave (64-66%). Osterley and Spring Grove was also 63% Leave, the highest Leave vote in any individual ward in the UK with a non-white majority for which we have data. The south London borough ofBromleynarrowly voted Remain. Those parts which did not do so by a significant margin were the Cray Valley wards, largely poor white working class areas; and Biggin Hill and Darwin wards, locations to the south which contain more open countryside and lie outside the built-up commuter belt. InCroydonin south London, places which voted Leave by substantial amounts were New Addington and Fieldway, neighbouring wards with large council estates. Beyond the areas with the strongest backing for Leave and Remain, examining the detailed breakdown of votes in various places gives greater insight into the pattern of support for the two sides - as can be seen from the following examples. In several places (for example, Birmingham, Bristol, Nottingham, Portsmouth) there was a strong contrast between the Leave-voting populations of large, rundown, predominantly white, housing estates in the urban periphery, versus Remain-voting populations in inner city areas with large numbers of ethnic minorities and sometimes students. Birminghamhad several wards with large Remain votes, although the city as a whole narrowly voted Leave.  These pro-Remain wards tended to be the more highly educated, better off localities, or minority ethnic areas which strongly backed Remain despite low levels of educational qualifications. I have written about thisbefore. InBlackburn with Darwen, Bastwell ward had the highest Remain vote at 65%, compared to only 44% in the area as a whole. This ward has an ethnic minority proportion of over 90%. Other Blackburn wards which voted Remain were also ones with high minority populations. Bradfordvoted to Leave (54%), but the area included some starkly contrasting places which went over 60% Remain: the prosperous, genteel, spa town of Ilkley, and strongly ethnic minority wards in the city, such as Manningham and Toller. Bristolvoted strongly Remain on the whole (62%), but there were some striking exceptions, particularly the large, deprived, mainly white estates to the south of the city. Hartcliffe and Withywood backed Leave at 67%. Similar neighbouring wards (Hengrove and Whitchurch Park, Filwood, Bishopsworth and Stockwood) also voted Leave, as did the more industrial area of Avonmouth and Lawrence Weston to the north west of the city. As a countyCornwallvoted to Leave. But one of its six parliamentary constituencies, Truro and Falmouth, voted 53% to Remain, possibly linked to a significant student population. InLincoln, which voted 57% to Leave, Carholme ward stands out as very different - it voted 63% to Remain. This ward includes Lincoln University, and 43% of the residents are students Middlesbroughvoted 65% to Leave. As already noted, it had several wards with extremely high leave votes of over 75%. But one ward, Linthorpe, voted very narrowly to Remain - a comparatively well-to-do inner suburb which includes an art college; and another ward, Central, which contains Teesside University, nearly did. Mole Valleyin Surrey exhibited a dramatic contrast between two neighbouring districts with very different demographics and housing. The highest Remain vote was in the very prosperous location of Dorking South, which voted 63% Remain, but the neighbouring ward of Holmwoods, dominated by large estates on the edge of the town of Dorking, voted 57% Leave, the area's highest Leave vote. Nottinghamvoted narrowly to Leave, but the inner city ward of Radford and Park voted 68% Remain. This has both a comparatively high proportion of ethnic minorities and considerable numbers of students from two nearby universities. There was a lot of variation within the area. Bulwell - a market town to the north of the city with many social problems - voted 69% Leave There was also a high Leave vote in the housing estate locations of the Clifton wards in the south of Nottingham. Oldhamvoted to Leave at 61%, but Werneth, the city ward with the highest ethnic minority population, voted Remain (57%). Other wards with high minority populations also voted Remain. The central wards in Oxford had high Remain votes InOxfordthe cluster of polling districts which included Blackbird Leys and other deprived estates on the southern edge of the city voted to Leave at 51%. In contrast the central areas containing colleges, university buildings and student accommodation voted to Remain at over 80%. Plymouthvoted 60% Leave, but Drake ward which includes the university had the city's highest Remain vote at 56%. Portsmouthwas another place with wide variation. Paulsgrove ward, with its large estate on the edge of the city, had the highest Leave vote at 70%, whereas at the other end of the spectrum Central Southsea, an inner city ward and student area, voted 57% Remain. Rochdalevoted 60% Leave. The place which bucked this trend by voting 59% Remain, Milkstone and Deeplish, was the most predominantly ethnic minority ward. Central Rochdale had the second highest Remain vote and is the other ward that is mainly not white. Walsallvoted strongly Leave (68%). The only ward which voted Remain, Paddock, is both a comparatively prosperous and multi-ethnic locality. A few councils released their data at remarkably localised levels, down even to individual polling districts (ie ballot boxes) in the case of Blackburn with Darwen and Bracknell Forest, or clusters of two/three/four districts, in the case of Amber Valley, Brentwood, Sevenoaks, Shetland, South Oxfordshire, and Tewkesbury. This provides very local and specific data, in some cases just for neighbourhoods of hundreds of voters. At its most detailed this reveals that the 110 people who cast their votes in the ballot box at St. Alban's Primary School in central Blackburn split 56-52 in favour of Remain, with two spoilt papers. It also discloses stark contrasts in some neighbouring locations. The 953 people who voted at Little Harwood community centre in north Blackburn had a Leave vote of only 31%, while the 336 electors who voted in the neighbouring ballot box at Roe Lee Park primary school produced a Leave percentage over twice as high, at 64%. The very detailed data we obtained also provides some rare evidence on the views of postal compared to non-postal voters. Campaign strategists have often deliberated on whether the two groups vote differently and should be given separate targeted messages. Most places mixed boxes of postal and non-postal votes for counting, so generally it's not possible to draw comparative conclusions. However there were a few exceptions which recorded them separately, or included a very small number of non-postal votes with the postals. These figures indicate that postal voters were narrowly less likely to back Leave than voters in polling stations. Data covering five counting areas with about 260,000 votes shows that in these places the roughly one in five electors who voted by post backed Leave at 55.4%, one percentage point lower than the local non-postal support for Leave of 56.4%. The counting areas involved are Amber Valley, East Cambridgeshire, Gwynedd, Hyndburn and North Warwickshire. Since the referendum the BBC has been trying to get the most detailed, localised voting data we could from each of the counting areas.  This was a major data collection exercise carried out by my colleague George Greenwood. We managed to obtain voting figures broken down into smaller geographical units for 178 of the 399 referendum counting areas (380 councils in England, Wales and Scotland, with a separate tally in Gibraltar,external, while inNorthern Ireland,externalresults were issued for the 18 constituencies). This varied between data for individual local government wards, wards grouped into clusters, and constituency level data. In a few cases the results supplied were even more localised than ward level. Overall the extra data covers a wide range of different areas and kinds of councils across the UK. Electoral returning officers are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act, so releasing the information was up to the discretion of councils. While some were very willing, in other cases it required a lot of persistence and persuasion. Some councils could not supply any detailed data because they mixed all ballot boxes prior to counting; some did possess more local figures but simply refused to disclose them to us. Others did provide data, but the combinations in which ballot boxes were mixed before counting were too complex to fit ward boundaries neatly. A few places such asBirmingham,externalreleased their ward by ward data following the referendum on their own initiative, but in most cases the information had to be obtained by us requesting it directly, and sometimes repeatedly, from the authority.

Paris tries to seduce the City,"""When was the last time you thought of taking your partner for a nice weekend in Frankfurt?"". That was one of the more memorable lines of a heavy sales pitch from politicians and business leaders from Paris. A raiding party touched down in London this morning determined to cart off billions in business and tens of thousands of jobs to the French capital in the weeks and months ahead. Valerie Pecresse - President of the region including Paris and its environs, and a former budget minister under Nicolas Sarkozy - led the party, and told a group of senior finance executives from heavyweights such as Blackrock, Goldman Sachs and Credit Suisse why Paris was the natural choice for any business they moved out of London. To be fair to Mme Pecresse, the brochure she presented had more to it than Paris being trÃ¨s agrÃ©able. She described the competition for London business as fierce and came armed accordingly. A 28% top rate of income tax for expat executives for a period of eight years (recently extended from five). That compares to a top rate of 45% in the UK. Commercial rents one-third the price of London - with millions of square feet currently unoccupied. A deep pool of talent - a lot of which, she joked, is currently in London. Two international schools and a plan for two more near the business areas of Paris. Some companies in the City of London have already said staff may have to move abroad Four of the six biggest continental European banks are French and based in Paris. The brochure was glossy and the tone was friendly - apart from the odd sideswipe at arch rival Frankfurt. But there were two issues the political and business leaders from across La Manche struggled with. Bankers I spoke to afterwards said that one big turn off remains how difficult it is to fire people in France. That really matters for banks. As their staff are so well paid, when business slumps they need to reduce their biggest cost - people - quickly. Working in finance is profitable but it can be brutal. The other issue was politics. The delegation arrived on the same day as the man who thought he would be president, Francois Fillon, was fighting for his political life after paying his wife over half a million euros for work she may or may not have done. Economic nationalism, the political wind that many say secured Brexit and the Trump presidency, is packing a punch in France with Marine Le Pen promising French jobs for French workers. Tax breaks for rich expats and looser employment protection sit uneasily with those priorities. The future of the UK's relationship with the EU is maddeningly vague to most business leaders, but if it's political uncertainty you don't like - why would you ever pick France? Madame Pecresse and her entourage insisted that the political uncertainty would be gone after the elections on 7 May. She said she was convinced that whoever was in charge, ""HE""(sic) would be pro-business. The same folks who told us Donald Trump couldn't win and that Brexit would never happen agree with her. One member of the raiding party told us why the pundits were right about France. Jean-Louis Missika, the Deputy Mayor of Paris for economic development, told the BBC that ""because France has embraced globalisation with more care for our workers, the backlash will be less severe"". The Parisian ambition is to tempt 10,000 direct employees and further 20,000 indirect employees to Paris. When bankers move, they tend to take law, accounting, office management, sandwich making and dry cleaning jobs with them. Those are pretty modest ambitions when you consider over a million people work in financial services in the UK - a third of them in London. Modest, but perhaps realistic. The good news for Paris is that they are already 10% of the way there. HSBC has already said it will move 1,000 jobs to Paris. It seems unlikely they will be the only newcomers to succumb to its charms.

Richard Westcott: Could Southern's drivers reject the deal?,"Some of Southern's drivers say they are not happy with the deal ""It's two weeks of my life I'll never get back. But we finally got there."" Bizarrely, the bosses of both sides said exactly the same thing to me when I interviewed them last week, moments after they'dannounced a dealto resolve the worst of the Southern rail strikes. Mick Whelan from Aslef and Nick Brown from GTR (Southern's parent company) looked shattered but pleased with their agreement. But was everyone cracking the champagne corks too soon? Aslef's 1,000 or so drivers still need to vote on the deal and there are possible signs that they might just kick it out. Union blasts Southern deal as 'betrayal' Driver union reaches Southern rail deal I spoke to a couple of Southern's train drivers over the weekend and they were not happy. One wrote this to me: ""GTR, 'We will agree to carry on doing exactly what we want.' Aslef, 'OK, we'll agree to that then.'"" Strikes on the Southern network caused chaos for passengers He went on: ""I'm very much of the opinion it will be a resounding 'no' vote (when members vote). The feeling is the union has sold us out."" Another driver also said that everyone he'd spoken to will vote no to the deal, again saying that they felt let down and that the company had got away with it. He even suggested that some of his colleagues might leave Aslef and join the RMT union instead. The RMT is still in dispute with Southern over the same issue and was vitriolic about the deal over the weekend. True, this is just the opinion of two drivers who've been chatting to their colleagues. But it suggests some anger at what they are being asked to sign up to. I understand that there is going to be a meeting in Brighton on Tuesday, where Aslef reps will try to sell the deal to members. It's bound to be frosty. Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan says the deal was discussed in ""good faith"" All of this doesn't necessarily mean that Aslef's drivers will vote against the agreement. When I interviewed Mick Whelan last week he told me: ""I'm not in the habit of making deals that my members don't like."" Then there are the London members who already use driver-only-operated trains and may not feel as strongly over this crunch issue. Plus, Aslef doesn't pay members during industrial action, and the double whammy of losing strike-day pay plus overtime may be enough to cut their appetite for a fight. If the drivers do vote against the deal though, it's hard to see where the next breakthrough in this dispute might come. If two weeks of ""incredibly intense"" negotiation at the TUC can't solve it, what can? If Aslef drivers vote no to the deal, could more strikes lie ahead? Presumably, Aslef would be forced to call more crippling strikes, which would also turn up the heat on the government to take over either part or all of this troublesome, complex behemoth of a franchise. I can tell you, ministers are not keen to seize control. Meanwhile, the RMT union, which represents the guards/conductors, has vowed to keep fighting. Their strikes don't have the same impact as Aslef's, with the last one only knocking out around 30% of services. But even that might change if their angry Aslef colleagues decide not to cross picket lines. Anyway, we should know all on 16 February when the ballot result comes back. The worst may not be over for beleaguered Southern passengers.

Lady Gaga dives into Super Bowl history,"The star performed aerial stunts throughout the first half of her set She jumped off the roof of Houston's NRG stadium and bathed in the light of hundreds of drones - but Lady Gaga's Super Bowl show was fairly restrained... by her standards. The star only changed costume twice, letting her music do the talking in a 12-minute, hit-laden set. She opened with Woody Guthrie's civil rights anthem This Land Is Your Land, a gentle but pointed rebuke to the Trump administration; which she reinforced by performing Born This Way - her hymn to acceptance and inclusion. ""No matter black, white or beige... I was born to be brave,"" she sang to an expected US TV audience of 110 million. But Gaga refrained from overt sermonising, simply saying: ""We're here to make you feel good"" (and, later on, ""hello mum""). Gaga's vocals were impeccable throughout the show She only performed one song from her current album, Joanne Ahead of the Super Bowl, the star said her show would be ""inclusive"" and celebrate ""the spirit of equality"". Sponsors Pepsi simply said it would be ""uniquely Gaga,external"". And, while she didn't hatch from an egg (as at the 2011 Grammy Awards) or smear herself in blood (2009's Monster Ball tour), it was certainly spectacular. Surprising moments from previous Super Bowl half-time shows New England Patriots win: Highlights and match report Rookie's guide to American Football Lady Gaga on BBC Music Gaga first appeared 79 metres above the crowd, as a swarm of drones hovered behind her; twinkling in the sky before adopting the colours of the stars and stripes during Woody Guthrie's left-wing anthem. ""One nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all,"" said the star, quoting the pledge of allegiance, then promptly performed a swan-dive from the roof, landing on a towering, torch-like structure several storeys below. There, she launched into a dizzying medley of hit singles including Poker Face, Just Dance and Telephone, backed by an army of dancers. Her vocals were strong and resonant throughout - although the intricate choreography left her out of breath for the set's sole ballad, Million Reasons. The show had taken months to plan Lady Gaga ties with Katy Perry as the youngest female artist to headline the half-time show: Both were 30 when they performed Stage hands had just seven minutes to construct the elaborate set Fans who flooded the pitch were given torches that flashed in time to the music, spelling out lyrics and making elaborate, co-ordinated patterns. BBC Sport presenter Mark Chapman revealed that the entire stadium - including his commentary booth and the public toilets - had been plunged into darkness to make the visuals work on television. Gaga ended the set with Bad Romance, backed by 40 dancers, dressed in blinding white costumes inspired by American Football uniforms. Finishing the show atop a staircase, Gaga shouted ""Super Bowl 51,"" dropped her microphone and jumped into the crowd holding a glittery silver football. ""This is for you Monsters,"" the star tweeted to her fanbase. ""I love you."" Gaga was backed by 40 dancers for Bad Romance Gaga posed on the field during the build-up to the clash between the Patriots and the Falcons She also found time to take a selfie from the centre of the stadium The last time the Super Bowl was held in Houston the half time performer was Janet Jackson, whose infamous ""wardrobe malfunction,external"" made the NFL wary of hiring young, edgy pop stars for several years. Gaga posed no such problems, taming her worst excesses to deliver a streamlined, spectacular show that reminded many fans why they love her. And while her performance lacked the political punch of Beyonce last year; or even a gif-able meme like Katy Perry's ""left shark"", there wasn't a single mis-step or misfiring moment. The star was invited to play the half time show after singing the National Anthem at the 50th Super Bowl in California last year. She said she had studied the greats (name-checking Michael Jackson, Diana Ross and Bruce Springsteen) before beginning work on her show in September. ""I want every guy's girlfriend in his arms; I want every husband and wife kissing; every kid laughing,"" she told Radio Disney last year. ""In my mind they're having this really powerful family experience watching the Super Bowl."" According to CNN, the drone light show required special permission from the Federal Aviation Authority - which had established a 34.5-mile-radius ""no-drone zone"" around the stadium during the game for safety and security reasons.

Bercow: Commons clerks' wigs get chop,"This video can not be played Speaker Bercow said it would make things 'less stuffy' John Bercow has defended the decision that Commons clerks will no longer have to wear wigs, after one MP likened the move to an ""executive order"". The Speaker announced the clerks, who advise him on conduct and constitutional issues, would also no longer wear wing collars and white tie. Conservative Sir Gerald Howarth said the tradition of wearing wigs went back ""several centuries"". But Mr Bercow said there was an even older tradition of not wearing wigs. He announced the changes on Monday, but added that clerks would keep part of their garb - black gowns, to signify they are experts on procedure and constitutional issues. Mr Bercow said changes to clothing and headgear represented the ""overwhelming view"" of clerks themselves. They would ""convey to the public a marginally less stuffy and forbidding image of this chamber at work"". But Sir Gerald, MP for Aldershot, raised a point of order, telling the Commons: ""I was surprised by [the] statement, which had the sort of appearance of an executive order."" He added that traditional clerks' dress was ""key to the dignity of the House"" and had been so ""for several centuries"", adding that MPs ""should discuss this"". Mr Bercow replied that it was ""a matter that can properly be decided by the Speaker"", adding that the House of Commons Commission had approved the changes, which clerks themselves had suggested. He said that, if one went back more than a ""couple of hundred years"", the situation was different from that presented by Sir Gerald, and that ""several centuries ago"", clerks ""did not wear wigs"". Mr Bercow has refrained from wearing a wig himself in the Commons since becoming Speaker in 2009, as did his predecessors Michael Martin and Betty Boothroyd.

Do 'longest flight' records matter?,"Qatar's Boeing 777-200LR is welcomed with a water cannon shower on Monday in Auckland Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current non-stop commercial route, after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland. Flight QR920 landed on Monday after 16 hours and 23 minutes, slightly quicker than expected. The Boeing 777-200LR jet was showered with water cannons on arrival - a tradition for airlines on new routes. Carriers like to talk up these records, but how are they measured and do they really matter? Longest (time) or furthest (distance) are the two key distinctions to make, but it's not as simple as it might sound. Qatar Airways flight between Doha and Auckland had four pilots, 15 cabin crew, and catered for 2,000 cold drinks to be served The distance between two cities doesn't vary for airlines of course, but they might choose to take alternative routes. For example, a carrier might choose to avoid flying over certain countries which can alter how far a plane flies from point A to point B. And airlines have been known to take unconventional routes. In October last year, Air India flew Delhi to San Francisco by crossing the Pacific rather than the Atlantic - a direction switch which added an extra 1,400km to the journey, making the 15,127km trip the longest ever non-stop flight by distance. By comparison, Qatar's new route is 14,535km. But regardless of the route, flight time is dependent on headwinds or tailwinds. For example, Qatar's return leg from Auckland to Doha is expected to take about 18 hours because of headwinds. And though Air India went the ""long way round"", favourable tailwinds meant the journey took about two-and-a-half hours less than its conventional route. ""The longest flying time doesn't always correspond with the longest distance,"" says Ellis Taylor of Flightglobal. ""Of course, from a passenger perspective, the flying time is probably the best measurement."" Record-breaking flights may make headlines. But new long-haul flights mean nothing if they're treated as a standalone route, says Mr Taylor. Rather, it's what a new route brings to the airline's existing network. Australia's Qantas flies some of the world's longest routes ""On its own, it wouldn't be viable to fly between Auckland and Doha, but Qatar is focusing on the passengers from Auckland going on to Europe, Africa, the US or elsewhere,"" says Mr Taylor. ""In that light, even though it may take some time for the route to stack up from a profit perspective, it may help the economics of its wider network."" Historically, most of the major long-haul routes have been serviced by legacy airlines like Singapore Airlines and Australia's Qantas. But adding new routes have allowed newer airlines like Qatar, and perhaps most notably Emirates, to expand their business very rapidly. ""It's also about reach for Middle East airlines striving to outdo each other,"" says Geoffrey Thomas of Airlineratings.com. Longest flight records will continue to change hands as airlines launch new routes, and the range capability of aircraft improves. Last year, for example, Qantas revealed itwould fly direct between Perth and Londonfrom March 2018, a flight that will take 17 hours. Qatar Airways tweeted the arrival of their long-haul flight, which landed slightly ahead of schedule The price of fuel and the types of planes which airlines buy will be the determining factors in opening new routes ""With the arrival of the 777-8X in 2022, new records such as flights from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London will be set,"" says Mr Thomas. ""The 777-8X will be the ultimate long haul airliner."" But remember, for routes to be viable, they also require people to buy tickets. That depends on passengers being willing to sit in their seats for 16, 17 or maybe 18 hours at a time. How long that desire will last (especially for travellers cramped up in economy) is something airlines will monitor carefully.

What happens when US president and courts collide?,"Protesters raised questions at a rally outside the Supreme Court - where the case may end up Donald Trump says he is defending the United States from terrorism - but a ""so-called judge"" is ""making the job very difficult"". But the judge - in halting the president's controversial executive order on immigration - said he was making sure President Trump's actions follow the law. That sets two theoretically equal branches of the government against one another - and could bring about a crisis. The separation of powers is crucial to understanding how the US is governed. The country's constitution established its treasured system of checks and balances - where the different branches of government hold equal authority and offset one another. The federal government's power is split into three distinct parts - theexecutivebranch, which includes the president and his cabinet; thelegislativebranch, Congress, which makes the laws; and thejudiciary. This works well most of the time, with each branch co-operating with the next. But with the president in open conflict with another branch, there are fears that an impasse could be reached. That could lead to a constitutional crisis - a scenario in which the situation cannot be resolved - particularly after Mr Trumpseemed to openly question the judge's authority,external. ""The President's hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous,"" Democratic Senator Patrick Leahy, from the Senate judiciary committee,said,external. ""He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis."" There are about 700 federal district judges in the US - the type facing down the president's order. Unlike state court judges, these men and women are part of the federal court system - along with the Supreme Court and the Courts of Appeals. Day to day, it's the 94 District Courts which deal with interpretation of US laws, treaties, and public officials - powers devolved to them from the Supreme Court. But the courts do not offer opinions on government policy unless they are asked - they only interpret law when a case is brought before them. The other two branches of governmentmakeandenforcethe laws, and the judicial branch interprets the laws when there is adispute. That is the issue here - a presidential executive order has all the force of law, and is subject to the same checks. Is Trump's immigration order legal? Trump border policy: Who's affected? What if Trump tries to bring back torture? Those judicial powers have been used many times before. Barack Obama faced stumbling blocks in 2015when he attempted to use an executive order to grant a reprieve to undocumented immigrants, and George W Bushfaced similar battles,externalover detainees in Guantanamo Bay. It is true that district judges are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. Judge James Robart, for example - the ""so-called judge"" of Mr Trump's Twitter criticism - was appointed by President George W Bush and confirmed in 2004. But Mr Trump can't fire judges. That's because the founding fathers of the United States created a system to protect the judiciary from interference. Mr Trump's executive powers have defined limits Only Congress can remove a federal judge from office through impeachment, which involves both the House and Senate. It is the same system used to remove a president. This ""article three"" protection is, in practical terms, very rigid. Only eight judges have been convicted in an impeachment trial in the entire history of the United States. The end result is that federal judges usually serve until they choose to retire - or until death. In effect, two of the country's three branches of government are in conflict - and neither can remove the other. Inside the mind of Donald Trump Which executive actions will have the most impact? Tech world caught between Trump and a liberal place The Supreme Court, as the name implies, has ultimate power in the judiciary - the other courts are inferior to it. In this case, the government could have taken its appeal against the district rulings straight to the Supreme Court - and may still do so. Just as with the other federal courts, though, the Supreme Court is protected from interference. But there are currently only eight judges on the Supreme Court. Four were appointed by a Democrat, and four by a Republican - with one vacant seat waiting to be filled by Mr Trump's nominee, which could swing the balance of power. Congress could break any deadlock that crops up between the president and the judiciary by creating a law that overturns his decision - or even impeaching a president or judge. Since Mr Trump's Republican party holds a majority there, action against the president seems unlikely. And the independence of the courts is so essential to the US way of governing, that moving to attack judges on behalf of the president would be a drastic step. Nonetheless, with two of the three powers in conflict, the decision may fall to Congress eventually - unless Mr Trump modifies his order. That may be the most prudent move, in keeping with his predecessors who have often backed off in the face of judicial opposition. For now, though, Mr Trump ""just cannot believe a judge would put our country in such peril,external"" - and shows no signs of changing his mind. Is Trump's immigration order legal?

Trump week two - hectic pace continues,"The second week of the Trump Administration was dominated by the fallout from his order on immigration President Trump's first week in office was widely regarded as a whirlwind. His second week has been no less hectic. Despite the mass protests of week one andfalling approval ratings,external, the administration appears to be doubling down on its pledge to shake up the Washington playbook. In a divided America, many people are repelled by the agenda and tone of this administration, while many others are pleased that their president is taking a bold stand and getting things done. Here are five key things from week two in Trumpland. On Friday, a week after his inauguration, President Trump issued an executive order suspending all refugee admissions for 120 days, banning Syrian refugees indefinitely and suspending arrivals from seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. The immediacy of the announcement, which Mr Trump said was necessary to not allow any lag time for ""bad dudes"" to sneak in, caused widespread confusion at airports around the world. Families were separated, and even Green Card holders from the affected countries were initially included in the ban. An Iraqi who put his life at risk as an interpreter for the US army was among hundreds of people detained at airports. Around the world, travellers were prevented from boarding planes, and in some cases, were pulled off flights. Vetted refugees waiting to travel to the US despaired. An Iran-born BBC reporter with British citizenshipwas among those temporarily detained. Demonstrators flocked to airports in protest, with many lawyers offering their services for free and filing emergency motions to have people released. Mr Trump said the restrictions were required so new security measures could be put in place to protect America from possible terrorist attacks. Things were working out ""very nicely"", he said. This video can not be played President Trump: ""A very good day"" Steve Gruber, a popular talk-show host in Michigan, summed up the mood among many Trump voters. Listeners,he said, ""are encouraged that a politician, albeit a new one, is actually doing the things he said he would do"". This video can not be played Protesters gather at Dulles airport: ""Welcome to the USA!"" Several courts moved to block parts of the order being implemented, but reports said that border officers in some places were not complying with the rulings. As condemnation grew, including from a few top Republicans,many foreign governmentsandmajor US companies, the White House insisted it was not a Muslim ban, pointing to the many Muslim-majority countries not involved. Thousands join protests across UK But former New York mayor Rudy Giuliani undermined that claim,admitting to Fox News,externalthat Mr Trump had previously asked him how to legally implement a ban on Muslims. He said, however, that the ban implemented was based on ""danger"", not religion. Sean Spicer, the White House's combative press secretary, blasted journalists for reporting it as a travel ""ban"", even though his boss used that very wording on Twitter. Meanwhile, the world tried to figure out the unique language on displayat protests in Scotland. The immigration order's fallout dominated headlines for most of this week. ""This has proven to be an embarrassing episode in what looks like a not-ready-for-primetime White House,"" our correspondent Anthony Zurcher wrote. Amateur hour at the White House? But President Trump's supporters think he's doing a great job. This video can not be played Trump voters say US president is 'doing a fabulous job' The former reality TV star now in the White House was this week finally given a chance to fire someone. In the middle of the furore over the immigration ban, acting attorney general Sally Yates ordered justice department lawyers not to enforce President Trump's executive order. Within hours, she was dismissed and accused by President Trump of ""betraying"" her department and being ""weak on borders"". Sally Yates refused to enforce Donald Trump's controversial travel ban Some observers and journalists asked whether the dismissal would have a chilling effect across government. But the White House said justice department lawyers had deemed the order legal and thus Ms Yates was not fulfilling her duty. This video can not be played White House spokesman Sean Spicer spars with journalists over attorney general sacking The move came on the heels of other comments from the administration suggesting that dissent from officials would not be tolerated. As news spread on Monday thathundreds of US diplomats around the worldwere planning to use a ""dissent channel"" to argue that the immigration restrictions would not make the US safer, Sean Spicer said ""they should either get with the programme or they can go"". That seemed like a pretty direct message to US government employees with independent views. On Tuesday evening at a White House ceremony, Donald Trump unveiled his pick to fill the vacant seat on the Supreme Court - Judge Neil Gorsuch, of Colorado. The Democrats, whom the administration has chastised for seeking to stymie them at every opportunity, have hinted they will use all means at their disposal to block his confirmation in the Senate. The Supreme Court has the final say on such divisive issues such as abortion, gun control and gay rights. Since Judge Antonin Scalia died a year ago, the court has been split equally between liberal and conservative justices, at four each. This video can not be played Donald Trump picks Neil Gorsuch as US Supreme Court nominee Whoever holds the ninth seat is thus pretty significant, though justices don't always split on clear ideological lines. Barack Obama tried to replace Mr Scalia with a nominee of his choice, but the Republicans didn't allow it given an election was forthcoming. Like the late Mr Scalia, the Ivy-League educated Mr Gorsuch is known to support textualism, or the interpretation of law according to its plain text. He also maintains a strict interpretation of the US Constitution, or how it was originally understood by the Founding Fathers. Who is Neil Gorsuch? Why is the US Supreme Court so important? House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi called the nominee ""a very hostile appointment"" and ""a very bad decision, well outside the mainstream of American legal thought"". And of course, there were more protests. This video can not be played Labor union leader Mary Kay Henry: ""This judge is a step backwards"" Stephen Bannon, Donald Trump's chief strategist, is a man who many people believe is behind much of what has come out of the White House in the past two weeks. The former executive chairman of populist, conservative news website Breitbart has been described as a ""rumpled right-wing agitator"" by the New York Times. On Saturday night, he wasgiven a seaton the National Security Council's inner circle, or principals' committee. Under the restructuring, the Joint Chiefs and director of national intelligence have been told only to attend when discussions pertain to their areas. The move shocked many Washington veterans. ""It's completely unprecedented to have a political adviser as a member of that group,"" Eliot Cohen, director of the Strategic Studies Program at the Johns Hopkins University School of Advanced International Studies,told the BBC. Stephen Bannon has President's Trump ear Mr Bannon has a ""destructive"" world view and has accumulated an ""unhealthy"" level of power, he said, describing it as an ""ominous"" move. What exactly is his destructive world view? Well,according to the Daily Beast,external, in 2013 Bannon said he wanted ""to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today's establishment"". The White House tried to brush the changes off, pointing to the fact that Obama adviser David Axelrodhad been included in some council meetings,external. Mr Bannon jokingly referred to himself as ""Darth Vader"" ina recent interview,externalwhere he described US media as ""the opposition party"". Steve Bannon will now sit at a table where issues pertaining to US national security, and thus global stability, are discussed at a very, very senior level. President Trump was said to have described the call with Mr Turnbull as ""the worst"" Refugees are very much on President Trump's radar at the moment and it is well known that he likes to talk about deals. But a phone call on the subject on Saturday between the US president and the Australian PM, which was scheduled to last for an hour, was cut short from the White House after just 25 minutes. President Trump said the conversation with Malcolm Turnbull, in which they discussed a refugee resettlement deal between the two nations, was not a favourite among calls he had taken with world leaders. In fact, theWashington Post reported,externalthat Mr Trump described the conversation as ""the worst by far"". He appeared to be somewhat irritated by the subject matter - adeal struck with the Obama administrationwhich would see up to 1,250 asylum seekers to Australia resettled in the US. What next? President Trump was so worked up after discussing ""the worst deal ever"" that he decided to issue a statement in his preferred manner - via Twitter. Mr Trump tweeted that he would ""study this dumb deal"". Mr Trump's tweet wrongly referenced ""thousands of illegal immigrants"" - only 1,250 migrants would be accepted by the US, legally Later, Mr Spicer gave an official version of his boss's 25-minute call with Mr Turnbull. He said that both leaders had ""emphasised the enduring strength and closeness of the US-Australia relationship"". Mr Turnbull later thanked President Trump for agreeing to uphold the deal.

NHS tourists crackdown 'to save Â£500m',"TheDaily Express is one of many papers to seize on the news that the government is to tighten the rules to prevent ""health tourism"",externalin England. The paper says the move to make foreign nationals pay in advance for non-urgent care is ""long overdue"", and will cut what it calls the ""widespread abuse"" of the system. The plan iswelcomed by the Daily Mail as a ""major crackdown"",external. Meanwhile,the Times says the move comes after a week in which NHS bosses faced criticism,externalthat their attempts to combat health tourism were ""chaotic"". But Labour's Meg Hillier, who chairs the public accounts committee, says she does not think mandating hospitals to take patients' money is the answer to the problem. TheDaily Telegraph,externalleads with a different NHS story - saying one in six A&E departments in England could be facing closure. The paper says the changes are being considered despite record overcrowding, and quotes senior doctors as calling them ""crazy"", although health officials say care will also be improved, and moved closer to people's homes. The paper describes the plan as ""a potent example of the death spiral gripping the NHS"" - greater demand leads to cuts, which make the situation worse. Its editorial suggests there is a clear logic to recouping money from overseas patients - but it calls for a more fundamental overhaul. President Trump's latest volley of tweets is said by the i to have ""shattered another political taboo"".,external His attack on a ""so-called"" judge who suspended his travel ban is certainly in character, says the paper, ""but this is the judiciary... Presidents aren't supposed to attack judges"". There is a similar warning in the Guardian,external, which says the president is ""fishing in dangerous waters"" by questioning the legitimacy of a court. ""If this continues,"" it says, ""the United States would be taking a step into the unknown."" TheDaily Telegraph finds voters in west Kansas fully supportive,externalof Mr Trump's policies. ""Foreigners are coming in, getting bigger in the areas they're in, and their goal is to kill us,"" says one. TheDaily Mail leads with what it calls the ""downsizing revolution"",external, which it expects in a government White Paper on housing in England this week. It says pensioners with large family homes will be given incentives to sell and move to smaller properties. Studies suggest more than 2.5m family homes could be made available if older owners downsized but the paper quotes Whitehall officials stressing there is no intention to put pressure on people to sell up. TheTimes says the government's proposals will be the biggest shake-up of housing policy in two generations,,externalwhile theGuardian expects measures to boost transparency on land ownership.,external Finally,the Sun thinks that the special relationship between Donald Trump and Theresa May is bearing fruit,external- over the issue of vegetables. It says British shopkeepers have turned to the Americans to solve the ""Great Lettuce Shortage"" which has been caused by bad weather in Europe. It says that is one in the eye for those who warned about Britain going to the back of the queue - though the paper also notes that iceberg lettuces flown in from California and Arizona are selling for three times the price of those from Spain. TheDaily Telegraph warns that the shortage could soon spread to carrots, parsnips,externaland other vegetables because of a cold snap which might see temperatures plummet to -15C. On the bright side, one expert says slower growth increases the sugar level, so the vegetables you do get are likely to be sweeter.

Paedophile 'ring'?,"YouTuber Reallygraceful is one of the amateur investigators flagging up sexually explicit comments on YouTube The allegations are shocking - a paedophile ring openly operating on YouTube. But the reality, as BBC Trending found, is much more complicated. The rumours first started to surface a few weeks ago on Reddit and other message boards. Several users claimed to have found evidence of a group of paedophiles exchanging explicit material via YouTube. It wasn't long before the claims reached the radar of several video bloggers. One, who goes by the name Reallygraceful, was visibly upset in a post she made on the subject. ""A paedophile ring exists on YouTube,"" she says. ""And instead of everybody sitting on their keyboards and doing nothingâ¦ let's actually do something about it."" Reallygraceful has about 30,000 followers on her channel, and other YouTube personalities, some with much larger followings, joined in the hunt. The allegations centred on a number of videos whose titles began ""Webcam video fromâ¦"", usually followed by a date. The videos, according to several who've seen them, do show young children - but they are not sexual in nature. The children are often emulating their favourite YouTubers, dancing, miming makeup tutorials, or doing nothing much at all. What has alarmed users are the comments beneath the videos, which are often very explicit. The videos are usually self-shot and the pages usually contain very little associated description other than the title. Many were posted years ago. Visit theTrending Facebook page,external So who posted them and why? And, as is being claimed by the vloggers, is there any evidence of a larger paedophile network behind them? The first clue is the titles. ""Webcam video fromâ¦"" is a default title used by some webcam manufacturers and indicates that the person who uploaded them didn't bother to change the title or didn't really realise what they were doing. One YouTuber who has looked into the claims and studied the videos says all indications point to the conclusion that the clips were unwittingly uploaded by the children themselves, who may or may not be aware of the explicit comments underneath. The amateur investigator, who goes by the name Reign Bot, runs a YouTube channel devoted to debunking rumours and investigating the dark corners of the internet. She says some of the claims made by other YouTubers have been overblown and that the description of a ""ring"" is not strictly accurate. ""People weren't claiming there were some shady individuals, but an entire ring of people working together to take advantage of children,"" she says. ""They were using 'paedophile ring' as more of a headline or buzz word in this case. ""Yes, such things do exist in the world, but this situation does not actually fit that criteria,"" she says. Hear the full storyon the BBC World Service Reign Bot says that the comments posted were disgusting and should be deleted, but says that some amateur investigators, who posted on YouTube, Reddit and elsewhere, jumped to conclusions about vast networks which were unsupported by evidence. ""I can see where these people are coming from, but the hysteria generated by this whole thing did nothing for their cause, and also fuelled misinformation."" Although the videos recently garnered attention, the fact that particular search terms could easily bring up videos of children has been the subject of a variety of comments on the extreme free speech message board 4chan for several years. One archived 4chan discussion makes references to child pornography and ""webcam video"" searches. Other posts on the site attacked those who were searching for such videos Reallygraceful and some of the other internet users hunting the video commentators were also promoters of the""Pizzagate"" conspiracy theory- an invented allegation that a paedophile ring which included Democratic Party officials was centred on a Washington pizza restaurant. Those discredited rumours began life as a politically motivated plot by Donald Trump supporters on 4chan, Reddit and other message boards. They culminated in an armed man travelling to the Washington DC pizza restaurant that was the target of the rumours andfiring shots as diners fled. The ""pizzagate"" rumours spiralled out of control as users of social networks projected hidden paedophile ""signals"" onto publicly available photos and other material. By contrast the YouTubers looking at these clips of children found actual examples of explicit messages, if no actual images of abuse. In an email exchange with BBC Trending, Reallygraceful - Grace Elizabeth is her real name - says she saw a disturbing degree of intent by those viewing and commenting on the videos. In some cases, she says, the videos had been copied to different accounts and put on lists of similar clips. ""These videos were time-stamped in the description to reflect what points of the video a child's underwear was showing or their bare chests were exposed,"" she says. Elizabeth also examined profiles of those commenting and aggregating the videos, which led to links to pro-paedophilia organisations. She walked back from comments in her original YouTube post linking the videos to ""pizzagate,"" but linked the YouTube videos to other child sexual assault allegations. ""Many individuals are awakening to the reality that's been hiding in plain sight,"" she says. Since the rumours began to get mainstream attention, many of the ""webcam video fromâ¦"" videos and comments have been taken down, presumably by YouTube itself, a move that Elizabeth called ""fantastic,"" although she urged the network to do more. How can I keep my kids safe online? - from BBC iWonder Keeping children safe online - from Cbeebies NSPCC Share Aware,external UK Council for Child Internet Safety: information from gov.uk,external YouTube did not directly answer questions about the videos, but in a statement said it has a zero-tolerance policy for sexual content involving minors, and that anything that sexualises children, including comments, will result in an account shutdown. But like on other social networks, the amount of material available on YouTube is so vast that the Google subsidiary relies on users to flag illegal or inappropriate content. ""People have made this whole situation about banning content on YouTube, but I think the actual message here goes out to the individuals uploading the content,"" says Reign Bot, the internet investigator. ""This should be a lesson to parents to monitor what their kids do online."" That sentiment was backed up by the UK National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which has a website calledShare Aware,externaloffering advice on children and use of the internet and social media. ""Parents can help by having regular conversations with their child about using privacy settings so that they decide who sees their posts and don't end up in a situation where they feel out of control,"" a spokesperson said. ""Sadly, there are some people who will mine the web for videos of young people and exploit it for their own devious uses.""

Market value,"This video can not be played BBC News visits Kirkgate Market in Leeds British markets are seen as a microcosm of the city or town in which they are based, encapsulating the diversity of communities and skills a place has to offer. But with some being sold off due to their prime locations and others fighting for their existence amid the rise of discount supermarkets and online retailers, will generations to come be able to enjoy them? Kirkgate Market has been selling food and goods to the people of Leeds for more than 150 years. The winner of ""Britain's Favourite Market"" for the second year in a row, the cavernous hall at the south of the city centre remains popular. But it is not immune to the need to adapt to changing trends. Among the 170 stall-holders, optimism for the future is mixed with serious concern about dropping footfall and the rising costs of renting floor space. Near an entrance to the 1904 hall, with its glass roof and cast-iron balcony, sits North African and Middle Eastern food vendor Cafe Moor. Owner Kada Bendaha set up his stand after a life-changing breakfast in the bustle of London's Borough Market and its speciality food stands. ""The beauty of a market is you have that one-to-one contact, you build that relationship with your fishmonger or butcher,"" he said. ""If you go to the fish section, there's a gentleman there who has been there for 38 years, you go and ask him about a particular fish, he knows the business inside out. ""Go to a supermarket and you will have a student who is just working part time there, it's not the same."" Dating back to 1857, Kirkgate has become one of the largest indoor markets in Europe, selling fish, meat, fruit and vegetables, clothes, jewellery, haberdashery, flowers and hardware. The booming voice of a butcher offering the day's best prices still echoes down its walkways, although e-cigarette stands and racks of iPhone covers tick off some modern requirements. It has been a turbulent time for the Leeds City Council-run market over the past couple of years, with temporary walls and scaffolding becoming a familiar sight during a Â£13.7m renovation. Despite the council reducing rents during this period, stall-holders have complained of regulars becoming put off and heading elsewhere. Monthly footfall at Kirkgate dropped significantly from 718,000 in 2014 to 628,000 in 2015, but the number rose again to 699,000 in 2016. Leslie Burwell, of Whitaker's Farmhouse Eggs, has worked in the market for 25 years in total. She said: ""It used to be heaving, you couldn't move for people down the aisles, there was an atmosphere with people shouting. ""They've taken all of the shops out of one section and made a big wide open space - they have spent millions of pounds and have nothing to show for it."" Kashif Ali Raja, who recently took over Spice Corner, said he was positive despite widespread change. He said: ""When you start a business, you have to work really hard. There's early mornings, working late. ""We sell seeds, fresh vegetables, things which are very difficult to find in Leeds, this is the only place you can get it. ""I don't think recent changes have made any difference, because the regular customers are the same, they will always come."" The outdoor section of Kirkgate, with its fruit stalls, luggage-sellers and flea market, is where Michael Marks opened his Penny Bazaar, leading to the founding of Marks & Spencer in 1890. The patch now sits a stone's throw away from the newly-opened 42,000 sq m Victoria Gate complex, a Â£165m retail development featuring a flagship John Lewis store. Leeds City Council wants the market to be able to take advantage of the expected increase in shoppers in the area, but not everyone feels it will make a difference. Julie Carr has worked in the outdoor section for 35 years and now sells second-hand toys and collectables at her stall. She said: ""The new John Lewis has made no difference to us, I don't think their customers and ours are connected at all. ""My theory is in 20 years there will be no shops, no markets, everything will be online and people will say 'I remember when we used to go to the market' - and they've gone."" The market's 1976 Hall has seen the most significant change, with the space transformed into a brightly-coloured communal seating area, where established ""street food"" traders have decided to set up permanently. A rotating schedule of craft fairs, live music and kids' entertainment is used to draw people in, with long tables encouraging those new to the market to get chatting to those who have been regulars for decades. One of the new food traders is the Yorkshire Wrap Company, selling hot meals wrapped up in a Yorkshire pudding. Michael Pratt, who runs the stall, said: ""First impressions are good, word of mouth seems to be getting out about the new food hall area. ""It's bringing a lot of different faces into the market, people who maybe wouldn't have usually come here."" He added: ""Markets give a sense of community and the ability to get everything under one roof, great produce for great prices. I think they're going from strength to strength."" Down in the basement of the top end of the market, Brian Bettison has been providing haircuts since 1982. He said rents for stalls had gone ""up and up and up"". He said: ""They've had numerous different ways of doing it through the years, it was measured on square footage, it was zoned into the most desirable areas. ""Everyone now has different agreements with the markets, nobody will let you know, they will keep it to themselves."" What do the shoppers think? Anna Woollett,30, from Meanwood in Leeds: ""I buy all of my fruit and vegetables from here, because I like to buy food fresh and it's far better quality than in supermarkets and lower prices. It's a really big part of my life. If I had to move to another city, one of the first things I would check out is if there's a decent market."" Maurice Collinson, 81, from Beeston, Leeds:""I'd like to see more stalls come in but they can't afford them as the prices are going up all the time. I've been coming here all of my life and it's a beautiful building, the top half is really what it used to be, it's really good."" Paul Eccles, 50, from York, said: ""The international food here is fantastic, stuff from north Africa, Asia, it's great. It's important they invest in them."" Close to where the indoor market meets the outdoor section, Cheryl Murtheh has been selling cosmetics for 16 years. She said: ""They're giving cheaper rent to newcomers coming in, but they should lower the rents of people who have been here a long time. ""What happens to the people who have been keeping you going for years, shouldn't they be entitled to something as well?"" According to the National Association of British Market Authorities, from 2009 to 2016 the number of market traders in the UK dropped from approximately 55,000 to 32,000. The recession has been highlighted as a key reason for this, although there is some evidence the sector as a whole has started to turn a corner. The National Market Traders Federation (NMTF) said traditional retail markets currently have a collective annual turnover of Â£2.7bn, with the figure increasing by Â£200m year on year since 2013. Like Kirkgate, several markets across the UK are adapting to modern trends to cater for younger shoppers. Many have introduced hot food areas, improved their branding, have extended opening hours and provided free wi-fi. Joe Harrison, chief executive of the NMTF, said: ""It's easy to follow trends, but five years down the line you may realise you've got nothing. ""They need to make sure careful steps are taken to keep them popular with the next generation, but it needs to have that social value, dealing with every demographic rather than focusing on one specific thing as it's currently the most economically viable."" Leeds City Council said visitor numbers were now ""on the up"" since the refurbishment, with the number of vacant units ""also reduced significantly"". A spokeswoman said: ""We recognise that there is still some way to go but we are very optimistic that more and more visitors will continue to discover the traditional charm combined with the new modern areas that Kirkgate has to offer."" Clearly the market has reached a key moment in its history, with bold decisions about the site's future use being made. While serving up mint teas and chicken shawarmas to lunchtime customers at his food stand, Mr Bendaha said: ""This is not just a full-time job, it's a lifestyle and it's a big part of the city. ""Hopefully it will never die.""

Donor dilemma,"When her daughter, Thalya, was diagnosed with chronic kidney disease, Chantal Onelien's initial reaction was shock. But, as Adam Harris reports, it was only the beginning of a long and difficult fight. Thalya, then only 13 years old, would need to begin dialysis immediately, and she would also need a new kidney. The family set out on what became a two-year journey of dialysis appointments, meetings with doctors and trying to provide Thalya a normal childhood. ""You make it work, so that it doesn't seem like doom and gloom,"" Onelien told the BBC. Every ten minutes in the United States, someone is added to thenational transplant list,external. Roughly 119,000 total people are on the list as of early February 2017, and almost 100,000 of those are waiting for a kidney. There are not nearly enough organ donors - living or deceased - to trim that figure. But for the Oneliens, an African-American family, the odds were even greater. In 2016, African Americans accounted for 30% of the overall organ donation waiting list, and 33% of the kidney list, despite being only 13% of the US population. A black organ recipient doesn't have to have a black donor. But they would be more likely to have a successful match - based on certain genetic markers and antibodies -  if more black donors were available. The percentage of black Americans who donate organs has risen since 1988,  but there is still an outsized need. Faced with these odds, the Oneliens started a social media campaign, using the hashtag #KidneyForThalya on Twitter, and a Facebook page that called for donations, shared inspirational stories of successful transplants and posted educational material about organ donation. Chantal and Thalya Chantal Onelien is familiar with some of the reasons why African Americans might not want to donate, including a distrust of doctors. ""People sometimes believe that not only will they not try to save your life, but will try to use your organs as experiments,"" she says. ""And it's hard to defuse some of that thinking - to debunk and demystify it."" Mistrust of the medical community among African Americans is not uncommon, and not without historical justification. In the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, black men in Alabama were promised free medical care, and then unknowingly signed up for a long-term research study into the effects of syphilis. When a cure became available, the men were denied treatment so that the study could continue. Henrietta Lackswent to John Hopkins for cervical cancer treatment, where a doctor took samples from her cervix and used them to develop one of the most-used cell research lines - all without her permission or knowledge. Derek DuBay, chief transplant surgeon at the Medical University of South Carolina, believes there is much more at play than just mistrust in the medical community. So Dr DuBay, alongside a team of researchers, used surveys and focus groups to find out why there was a such a disparity between black and white donors. They found many African Americans cited fear that their organs would not be usable due to high blood pressure, heart disease and other prevalent ailments in the black community. The researchers concluded,externalthat often, it's a simple matter of educating people about organ donation. ""We need to enhance education to let them know that a lot of times these organs are acceptable for transplant,"" Dr DuBay says. ""And even though the heart might not be good for transplant,"" another organ might be. Julius Wilder, professor at the Duke Clinical Institute, agrees. ""While there may be mistrust in the African-American community surrounding organ donation,"" Dr Wilder says, ""it is not a barrier to the extent that lack of education or access is"". Access, Dr Wilder says, is key to driving both living and deceased donations. ""Minorities are more likely to live in places with less economic and healthcare resources. ""This is a vicious cycle that feeds on itself because these resource poor environments make people sicker and they often have greater need for organ transplantation."" The treatment centre helped by providing activities like music and entertainment during dialysis, Onelien says, making it seem less like a chore The lack of access is found in both rural communities and urban centres in close proximity to transplantation hospitals. ""If you do not have health insurance or strong social support resources,"" he says, meaning both emotional and tangible support, such as money or childcare, ""you will not have access to transplantation"". Donor advocates are now trying to steer kidney donors of all races towards living donations. Josh Morrison and Thomas Kelly were both living donors. They started Waitlist Zero to educate the general public abut living donation and chip away at the growing waitlist. Organs such as kidneys, segments of the liver, and portions of the pancreas and intestine can be donated with the donor continuing to live a healthy life. Unfortunately, African Americans are the least likely group to receive a kidney donation from a living donor. But Mr Morrison hopes public education campaigns can change that. ""If you ask people who've donated, they get this surge of just purpose and energy,"" Chantal Onelien says. ""It's like, 'Wow, I saved someone's life'."" In June, the Obama administration announced several measures it was taking to address the overall waiting list, including $200m for research and development, and promoting new technology to make registering as an organ donation easier. On 19 November, the Oneliens got the call - there was a deceased donor and kidney for Thalya. The family spent 33 days in hospital, after minor complications led to more procedures than anticipated. Just days before Christmas, they went home. With Thalya in recovery, the Oneliens are now looking forward to the future. When asked whether they planned to continue to raise awareness about organ donation, Chantal Onelien says: ""Absolutely. Now more than ever."" Â© 2025 BBC.

How revealing have Trump's first weeks as president been?,"No modern president has been so analysed. Other leaders don't know him and can't read him. He leaves a trail, but it is strewn with contradictions. He craves popularity but revels in being demonised. He trusts his gut instincts and embraces unpredictability as a virtue. Diplomats, foreign leaders, business chiefs are all trying to decipher what drives the 45th president. Donald Trump's first two weeks have been about power, about asserting it, about the noise of power, about taking a wrecking ball to the establishment and leaving it wrong-footed and uncertain. No president before him has been so ready with threats against foreign powers, old allies, major corporations, and Washington's public servants. At conferences, seminars, at diplomatic functions, in foreign ministries, I have encountered the same whispered and not so hidden question: what do these erratic actions tell us about the mind of Donald Trump?"" Some say he can't survive or that he will over-reach himself. Others are waiting for him to self-destruct, but there is clear calculation behind these early heady days of being the most powerful man in the world. Despite the protests, many Americans support the president on migration First, Donald Trump is doing in office what he promised he would do, on the campaign trail. At more than 15 campaign stops, I heard him vow to: bring back jobs to America build the wall with Mexico replace big trade agreements with bilateral deals stand up to Iran introduce ""extreme vetting"" of migrants His claims were dismissed as campaign braggadocio, but he would bracket most of his promises with the words ""believe me"". He is now delivering. Secondly, President Trump is looking after his core supporters; all those voters in Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan and North Carolina who delivered him the White House. While demonstrators gather in cities and at airports, protesting at his banning refugees and citizens from seven mainly Muslim countries from entering the States, the polls indicate that in middle America he has the support of nearly one in two Americans: 49% agreed with the policy. Trump ramps up criticism of judge after travel ban setback Trump's executive order: Who does travel ban affect? The people around the president Newshour Extra: Steve Bannon - The de facto president? All the outrage about the policy being discriminatory, that it is incoherent, that it will prove a recruiting sergeant for extremists, that such a policy - if it had been in place - would have prevented none of the recent terrorists attacks, make little impression on Mr Trump's inner circle. Mr Trump knows his people, and he tweets his messages to them, direct and simple, as they were during the campaign. ""This travel ban is not about religion,"" he tweets, ""this is about terror and keeping our country safe."" Some who voted for him may have misgivings, but most of them, so far, don't. They like his confrontational style. Offending Washington's elite is a badge of his authenticity. Early battles with judges and state department officials are evidence that he is ""draining the swamp"" as promised. When a federal judge halted the travel ban, the president tweeted: ""The opinion of this so-called judgeâ¦ is ridiculous and will be overturned."" While his critics accused him of showing a lack of respect for the Constitution, Donald Trump reminded his audience that many ""bad and dangerous people"" could be ""pouring"" into the country. The president remains in campaigning mode. Mr Trump has criticised those who halted his new migration policy The dizzying array of announcements and executive orders form part of a strategic plan. Never mind that some of the policies are incomplete. That is to miss the point. The strategy is to demonstrate over the first 100 days of his presidency that he is a ""high-energy"" leader, shaking up the old order. He is lucky to have inherited a strong economy,  but he has promised much more. The bonfire of regulations, the slashing of corporate and personal taxes, the pump-priming investments in infrastructure are all intended to lift growth levels above 3%. If he achieves that, many Americans will stick with him. Social media, as it did during the campaign, enables him to talk directly to those who packed his rallies. The conventional wisdom was that he would not be tweeter-in-chief when he got to the White House. But Mr Trump knows that every tweet becomes a news story and so enables him to manage the news agenda. The mainstream media is still struggling to find a convincing riposte to a president who bypasses them to deliver his messages. He declares he's in a ""running war"" with the press. His chief strategist labels the media the ""opposition party"". Again Mr Trump understands that if he denounces the media as ""dishonest"", it weakens its ability to hold him to account. The state of the US economy will be a key indicator of President Trump's achievements His detractors call him ""narcissist-in-chief"". They point to his personal flaws: the need to be loved, to be popular, to make every issue about himself, the thin-skinned retorts, the savaging of those who disagree and the demonising of the press. All are weaknesses that over time may damage and perhaps undo him. His strategy is not just to change America but for him to dominate the public space. Others search for the ideology that will underpin his presidency. For Donald Trump, his guiding slogan will be ""America first."" It will be his defence against all attacks. If that means challenging the international order, or tearing up old trade agreements or upsetting the global elite, so be it. In these early days, it is impossible to know how much of a revolutionary Donald Trump will be and how much ideology will inform his decision-making. His chief strategist, Stephen Bannon is, on the other hand, deeply ideological. He is a self-proclaimed ""economic nationalist"". He seeks a new political order, where sovereignty returns to nation states, where the West confronts the ""hateful ideology"" of radical Islam. In the immediate future, President Trump is likely to continue with his confrontational style, believing it is popular with his core supporters. Many tests lie ahead. Not least is whether his policies will be followed through. President Trump's chief strategist, Stephen Bannon, is deeply ideological Was the announcement about the wall with Mexico intended as a headline or is Mr Trump determined to build it with Mexican money? Will he really impose an import tax? Will he risk a trade and currency war with China? Will he move the American embassy in Israel to Jerusalem? Will he encourage anti-establishment parties in Europe? The questions are many, and the answers few. To those who have openly doubted the president's sanity in these churning, bruising opening days, a clear strategy emerges. The president and his close advisers will pay scant attention to the outcry from their opponents. But they will nurture those who gave him his majority in the electoral college and might again. In two years, and by the time of the mid-term elections, the American public will deliver an initial verdict on Trumpism. Most importantly the Republican Party will be deciding whether it stays loyal to Mr Trump or whether it allows doubts and reservations to seep in, making Congress the obstacle to his presidency.

Tim Harford: Why the falling cost of light matters,"Back in the mid-1990s, an economist called William Nordhaus conducteda series of simple experiments with light,external. First, he used a prehistoric technology: he lit a wood fire. But Prof Nordhaus also had a piece of hi-tech equipment with him - a Minolta light meter. He burned 20lb (9kg) of wood, kept track of how long it burned for and carefully recorded the dim, flickering firelight with his meter. Next, he bought a Roman oil lamp, fitted it with a wick, and filled it with cold-pressed sesame oil. He lit the lamp and watched the oil burn down, again using the light meter to measure its soft, even glow. Bill Nordhaus's open wood fire had burned for just three hours on 9kg of wood. But a mere eggcup of oil burned all day, and more brightly and controllably. Why did he do this? He wanted to understand the economic significance of the light bulb. But Prof Nordhaus also wanted to illuminate a difficult issue for economists: how to keep track of inflation, the changing cost of goods and services. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. To see why this is difficult, consider the price of travelling from - say - Lisbon in Portugal to Luanda in Angola. When that journey was first made, by Portuguese explorers, it would have been an epic expedition, possibly taking months. Later, by steam ship, it would have taken a few days; then, by plane, a few hours. An economic historian could start by tracking the price of passage on the ship, but once an air route has opened up, which price do you look at? Maybe you simply switch to the airline ticket price once more people start flying than sailing. But flying is a different service - faster, more convenient. If more travellers are willing to pay twice as much to fly, it hardly makes sense for inflation statistics to record that the cost of the journey has suddenly doubled. It was to raise this question over the way we measure inflation that Bill Nordhaus started fooling around with wood fires, oil lamps and light meters. Prof Nordhaus found the Roman oil lamp offered much better light He wanted to unbundle the cost of a single quality that humans have cared deeply about since time immemorial, using the state-of-the-art technology of different ages: illumination. Light is measured in lumens, or lumen-hours. A candle gives off 13 lumens while it burns. A typical modern light bulb is almost 100 times brighter than that. Imagine gathering and chopping wood 10 hours a day for six days. Those 60 hours of work would produce 1,000 lumen hours of light. That is the equivalent of one modern light bulb shining for just 54 minutes, although what you would actually get is many more hours of dim, flickering light instead. Of course, light is not the only reason to burn fires: they also help keep you warm, cook your food and scare off wild animals. If you just needed light and a wood fire was your only option, you might decide to wait until the Sun comes up. Thousands of years ago, better options came along - candles from Egypt and Crete, and oil lamps from Babylon. Their light was steadier and more controllable, but still prohibitively expensive. In a diary entry of May 1743, the president of Harvard University, the Reverend Edward Holyoake, noted that his household had spent two days making 78lb (35kg) of tallow candles. Six months later, he noted: ""Candles all gone."" And those were the summer months. The iPhone at 10: How the smartphone became so smart The steel box that changed global trade The hidden strengths of unloved concrete How the barcode changed retailing Nor were these the clean-burning paraffin wax candles we use today. The wealthiest could afford beeswax, but most people - even the Harvard president - used tallow candles, stinking, smoking sticks of animal fat. Making them involved heating up animal fat and dipping and re-dipping wicks into the molten lard. It was pungent and time-consuming work. A tallow chandler dips a frame of candles into a bath of liquid fat According to Prof Nordhaus's research, if you set aside one whole week a year to spend 60 hours devoted exclusively to making candles - or earning the money to buy them - that would enable you to burn a single candle for just two hours and 20 minutes every evening. Things improved a little as the 18th and 19th Centuries unfolded. Candles were made of spermaceti - the milk-hued oily gloop harvested from dead sperm whales. American founding father Ben Franklin loved the strong, white light they gave off, and the way they ""may be held in the hand, even in hot weather, without softening"", and noted that they ""last much longer"". While the new candles were pleasing, they were also pricey. George Washington calculated that burning a single spermaceti candle for five hours a night all year would cost him Â£8, or well over $1,000 (Â£820) in today's money. A few decades later, gas lamps and kerosene lamps helped to lower costs. They also saved the sperm whale from extinction. But they, too, were basically an expensive hassle. They dripped, smelt and set fire to things. Thomas Edison's carbon filament light bulbs represented an enormous technological leap forward Then something changed. That something was the light bulb. By 1900, one of Thomas Edison's carbon filament bulbs would provide you with 10 days of bright, continuous illumination, 100 times as bright as a candle, for the money you could earn with our 60-hour week of hard labour. By 1920, that same week of labour would pay for more than five months' continuous light from tungsten filament bulbs. By 1990, it was 10 years. A couple of years after that, thanks to compact fluorescent bulbs, it was more than five times longer. The labour that had once produced the equivalent of 54 minutes of quality light now produced 52 years. And modern LED lights continue to get cheaper and cheaper. Switch off a light bulb for an hour and you are saving illumination that would have cost our ancestors all week to create. It would have taken Benjamin Franklin's contemporaries all afternoon. But someone in a rich industrial economy today could earn the money to buy that illumination in a fraction of a second. LED bulbs offer sharper, cheaper and more energy efficient illumination And of course, unlike oil lamps and candles, modern light bulbs are clean, fire-safe and controllable. The light bulb has become an icon of innovation. It has transformed our society into one where we can work, read, sew or play whenever we want to, regardless of how dark the night has become. But the price of light alone tells a fascinating story: it has fallen by a factor of 500,000, far faster than official inflation statistics suggest. A thing that was once too precious to use is now too cheap to notice.

Shannon's story,"Shannon Matthews is now 18 and living with another family A new BBC drama set around the hoax kidnapping of nine-year-old Shannon Matthews has drawn criticism from the victim's grandparents. June and Gordon Matthews said that The Moorside, starring Sheridan Smith, was ""sick and disgusting"" and the eventsshould not be treated as entertainment. The Moorside - named after the estate in Dewsbury, West Yorkshire, where the real-life events unfolded - will be screened on BBC One on Tuesday with the second and concluding part the following week. But rather than being Shannon's story, the BBC says it actually focuses on the experience of the woman who led the campaign to find the youngster. Sheridan Smith as Julie Sheridan Smith will star as Julie Bushby, a member of Dewsbury's residents and tenants association. ""The themes of faith and trust in human nature, and the way the whole community came together, really inspired me,"" said Smith. Bushby has given a small selection of newspaper and TV interviews in the past week, praising Smith's portrayal and revealing that the actress has stayed in touch since filming. The programme was written by screenwriter Neil McKay, who had previously penned TV dramas based around the real-life stories of Myra Hindley (See No Evil) and Fred West (Appropriate Adult). The hoax kidnapping of the West Yorkshire schoolgirl dominated news headlines in 2008. As local police undertook their biggest search operation since the Yorkshire Ripper, the nine-year-old was being drugged and hidden in the base of a divan bed by the very people appealing for her safe return. Her mother, Karen, and Michael Donovan, the uncle of Karen's partner, were sent to prison for eight years for kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice, after the court heard about their plot to hide the child and claim a Â£50,000 reward that subsequently had been offered by the Sun. The crime shocked the nation, but that shock was felt even more keenly in the local community, which had been seen playing a big part in the 24 days of searching; printing T-shirts, organising fundraising, and praying for the safety of Shannon. Matthews reported Shannon missing at 18:48 GMT on 19 February 2008 after she had failed to return home from a swimming trip with her school. The last confirmed sighting of her had been outside Westmoor Junior School, in Dewsbury, at 15:10 GMT. Within 24 hours, West Yorkshire Police had started a massive search for her, with more than 200 officers involved. And the community began its own operation, printing copies of Shannon's picture and posting them up around the neighbourhood. The idea that Shannon had run away from home was touted, but her family insisted it would be totally out of character. As the search entered its second day, around 200 volunteers joined the 200 officers already looking for Shannon. Within the first week, specialists were drafted in to help, from behavioural experts and a dedicated team of scientists, to mountain rescue teams and specially trained dogs. But when they found no sign of her, police warned that she may have ""fallen into the wrong hands"" and said they were ""gravely concerned"". They also revealed a scribbled note on Shannon's bedroom wall, saying she wanted to see more of her natural father. On the eve of Mother's Day, 11 days after Shannon had disappeared, her mother launched an emotional appeal for her daughter's return. ""Mother's Day is a day when every mum wants her children around them,"" she said. ""Today I don't want cards or presents, I just want my darling daughter home safely. ""I have a special bond with Shannon and I feel sure that she is alive and will come home to her mum."" It was that day that the Sun made its first reward offer of Â£20,000 for anyone with information that would lead to finding Shannon. Newspapers, with support from police, occasionally make such reward offers when crimes are committed. Occasionally, they are known to provide a breakthrough and the newspaper which makes the offer may gain the benefit of a close relationship with the detectives and victims. Matthews continued to appear on TV and make statements begging for her daughter to come home. She asked for whoever had her to release her, said the family no longer felt safe and even suggested someone close to the family had taken Shannon to ""get at her"". Others added their voices to the plea, including the head teacher from Shannon's school. And the community was still out every day trying to find where she had gone, supporting the family and wearing T-shirts emblazoned with Shannon's face. The reward from the Sun was upped to Â£50,000 in another bid to find her. On 14 March 2008, Shannon was found alive. She was hidden in the base of a divan bed at a house in Batley Carr, less than a mile from her home. Police released this image of the bed Shannon was found in The house belonged to Donovan, who was arrested after a struggle with police. Matthews denied any part in the hoax but Shannon was taken straight into care after her discovery. The mother and daughter saw each other for the first time on 3 April, but three days later Matthews was charged with child neglect and perverting the course of justice over her daughter's disappearance, joining Donovan in the dock. The community was left in shock. A Freedom of Information request to West Yorkshire Police revealed the investigation into Shannon's disappearance cost Â£2,659,000. On 5 September 2008, Matthews and Donovan denied all the charges at Leeds Crown Court. The trial started in November and on day one it was revealed that Shannon had been drugged and tethered in the flat where she was found. Prosecutors described Matthews as a ""Jekyll and Hyde"" character, who forced a sad look on her face when police and media were around. Donovan was described as a fantasist by his own niece, and he claimed Matthews paid him and then threatened him to keep Shannon hidden. The pair kept denying their parts. Julian Goose, summing up the case for the prosecution, said Matthews had ""lied and lied and lied again"" as she told five different versions regarding her daughter's disappearance. Alan Conrad, who was defending Donovan, said his client was not an ""evil monster"" but in reality he was a ""pathetic inadequate"" who was ""vulnerable, unsophisticated and weak in body and mind"". On 4 December 2008, the pair were found guilty, with the jury taking just six hours on their unanimous verdict. On 23 January 2009, they were sentenced to eight years each in prison. Matthews was released in 2012 after serving half her sentence, by which time Donovan had already been freed. Shannon is now 18 and living with a different family. The two-part drama The Moorside will air on Tuesday, 7 February, and Tuesday, 14 February, at 21:00 GMT on BBC One.

Calls for officer to keep police dog,"Sgt David Evans has offered to buy Ivy and cover the cost of replacing her More than 15,000 people have signed a petition to allow a police dog to retire with her handler. Sgt David Evans, from Shropshire, is ""heartbroken"" at the prospect of not being able to keep four-year-old Ivy when he retires, his daughter said. She set up an online petition to gather support for her father, who is stepping down in April after 34 years' service. The chief constable has ""made a direct offer"" to speak to Sgt Evans. Police dogs normally retire about age eight. Latest reaction to the petition Sgt Evans, 59, has been told he will have to pass the animal - a Malinois cross German Shepherd - on to another handler to continue working, the family said. It takes about 13 weeks to train a police dog Purchase and initial training costs about Â£24,000 The dogs usually retire around the age of eight, depending on fitness If the dog is approaching retirement at the same time as its handler, it would be considered for retirement. In cases where dogs are still young, they will often be re-handled Source: West Mercia Police The petition calling for Ivy to be allowed to retire with her handler has been signed by people from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand West Mercia Police's chief constable has offered to speak to the officer personally about Ivy's future The petition has been signed by people from as far afield as Canada and New Zealand.  Daughter Jennie said the response was ""incredible"". She said Sgt Evans, of Market Drayton, had offered to buy Ivy and cover the cost of replacing her. Ms Evans said: ""Dad sacrificed many family moments with the support of his wife to enable him to undergo months of training with his police dogs. ""West Mercia need to show they appreciate these efforts and do not treat dogs as dispensable equipment that can be 'handed down' to other people.""

Inspiring heroine,"The Eagle Huntress, a documentary about a Kazakh nomad girl in Mongolia learning to hunt with a golden eagle, divides opinion. It is up for a Bafta award on Sunday night but missed out on an Oscar nomination, possibly because to some viewers it feels staged. Director Otto Bell, however, denies all accusations that the film was scripted, acted or re-enacted. The story of the Eagle Huntress is simple and heartwarming. Aisholpan Nurgaiv, the rosy-cheeked 13-year-old heroine, is trained by her father to hunt on horseback with a golden eagle - traditionally a male pursuit - and shocks everyone by winning the prestigious eagle-hunters' competition held annually in the town of Ulgii, in north-western Mongolia. It has a stirring musical soundtrack, ends with an anthem ""You can do anything"" sung by pop superstar Sia, and is narrated by another teenage role model, Star Wars actress Daisy Ridley. One reviewer has described it as a ""fairytale documentary,external"" - two words that don't usually go together - that feels at times ""more like fiction than fact"". Another calls it a ""repetitious, half-baked, contrived and crudely staged homily on female empowerment [that] tells us less about Kazakh nomads than Pocahontas does about the Algonquins in 17th Century Virginia"". The film took another culture's traditions, he goes on, and translated them ""into thetired platitudes of a second-rate Disney animation,external"". Early publicity for the film did little to inspire confidence, by stating that Aisholpan had fought ""an ingrained culture of misogyny to become the first female eagle hunter in 2,000 years of male-dominated history"" - a claim that US historian Adrienne Mayor hasshown is untrue,external. This line was recast to say that Aisholpan is ""the first female in 12 generations of her Kazakh family"" to be an eagle huntress. But Mayor and others still argue that the film creates a false impression, by failing to mention other Kazakh eagle huntresses, and exaggerating the patriarchal pressures that Aisholpan had to overcome. ""I think eagle hunting would be open to any young woman who would want to pursue it,"" Mayor says. Adrienne Mayor's paper, The Eagle Huntress - Ancient Traditions and New Generations, mentions a number of Kazakh women who have trained or are training to hunt with eagles The spark for the film came when director Otto Bell came across photographs of Aisholpan taken by Israeli photographerAsher Svidensky on the BBC News website, in April 2014. He tracked Aisholpan's family down (being nomads, they move around) and on the very first day, he says, filmed one of the early scenes in the film, where the girl and her father seize a baby eaglet from its nest. It's a dramatic moment with Aisholpan climbing down a cliff, her father holding a rope attached to her waist. And it's one of a number of scenes that some critics have assumed was staged. Otto Bell rejects this. ""The scene where she takes the baby eagle out of the nest - people are always surprised to know that's one single take. I filmed it like I would film a live sports event,"" he says. ""I did it drawing on my experience in commercials. As far as reconstructing stuff and staging stuff, what you see on the screen is what we got."" Another scene that sceptics find questionable comes when Aisholpan's father, Agalai, gets his own father to give his blessing to Aisholpan's eagle-hunting ambitions. The shot is framed and the camera is rolling when the conversation between the two men takes place outside the tent, and the girl is summoned to receive the old man's good wishes. Was it staged? No, says Bell. ""The blessing scene - he said he was going to do this, I just asked him to do it outside. He told me: 'We need to think about what my father thinks of this.' The father likes to sit outside anyway, he likes to watch the goats. That was as close [to staging] as we got."" Otto Bell (centre) with Aisholpan's parents at the Ajyal film festival in Doha in December There are other moments that critics grumble about. Tim Robey in the Telegraph describes as ""woefully unspontaneous,external"" a scene where a newsreader on the radio in the family's tent is heard talking about the forthcoming eagle festival, and Aisholpan pipes up to plead with her parents for permission to enter. It's ""engineered storytelling"" he says. ""You feel sorry for her enacting some of these charades."" Will Dunn in the New Statesman is also bothered by the film's ""re-enactment and editorialising,external"", though he notes that without the imposed girl-power narrative it's ""a film about the fox-hunting techniques of Mongolian Kazakhs, a subject that is not exactly a banker at the box office"". He also accepts it would have been a shame if Aisholpan's world had not been revealed to a wider audience. Nigel Andrews in his review in the Financial Times last December wrote that the action and dialogue seemed ""a little set up,external"".  He was particularly suspicious of a montage of grumpy elderly men filmed tut-tutting over the idea of a woman taking up eagle hunting. But while the academic Adrienne Mayor suggests Bell went searching for these naysayers in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan, in Andrews'latest article about the film,externalBell says he just went round knocking on elders' doors, and all openly voiced disapproval. So he put them in the film. Meghan Fitz-James, a Canadian traveller who spent time with Aisholpan's family, also says that one scene showing Aisholpan training for the eagle festival was in factshot three days later,external, in a four-hour shoot with coaching and retakes. Aisholpan training with her father But the fundamentals of the film are confirmed by Aisholpan herself. ""I started to train when I was 10 years old, going into the mountains with my dad,"" she told the BBC, while passing through Ulan Bator recently. ""I told my dad that I wanted to become an eagle huntress."" That was in 2011 - two or three years before Svidensky arrived on the scene - and she wasn't just training with the eagle, she was already hunting too, she says. Aisholpan also confirms that she was aware some men thought a girl was not strong enough to hold an eagle, that she should stay at home, and would not be able to stand the cold hunting for hours in winter in the Altai mountains. ""The pressure gave me more will and power. It gave me the inspiration to win,"" she says. But the curmudgeonly views of these mostly elderly men were not expressed at the eagle festival, where officials and competitors were supportive, she says. After her win in 2014 (captured on film) she was greeted by loud cheers when she competed again in 2015 and 2016. Watching the film, a cynical viewer may fear that Aisholpan has been coached when she says: ""Girls can do anything if they try."" But she says the same thing off-screen too: ""I am happy that I have won a man's competition. It shows how strong women are."" Who would not be proud, in her position, to have beaten grown men with years of eagle-hunting experience? Any telling of her story would carry a female empowerment message, even if this film does milk it for all its worth. Despite her criticisms of the film, the historian Adrienne Mayor agrees that Aisholpan is a worthy heroine. ""Her bravery and her feats in that eagle hunting contest are really amazing and inspiring,"" she says. ""That would have been enough in the film.""

Shapovalov 'ashamed' after default,"This video can not be played Shapovalov hits umpire in face and loses Davis Cup tie Canada's Denis Shapovalov said he was ""incredibly ashamed and embarrassed"" after he was defaulted for hitting the umpire with a ball - handing Great Britain Davis Cup victory in Ottawa. The 17-year-old had just dropped serve to trail Kyle Edmund 6-3 6-4 2-1 when he angrily hit the ball out of court. It struck French umpire Arnaud Gabas in the eye and a default followed. ""Luckily he was OK but obviously it's unacceptable behaviour from me,"" said Wimbledon junior champion Shapovalov. ""I just feel awful for letting my team down, for letting my country down, for acting in a way that I would never want to act. ""I can promise that's the last time I will do anything like that. I'm going to learn from this and try to move past it."" Davis Cup updates: How the drama unfolded Great Britain win after Shapovalov defaulted The World Group first-round tie was poised at 2-2 after Vasek Pospisil beat Dan Evans to set up a decider, but Canada's hopes ended when Shapovalov let frustration get the better of him. He later apologised to Gabas in the referee's office before the Frenchman headed to Ottawa General Hospital for a precautionary evaluation on bruising and swelling to his left eye. The International Tennis Federation (ITF) said in a statement it was ""clear that Mr Shapovalov did not intend to hit Mr Gabas"". Referee Brian Earley has the power to impose a fine of up to $12,000 (Â£9,600) and the ITF might significantly increase that fine, and suspend Shapovalov from future ties. GB captain Leon Smith said: ""Unfortunately for the young lad this is going to get an awful lot of attention. ""This will be looked at closely and it should be as it is dangerous. Whether it's an umpire or a young kid who's at the side of the court, that really could be a serious injury, so I'm sure it will be dealt with swiftly and pretty firmly."" Britain go on to face an away tie in France from 7-9 April - a repeat ofthe 2015 quarter-final in Londonthat Britain won on their way to regaining the title for the first time in 79 years. Britain are through to the quarter-finals for the fourth year in a row John Lloyd, former Great Britain Davis Cup captain and player We don't know yet how the umpire's eye is but we could see it was already closing. You don't know about permanent damage until he sees the doctor. It's devastating for Shapovalov. He let himself down, he let his country down. He could have caused serious damage to the umpire. He will realise that he can't do that sort of thing again and he's going to get a lot of trouble in the press for this, quite rightly so because he deserves it, but he will rebound. If you look to the brighter side we've seen some undoubted talent in him, if he can just control it a little bit. There's nothing wrong with getting emotional - we've seen great champions like John McEnroe get emotional - but you can't go to that extent and he'll have to curb it a little bit.

The long wait,"Iris Sibley spent six months in hospital waiting for a place in a care home It is December in the Bristol Royal Infirmary and in a room tucked away on a top floor is 89-year-old Iris Sibley. She has been living here for more than six months. Keeping her company are her devoted husband and son - Arthur, who is 90, and John. ""Mum has got dementia and other problems and she now needs 24/7 nursing care,"" says John. ""At the moment she is being funded by the NHS. But it's just a system where you're going from one organisation to another and nobody seems to be co-ordinating."" Tracing the steps that John, Arthur and Iris have tried to take to get her moved on to a care home is mind-numbingly complex. Everyone is well meaning but no-one is fully in charge of the whole process. Julia Clarke, chief executive of local NHS services provider Bristol Community Health, says Iris's case is simple to process and fund - but finding space in a care home is the difficult part. ""I've seen the printout of all the calls that we made to the various homes between August and December and it was more or less a daily effort,"" she says. ""Twenty-four homes were contacted during the period, 11 had no vacancies and another 11 felt they couldn't meet Mrs Sibley's needs. And the two able to meet her needs with vacancies, unfortunately were too far away for the family and for Mrs Sibley to have access to her support networks. ""So it's a combination of circumstances. Some people would call it a perfect storm."" There are two big costs here, the human and of course the financial cost for the NHS, which is providing a place for Iris to live. Bristol Royal Infirmary is a large teaching hospital in the centre of the city Robert Woolley, the chief executive of the Bristol Royal Infirmary, says he has 800 beds available. On any given day around 60 people are ready to leave but can't and that is when it gets pricey. ""The sort of medical ward that Mrs Sibley was on, the costs are in the order of Â£450 a night. ""Given the delay that she had leaving hospital, going on for six months that is probably Â£90,000 that we didn't really need to spend in the NHS if there had been appropriate care available for her outside of hospital."" Iris's husband Arthur appreciates the care given to his wife but said: ""She needs a bit of stimulation. I'm not sure that being alone in the room is good for her. ""We've tried all sorts of ways to hurry things up but if they can't find a vacancy, they can't find a vacancy."" Anne Morris, director of nursing for South Gloucestershire's clinical commissioning group which orders the area's NHS and community health services, says: ""Iris is an elderly lady with some health needs that some of the care homes would struggle to be able to meet."" She adds they are working to put appropriate support in place for staff. However space is not the only problem John and Arthur face - money can potentially be an issue. ""We went to see a home where there was a vacancy and it was great,"" says John. ""It had everything that mum needed, a window to look out into a garden to see birds. But then a few days later we heard from the NHS people that the bed had gone."" Care providers have to balance the number of patients who pay privately and those funded by the state John believed his mum lost out on the place because a private person could pay more. David Sallacombe, chief executive of Care and Support West, the body that represents the homes, is blunt about the cost. ""What often happens is that the provider has to make some difficult judgements about the percentage they have in their organisation who might be self-funders and the percentage of state-funded,"" he explains. ""Some organisations have made the decision to only have self-funding clients, whereas on the residential side it can be often 70% self-funders, 30% state funded."" Since December, Iris has been found a place in a nursing home and she loves it. However, she has been reassessed by the funding authority and although she is still doubly incontinent, living with dementia and needing a hoist to be moved out of bed, the family are now being told that she no longer qualifies for NHS funding. This means she will be back with the council and the family will have to pay towards her care. What's the cost of care in your area? How the care system works across the UK Care: The alternative options Mike Hennessy, director of adult social services for Bristol City Council, says fully-funded NHS care is free at the point of delivery, whereas council services are means tested. He points out there is usually a contribution to be made by the service user towards their care. ""The cost of a care home varies significantly. In actual fact it could be anywhere between Â£800 and Â£1,100 a week depending on the needs of the individual,"" he says. He says the amount to pay is decided on the individual's income and any assets that they have. ""Sometimes if people have got over Â£23,500 they will be required to pay the full cost of their care."" Everyone we talked to about Iris mentioned the future that we all face, with an ageing population and a lack of money. Could some planning and a national conversation make it less gloomy? Mr Sallacombe says: ""Is there any conversation about what that might mean - are we talking here about whether it will cost everybody a pound a week more or five pounds a week more?

The chimp trade," A secret network of wildlife traffickers selling baby chimpanzees has been exposed by a year-long BBC News investigation. The tiny animals are seized from the wild and sold as pets. The BBC’s research uncovered a notorious West African hub for wildlife trafficking, known as the “blue room”, and led to the rescue of a one-year-old chimp. In a dusty back street of Abidjan, Ivory Coast’s largest city, a tiny chimpanzee cries out for comfort. His black hair is ruffled and his dirty nappy scrapes the concrete floor as he crawls towards the familiar figures of the men who have been holding him captive. The baby chimp, ripped away from his family in the wild, is the victim of a lucrative and brutal smuggling operation, exposed by a 12-month-long BBC News investigation spanning half a dozen countries. In demand as pets in wealthy homes or as performers in commercial zoos, baby chimpanzees command a price tag of $12,500, a little under £10,000, but sometimes more. Each capture of a live infant like this one exacts a terrible cost on chimp populations. The usual tactic used by poachers is to shoot as many of the adults in a family as possible. This prevents them from resisting the capture of the baby and their bodies can then be sold as bushmeat. To obtain one infant alive, up to 10 adults are typically slaughtered. “One has to kill the mother, one has to kill the father,” explained Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, an expert in wildlife crime with Ivory Coast Police. “If our ancestors had killed them, nowadays we wouldn't even know about chimpanzees.” Once captured, these baby chimps then enter a sophisticated chain that stretches from the poachers in the jungles to middlemen, who arrange false export permits and transport, and ultimately to the buyers. The animals are in high demand in the Gulf states, south-east Asia and China, with buyers prepared to pay high prices and additional fees to help bypass international controls. And while they may be well looked-after while they are young, chimpanzees soon become too strong and potentially violent to be kept in a home. Karl Ammann, a Swiss wildlife activist who campaigns against chimp trafficking, describes it as a “kind of slavery” and warns that when chimps cease being cute infants, they face a terrible fate. “They still have 90% of their life ahead of them,” he said. “They get locked in some cage and maybe even killed in some cases because they have outlived their useful pet stage. That for me is just impossible to accept.” The baby chimp discovered by the BBC had been bought from a poacher, according to one account, for 300 Euros (£257). But it was rescued en route as a result of our research - leading Interpol officials and Ivorian detectives to expose a major trafficking ring. After months of work building relationships with dealers across a number of countries, our team tracked down the smuggling ringleaders to a house in Abidjan. Posing as prospective buyers, undercover reporters confirmed the infant chimp was at the property before alerting Interpol and local police who were waiting nearby. During the police operation, a small room about the size of a shower cubicle was discovered, decorated with small blue tiles. Inside it, they found a tiny chimp cowering in a wooden crate. The discovery was not only a moment of liberation for the little animal, but also a crucial turning point in a long search by wildlife campaigners to track down a notorious “blue room”, known to be used as a holding pen by traffickers and constantly restocked. For years, when dealers had circulated videos showing captive baby chimpanzees ready for sale, the same distinctive blue tiles were visible. Understood to be in West Africa, no-one knew which country it might be in, let alone which city, until our research led police to it. This revelation provides new insight into the potential scale of loss suffered by great apes, including chimpanzees. An estimated 3,000great apes, including orangutans, gorillas and chimpanzees, are lost from the wild every yearas a result of illegal trade, according to the UN Environment Programme. They are either sold, killed during the hunt or die in captivity. About two thirds of the apes lost are chimpanzees - an endangered species. Western chimpanzees, like the one freed in Abidjan, are judged to be especially vulnerable, so are categorised as critically endangered. There are no more than 65,000 left and probably far fewer. Some1,800 apes were seized by authorities in 23 countries while being traffickedbetween 2005 and 2011, according to the Great Ape Survival Partnership, an alliance of more than 100 governments and other organisations. A quarter of those apes rescued were chimps. Although it is unknown how many smuggled apes reach their destinations undetected, the BBC’s investigation suggests the total is almost certain to be higher than previously thought. The illegal trade in great apes is made possible by the determination of the smugglers and the ease with which international laws on buying and selling endangered species can be evaded. Trading of endangered wild animals and plants is tightly controlled under the Cites agreement - theConvention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora- which aims to protect all wildlife under threat. Under the convention, chimpanzees, which are awarded the highest level of protection (a listing under what is known as Appendix 1), can only be exported under a very limited number of exemptions. For example, the animals need to have been bred in captivity (which is not known to happen in West Africa) and exporting and importing organisations need to be registered with Cites. Despite this, the BBC’s investigation revealed that with the right money and the right connections the smuggling networks can evade these controls. In fact, our team was able to buy two permits to export chimps for $4,000 each. Posing as buyers for a client in Thailand, the team obtained their first permit in the Egyptian capital Cairo, which has long been known as a centre for animal trafficking. Our undercover reporter began negotiations over a secure messaging service with two pet traders, Mahmoud Khaled and Ramadan Abdelnaiem. The pair shared videos of infant chimps held inside the infamous blue-tiled room and offered to secure Cites permits allowing the animals to be exported. Khaled even promised to provide video footage of the chimp’s progress en route to its destination. “When [the] thing is shipped and put in boxes, you will receive a video,” he said. “When it goes to the airport, you receive a video, when it lands at the airport, you will receive a video. [When] it is shipped, you will receive a video. When it is put in the airplane, you receive a video...” While Khaled offered to obtain a Cites Appendix 1 permit, enabling the export of chimps, Ramadan suggested an alternative technique: getting permits for less endangered animals and then hiding the chimps among them. Both these methods are recognised by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime as “wildlife laundering”, when smugglers use fraudulent paperwork or mix protected species with legal shipments of wildlife. A video sent to the BBC’s undercover team by a dealer in West Africa shows how chimps and other endangered animals are smuggled in secret compartments in specially-designed crates. Here, this baby chimpanzee was hidden below animals including parrots, civet cats and mongoose which have less protection in international law. The shipment was made from West Africa and destined for Nepal. The chimp shown in this video, however, never made it. Messages found on the dealer’s mobile phone revealed that the chimpanzee had died, still hidden in the crate in transit at Istanbul airport. The BBC undercover team accepted Khaled’s offer and picked up the Appendix 1 permit two weeks later. Clumsily filled-in, with spelling mistakes and other inaccuracies, it appeared to be signed and stamped by a Jordanian government official. It showed our fake address and a simple internet search would have revealed it was not a Cites-registered institution. The next step was to see if we could arrange to buy the chimps, but at this point Khaled, called the deal off, afraid of being exposed. With the Egyptian deal fallen through, the team decided to deal directly with the source of the chimpanzees in West Africa. This time pretending to be an Indonesian pet shop acting for wealthy clients, our team made contact with a young dealer in Guinea called Ibrahima Traore. Again communicating over a secure messaging service, the team built up a relationship with Traore, aged just 22, who began to send us videos of chimpanzees -  once more in the setting of the blue room. It became clear that the room was being constantly re-stocked. Traore said he could sell us one or two baby chimps as well as a Cites permit. This time, the document the BBC team received looked genuine, though it was falsely filled in, and was signed and stamped by the national parks of Liberia. As the relationship with Traore developed, he began to reveal the scale of his illegal operation. He said he held chimpanzees at farms in Guinea, his home country, as well as in Liberia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ivory Coast. In a conversation filmed secretly, Traore boasted of being able to circumvent international controls and having “someone important on the inside”. “I’m not afraid - you can import everywhere you want - send everywhere you want,” he said. Traore also told of how he shipped chimpanzees without any Cites documentation at all - by hiding them amongst other less-protected animals. One of his videos demonstrated how to smuggle chimps in secret compartments. Confronted with the BBC’s evidence, the secretary-general of Cites, John Scanlon, said that while he wasn’t shocked by the ease with which fraudulent permits for the export of baby chimps were purchased, he was “dismayed”. Although he believed the permit system was “sound and secure” overall, he said there were instances, particularly in West and Central Africa, where there was “an abuse of permits”. “There is corruption in the system,” he told the BBC. “We’ve brought it to the attention of our governments at a standing committee meeting several months ago. We said if we can’t get a handle on corruption, we are not going to stop illegal trade in wildlife.” For this reason, Cites was pushing to introduce an electronic system of permissions that would be harder to fake, he explained. “These things are not easy, but we are onto it, we are seeing it and we are doing our best.” But, despite this, Mr Scanlon said he did not believe there was a surge in the illegal trade in great apes, including chimpanzees. “If we did, I can assure you there would be a rush of attention to this issue and a rush of resources to stop it, but we are not seeing it,” he said. He stressed that wherever the abuse of permits was observed, the governments of those countries implicated were warned and punished. There were about 30 trade suspensions currently in place, he confirmed. Law enforcement efforts, however, appear to lag far behind the rates of illegal trade. Just 27 arrests were made in Africa and Asia in connection with the great ape trade between 2005 and 2011, and one-quarter of the arrests never led to prosecutions prosecuted, according to the UN Environment Programme. At Interpol, which facilitates international law enforcement cooperation, wildlife smuggling is a priority, but national governments have stipulated that the funding and investigative effort should be focused on the highest-profile threats, such as the slaughter of elephants and rhinos. David Higgins, manager of Interpol’s Environmental Security Unit, admitted the region of West Africa had not been a priority - and nor had the smuggling of great apes. Because such crimes did not threaten the economic well-being of a country, or its political stability, they did not compel governments to respond, he said, and the resources were simply not there. “Without the funding, we can’t do anything,” he said. “So with primates, unfortunately, our information is not as strong as it could be.” He urged states to step up and offer the required financial investment. “Yes, we need the global community’s attention on this and we call upon that level of support.” Back in Ivory Coast, it was the trafficking ringleader, Ibrahima Traore, who eventually led our reporters - and Interpol - to the blue room. He sent a video of the baby chimp and himself inside the room holding a piece of paper showing the date at the time of the deal - to show that the footage was genuine and that the animal had previously been captured and was ready for sale. His face was clearly visible and he seemed not to worry about incriminating himself. Days later our undercover reporter visited the property - purportedly to discuss arrangements for buying the chimpanzee - where they confirmed its presence and tipped off police. Ibrahima Traore was arrested and, along with his uncle Mohamed, is facing charges related to wildlife trafficking. The data captured from his phones and laptops revealed a goldmine of information about a sprawling international network of great ape traffickers, working across Europe, Africa, Asia and the Middle East. Cites certificates found on Traore’s computer documented the possible illegal movement of dozens of different species of primates, as well as other endangered species. The evidence also implicated Traore’s brother, Aboubacar, who was named in a Cites document last year because of his smuggling of endangered birds including African grey parrots. Ibrahima Traore’s father, Alhassane, also appeared to be involved. Records showed his bank account in Guinea’s capital Conakry was used to deposit payments – and it was that account that the BBC team was told to use. The detective in charge in Ivory Coast, Colonel Assoumou Assoumou, pledged to delve into the entire illegal supply chain - from the hunters to the traffickers to the buyers. “In 10 years, in 20 years, we won’t have any more chimpanzees,” he warned. “This species will disappear. That’s the reason why this cause was taken up by Interpol. Personally I am committed to fight against this phenomenon. “These are rare species and it should not be us, in our generation, that wipes them out.” As for the baby male chimp discovered in the blue room, he was initially taken to the Interpol building in Abidjan, before being handed over to wildlife officials from the Ministry of Water and Forests. They took him to the zoo in Abidjan, where he was fed and comforted and given a name by keepers: Nemley junior. He was then shown an older female who acts as an adoptive mother to two other infant chimps. After being gradually introduced to this new family, Nemley junior may live with them. But caring for an infant chimp is a long-term and costly commitment so two wildlife organisations with experience of infant chimpanzees have offered him homes in specialists sanctuaries, including the Born Free Foundation. Will Travers, president of Born Free, described the exotic pet trade as “sickening and cruel” and promised to help relocate the baby chimp. “If given the opportunity, we will do all we can, with the help of our specialists and the full participation of the local government agencies, to try and relocate Nemley junior to a registered chimpanzee sanctuary, where this little victim of the illegal wildlife trade can be given a life worth living, in the company of other chimps, for the rest of his life.” But whatever happens next, the orphan has certainly been left traumatised, according to Dr Cleve Hicks of the University of Warsaw, a specialist in chimp behaviour who set up a chimp sanctuary in the Democratic Republic of Congo. “Mainly they have a broken heart - they’ve seen their mothers die,” he said. Dan Bucknall, of the wildlife charity Tusk, agreed that recovery could be “very difficult with such clever sentient animals” but added that chimpanzees were resilient creatures. “In the right hands, with good carers, and with constant attention, they can do OK and the prospects are good.”"
Could Southern's drivers reject the deal?,"Some of Southern's drivers say they are not happy with the deal ""It's two weeks of my life I'll never get back. But we finally got there."" Bizarrely, the bosses of both sides said exactly the same thing to me when I interviewed them last week, moments after they'dannounced a dealto resolve the worst of the Southern rail strikes. Mick Whelan from Aslef and Nick Brown from GTR (Southern's parent company) looked shattered but pleased with their agreement. But was everyone cracking the champagne corks too soon? Aslef's 1,000 or so drivers still need to vote on the deal and there are possible signs that they might just kick it out. Union blasts Southern deal as 'betrayal' Driver union reaches Southern rail deal I spoke to a couple of Southern's train drivers over the weekend and they were not happy. One wrote this to me: ""GTR, 'We will agree to carry on doing exactly what we want.' Aslef, 'OK, we'll agree to that then.'"" Strikes on the Southern network caused chaos for passengers He went on: ""I'm very much of the opinion it will be a resounding 'no' vote (when members vote). The feeling is the union has sold us out."" Another driver also said that everyone he'd spoken to will vote no to the deal, again saying that they felt let down and that the company had got away with it. He even suggested that some of his colleagues might leave Aslef and join the RMT union instead. The RMT is still in dispute with Southern over the same issue and was vitriolic about the deal over the weekend. True, this is just the opinion of two drivers who've been chatting to their colleagues. But it suggests some anger at what they are being asked to sign up to. I understand that there is going to be a meeting in Brighton on Tuesday, where Aslef reps will try to sell the deal to members. It's bound to be frosty. Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan says the deal was discussed in ""good faith"" All of this doesn't necessarily mean that Aslef's drivers will vote against the agreement. When I interviewed Mick Whelan last week he told me: ""I'm not in the habit of making deals that my members don't like."" Then there are the London members who already use driver-only-operated trains and may not feel as strongly over this crunch issue. Plus, Aslef doesn't pay members during industrial action, and the double whammy of losing strike-day pay plus overtime may be enough to cut their appetite for a fight. If the drivers do vote against the deal though, it's hard to see where the next breakthrough in this dispute might come. If two weeks of ""incredibly intense"" negotiation at the TUC can't solve it, what can? If Aslef drivers vote no to the deal, could more strikes lie ahead? Presumably, Aslef would be forced to call more crippling strikes, which would also turn up the heat on the government to take over either part or all of this troublesome, complex behemoth of a franchise. I can tell you, ministers are not keen to seize control. Meanwhile, the RMT union, which represents the guards/conductors, has vowed to keep fighting. Their strikes don't have the same impact as Aslef's, with the last one only knocking out around 30% of services. But even that might change if their angry Aslef colleagues decide not to cross picket lines. Anyway, we should know all on 16 February when the ballot result comes back.

Do 'longest flight' records matter?6 February 2017 (07:53:56),"Qatar's Boeing 777-200LR is welcomed with a water cannon shower on Monday in Auckland Qatar Airways has launched what it says is the longest current non-stop commercial route, after completing a journey from Doha to Auckland. Flight QR920 landed on Monday after 16 hours and 23 minutes, slightly quicker than expected. The Boeing 777-200LR jet was showered with water cannons on arrival - a tradition for airlines on new routes. Carriers like to talk up these records, but how are they measured and do they really matter? Longest (time) or furthest (distance) are the two key distinctions to make, but it's not as simple as it might sound. Qatar Airways flight between Doha and Auckland had four pilots, 15 cabin crew, and catered for 2,000 cold drinks to be served The distance between two cities doesn't vary for airlines of course, but they might choose to take alternative routes. For example, a carrier might choose to avoid flying over certain countries which can alter how far a plane flies from point A to point B. And airlines have been known to take unconventional routes. In October last year, Air India flew Delhi to San Francisco by crossing the Pacific rather than the Atlantic - a direction switch which added an extra 1,400km to the journey, making the 15,127km trip the longest ever non-stop flight by distance. By comparison, Qatar's new route is 14,535km. But regardless of the route, flight time is dependent on headwinds or tailwinds. For example, Qatar's return leg from Auckland to Doha is expected to take about 18 hours because of headwinds. And though Air India went the ""long way round"", favourable tailwinds meant the journey took about two-and-a-half hours less than its conventional route. ""The longest flying time doesn't always correspond with the longest distance,"" says Ellis Taylor of Flightglobal. ""Of course, from a passenger perspective, the flying time is probably the best measurement."" Record-breaking flights may make headlines. But new long-haul flights mean nothing if they're treated as a standalone route, says Mr Taylor. Rather, it's what a new route brings to the airline's existing network. Australia's Qantas flies some of the world's longest routes ""On its own, it wouldn't be viable to fly between Auckland and Doha, but Qatar is focusing on the passengers from Auckland going on to Europe, Africa, the US or elsewhere,"" says Mr Taylor. ""In that light, even though it may take some time for the route to stack up from a profit perspective, it may help the economics of its wider network."" Historically, most of the major long-haul routes have been serviced by legacy airlines like Singapore Airlines and Australia's Qantas. But adding new routes have allowed newer airlines like Qatar, and perhaps most notably Emirates, to expand their business very rapidly. ""It's also about reach for Middle East airlines striving to outdo each other,"" says Geoffrey Thomas of Airlineratings.com. Longest flight records will continue to change hands as airlines launch new routes, and the range capability of aircraft improves. Last year, for example, Qantas revealed itwould fly direct between Perth and Londonfrom March 2018, a flight that will take 17 hours. Qatar Airways tweeted the arrival of their long-haul flight, which landed slightly ahead of schedule The price of fuel and the types of planes which airlines buy will be the determining factors in opening new routes ""With the arrival of the 777-8X in 2022, new records such as flights from Sydney to New York and Sydney to London will be set,"" says Mr Thomas. ""The 777-8X will be the ultimate long haul airliner."" But remember, for routes to be viable, they also require people to buy tickets. That depends on passengers being willing to sit in their seats for 16, 17 or maybe 18 hours at a time. How long that desire will last (especially for travellers cramped up in economy) is something airlines will monitor carefully.

Should you have an extra bin in your bathroom?3 February 2017 (15:56:30),"Our bathrooms are filled with shampoo bottles, toilet rolls and cleaning products which could easily be put into our recycling bins when finished with. Yet research shows our green intentions are washed away as soon as we step near a toilet. Now a business group has come up with an idea for how to combat this problem - two bathroom bins. The Circular Economy Taskforce, who were brought together by Prince Charles's Business in the Community environment charity, says it could boost recycling. So should two bins really sit alongside your stack of loo roll in the bathroom? Why should people have two bins in their bathrooms? ""It's trying to address the problem that people are less likely to recycle packaging for things we use in our bathrooms than for things we use in other rooms of the house,"" says Jonny Hazell, senior policy adviser for environmental think tank Green Alliance. The Recycle Now campaign points to its statistics, which show that while 90% of packaging is recycled in our kitchens, only 50% is being recycled in the bathroom. ""Often homes have one central recycling bin located in the kitchen, so when in the shower or washing your face it can be tricky to remember to transfer it to that bin,"" it says. ""This is why having a recycling bin or bag in the bathroom might be useful, if there is space."" Business in the Community says two bins could make it easier to separate out the plastics that can be recycled. ""But it doesn't have to be a bin, it could be as simple as a bag on the door handle that you bring down to the kitchen every week,"" it added. Where has this idea come from? While recycling has grown from 12% to 45% in the UK over the last decade, campaigners say the bathroom is an area that needs more focus. The Circular Economy Taskforce came up with the idea as part of its work looking at practical collaborative ways to boost recycling and re-use rates. ""The bathroom is one of the areas that has come up time and time again in the group as somewhere where both business and consumers can make a difference to help us all reduce our impact on the environment,"" says Business in the Community. ""Thinking about how different types of bins could boost recycling in the bathroom is just one example of a potential simple solution that could have a big impact."" Why are people failing to recycle their bathroom products? Campaigners believes it comes down not just to where a recycling bin is located but also to confusion over what can be recycled. Recycle Now says: ""There can also be confusion about what can or can't be recycled with bathroom products. ""For example many people don't realise that bleach bottles can be easily recycled - simply make sure it's empty and put the lid back on. ""Recycling just one bleach bottle saves enough energy to power a street light for 6.5 hours, so the value quickly adds up."" Research from the University of Exeter,externalalso found that people who threw away waste in the bathroom saw it as being ""dirty"" and were less likely to recycle it. Going through your bathroom bin to separate out what can and can't be recycled can seem off-putting,"" says Business in the Community. It added: ""There is also a lot of confusion around what can be recycled in the bathroom, for example many consumers are confused by aerosols."" How much recyclable waste comes from a bathroom? A surprising amount. Typical products include: Plastic shampoo, conditioner and shower gel bottles, plastic moisturiser bottles (such as for hand cream and body lotion), glass face cream pots (plus the cardboard packaging they come in), perfume and aftershave bottles, aerosols for deodorant, air freshener and shaving foam, bleach and bathroom cleaner bottles, toothpaste boxes and toilet roll tubes. Is a lack of recycling in bathrooms a real problem? Every little helps, is the message from environmental and recycling groups. ""In general, the less we recycle, the more water and energy we need to use to produce the materials we use in our daily lives,"" said Mr Hazell. Recycle Now says recycling reduces the amount we are sending to landfill and makes use of resources already available rather than making them from scratch. ""Ultimately this means reduced levels of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere which contribute to climate change,"" it added. ""For instance it takes 75% less energy to make a plastic shampoo bottle from recycled plastic compared with using virgin materials."" Can two bins have a meaningful impact on recycling overall? ""Ensuring you recycle in the bathroom can make a big difference,"" says Recycle Now. ""It would save Â£135,000 in landfill costs if every UK household threw their next empty shampoo bottles into the recycling bin. ""On top of this, if everyone recycled one more toilet roll tube it would save enough cardboard inner tubes from landfill to go round the M25 38 times."" But what if you don't have the space for two bins? There are other options. Hang a reusable bag on the bathroom door so you can transfer your recyclable items straight into the recycling bin. Or opt for a bin with split compartments which can be used to separate recyclable and non-recyclable items. UK recycling figure drops for first time Are you rubbish at recycling?

Queen in sapphire for 65 years on throne,"This video can not be played The King's Troop Royal Horse Artillery fire a gun salute in Green Park A 41-gun salute has been fired in London's Green Park to mark the Queen's 65 years on the throne. Gun salutes also took place in Cardiff, Edinburgh and York. The Queen has become the first British monarch to reach a sapphire jubilee, after becoming theUK's longest-reigning monarchin 2015, aged 89. A portrait of the Queen by British photographer David Bailey has been reissued for the anniversary.
