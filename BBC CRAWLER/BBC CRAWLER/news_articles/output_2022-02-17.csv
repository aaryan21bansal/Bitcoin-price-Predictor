Trump must testify in NY investigation says judge,"A judge has ruled that Donald Trump and two of his children must testify in a New York investigation Former US President Donald Trump and two of his children must answer questions under oath in a New York investigation into their business practices, a judge has ruled. New York's attorney general has accused the Trump Organization of obtaining tax breaks and loans through ""fraudulent or misleading asset valuations"". Mr Trump must sit for sworn testimony within 21 days. He denies the accusations, and is expected to appeal the decision. He could also invoke his right to remain silent in any deposition. The Trump Organization said in a statement to the BBC: ""The entire system is corrupt."" On Thursday, New York Supreme Court Judge Arthur Engoron said that Mr Trump, his son Donald Trump Jr, 44, and daughter Ivanka Trump, 40, must each comply with legal orders that prosecutors issued in December. New York Attorney General Letitia James' investigation had uncovered ""copious evidence of possible financial fraud"", the judge said, giving her a ""clear right"" to question under oath the former president and two of his children involved in the business. Trump accountants say financial reports unreliable Mr Trump, 75, has called the investigation politically motivated and a ""witch-hunt"" by Ms James, a Democrat. Whether Donald Trump will actually answer questions under oath about his business practices is an open question. An appeal is almost certainly forthcoming. And if that is unsuccessful, Mr Trump may decline to answer the questions, as his son Eric Trump did under similar circumstances in 2020. That's what the former president's lawyers are already recommending. Having their client sit for what would surely be a multi-hour grilling by New York lawyers looking for verbal missteps or contradictory assertions is not their idea of sound legal strategy. This is far from the end of the line, but it still was a rough day for the former president. This civil case, and the criminal probe in Manhattan, aren't going away anytime soon. And having a judge, in a written order, say that there is ""copious evidence of fraud"" isn't a good look - particularly for a man who likes to boast of his unparalleled business acumen. The investigation, which was opened in 2019, aims to prove the government's claims that Mr Trump inflated the value of his assets to banks when seeking loans. The fraud is alleged to have taken place before he took office. Attorneys for Mr Trump had attempted to sue Ms James in a bid to prevent her from questioning the former president and his children. Ms James hailed the judge's decision as a victory, saying that ""justice has prevailed"". The civil case is separate to a Manhattan criminal investigation into the Trump Organization's practices. In court, attorneys for Mr Trump argued that testifying in the civil case would improperly allow the state to circumvent a law that bars prosecutors from calling someone to testify before a criminal grand jury unless they are granted immunity. ""If she [Ms James] wants sworn testimony from my client, he's entitled to immunity,"" Mr Trump's defence attorney, Ronald Fischetti said. ""He gets immunity for what he says, or he gets nothing.""

UK scraps rich foreign investor visa scheme,"Visas offering foreign investors fast-track residency in the UK are being scrapped with immediate effect, the home secretary has confirmed. Priti Patel said ending Tier 1 investor visas, for those spending at least Â£2m, was the start of a ""renewed crackdown on illicit finance and fraud"". The scheme was introduced in 2008 to encourage wealthy people from outside the EU to invest in the UK. It has been under review for some time, after concerns it is open to abuse. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. But the move has been brought forward, with the government saying it was part of their ""new plan for immigration"". How much Russian money is there in the UK? Investor visas halted over money laundering The Tier 1 (investor) visa, often called a ""golden visa"", offers residency to those investing Â£2m or more in the UK, and allows their families to join them. Holders of these visas can then apply for permanent residency in the UK, at a speed depending on how much they invest. A Â£2m investment allows an application within five years, shortened to three years with Â£5m or two years if Â£10m is invested. But the route to residency is now being closed with immediate effect, with the government saying it ""failed to deliver for the UK people and gave opportunities for corrupt elites to access the UK"". Ms Patel added: ""I have zero tolerance for abuse of our immigration system. Under my new plan for Immigration, I want to ensure the British people have confidence in the system, including stopping corrupt elites who threaten our national security and push dirty money around our cities. ""Closing this route is just the start of our renewed crackdown on fraud and illicit finance. We will be publishing a fraud action plan, while the forthcoming Economic Crime Bill will crackdown on people abusing our financial institutions and better protect the taxpayer."" The Home Office said settlement in the UK will now be conditional on applicants ""executing an investment strategy that can show genuine job creation and other tangible economic impacts - passively holding UK investments will no longer be enough to obtain settlement.â¯""â¯ Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: ""Shutting the door to Putin's cronies is not enough - too many of them have already walked through it with virtually no questions asked."" She urged the government to publish its report into those who came to the UK on the visas. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper also called for the review to be published and said a general plan was needed to ""stop illicit finance coming into the UK"". She said ""for years the Conservatives failed to stamp out the influence of Russian money in the UK"" adding that it had ""taken international condemnation of our failures... for the home secretary to act"". The Home Office has issued 2,581 investor visas to Russian citizens since the scheme was introduced in 2008. Several changes have been made since the investor visa scheme was launched, including extra checks on how and when applicants acquired their wealth. Banks are also now required to complete certain checks before opening accounts for applicants - who are also required to submit extra paperwork if their qualifying funds are invested through a chain of different companies. In 2020, Parliament's intelligence and security committee argued for a ""more robust"" approach to approving Tier 1 visas as part of areport on Russian influence in the UK,external. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of Tier 1 (Investor) visas granted to Russians as 14,516. The correct figure to the end of March 2020 was 2,581.

New York Times Wordle changes upset fans,"Wordle went from a handful of users to millions in a matter of months Wordle moved from its original web address to one run by the New York Times (NYT) last weekend and some players are not happy. Those still playing the daily word game on the original website - because they downloaded it or have not refreshed their browser - are getting different words to solve from the NYT version. That is because the paper has removed five-letter words it deemed offensive. But it has denied the other big fans' complaint - that it has got harder. Fans have not been impressed by the switchover The game, which asks players to find a five-letter word each day with clues along the way, has grown in popularity from fewer than 100 players in November to millions by the end of January. Its creator, Josh Wardle, initially said he didn't intend to make money from the game but later sold it to the NYT for an undisclosed seven-figure sum. Many fans took to Twitter to complain that since the NYT took over its stewardship - with words such as ultra and caulk - the puzzle appeared more challenging. Comedian Trevor Noah summed up many people's feelings, tweeting: ""Wordle isn't fun since the New York Times took over. Is it just me?"" Allow Twitter content?

The NYT denied any changes to gameplay, but it did admit that it was in the process of removing ""offensive words"" which included whore, slave and wench from both the list of acceptable guesses and the answers. That is why players of the original version are now out of sync with the NYT version. One of the big appeals of the game was that players were all solving the same word each day. The loss of this shared experience and the fact that there are now competing versions has angered fans. In response, the NYT is urging everyone to migrate to its version. Allow Twitter content?

GB men's curlers guaranteed at least silver after win,"This video can not be played Winter Olympics: Great Britain beat United States in men's curling semi-final - highlights 24th Winter Olympic Games Hosts:Beijing, ChinaDates: 4-20 February Coverage:Watch live on BBC TV, BBC iPlayer, BBC Red Button and online; listen on BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC Sounds; live text and highlights on BBC Sport website and mobile app Great Britain have their first medal of the Winter Olympics after the men's curling team defeated the United States 8-4 in a nail-biting semi-final to guarantee at least silver. Bruce Mouat, Grant Hardie, Bobby Lammie and Hammy McMillan stole one in the penultimate end and held out. The Scottish quartet will play Sweden for gold at 06:05 GMT on Saturday. Thirteen days in, it ends concerns the British team might finish without a medal for the first time since 1992. Follow Winter Olympics day 13 GB women squeeze into semi-final Eve Muirhead's women's side will have the chance to replicate the men's achievement when they play Sweden at 12:05 on Friday. ""The last two weeks for myself has been a bit of a rollercoaster,"" Mouat told BBC Sport. ""I'm just so excited to share this with the guys and that celebration at the end was just pure elation - I don't think I can sum it up any other way."" This video can not be played Winter Olympics: Great Britain men beat United States to reach curling final Having flown through the round-robin section with eight wins and just one defeat, Great Britain were favourites to move through to the gold-medal game. But they were up against the defending champions and skip John Shuster, who has a habit of performing on the big occasion, as he did four years ago when winning a shock gold. That feat looked on again when the USA stole two in just the second end, but Britain immediately took three back to settle early nerves. Another two followed in the fifth end for a 5-4 lead at the halfway point, and then it was all about Mouat and his team holding their nerve. The next three ends were blank as the game became cagey, but crucially in the ninth end Mouat produced a terrific draw to steal one and increase the lead to two heading into the final end. And in the last, Shuster could not produce the miracle shot for two that would have rescued his side. Instead, the British side will at least emulate the achievement of Dave Murdoch's rink in 2014 by securing silver - and have the chance to upgrade to gold. ""I'm excited to play that game,"" Mouat added. ""We've got a day off tomorrow but just looking forward to hopefully going for that gold. I'm shaking.""

Elon Musk says US trying to 'chill' his free speech,"Elon Musk's Twitter posts have brought him to the attention of financial regulators. Tesla boss Elon Musk has accused US regulators of targeting him for ""unrelenting investigation"" because of his criticism of the government. In a court filing, the billionaire says the Securities and Exchange Commission has engaged in ""outsized efforts"" to monitor the firm that ""seem calculated to chill his exercise"" of free speech. The letter heightens the battle between Mr Musk and financial regulators over his social media activity. His Twitter posts often move markets. In 2018, the SEC ordered Mr Musk to submit to increased oversight of his posts about Tesla aspart of a settlement into claims that he misled investors in 2018with a post about taking the electric car company private. The SEC hasrepeatedly raised questionssince about Mr Musk running afoul of the agreement, in which Mr Musk agreed to give Tesla officials pre-approval of posts about the company. In November, regulators subpoenaed the firm, requesting information about its governance processes related to the order.

Tesla sued over alleged racial discrimination Musk's brain chip firm denies animal cruelty claim In the letter to Judge Alison Nathan, who is overseeing the 2018 settlement, the billionaire's attorney Alex Spiro accused regulators of ""weaponizing the consent decree by using it to try to muzzle and harass Mr. Musk and Tesla"". ""The SEC seems to be targeting Mr. Musk and Tesla for unrelenting investigation largely because Mr. Musk remains an outspoken critic of the government,"" he wrote on behalf of Mr Musk and Tesla. ""The SEC's outsized efforts seem calculated to chill his exercise of First Amendment rights rather than to enforce generally applicable laws in even-handed fashion"". He said the SEC had opened ""serial investigations"" without seeking guidance from the court and that the agency was overdue to distribute to investors the $40m in penalties it collected as part of the 2018 settlement. The SEC declined to comment. Mr Musk's Twitter musings on topics from Tesla to crypto currency have frequently appeared to move market prices. He has used his perch to criticise the SEC, saying oversight at the agency was ""broken"". Mr Musk has also criticised US President Joe Biden for not acknowledging the contributions of SpaceX or Tesla, most recently dismissing the president as a ""damp [sock emoji] puppet"".

"UK scraps rich foreign investor visa schemeFast-track Tier 1 visas ended with immediate effect, amid concerns over fraud and security.","Visas offering foreign investors fast-track residency in the UK are being scrapped with immediate effect, the home secretary has confirmed. Priti Patel said ending Tier 1 investor visas, for those spending at least Â£2m, was the start of a ""renewed crackdown on illicit finance and fraud"". The scheme was introduced in 2008 to encourage wealthy people from outside the EU to invest in the UK. It has been under review for some time, after concerns it is open to abuse. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. But the move has been brought forward, with the government saying it was part of their ""new plan for immigration"". How much Russian money is there in the UK? Investor visas halted over money laundering The Tier 1 (investor) visa, often called a ""golden visa"", offers residency to those investing Â£2m or more in the UK, and allows their families to join them. Holders of these visas can then apply for permanent residency in the UK, at a speed depending on how much they invest. A Â£2m investment allows an application within five years, shortened to three years with Â£5m or two years if Â£10m is invested. But the route to residency is now being closed with immediate effect, with the government saying it ""failed to deliver for the UK people and gave opportunities for corrupt elites to access the UK"". Ms Patel added: ""I have zero tolerance for abuse of our immigration system. Under my new plan for Immigration, I want to ensure the British people have confidence in the system, including stopping corrupt elites who threaten our national security and push dirty money around our cities. ""Closing this route is just the start of our renewed crackdown on fraud and illicit finance. We will be publishing a fraud action plan, while the forthcoming Economic Crime Bill will crackdown on people abusing our financial institutions and better protect the taxpayer."" The Home Office said settlement in the UK will now be conditional on applicants ""executing an investment strategy that can show genuine job creation and other tangible economic impacts - passively holding UK investments will no longer be enough to obtain settlement.â¯""â¯ Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesperson Layla Moran said: ""Shutting the door to Putin's cronies is not enough - too many of them have already walked through it with virtually no questions asked."" She urged the government to publish its report into those who came to the UK on the visas. Labour's shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper also called for the review to be published and said a general plan was needed to ""stop illicit finance coming into the UK"". She said ""for years the Conservatives failed to stamp out the influence of Russian money in the UK"" adding that it had ""taken international condemnation of our failures... for the home secretary to act"". The Home Office has issued 2,581 investor visas to Russian citizens since the scheme was introduced in 2008. Several changes have been made since the investor visa scheme was launched, including extra checks on how and when applicants acquired their wealth. Banks are also now required to complete certain checks before opening accounts for applicants - who are also required to submit extra paperwork if their qualifying funds are invested through a chain of different companies. In 2020, Parliament's intelligence and security committee argued for a ""more robust"" approach to approving Tier 1 visas as part of areport on Russian influence in the UK,external. Correction: An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated the number of Tier 1 (Investor) visas granted to Russians as 14,516. The correct figure to the end of March 2020 was 2,581.

"Sex offender who fled open prison caughtPaul Robson, 56, spent four days on the run after going missing from an open prison on Sunday.Lincolnshire","Police had said sex offender Paul Robson could be ""anywhere in the country"" and the public should not approach him A sex offender branded a ""menace to females"" has been recaptured after fleeing from an open prison. Paul Robson, 56 was given a life sentence in 2000 after he sexually assaulted a woman at knifepoint. He walked out of HMP North Sea Camp, in Lincolnshire, on Sunday and spent four days on the run. Robson was arrested in Skegness at about 09:30 GMT on Thursday after a call from a member of the public who recognised him, police said. Announcing his capture, Ch Supt Kate Anderson, from Lincolnshire Police, thanked members of the public who had shared the force's appeals to find Robson and reported potential sightings. ""At this stage, we don't believe he had any accomplices or believe that he's committed further offences,"" she said. Officers had worked ""tirelessly"" in their search for Robson, she added. More stories across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Further photos of Robson were issued as part of the force's appeals to locate him Police had issued several appeals to locate Robson since he absconded. Further images of him were released on Wednesday, with the force suggesting he may have changed his appearance. It is understood Robson was returned to a closed prison and will not be eligible to apply for parole for at least a further two years. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said Robson would ""face an uphill struggle proving he can ever be trusted to move to an open prison again"". Robson, originally from Newcastle, was jailed at Oxford Crown Court for the attempted rape and indecent assault of his victim.

LiveLiveUS claims Russia could fabricate reason to invade8 minutes ago,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia could fabricate an excuse to invade its neighbour He tells a UN meeting that Moscow could ""manufacture"" a pretext to attack, warning that military action could begin imminently But Russia's deputy foreign minister says the allegations - which have been echoed by other Western leaders - are ""baseless"" It comes after US President Joe Biden warned an invasion could be launched in the coming days, but said a diplomatic solution was still possible Western allies earlier warned that reports of shelling in Ukraine's Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" effort Russia says reports of an escalation in violence are concerning, but accuses the West of hysteria It has expelled a senior US diplomat to Moscow as tensions continue to rise over the crisis Russia denies plans to invade Ukraine and says some of the 100,000 troops amassed at the border are leaving after military drills But a senior US official says 7,000 extra Russian troops have arrived at Ukraine's borders in recent days Edited by James Clarke We're ending our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a recap of some of the key events today:  Here's our main story on Biden's comments today. The US embassy in Moscow Russia delivered a list of demands to the US ambassador on Thursday, accusing Washington of ignoring its security demands. âNo âRussian invasion of Ukraineâ, which the United States and its allies have officially been announcing since last fall, is happening, nor is one being planned,â says the letter from the Russian Foreign Ministry. ""In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,"" the lengthy document says. It called the US refusal to commit to never allowing Ukraine to join Nato ""not constructive"" and called for Nato troops to pull back to countries that joined the alliance before 1997. ""We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics,"" it added. The letter adds that Russia is prepared to negotiate on arms control treaties, and the possible Russian inspection of US missile bases in Poland and Romania, but only if its security concerns are addressed. âWe welcome the readiness of the United States for appropriate consultations,â the document says, adding: âThis work cannot replace the settlement of the key problems posed by Russia.â The US did not immediately respond to the list of demands. The UK is scrapping a fast-track visa scheme for foreign investors over ""security concerns"" amid concerns of illicit Russian money in Britain. The Tier 1 investor visas had allowed residency in the UK for those investing at least Â£2m, but new applicants will no longer be accepted. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the Tier 1 scheme is being closed to ""clamp down on illicit finance"". ""This kind of malign activity, including what we are seeing from Russia right now, has no place in the UK,"" she says. Read more on this story here. More details are emerging of the reported shell blast that struck a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine. Three staff at the nursery were injured when a projectile - which Ukraine says was fired by Russian-backed separatists - blew a whole in a wall. A mother of a child at the kindergarten says she and her husband rushed to the kindergarten in a panic when they heard about the strike in the village of Stanitsya Luhanska. A woman stands among the debris after the shelling of a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine The woman, who refused to give her name, told AFP news agency: ""I was very scared. The kindergarten has no bomb shelter. It only has thick walls. But they even managed to puncture those. I still canât calm down."" Natalia Slesareva, who works at the kindergarten, said it was a close call that everybody escaped unharmed. ""The children were eating breakfast when it hit,"" she told AFP. ""It hit the gym. After breakfast, the children had gym class. So another 15 minutes, and everything could have been much, much worse."" A Ukrainian soldier in a trench on the frontline In the past few hours: We've been hearing a lot about the Minsk agreements as tensions  escalate over the crisis. The agreements - named about the capital of Belarus where they were signed in 2014 and 2015 - are designed to keep a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Among the deal's 13 points are a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the withdrawal of ""all foreign armed formations, military equipment and also mercenaries"" from Ukraine. They also give special status to the separatist-controlled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk and give the Ukrainian government ""full control"" of Ukraine's border with Russia. But there are fundamental differences in how the agreements are interpreted by Kyiv and Moscow. While Ukraine sees the agreements as the basis for reuniting Ukraine and re-establish its sovereignty, Russia sees them as a chance to grant autonomy to the separatist territories. The agreements have never been fully implement by both sides. Read more: What are the Minsk agreements? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The latest satellite images provided by the US space technology company Maxar show that wide-scale Russian military activity persists close to Ukraine's borders, despite recent Russian claims of de-escalation and withdrawal. Taken in mid-February, they illustrate that Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides - on its borders with both Russia and Belarus - by Russian military hardware and troop concentrations. It is important to remember that Russia's current military presence of around 30,000 troops in Belarus, while alarming to both Ukraine and NATO, are part of joint, scheduled exercises that are due to conclude on February 20. So a key test of Moscow's intentions will come after that date when satellite images will reveal if the bulk of Russian forces there have remained or departed. Satellite images show Russian military activity Russia says it ordered the expulsion of the deputy ambassador at the US embassy in Moscow in response to the US expulsion of a senior official at the Russian embassy in Washington. Earlier the US called the expulsion of its senior diplomat, Bart Gorman, ""unprovoked"" and an ""escalatory step"". The Russian foreign ministry has issued a statement in response to what it said were media reports presenting it as ""almost a deliberate escalation on the Russian side"". The statement says: ""The American diplomat was indeed ordered to leave Russia,
but strictly in response to the unreasonable expulsion of the
Minister-Counsellor of our Embassy in Washington, despite his
status as a leading official"". Ukrainian-born residents in the south of England say they are worried about family still living in the country. Hanna Greentree lives in Fareham with her husband and daughter, but her 65-year-old mother lives on her own in Ukraine. Khrystyna Chelak moved to the UK 15 years ago and lives in Caversham but still has family in Ukraine.

This video can not be played Ukrainian families in the south speak about concerns Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stopped by the UN Security Council en route to Munich to deliver a dire warning about Russian plans to invade Ukraine. He ignored admonitions by the Russian ambassador to avoid making a âcircusâ out of the meeting by âplaying to the camerasâ with such âspeculation"". His speech was the latest installment of the administrationâs aggressive information war. Itâs made a strategic decision to go public with intelligence, believing that calling out Russiaâs so-called âplaybookâ at every opportunity could serve as a deterrent to conflict. But Blinken was clearly mindful that such interventions carry risks. He made a nod to one of his predecessors, Colin Powell, whoâd argued a case for invading Iraq in 2003 which turned out to be false. âLet me be clear,â he said. âI am here today not to start a war but to prevent one.â The US would be relieved and would gladly accept any criticism about its rhetoric if Russia did not invade, he said. In the meantime, he laid out clearly, step by step, how US intelligence believes Russia could carry out an attack, starting with manufacturing a pretext to raining bombs and missiles on Kyiv. A howitzer fires during Russia-Belarus joint military exercises It's quite easy to lose track of what's been going on with all those military exercises near Ukraine's borders in recent days, with countless claims and counterclaims voiced by different players. Here's a timeline to get you up to speed: - From10 February, Russia has been holding massive drills on the territory of its key ally Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour - US officials have warned that up to30,000 Russian troopsmay have been involved in the drills, which are set to end on20 February - Russia has also massed troops along Ukraine's eastern border, and has been holding exercises in Crimea - a southern Ukrainian peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014 - Russia has since said that some of troops have been returning to their permanent bases - but Ukraine and its Western allies are sceptical - In addition, from13 Februarythe Russian Navy has been staging firing exercises in the Black Sea. The drills are set to end on19 February -Meanwhile, Ukraine - fearing that it could be encircled from the north, east and south - has been staging its own military exercises across its territory - Ukraine has also been boosting its territorial defence - weapons-trained civilian volunteers who could be called in case of a foreign invasion  Fergal KeaneBBC News, Northern Ukraine Maj Sergiy Khomenko says he serves to protect Ukraine's independence The Ukrainian border guards scan the snowy forest for any sign of Russian movement. They stand guard at the Senkivka crossing, where the Kremlin once celebrated the unity of the Soviet world. A few truck drivers heading south to the capital, Kyiv, cluster near the Three Sisters monument - a white obelisk erected back in 1975 to mark where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. Maj Sergiy Khomenko, 29, comes from a military family and grew up in a border village. The current crisis with Russia would have been unimaginable in his parents' youth. But he serves a Ukraine that has been consistently pushing away from the orbit of Moscow. ""The independence of Ukraine is enshrined in all our documents. It is in our constitution. As a military man, I need to protect this,"" he tells me. Read the story in full here. In a video posted to its official Twitter account, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has warned that ""a considerable number of civilians will die"" if Russia chooses to attack Ukraine. In a video update posted on Thursday, the MoD said that it has seen no evidence to substantiate Russian claims that its forces are withdrawing from the border region and ""can conduct an invasion without further warning"". The video also outlined a number of reasons that Russian President Vladimir Putin would want to launch a military operation in Ukraine, including a belief that is it is a ""strategically important buffer zone"" between Russia and Nato, as well as its cultural and historical ties to Russia. ""It [Russia] does not accept Ukraine as an independent state,"" the video's narrator says. ""But it is an independent state"". The Russian forces amassed on Ukraine's borders are ""beyond anything needed"" for large-scale military exercises and could directly threaten Kyiv, the MoD video said. ""Defence intelligence assesses that [Putin] would be willing to sustain thousands of casualties to get what he wants,"" it warned. The MoD ends with the message that Putin ""can still choose peace"" and diplomacy to de-escalate tensions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While tensions mount, the US government has urged its citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, citing the threat of an imminent Russian invasion. But not all US citizens who live in Ukraine are taking this advice. Many here don't believe that a full-scale attack on Kyiv is imminent, despite warnings from intelligence sources quoted in the media. BBC News Ukraine has spoken to some Americans living in the country, including businessmen, teachers and volunteers, and asked them about their decision to stay. ""I will not leave the country I call home,"" says Sean Almeida Sean Almeida, from Boston, has been building a business in Kyiv since 2014, and now, despite the threat, does not intend to flee Ukraine. ""Let Biden say what he wants, but I am not going to panic and leave the country that has long since become my home,"" he says.

Not if Russiaâs eleven-page written response to Washingtonâs proposal is anything to go by. The letter is full of criticism of the United States. The tone is bitter,
impatient and pretty uncompromising. Moscow detected âno constructive answerâ from the US to
Russiaâs key demands, such as an end to Nato enlargement eastwards. Russia is not softening its stance. Itâs insisting that all
US troops and weaponry be withdrawn from central and eastern Europe,
south-eastern Europe and the Baltics. Hard to see America agreeing to that. Then came the threat. Itâs one that President Putin has
already delivered: that if Moscow fails to receive the âlegally binding
security guaranteesâ it seeks, it will react with âmilitary-technical means.â What would those be? Moscowâs not saying - intentionally. To
keep the West guessing. Todayâs expulsion of the deputy US ambassador to Moscow adds
to the general sense of diplomacy stalling. Washington interprets the move as
an escalation. Russia doesnât want to be seen to be closing the door to
dialogue. And there are some areas â like arms control and risk reduction â
where common ground could be found. But Moscow has made it quite clear its
main concerns have not been addressed. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media We've had reaction from the Kremlin in response to the US president's comments earlier. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has criticised Joe Biden for saying that Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine ""within the next several days"". In remarks reported by the state RIA Novosti news agency, Peskov said:
   ""Unfortunately, tension continues to be whipped up with such statements."" UK Europe Minister James Cleverly tells the UN Security Council Russia is using ""increasing disinformation"" to ""fabricate a pretext"" to invade Ukraine. ""We are seeing increasing disinformation about events in the Donbas that are straight out of the Kremlin playbook,"" he says. ""A blatant attempt by the Russian Government to fabricate a pretext for the invasion of Ukraine."" Western allies have warned that recent reports of shelling in Ukraine's south-eastern Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" operation to justify an invasion. UK Europe Minister James Cleverly is also in New York addressing the UN Security Council. He says we're at a ""critical juncture to prevent further escalation"". ""Russia has deployed the forces necessary to invade Ukraine and now has them readied for action,"" he says. Despite Russian claims its forces are withdrawing, ""the opposite is in fact true and the Russian military build-up continues"", Cleverly says. ""Russia is patently failing to live up to the international commitments that it has made around military transparency by refusing to adequately explain its military build-up or to provide the necessary transparency to build trust or to de-escalate the situation."" We've heard more from US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, he tells the UN Security Council in New York that he has offered to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Europe next week. Additionally, Blinken says the US is proposing a meeting of the Nato-Russia council and permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, in a bid to resolve the tensions on Ukraine's borders ""without conflict"". These meetings, Blinken adds, could ""pave the way"" for a summit of key leaders to discuss mutual security concerns. ""As lead diplomats, we have a responsibility to make every effort for diplomacy to succeed and leave no diplomatic stone unturned,"" he says. Blinken adds that the US believes that the implementation of the Minsk Agreement is vital to ensuring a diplomatic path forward. He says the US would be ""relieved"" if its warnings about Russia are incorrect and US predictions proven wrong. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Obsolete devices leave bionic eye patients in darkThe retinal-implant manufacturer has shifted its focus, leaving users with little or no support.","Second Sight's website has stories from patients who have had the implant Hundreds of people who had retinal implants to improve their sight face an uncertain future as the technology they rely on is now obsolete. Second Sight stopped making its Argus II bionic eyes several years ago to focus on a brain implant instead. According to IEEE Spectrum,,externalwhich broke the story, it is now hoping to merge with a biopharmaceutical firm which does not make eye implants. Second Sight was contacted by the BBC but has not yet responded. Adam Mendelsohn, chief executive of Nano Precision Medical, with which Second Sight is planning to merge, told the BBC it would consider the issues raised by IEEE once the merger, scheduled for mid-2022 - was completed. ""I do intend to make this one of our priorities if and when I assume my leadership position in the combined company,"" Mr Mendelsohn said. According to Second Sight's website, its Argus II offers life-changing benefits for those with sight impairment, including ""enjoying mobility and independence"". ""Our mission is to develop neuro-stimulation technology to enhance the lives of blind individuals, while supporting our current users,"" it says. The implant takes the place of the eye's photoreceptors But IEEE Spectrum reports that Second Sight actually discontinued its retinal implants - which effectively take the place of photoreceptors in the eye to create a form of artificial vision - in 2019. It says the firm nearly went out of business in 2020 and is now concentrating on a brain device - the Orion - which also provides artificial vision, while providing only limited support to the 350 or so who have the implants. Surgery to implant the device typically takes a few hours and is followed by post-op training to help users interpret the signals from their devices. The website also promises updates. ""As technology improves, so will your Argus II implant - without the need for additional surgery. Enjoy programming flexibility and the capacity for future hardware and software upgrades."" The system consists of the implant, special glasses with a built-in camera and a video processing unit (VPU) that is attached around the wearer's waist. The camera on the glasses sends video to the VPU, which converts the images to patterns of black and white pixels and sends them back to a responder in the glasses, which in turn beams them wirelessly to an antenna on the outside of the eye. An implanted electrode array behind the retina receives the stimulation patterns from the user's glasses and stimulates the eye by creating flashes of light that correspond to the video feed and which are sent by the implant to the optic nerve to create a kind of artificial vision. It's clever and innovative tech, which has taken decades to create and was not cheap - estimated at around $150,000 (Â£110,000) excluding surgery and post-surgery training. People using body parts from private firms are increasingly vulnerable, says an expert in technology ethics But patients contacted by IEEE Spectrum voiced concern. One, Ross Doerr, said Second Sight failed to contact any of its patients after its financial difficulties in 2020. ""Those of us with this implant are figuratively and literally in the dark,"" he said. Another user, Jeroen Perk, had problems when his VPU system broke in November 2020. ""I had no vision, no Argus, and no support from Second Sight,"" he told the publication. He considered having the device surgically removed but decided to ask other patients and doctors familiar with the system for help, and luckily found spare parts. Second Sight told the magazine that during its financial difficulties it had had to reduce its workforce and ""was unable to continue the previous level of support and communication for Argus II users"". It has since contacted users and doctors, saying it will do its best to ""provide virtual support"". But no repairs or replacements are possible for the implants. Elizabeth M Renieris, professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, in the US, described the development as a cautionary tale. She told the BBC: ""This is a prime example of our increasing vulnerability in the face of high-tech, smart and connected devices which are proliferating in the healthcare and biomedical sectors. ""These are not like off-the-shelf products or services that we can actually own or control. Instead we are dependent on software upgrades, proprietary methods and parts, and the commercial drivers and success or failure of for-profit ventures."" Ethical considerations around such technology should in future include ""autonomy, dignity, and accountability"", she added.

Sex offender who fled open prison caught,"Police had said sex offender Paul Robson could be ""anywhere in the country"" and the public should not approach him A sex offender branded a ""menace to females"" has been recaptured after fleeing from an open prison. Paul Robson, 56 was given a life sentence in 2000 after he sexually assaulted a woman at knifepoint. He walked out of HMP North Sea Camp, in Lincolnshire, on Sunday and spent four days on the run. Robson was arrested in Skegness at about 09:30 GMT on Thursday after a call from a member of the public who recognised him, police said. Announcing his capture, Ch Supt Kate Anderson, from Lincolnshire Police, thanked members of the public who had shared the force's appeals to find Robson and reported potential sightings. ""At this stage, we don't believe he had any accomplices or believe that he's committed further offences,"" she said. Officers had worked ""tirelessly"" in their search for Robson, she added. More stories across Yorkshire and Lincolnshire Further photos of Robson were issued as part of the force's appeals to locate him Police had issued several appeals to locate Robson since he absconded. Further images of him were released on Wednesday, with the force suggesting he may have changed his appearance. It is understood Robson was returned to a closed prison and will not be eligible to apply for parole for at least a further two years. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said Robson would ""face an uphill struggle proving he can ever be trusted to move to an open prison again"".

"Post Office scandal 'nearly killed me', inquiry hears","Wendy Martin told an inquiry that the faulty accounting IT system created a situation where she was 'like a walking zombie' A former sub-postmistress has told an inquiry she ended up having a ""complete breakdown"" after faulty accounting software wrongly made it seem like she was stealing. Wendy Martin, who ran a post office in York, said the faulty Horizon system ""devastated"" her health and finances. The IT issues led to accounting errors at hundreds of UK post offices. Earlier, MPs urged ministers to sort compensation for all sub-postmasters wrongly accused of theft. Ms Martin, who only ran her branch for 20 months, told a public inquiry on Thursday she resorted to videoing herself cashing up, in order to show that she wasn't fiddling the figures, as the Horizon system suggested. ""My worst discrepancy one day was over Â£30,000,"" she said, adding that this was an amount she would effectively owe the Post Office. ""It was awful."" The former sub-postmistress said how she called the Horizon software helpline daily as her modem continually lost connection. Ms Martin said she was repeatedly told to unplug everything and turn it on again. She said she then noticed that accounting discrepancies would occur at the same times as the loss of connection. At the time, she closed her branch and refused to re-open until someone from Post Office headquarters addressed the issues with her computer system. Ms Martin told how she was shouted at on the phone by a senior member of the Post Office and told to re-open, which she refused to do. 'I want someone else jailed like I was' Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Postmistress: Post Office scandal 'ruined my life' Ms Martin's witness statement came on the day a Parliamentary Committee said the government needs to work faster to make sure all sub-postmasters wrongly accused of theft receive adequate compensation. The Business Committee has been looking at ways to speed up the compensation process, in parallel to the ongoing public inquiry into the scandal. Unlike many others involved in the scandal she was not prosecuted, neither was her contract terminated, but Ms Martin shut the branch after deciding she was fighting a losing battle. Describing suffering a breakdown as a result of the problems she was facing at work, Ms Martin said she ""just couldn't do it anymore"". ""I'd gone to a shade of grey that a human shouldn't be,"" she added, referring to kidney and liver issues that she suffered during her time at the branch. She said the rumours of her stealing pushed her to the point of wearing no make-up so that ""people could see how ill I looked"". Ms Martin is furious that she has lost so much financially: ""I've lost my businessâ¦ I'm in debt now until I'm in my mid-70sâ¦ I've lost the money I invested in my business. I've lost my retirement."" Father of five Mohammed Amir told an inquiry he believes his heart attack at age 33 was due to stress Another sub-postmaster told the inquiry he blames the Post Office for stress which led him to have a heart attack at just 33. Mohammed Amir, from Bolton, said at the time he was otherwise healthy - a regular gym-goer, sports coach and had quit smoking. ""It's been 14 years since I had that episode - I didn't realise it was because of all thisâ¦ I do blame Post Office for causing that,"" he told the inquiry. Mr Amir estimated the shortfalls across his branches totalled Â£130,000. ""I couldn't understand why, when we'd left the office in the evening, the accounts would be different the next day. We'd be there until late in the evening, after we'd closed at half past five, trying to work out what has happened. ""I was convinced it was the system but couldn't prove it,"" he said. No action was taken against Mr Amir - but he was part of the 555 sub-postmasters who won a settlement in 2019. 72 sub-postmasters and mistresses celebrated the quashing of their convictions last April Between 2000 and 2014, more than 700 sub-postmasters and mistresses were accused of theft, fraud and false accounting in the most widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history. A total of 72 have had their names cleared so far. The inquiry is expected to run for the rest of this year. The software was developed by Japanese company Fujitsu. The Post Office has previously said it is ""sincerely sorry for the impact of the Horizon scandal on the lives of victims and their families and we are in no doubt about the human cost"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added.

Russia looking for excuse to invade Ukraine - Biden,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia could fabricate an excuse to invade its neighbour He tells a UN meeting that Moscow could ""manufacture"" a pretext to attack, warning that military action could begin imminently But Russia's deputy foreign minister says the allegations - which have been echoed by other Western leaders - are ""baseless"" It comes after US President Joe Biden warned an invasion could be launched in the coming days, but said a diplomatic solution was still possible Western allies earlier warned that reports of shelling in Ukraine's Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" effort Russia says reports of an escalation in violence are concerning, but accuses the West of hysteria It has expelled a senior US diplomat to Moscow as tensions continue to rise over the crisis Russia denies plans to invade Ukraine and says some of the 100,000 troops amassed at the border are leaving after military drills But a senior US official says 7,000 extra Russian troops have arrived at Ukraine's borders in recent days Edited by James Clarke We're ending our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a recap of some of the key events today:  Here's our main story on Biden's comments today. The US embassy in Moscow Russia delivered a list of demands to the US ambassador on Thursday, accusing Washington of ignoring its security demands. âNo âRussian invasion of Ukraineâ, which the United States and its allies have officially been announcing since last fall, is happening, nor is one being planned,â says the letter from the Russian Foreign Ministry. ""In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,"" the lengthy document says. It called the US refusal to commit to never allowing Ukraine to join Nato ""not constructive"" and called for Nato troops to pull back to countries that joined the alliance before 1997. ""We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics,"" it added. The letter adds that Russia is prepared to negotiate on arms control treaties, and the possible Russian inspection of US missile bases in Poland and Romania, but only if its security concerns are addressed. âWe welcome the readiness of the United States for appropriate consultations,â the document says, adding: âThis work cannot replace the settlement of the key problems posed by Russia.â The US did not immediately respond to the list of demands. The UK is scrapping a fast-track visa scheme for foreign investors over ""security concerns"" amid concerns of illicit Russian money in Britain. The Tier 1 investor visas had allowed residency in the UK for those investing at least Â£2m, but new applicants will no longer be accepted. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the Tier 1 scheme is being closed to ""clamp down on illicit finance"". ""This kind of malign activity, including what we are seeing from Russia right now, has no place in the UK,"" she says. Read more on this story here. More details are emerging of the reported shell blast that struck a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine. Three staff at the nursery were injured when a projectile - which Ukraine says was fired by Russian-backed separatists - blew a whole in a wall. A mother of a child at the kindergarten says she and her husband rushed to the kindergarten in a panic when they heard about the strike in the village of Stanitsya Luhanska. A woman stands among the debris after the shelling of a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine The woman, who refused to give her name, told AFP news agency: ""I was very scared. The kindergarten has no bomb shelter. It only has thick walls. But they even managed to puncture those. I still canât calm down."" Natalia Slesareva, who works at the kindergarten, said it was a close call that everybody escaped unharmed. ""The children were eating breakfast when it hit,"" she told AFP. ""It hit the gym. After breakfast, the children had gym class. So another 15 minutes, and everything could have been much, much worse."" A Ukrainian soldier in a trench on the frontline In the past few hours: We've been hearing a lot about the Minsk agreements as tensions  escalate over the crisis. The agreements - named about the capital of Belarus where they were signed in 2014 and 2015 - are designed to keep a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Among the deal's 13 points are a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the withdrawal of ""all foreign armed formations, military equipment and also mercenaries"" from Ukraine. They also give special status to the separatist-controlled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk and give the Ukrainian government ""full control"" of Ukraine's border with Russia. But there are fundamental differences in how the agreements are interpreted by Kyiv and Moscow. While Ukraine sees the agreements as the basis for reuniting Ukraine and re-establish its sovereignty, Russia sees them as a chance to grant autonomy to the separatist territories. The agreements have never been fully implement by both sides. Read more: What are the Minsk agreements? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The latest satellite images provided by the US space technology company Maxar show that wide-scale Russian military activity persists close to Ukraine's borders, despite recent Russian claims of de-escalation and withdrawal. Taken in mid-February, they illustrate that Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides - on its borders with both Russia and Belarus - by Russian military hardware and troop concentrations. It is important to remember that Russia's current military presence of around 30,000 troops in Belarus, while alarming to both Ukraine and NATO, are part of joint, scheduled exercises that are due to conclude on February 20. So a key test of Moscow's intentions will come after that date when satellite images will reveal if the bulk of Russian forces there have remained or departed. Satellite images show Russian military activity Russia says it ordered the expulsion of the deputy ambassador at the US embassy in Moscow in response to the US expulsion of a senior official at the Russian embassy in Washington. Earlier the US called the expulsion of its senior diplomat, Bart Gorman, ""unprovoked"" and an ""escalatory step"". The Russian foreign ministry has issued a statement in response to what it said were media reports presenting it as ""almost a deliberate escalation on the Russian side"". The statement says: ""The American diplomat was indeed ordered to leave Russia,
but strictly in response to the unreasonable expulsion of the
Minister-Counsellor of our Embassy in Washington, despite his
status as a leading official"". Ukrainian-born residents in the south of England say they are worried about family still living in the country. Hanna Greentree lives in Fareham with her husband and daughter, but her 65-year-old mother lives on her own in Ukraine. Khrystyna Chelak moved to the UK 15 years ago and lives in Caversham but still has family in Ukraine.
She says some people are making preparations to leave and have found their nearest bomb shelters. Watch what they have to say below. This video can not be played Ukrainian families in the south speak about concerns Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stopped by the UN Security Council en route to Munich to deliver a dire warning about Russian plans to invade Ukraine. He ignored admonitions by the Russian ambassador to avoid making a âcircusâ out of the meeting by âplaying to the camerasâ with such âspeculation"". His speech was the latest installment of the administrationâs aggressive information war. Itâs made a strategic decision to go public with intelligence, believing that calling out Russiaâs so-called âplaybookâ at every opportunity could serve as a deterrent to conflict. But Blinken was clearly mindful that such interventions carry risks. He made a nod to one of his predecessors, Colin Powell, whoâd argued a case for invading Iraq in 2003 which turned out to be false. âLet me be clear,â he said. âI am here today not to start a war but to prevent one.â The US would be relieved and would gladly accept any criticism about its rhetoric if Russia did not invade, he said. In the meantime, he laid out clearly, step by step, how US intelligence believes Russia could carry out an attack, starting with manufacturing a pretext to raining bombs and missiles on Kyiv. A howitzer fires during Russia-Belarus joint military exercises It's quite easy to lose track of what's been going on with all those military exercises near Ukraine's borders in recent days, with countless claims and counterclaims voiced by different players. Here's a timeline to get you up to speed: - From10 February, Russia has been holding massive drills on the territory of its key ally Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour - US officials have warned that up to30,000 Russian troopsmay have been involved in the drills, which are set to end on20 February - Russia has also massed troops along Ukraine's eastern border, and has been holding exercises in Crimea - a southern Ukrainian peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014 - Russia has since said that some of troops have been returning to their permanent bases - but Ukraine and its Western allies are sceptical - In addition, from13 Februarythe Russian Navy has been staging firing exercises in the Black Sea. The drills are set to end on19 February -Meanwhile, Ukraine - fearing that it could be encircled from the north, east and south - has been staging its own military exercises across its territory - Ukraine has also been boosting its territorial defence - weapons-trained civilian volunteers who could be called in case of a foreign invasion  Fergal KeaneBBC News, Northern Ukraine Maj Sergiy Khomenko says he serves to protect Ukraine's independence The Ukrainian border guards scan the snowy forest for any sign of Russian movement. They stand guard at the Senkivka crossing, where the Kremlin once celebrated the unity of the Soviet world. A few truck drivers heading south to the capital, Kyiv, cluster near the Three Sisters monument - a white obelisk erected back in 1975 to mark where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. Maj Sergiy Khomenko, 29, comes from a military family and grew up in a border village. The current crisis with Russia would have been unimaginable in his parents' youth. But he serves a Ukraine that has been consistently pushing away from the orbit of Moscow. ""The independence of Ukraine is enshrined in all our documents. It is in our constitution. As a military man, I need to protect this,"" he tells me. Read the story in full here. In a video posted to its official Twitter account, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has warned that ""a considerable number of civilians will die"" if Russia chooses to attack Ukraine. In a video update posted on Thursday, the MoD said that it has seen no evidence to substantiate Russian claims that its forces are withdrawing from the border region and ""can conduct an invasion without further warning"". The video also outlined a number of reasons that Russian President Vladimir Putin would want to launch a military operation in Ukraine, including a belief that is it is a ""strategically important buffer zone"" between Russia and Nato, as well as its cultural and historical ties to Russia. ""It [Russia] does not accept Ukraine as an independent state,"" the video's narrator says. ""But it is an independent state"". The Russian forces amassed on Ukraine's borders are ""beyond anything needed"" for large-scale military exercises and could directly threaten Kyiv, the MoD video said. ""Defence intelligence assesses that [Putin] would be willing to sustain thousands of casualties to get what he wants,"" it warned. The MoD ends with the message that Putin ""can still choose peace"" and diplomacy to de-escalate tensions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While tensions mount, the US government has urged its citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, citing the threat of an imminent Russian invasion. But not all US citizens who live in Ukraine are taking this advice. Many here don't believe that a full-scale attack on Kyiv is imminent, despite warnings from intelligence sources quoted in the media. BBC News Ukraine has spoken to some Americans living in the country, including businessmen, teachers and volunteers, and asked them about their decision to stay. ""I will not leave the country I call home,"" says Sean Almeida Sean Almeida, from Boston, has been building a business in Kyiv since 2014, and now, despite the threat, does not intend to flee Ukraine. ""Let Biden say what he wants, but I am not going to panic and leave the country that has long since become my home,"" he says.

Not if Russiaâs eleven-page written response to Washingtonâs proposal is anything to go by. The letter is full of criticism of the United States. The tone is bitter,
impatient and pretty uncompromising. Moscow detected âno constructive answerâ from the US to
Russiaâs key demands, such as an end to Nato enlargement eastwards. Russia is not softening its stance. Itâs insisting that all
US troops and weaponry be withdrawn from central and eastern Europe,
south-eastern Europe and the Baltics. Hard to see America agreeing to that. Then came the threat. Itâs one that President Putin has
already delivered: that if Moscow fails to receive the âlegally binding
security guaranteesâ it seeks, it will react with âmilitary-technical means.â What would those be? Moscowâs not saying - intentionally. To
keep the West guessing. Todayâs expulsion of the deputy US ambassador to Moscow adds
to the general sense of diplomacy stalling. Washington interprets the move as
an escalation. Russia doesnât want to be seen to be closing the door to
dialogue. And there are some areas â like arms control and risk reduction â
where common ground could be found. But Moscow has made it quite clear its
main concerns have not been addressed. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media We've had reaction from the Kremlin in response to the US president's comments earlier. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has criticised Joe Biden for saying that Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine ""within the next several days"". In remarks reported by the state RIA Novosti news agency, Peskov said:
   ""Unfortunately, tension continues to be whipped up with such statements."" UK Europe Minister James Cleverly tells the UN Security Council Russia is using ""increasing disinformation"" to ""fabricate a pretext"" to invade Ukraine. ""We are seeing increasing disinformation about events in the Donbas that are straight out of the Kremlin playbook,"" he says. ""A blatant attempt by the Russian Government to fabricate a pretext for the invasion of Ukraine."" Western allies have warned that recent reports of shelling in Ukraine's south-eastern Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" operation to justify an invasion. UK Europe Minister James Cleverly is also in New York addressing the UN Security Council. He says we're at a ""critical juncture to prevent further escalation"". ""Russia has deployed the forces necessary to invade Ukraine and now has them readied for action,"" he says. Despite Russian claims its forces are withdrawing, ""the opposite is in fact true and the Russian military build-up continues"", Cleverly says. ""Russia is patently failing to live up to the international commitments that it has made around military transparency by refusing to adequately explain its military build-up or to provide the necessary transparency to build trust or to de-escalate the situation."" We've heard more from US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, he tells the UN Security Council in New York that he has offered to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Europe next week. Additionally, Blinken says the US is proposing a meeting of the Nato-Russia council and permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, in a bid to resolve the tensions on Ukraine's borders ""without conflict"". These meetings, Blinken adds, could ""pave the way"" for a summit of key leaders to discuss mutual security concerns. ""As lead diplomats, we have a responsibility to make every effort for diplomacy to succeed and leave no diplomatic stone unturned,"" he says. Blinken adds that the US believes that the implementation of the Minsk Agreement is vital to ensuring a diplomatic path forward. He says the US would be ""relieved"" if its warnings about Russia are incorrect and US predictions proven wrong. Â© 2025 BBC.

Additionally, Blinken says the US is proposing a meeting of the Nato-Russia council and permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, in a bid to resolve the tensions on Ukraine's borders ""without conflict"". These meetings, Blinken adds, could ""pave the way"" for a summit of key leaders to discuss mutual security concerns. ""As lead diplomats, we have a responsibility to make every effort for diplomacy to succeed and leave no diplomatic stone unturned,"" he says. Blinken adds that the US believes that the implementation of the Minsk Agreement is vital to ensuring a diplomatic path forward. He says the US would be ""relieved"" if its warnings about Russia are incorrect and US predictions proven wrong. Â© 2025 BBC.

KitKat and Durex makers warn of price rises,"KitKat and Nescafe-maker Nestle has warned it will increase the prices of its products due to the growing cost of producing its goods. Mark Schneider, boss of the food group, said it was ""safe assumption"" that prices would rise this year. He said there was ""no place"" in the company that was ""exempt of inflation"". Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods company behind Durex and Dettol, also said prices would rise, but added it hoped to absorb most of the increases. Reckitt's costs rose 11% in 2021, but chief executive Laxman Narasimhan said that wouldn't mean prices rising by that amount, as the company had ways to ""mitigate and manage pricing"" ""We care about the competitiveness of our brands,"" he told a conference call. Jeff Carr, chief financial officer, said the firm's costs had increased ""across the board"", ranging from crude oil and plastic, to shipping and wages. But he said that company was ""absorbing a significant part"" of higher operating costs through ""efficiency"" and ""better buying"". ""We are not passing it on to consumers,"" he said. ""We are passing some pricing onto consumers but we minimise that through the programmes we haveâ¦to absorb those cost increases."" Shares rose in the company by as much as 5.4% on Thursday. Living costs at 30-year high as households squeezed Meanwhile, Nestle said it had already lifted prices by 3.1% in the fourth quarter of its financial to offset rising operating costs. ""It is a safe assumption that our input cost increases for 2022 will be higher than 2021, that is something that we have to reflect in our pricing,"" said Mr Schneider ""There is almost no place in the company that is exempt of inflation now,"" he added. ""Some of these things you can hedge against, some not."" Consumer goods companies have previously warned of price rises for products due the rising costs of raw materials, energy and labour. It will raise pressure on households who are facinga cost of living crisis. Recent data showed that inflation hit a 30-year high of 5.5% in the year to January and the Bank of England forecasts that the cost of living could reach over 7% by spring - far above its 2% inflation target. Gas and electricity costs are set to rise in April when the new, higher energy price cap is introduced. At the same time companies, their staff and the self-employed will pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said big brand owners were facing an ""important test given pressures on the cost of living"". ""Consumers may not be able to keep stomaching price increases and so there is a risk they buy less of the popular and more expensive brands and/or trade down to cheaper options,"" she added. ""The big brand companies therefore face the risk of having to cut their prices just to maintain sales volumes."" Nestle, which also makes Cheerios and Smarties, revealed total sales increased by 3.3% to SwFr87.1bn (Â£69.5bn) last year. The firm's net profit grew by 38.2% to SwFr16.9bn. It said sales had been driven by strong demand for coffee, pet products and health foods during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Reckitt said its full-year sales had increased by 3.5%, ahead of expectations, on demand for hygiene and health products. Splitting its divisions, hygiene performed best with sales up 1.6% in the year to Â£5.9 billion, including strong sales of Air Wick, Lysol, Finish and Vanish. Sales of Durex condoms, KY lubricants and Veet hair removal products were boosted as lockdowns were lifted. The firm added sales of US cleaning and disinfecting spray Lysol were about 90% higher than 2019. It said it expected its health business to benefit from stronger cold and flu treatment sales. Last week, Unilever, the firm behind brands such as Marmite and Dove Soap, said it would put up its prices again this year as its overheads continue to rise. The company, which also makes Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said it was facing â¬3.5bn (Â£2.95bn) of extra costs in 2022 alone.

Rates to rise across all 11 councils areas,"The money generated by rates is used to pay for public services, with bills decided against the value of a property All of Northern Ireland's 11 councils have agreed rates increases for 2022-23. The highest percentage increase was by Mid Ulster District Council at 3.9%. The lowest percentage increase was agreed by the Antrim and Newtownabbey council area, which announced a 1.9% rise. The money generated by rates is used to pay for public services, with bills decided against the value of a property. Councils have cited the affect of the coronavirus pandemic as well as rising energy costs as factors behind the decision to increase rates. Planned council savings 'won't mean service cuts' Some councils froze their rates for last year as a way of acknowledging the financial pressures facing people during the pandemic. Rates are set at a regional level each year by Stormont and a rate is then also decided at a district level by each council in Northern Ireland. They regional rate covers regional services like hospitals and roads maintenance, while the district rate covers services like leisure centre facilities and waste management. Antrim and Newtownabbey Rates in the Antrim and Newtownabbey council area will increase by 1.9%. The SDLP had proposed a rates freeze for the year ahead, but Alliance councillor for Antrim Neil Kelly said that would be ""ridiculous and irresponsible"". Council chief executive Jacqui Dixon said it would be ""difficult to identify"" how to freeze rates ""without having an impact on our financial sustainability"". Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Those in the ABC Borough Council area will see a rise of 1.97% in their rates for the next financial year. It adds an extra Â£0.19 per week to bills, or Â£9.79 annually for the average household. For businesses, it means an increase of Â£13 per month or Â£156 for the year. Lord mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Alderman Glenn Barr, said the rate struck was well below inflation and was ""marginal in comparison to the significant increase in energy costs"". ""The council has tried to absorb as much of these costs as it can and in the face of other unavoidable pressures such as the new health and care levy,"" he said. Ards and North Down The rate agreed by Ards and North Down councillors represents a 2.75% increase for the borough. It equates to an increase of Â£1 per month for the average household (Â£12 a year), or Â£10 a month for the average business (Â£120 a year). The council has said the money will go towards redevelopment plans for Bangor Waterfront, better borough-wide broadband and an Innovation Hub, among other projects. Belfast Councillors have agreed a 2.99% increase for the district for 2022-23. The council said on its website that the rise fell well below the inflation rate. Broken down, the costs will mean an average increase of: Â£1.18 per month, or Â£14.11 per year, for a house Â£19.18 per month, or Â£230.22 per year, for an office unit Â£15.72 per month, or Â£188.60 per year, for a retail unit Causeway Coast and Glens The council agreed a rates rise of 3.49%. It means monthly bills for households in the district will increase by Â£1.40 (based on a house value of Â£121,478). Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Richard Holmes acknowledged the rise and cited several pressures. ""Unprecedented rises in utility and energy costs along with other factors including the ongoing health crisis and uncertainty around central government funding, has meant the organisation has been faced with more than Â£5.1m of additional financial pressures beyond our control,"" he said. Derry City and Strabane The rates for those in the Derry City and Strabane district will rise by 3.44%. It means the average domestic rate will increase by Â£0.33 per week, or Â£16.97 annually. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Alderman Graham Warke said the decision had been ""a very challenging process in a difficult economic climate"". Fermanagh and Omagh The rate struck by Fermanagh and Omagh District councillors was 2.72%. The average household (house price listed at Â£114,500) will pay an extra Â£0.23 per week or Â£11.96 annually. The council said the setting of the rate would raise approximately Â£38m in additional revenue, with the majority (Â£10m) earmarked for waste management. Northern Ireland has 11 council areas Lisburn and Castlereagh Councillors agreed to increase rates in the district by 3.64%. The council said that for a house with a value of Â£180,000 this would mean an increase in monthly costs of Â£1.73, or Â£20.70 a year. It cited improvements to full-fibre broadband across the district and investment in community facilities as ways in which the money gathered from rates would be used. Mid and East Antrim The rate struck for the Mid and East Antrim council area is 3.64%. It means the average household's bill will increase by Â£0.34 per week or Â£17.50 per year. The average business will see a Â£4.44 rise per week or Â£231 annually. Alderman Billy Ashe cited rising national insurance payments, national pay awards, fuel and energy increases, as well as insurance and landfill costs as factors behind the increase in rates bills for those in the borough. Mid Ulster Mid Ulster District Council struck the highest percentage increase for rates in Northern Ireland at 3.9%. The council said the increase had to be factored against a rates freeze applied for the 2021-22 financial year and that despite the rise, it was confident its rates would be among the lowest in Northern Ireland. The rates increase equates to a rise of Â£1.68 per month for the average household, or Â£16.75 per year. Factors cited for the rise in rates included Â£4.1m of additional financial pressures beyond the control of the council, which said it would deliver an Â£80m capital investment programme in the next three years. Newry, Mourne and Down The council agreed a 1.95% increase from last year's rates for the district. Councillor Cathy Mason said the council was happy the figure would not increase by more than 2%. ""It is crucially important that we strike a balance between supporting our ratepayers through challenging times and continuing to invest in the future of the district,"" she said.

What a day. Great Britain are finally guaranteed a medal at these Winter Olympics courtesy of the men's curlers. You can read all about their winhere. We're going to leave our text updates here but you can still watch the BBC TV coverage above. There will be a lot of dissection and discussion on a dramatic but controversial day. You can scroll down too for headlines, clips and reaction. We'll be back late tonight! Medal events:4 Biathlon(men's mass start),freestyle skiing(women's halfpipe, men's ski cross),speed skating(men's 1,000m) Attention will be firmly on the halfpipe and curling rink from a British perspective on Friday. Zoe Atkingoes in women's ski halfpipe (01:30-02:49) final, having qualified in fourth-place. At 12:05 GMT, theGreat Britain women's teamlook to follow their male counterparts in reaching the curling final. They meet Sweden in the semi-final. Elsewhere,Ollie Davies, who became the first Briton to reach the ski cross big final at a World Championship last year, marks his Olympic debut with the knockout runs beginning at 06:45 and the finals starting just before 08:00. Cornelius Kerstenreturns in speed skating's 1000m event. He's ranked 11th in the world over this distance in the 2021-22 season. Mica McNeillandMontell Douglasgo in the first two runs of the two-woman bobsleigh (12:00 and 13:30). Figure Skating - women's free skate Christopher DeanFormer Olympic champion on BBC TV The whole process has been farcical. The organisation, the politics surrounding it to get to this point has been a real mess. And the loser is figure skating, the women's event is suffering from it. The doping hasn't made her have the ability she has. It may have allowed her to train harder and longer, but her technique is second to none. The other two Russians competing are out of the same school so it casts a shadow over of the whole system. Did we not have this when the Olympics were in Sochi? They said 'ok, we are going to ban Russia, but we are going to let them all come under a different flag'. But it's the same systemic issue of the Russians coming to compete. But for sure I don't think Valieva knew what she was taking. Jayne TorvillFormer Olympic champion on BBC TV It's a difficult one. For her personally I would want her to be in the final. But is that fair to the other competitors? But as a young 15-year-old I don't think this was any of her doing, she has been very misguided. Figure skating - women's free skate Robin CousinsOlympic gold medallist figure skater on BBC TV The reaction toKamila Valieva's struggles in the women's singles finale continues. She missed out on the medal places after a poor final routine. Someone thought having her do
that was better than having her go home to her family and to wait and sort this
out, knowing she could have two more Olympics ahead of her. To see the talent and the
unquestionable quality of Valieva... To see it put into this arena in that way
should never have happened. Men's curling BBC Sport The rest of the men's curling team break down their performance: Grant Hardie:""After my missed shot in
the second end for them to steal a two, you're fearing the worst but we all
stuck together, turned that round and we're chuffed."" Bobby Lammy:""They're
quite out there as a team, they speak a lot, but we knew we had to bring that
energy as well. Even after that two, we knew we still had to keep together,
keep fighting, keep going for it and thankfully we managed to pull through. Hammie McMillan:""We
kept control. We were quite happy blanking and we knew the percentages at the
seventh end and not giving up a two was key.  Men's curling - GB into the final BBC Sport Bruce Mouat speaking to BBC Sport after securing Great Britain's place in the curling final:""I'm excited to play that game - got a day off tomorrow but just looking forward to hopefully going for that gold. I'm shaking. On having to play twice in one day:""We play a lot of these two games days on tour so we were happy to get the win. ""The last two weeks for myself has been a bit of a rollercoaster and I'm just so excited to share this with the guys and that celebration at the end was just pure elation - I don't think I can sum it up any other way."" Men's curling - USA 4-8 Great Britain Rhona HowieOlympic gold medallist curler on BBC TV Great Britain have trained so hard as a team, they work well together. They don't argue with each other, they discuss shots and come to an opinion they're all happy with. Everything is just so impressive with this young team. Men's curling - USA 4-8 Great Britain Look at the relief on Bruce Mouat's face... Men's curling - Great Britain 8-4 USA Rhona HowieOlympic gold medallist curler on BBC TV I'm speechless. What a game of curling, They were so patient. That was tough because Shuster was a showman out there. Four blank ends, they didn't panic, they stayed calm, and just kept the pressure on USA. Really impressive by them all They got Shuster rattled. They knew that - John was very loud in the first half of the game - they know that's how he plays the game. The GB team didn't let it bother them one iota. Just joining us? Here are the headlines on day 13. #bbcolympics Dawn Wilson:Just managed to stop myself giving a little ""whoop"" in the office as I am NOT  watching the #bbcolympics live feed of the curling, but is now a good time to mention I have a little crush on Bruce Mouat? Natalie Lewis:YES!!!  we are actually going to win a medal, an actual medal. Day 13 lucky for Team GB, well done Bruce & co. It's been meh daily us having bad luck and not winning anything, so thank you for giving us a bit of joy. Men's curling - USA 4-8 Great Britain It's going to be an early one on Saturday. The gold medal match begins at 06:05 GMT on Saturday morning. #bbcolympics Matt:Superb from Team Mouat! A fantastic win and a guaranteed medal at last.

This video can not be played Winter Olympics: Great Britain men beat United States to reach curling final Having flown through the round-robin section with eight wins and just one defeat, Great Britain were favourites to move through to the gold-medal game. But they were up against the defending champions and skip John Shuster, who has a habit of performing on the big occasion, as he did four years ago when winning a shock gold. That feat looked on again when the USA stole two in just the second end, but Britain immediately took three back to settle early nerves. Another two followed in the fifth end for a 5-4 lead at the halfway point, and then it was all about Mouat and his team holding their nerve. The next three ends were blank as the game became cagey, but crucially in the ninth end Mouat produced a terrific draw to steal one and increase the lead to two heading into the final end. And in the last, Shuster could not produce the miracle shot for two that would have rescued his side. Instead, the British side will at least emulate the achievement of Dave Murdoch's rink in 2014 by securing silver - and have the chance to upgrade to gold.

What a day. Great Britain are finally guaranteed a medal at these Winter Olympics courtesy of the men's curlers. You can read all about their winhere. We're going to leave our text updates here but you can still watch the BBC TV coverage above. There will be a lot of dissection and discussion on a dramatic but controversial day. You can scroll down too for headlines, clips and reaction. We'll be back late tonight! Medal events:4 Biathlon(men's mass start),freestyle skiing(women's halfpipe, men's ski cross),speed skating(men's 1,000m) Attention will be firmly on the halfpipe and curling rink from a British perspective on Friday. Zoe Atkingoes in women's ski halfpipe (01:30-02:49) final, having qualified in fourth-place. At 12:05 GMT, theGreat Britain women's teamlook to follow their male counterparts in reaching the curling final. They meet Sweden in the semi-final. Elsewhere,Ollie Davies, who became the first Briton to reach the ski cross big final at a World Championship last year, marks his Olympic debut with the knockout runs beginning at 06:45 and the finals starting just before 08:00. Cornelius Kerstenreturns in speed skating's 1000m event. He's ranked 11th in the world over this distance in the 2021-22 season. Mica McNeillandMontell Douglasgo in the first two runs of the two-woman bobsleigh (12:00 and 13:30). Figure Skating - women's free skate Christopher DeanFormer Olympic champion on BBC TV The whole process has been farcical. The organisation, the politics surrounding it to get to this point has been a real mess. And the loser is figure skating, the women's event is suffering from it. The doping hasn't made her have the ability she has. It may have allowed her to train harder and longer, but her technique is second to none. The other two Russians competing are out of the same school so it casts a shadow over of the whole system. Did we not have this when the Olympics were in Sochi? They said 'ok, we are going to ban Russia, but we are going to let them all come under a different flag'. But it's the same systemic issue of the Russians coming to compete. But for sure I don't think Valieva knew what she was taking. Jayne TorvillFormer Olympic champion on BBC TV It's a difficult one. For her personally I would want her to be in the final. But is that fair to the other competitors? But as a young 15-year-old I don't think this was any of her doing, she has been very misguided. Figure skating - women's free skate Robin CousinsOlympic gold medallist figure skater on BBC TV The reaction toKamila Valieva's struggles in the women's singles finale continues. She missed out on the medal places after a poor final routine. Someone thought having her do
that was better than having her go home to her family and to wait and sort this
out, knowing she could have two more Olympics ahead of her. To see the talent and the
unquestionable quality of Valieva... To see it put into this arena in that way
should never have happened. Men's curling BBC Sport The rest of the men's curling team break down their performance: Grant Hardie:""After my missed shot in
the second end for them to steal a two, you're fearing the worst but we all
stuck together, turned that round and we're chuffed."" Bobby Lammy:""They're
quite out there as a team, they speak a lot, but we knew we had to bring that
energy as well. Even after that two, we knew we still had to keep together,
keep fighting, keep going for it and thankfully we managed to pull through. Hammie McMillan:""We
kept control. We were quite happy blanking and we knew the percentages at the
seventh end and not giving up a two was key.  Men's curling - GB into the final BBC Sport Bruce Mouat speaking to BBC Sport after securing Great Britain's place in the curling final:""I'm excited to play that game - got a day off tomorrow but just looking forward to hopefully going for that gold. I'm shaking. On having to play twice in one day:""We play a lot of these two games days on tour so we were happy to get the win. ""The last two weeks for myself has been a bit of a rollercoaster and I'm just so excited to share this with the guys and that celebration at the end was just pure elation - I don't think I can sum it up any other way."" Men's curling - USA 4-8 Great Britain Rhona HowieOlympic gold medallist curler on BBC TV Great Britain have trained so hard as a team, they work well together. They don't argue with each other, they discuss shots and come to an opinion they're all happy with. Everything is just so impressive with this young team. Men's curling - USA 4-8 Great Britain Look at the relief on Bruce Mouat's face... Men's curling - Great Britain 8-4 USA Rhona HowieOlympic gold medallist curler on BBC TV I'm speechless. What a game of curling, They were so patient. That was tough because Shuster was a showman out there. Four blank ends, they didn't panic, they stayed calm, and just kept the pressure on USA. Really impressive by them all They got Shuster rattled. They knew that - John was very loud in the first half of the game - they know that's how he plays the game. The GB team didn't let it bother them one iota. Just joining us? Here are the headlines on day 13. #bbcolympics Dawn Wilson:Just managed to stop myself giving a little ""whoop"" in the office as I am NOT  watching the #bbcolympics live feed of the curling, but is now a good time to mention I have a little crush on Bruce Mouat? Natalie Lewis:YES!!!  we are actually going to win a medal, an actual medal. Day 13 lucky for Team GB, well done Bruce & co. It's been meh daily us having bad luck and not winning anything, so thank you for giving us a bit of joy. Men's curling - USA 4-8 Great Britain It's going to be an early one on Saturday. The gold medal match begins at 06:05 GMT on Saturday morning. #bbcolympics Matt:Superb from Team Mouat! A fantastic win and a guaranteed medal at last.

Apple boss faces backlash over Â£73m pay package,"Investors are being urged to vote against a $99m (Â£73m) pay package awarded to Apple boss Tim Cook last year. Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) said it has ""significant concerns"" over the size of the award, up from $14.8m the year before. Mr Cook, whose net worth is reportedly more than Â£1bn, received the pay in shares, salary, and for other costs. The BBC has contacted Apple for comment. In a letter to shareholders, the ISS said there are ""significant concerns"" over the ""design and magnitude"" of the package. ""Half of the award lacks performance criteria,"" ISS said. Mr Cook, 61, who has often spoken publicly about his concerns over equality and human rights issues, said in 2015 that he would give away his entire fortune before he dies. Norfolk County Council sues Apple in class action Apple sales soar despite chip supply shortages According to ISS, Mr Cook's pay was 1,447 times more than the wage of an average Apple employee. His package included $630,600 in personal security costs and $712,500 for personal use of a private jet. ISS said the cost of such perks ""significantly exceeded"" comparable companies last year. Last year, a US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filing showed that Mr Cook donated almost Â£7.4m worth of Apple shares to charity, without naming the recipient. The company behind the iPhone, iPad and MacBook became the first company to hit a $3tn (Â£2.2tn) stock market value in January before dipping to its current value of $2.8tn (Â£2.1tn). Shareholder returns are now more than 1,000% since Mr Cook took over in 2011. Apple is due to hold its annual meeting for shareholders in the first week of March. However, shareholder votes are only advisory, while Apple's board decide on pay packages. At last year's meeting, 95% of shareholder votes supported Apple's executive compensation programme. Companies in the US, and UK, are facing stronger shareholder opposition over pay and compensation. General Electric, IBM and Starbucks failed to win a majority of shareholder backing for executive pay in 2021. US oil firms ExxonMobil and Chevron also saw shareholder revolts from climate activists last year. Millionaires ask to pay more tax Asset manager Blackrock, Exxon's second largest shareholder, doubled its votes against executive pay proposals in the Americas in early 2021, compared to 2020. In the UK, more than twice as many FTSE 100 companies faced shareholder revolts than in 2020, condemning executive pay-outs when many employees faced added financial hardships in the pandemic. President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats have called for higher taxes on the billionaires and big business to help pay for a major social spending package. The proposal would raise about $16bn by limiting deductions for executive compensation. The tax hike plan would pay for federally funded paid family leave, expanded education budgets and climate change problems.

Obsolete devices leave bionic eye patients in dark,"Second Sight's website has stories from patients who have had the implant Hundreds of people who had retinal implants to improve their sight face an uncertain future as the technology they rely on is now obsolete. Second Sight stopped making its Argus II bionic eyes several years ago to focus on a brain implant instead. According to IEEE Spectrum,,externalwhich broke the story, it is now hoping to merge with a biopharmaceutical firm which does not make eye implants. Second Sight was contacted by the BBC but has not yet responded. Adam Mendelsohn, chief executive of Nano Precision Medical, with which Second Sight is planning to merge, told the BBC it would consider the issues raised by IEEE once the merger, scheduled for mid-2022 - was completed. ""I do intend to make this one of our priorities if and when I assume my leadership position in the combined company,"" Mr Mendelsohn said. According to Second Sight's website, its Argus II offers life-changing benefits for those with sight impairment, including ""enjoying mobility and independence"". ""Our mission is to develop neuro-stimulation technology to enhance the lives of blind individuals, while supporting our current users,"" it says. The implant takes the place of the eye's photoreceptors But IEEE Spectrum reports that Second Sight actually discontinued its retinal implants - which effectively take the place of photoreceptors in the eye to create a form of artificial vision - in 2019. It says the firm nearly went out of business in 2020 and is now concentrating on a brain device - the Orion - which also provides artificial vision, while providing only limited support to the 350 or so who have the implants. Surgery to implant the device typically takes a few hours and is followed by post-op training to help users interpret the signals from their devices. The website also promises updates. ""As technology improves, so will your Argus II implant - without the need for additional surgery. Enjoy programming flexibility and the capacity for future hardware and software upgrades."" The system consists of the implant, special glasses with a built-in camera and a video processing unit (VPU) that is attached around the wearer's waist. The camera on the glasses sends video to the VPU, which converts the images to patterns of black and white pixels and sends them back to a responder in the glasses, which in turn beams them wirelessly to an antenna on the outside of the eye. An implanted electrode array behind the retina receives the stimulation patterns from the user's glasses and stimulates the eye by creating flashes of light that correspond to the video feed and which are sent by the implant to the optic nerve to create a kind of artificial vision. It's clever and innovative tech, which has taken decades to create and was not cheap - estimated at around $150,000 (Â£110,000) excluding surgery and post-surgery training. People using body parts from private firms are increasingly vulnerable, says an expert in technology ethics But patients contacted by IEEE Spectrum voiced concern. One, Ross Doerr, said Second Sight failed to contact any of its patients after its financial difficulties in 2020. ""Those of us with this implant are figuratively and literally in the dark,"" he said. Another user, Jeroen Perk, had problems when his VPU system broke in November 2020. ""I had no vision, no Argus, and no support from Second Sight,"" he told the publication. He considered having the device surgically removed but decided to ask other patients and doctors familiar with the system for help, and luckily found spare parts. Second Sight told the magazine that during its financial difficulties it had had to reduce its workforce and ""was unable to continue the previous level of support and communication for Argus II users"". It has since contacted users and doctors, saying it will do its best to ""provide virtual support"". But no repairs or replacements are possible for the implants. Elizabeth M Renieris, professor of technology ethics at the University of Notre Dame, in the US, described the development as a cautionary tale. She told the BBC: ""This is a prime example of our increasing vulnerability in the face of high-tech, smart and connected devices which are proliferating in the healthcare and biomedical sectors. ""These are not like off-the-shelf products or services that we can actually own or control. Instead we are dependent on software upgrades, proprietary methods and parts, and the commercial drivers and success or failure of for-profit ventures."" Ethical considerations around such technology should in future include ""autonomy, dignity, and accountability"", she added.

Truss: Russia will test our mettle over Ukraine,"This video can not be played Visiting Kyiv, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss praised Ukrainians' stoicism and fortitude Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the UK is increasing its financial support for Ukraine, amid tensions with Russia. Speaking in Kyiv, Ms Truss said the UK would be spending an additional Â£12m on democracy and energy independence projects in the country. Western allies have warned Russia could try to stage an attack to justify invading Ukraine. Russia has repeatedly denied it has plans to invade despite amassing more than 100,000 troops along the border. As part of ongoing diplomatic efforts, Ms Truss visited the Ukrainian capital, holding a press conference alongside the country's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba. She praised the country's ""fortitude in the face of Russian aggression"" and pledged UK's ""steadfast support"". Mr Kuleba said Ukrainian-British relationships had ""reached an unprecedentedly high level"". LIVE: West must not be fooled by Russia's claims - Truss What is Nato and why doesn't Russia trust it? Russian troop withdrawal claim is false, says US In addition to increasing funding for Ukraine's defence capabilities from Â£88m to Â£100m, Ms Truss also announced a new ""trilateral partnership"" with Ukraine and Poland to ""intensify work on defence and security, sanctions, energy security and countering disinformation"". The foreign secretary also warned that ""false-flag"" operations were taking place in the region adding: ""We are very clear the aggressor in this situation is Russia."" A false-flag attack is where one side stages or fabricates an attack against it in order to justify the use of force in retaliation. Earlier in the day, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said Russia could be ""trying to stage a pretext for an armed attack against Ukraine"". Russia has accused the West of ""hysteria"" over such warnings in recent weeks. It has also called on Nato to guarantee Ukraine will not be allowed to join the defence alliance. Nato insists it will keep its open door policy, and has been increasingly concerned an invasion is on the cards. Mr Stoltenberg, said there were ""signs from Moscow that diplomacy could continue"", but that the West had ""not seen any sign of withdrawal or de-escalation"". Speaking from an RAF base in Waddington, Lincolnshire, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was ""still time to avoid a catastrophe"" but said the picture from the region was ""very grim"". He added that a Russian invasion would result in a ""bloody and protracted conflict in which, I'm afraid, there will be many casualties and including many Russian casualties"" In a speech following the press conference in Kyiv, Ms Truss, who became foreign secretary last year, said the current crisis in the region was a ""litmus test"" for the West. ""The free world needs to draw the line under a decade of drift... we must stand up to and defuse Russian aggression now, because if we don't it will embolden not only the Kremlin, but aggressors, authoritarians and autocrats everywhere. ""The West needs to wise up. We need to work together to discredit their arguments in public."" Ms Truss is now travelling to Poland for a meeting with her Polish counterpart, before heading to the Munich Security Conference on Saturday for meetings with allies. The UK has no troops in Ukraine but it has increased numbers in Estonia to the ""high hundreds,"" according to the Ministry of Defence, as well as sending additional helicopters, jets and warships to the region. A further 1,000 British troops are also on standby to support Nato if called upon.

"Little evidence Brexit hit trade, says Rees-Mogg","Jacob Rees-Mogg has been tasked with making Brexit deliver for the UK economy Evidence that leaving the EU has damaged UK trade is ""few and far between"", the government's Brexit opportunities minister has said. Jacob Rees-Mogg, who was handed the new role last week, said recent drops in exports had been caused by disruption during Covid. He argued that Brexit was ""already a success"" and is boosting the economy. But the Office for Budget Responsibility said there was a Brexit hit to trade with the EU. The UK left the EU's trading regime in January 2021, 11 months after it left the bloc - with its trade now governed by apost-Brexit trade deal. Since then, British businesses have experienced additional paperwork and border checks when exporting products to EU countries. Brexit: A year on and the trading impact is showing Warning over border delays when new checks kick in What will Jacob Rees-Mogg do in his new job? Last week, a cross-party committee of MPs said that new arrangements for the UK-EU border had added costs to exporting businesses. In a report, the Public Accounts Committee said trade had been ""suppressed"" since the UK cut formal trade ties in January 2021, due a combination of Brexit, Covid and global economic problems. The MPs said it was not possible to separate out the precise impact of each factor, but it was ""clear"" that Brexit had had an impact. Official trade statistics show UK exports to the EU in the first ten months of 2021 were down 12% on pre-pandemic levels, in a year hit by disruption. UK imports from the EU were 20% lower than before the pandemic. Asked by the BBC about falls in trade during a visit to the port of Felixstowe, Mr Rees-Mogg said Covid had caused ""the most enormous disruptions to supply chains"". ""We've had containers simply being stuck the wrong place, being stuck in Chinese ports, being stuck in the port of Los Angeles,"" he added. ""This has been a global trade issue - and we do have to recover from the problems of Covid"". Asked whether Brexit had reduced UK trade, he replied: ""I think Brexit has been extremely beneficial for the country. ""I think the evidence that Brexit has caused trade drops is few and far between."" The way the UK trades with the EU changed on 1 January 2021, at a time when trade was also being affected by the pandemic, making it hard to distinguish the impact of each of them. Fortunately, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which comes up with economic forecasts for the government, has tried to separate the two. It saidat the time of the Budget in October,externalthat both imports and exports with the EU had been hit by Brexit and that both were on track to end up 15% lower as a result of the UK leaving the EU. But the OBR said it was too early to know for sure because, for example, some of the barriers to trade agreed with the EU had not yet come into force. It pointed toresearch from the Centre for European Reform,external, which concluded that in October 2021 the UK's trade in goods with the EU had been 15.7%, or Â£12.6bn lower, than it would have been without Brexit. The gap had been between 11% and 16% each month of 2021. New research from the British Chambers of Commerce has suggested many firms do not believe post-Brexit trading arrangements have helped trade with the EU. In a survey of 1,000 UK exporters by the business group, seven out of 10 of those polled said the UK's trade deal with the EU was not enabling their business to grow. Liberal Democrat business spokesperson Sarah Olney said the research showed British firms believe the deal is ""simply not good enough"". ""Claims from the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg about Brexit opportunities ring hollow for businesses being drowned in paperwork and delays at our borders,"" she added. In his new cabinet job, Mr Rees-Mogg has been tasked with finding opportunities to make UK businesses more competitive by changing or removing EU laws copied over after Brexit. Since Brexit, the UK has moved away from EU laws in certain areas, including on immigration, payments to farmers, and gene-editing rules for crops. But the prime minister has been under increasing pressure in recent months from MPs on the right of his party to go further. The government has promised to introduce a new law to streamline the process for removing or amending EU laws the UK has inherited.

KitKat and Durex makers warn of price risesConsumer groups Nestle and Reckitt say product prices will rise to offset higher operating costs.Business,"KitKat and Nescafe-maker Nestle has warned it will increase the prices of its products due to the growing cost of producing its goods. Mark Schneider, boss of the food group, said it was ""safe assumption"" that prices would rise this year. He said there was ""no place"" in the company that was ""exempt of inflation"". Reckitt Benckiser, the consumer goods company behind Durex and Dettol, also said prices would rise, but added it hoped to absorb most of the increases. Reckitt's costs rose 11% in 2021, but chief executive Laxman Narasimhan said that wouldn't mean prices rising by that amount, as the company had ways to ""mitigate and manage pricing"" ""We care about the competitiveness of our brands,"" he told a conference call. Jeff Carr, chief financial officer, said the firm's costs had increased ""across the board"", ranging from crude oil and plastic, to shipping and wages. But he said that company was ""absorbing a significant part"" of higher operating costs through ""efficiency"" and ""better buying"". ""We are not passing it on to consumers,"" he said. ""We are passing some pricing onto consumers but we minimise that through the programmes we haveâ¦to absorb those cost increases."" Shares rose in the company by as much as 5.4% on Thursday. Living costs at 30-year high as households squeezed Meanwhile, Nestle said it had already lifted prices by 3.1% in the fourth quarter of its financial to offset rising operating costs. ""It is a safe assumption that our input cost increases for 2022 will be higher than 2021, that is something that we have to reflect in our pricing,"" said Mr Schneider ""There is almost no place in the company that is exempt of inflation now,"" he added. ""Some of these things you can hedge against, some not."" Consumer goods companies have previously warned of price rises for products due the rising costs of raw materials, energy and labour. It will raise pressure on households who are facinga cost of living crisis. Recent data showed that inflation hit a 30-year high of 5.5% in the year to January and the Bank of England forecasts that the cost of living could reach over 7% by spring - far above its 2% inflation target. Gas and electricity costs are set to rise in April when the new, higher energy price cap is introduced. At the same time companies, their staff and the self-employed will pay 1.25p more in the pound for National Insurance. Danni Hewson, financial analyst at AJ Bell, said big brand owners were facing an ""important test given pressures on the cost of living"". ""Consumers may not be able to keep stomaching price increases and so there is a risk they buy less of the popular and more expensive brands and/or trade down to cheaper options,"" she added. ""The big brand companies therefore face the risk of having to cut their prices just to maintain sales volumes."" Nestle, which also makes Cheerios and Smarties, revealed total sales increased by 3.3% to SwFr87.1bn (Â£69.5bn) last year. The firm's net profit grew by 38.2% to SwFr16.9bn. It said sales had been driven by strong demand for coffee, pet products and health foods during the pandemic. Meanwhile, Reckitt said its full-year sales had increased by 3.5%, ahead of expectations, on demand for hygiene and health products. Splitting its divisions, hygiene performed best with sales up 1.6% in the year to Â£5.9 billion, including strong sales of Air Wick, Lysol, Finish and Vanish. Sales of Durex condoms, KY lubricants and Veet hair removal products were boosted as lockdowns were lifted. The firm added sales of US cleaning and disinfecting spray Lysol were about 90% higher than 2019. It said it expected its health business to benefit from stronger cold and flu treatment sales. Last week, Unilever, the firm behind brands such as Marmite and Dove Soap, said it would put up its prices again this year as its overheads continue to rise. The company, which also makes Ben & Jerry's ice cream and Hellmann's mayonnaise, said it was facing â¬3.5bn (Â£2.95bn) of extra costs in 2022 alone.

No other path than Nato for Ukraine - president,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia could fabricate an excuse to invade its neighbour He tells a UN meeting that Moscow could ""manufacture"" a pretext to attack, warning that military action could begin imminently But Russia's deputy foreign minister says the allegations - which have been echoed by other Western leaders - are ""baseless"" It comes after US President Joe Biden warned an invasion could be launched in the coming days, but said a diplomatic solution was still possible Western allies earlier warned that reports of shelling in Ukraine's Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" effort Russia says reports of an escalation in violence are concerning, but accuses the West of hysteria It has expelled a senior US diplomat to Moscow as tensions continue to rise over the crisis Russia denies plans to invade Ukraine and says some of the 100,000 troops amassed at the border are leaving after military drills But a senior US official says 7,000 extra Russian troops have arrived at Ukraine's borders in recent days Edited by James Clarke We're ending our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a recap of some of the key events today:  Here's our main story on Biden's comments today. The US embassy in Moscow Russia delivered a list of demands to the US ambassador on Thursday, accusing Washington of ignoring its security demands. âNo âRussian invasion of Ukraineâ, which the United States and its allies have officially been announcing since last fall, is happening, nor is one being planned,â says the letter from the Russian Foreign Ministry. ""In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,"" the lengthy document says. It called the US refusal to commit to never allowing Ukraine to join Nato ""not constructive"" and called for Nato troops to pull back to countries that joined the alliance before 1997. ""We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics,"" it added. The letter adds that Russia is prepared to negotiate on arms control treaties, and the possible Russian inspection of US missile bases in Poland and Romania, but only if its security concerns are addressed. âWe welcome the readiness of the United States for appropriate consultations,â the document says, adding: âThis work cannot replace the settlement of the key problems posed by Russia.â The US did not immediately respond to the list of demands. The UK is scrapping a fast-track visa scheme for foreign investors over ""security concerns"" amid concerns of illicit Russian money in Britain. The Tier 1 investor visas had allowed residency in the UK for those investing at least Â£2m, but new applicants will no longer be accepted. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the Tier 1 scheme is being closed to ""clamp down on illicit finance"". ""This kind of malign activity, including what we are seeing from Russia right now, has no place in the UK,"" she says. Read more on this story here. More details are emerging of the reported shell blast that struck a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine. Three staff at the nursery were injured when a projectile - which Ukraine says was fired by Russian-backed separatists - blew a whole in a wall. A mother of a child at the kindergarten says she and her husband rushed to the kindergarten in a panic when they heard about the strike in the village of Stanitsya Luhanska. A woman stands among the debris after the shelling of a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine The woman, who refused to give her name, told AFP news agency: ""I was very scared. The kindergarten has no bomb shelter. It only has thick walls. But they even managed to puncture those. I still canât calm down."" Natalia Slesareva, who works at the kindergarten, said it was a close call that everybody escaped unharmed. ""The children were eating breakfast when it hit,"" she told AFP. ""It hit the gym. After breakfast, the children had gym class. So another 15 minutes, and everything could have been much, much worse."" A Ukrainian soldier in a trench on the frontline In the past few hours: We've been hearing a lot about the Minsk agreements as tensions  escalate over the crisis. The agreements - named about the capital of Belarus where they were signed in 2014 and 2015 - are designed to keep a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Among the deal's 13 points are a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the withdrawal of ""all foreign armed formations, military equipment and also mercenaries"" from Ukraine. They also give special status to the separatist-controlled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk and give the Ukrainian government ""full control"" of Ukraine's border with Russia. But there are fundamental differences in how the agreements are interpreted by Kyiv and Moscow. While Ukraine sees the agreements as the basis for reuniting Ukraine and re-establish its sovereignty, Russia sees them as a chance to grant autonomy to the separatist territories. The agreements have never been fully implement by both sides. Read more: What are the Minsk agreements? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The latest satellite images provided by the US space technology company Maxar show that wide-scale Russian military activity persists close to Ukraine's borders, despite recent Russian claims of de-escalation and withdrawal. Taken in mid-February, they illustrate that Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides - on its borders with both Russia and Belarus - by Russian military hardware and troop concentrations. It is important to remember that Russia's current military presence of around 30,000 troops in Belarus, while alarming to both Ukraine and NATO, are part of joint, scheduled exercises that are due to conclude on February 20. So a key test of Moscow's intentions will come after that date when satellite images will reveal if the bulk of Russian forces there have remained or departed. Satellite images show Russian military activity Russia says it ordered the expulsion of the deputy ambassador at the US embassy in Moscow in response to the US expulsion of a senior official at the Russian embassy in Washington. Earlier the US called the expulsion of its senior diplomat, Bart Gorman, ""unprovoked"" and an ""escalatory step"". The Russian foreign ministry has issued a statement in response to what it said were media reports presenting it as ""almost a deliberate escalation on the Russian side"". The statement says: ""The American diplomat was indeed ordered to leave Russia,
but strictly in response to the unreasonable expulsion of the
Minister-Counsellor of our Embassy in Washington, despite his
status as a leading official"". Ukrainian-born residents in the south of England say they are worried about family still living in the country. Hanna Greentree lives in Fareham with her husband and daughter, but her 65-year-old mother lives on her own in Ukraine. Khrystyna Chelak moved to the UK 15 years ago and lives in Caversham but still has family in Ukraine.
She says some people are making preparations to leave and have found their nearest bomb shelters. Watch what they have to say below. This video can not be played Ukrainian families in the south speak about concerns Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stopped by the UN Security Council en route to Munich to deliver a dire warning about Russian plans to invade Ukraine. He ignored admonitions by the Russian ambassador to avoid making a âcircusâ out of the meeting by âplaying to the camerasâ with such âspeculation"". His speech was the latest installment of the administrationâs aggressive information war. Itâs made a strategic decision to go public with intelligence, believing that calling out Russiaâs so-called âplaybookâ at every opportunity could serve as a deterrent to conflict. But Blinken was clearly mindful that such interventions carry risks. He made a nod to one of his predecessors, Colin Powell, whoâd argued a case for invading Iraq in 2003 which turned out to be false. âLet me be clear,â he said. âI am here today not to start a war but to prevent one.â The US would be relieved and would gladly accept any criticism about its rhetoric if Russia did not invade, he said. In the meantime, he laid out clearly, step by step, how US intelligence believes Russia could carry out an attack, starting with manufacturing a pretext to raining bombs and missiles on Kyiv. A howitzer fires during Russia-Belarus joint military exercises It's quite easy to lose track of what's been going on with all those military exercises near Ukraine's borders in recent days, with countless claims and counterclaims voiced by different players. Here's a timeline to get you up to speed: - From10 February, Russia has been holding massive drills on the territory of its key ally Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour - US officials have warned that up to30,000 Russian troopsmay have been involved in the drills, which are set to end on20 February - Russia has also massed troops along Ukraine's eastern border, and has been holding exercises in Crimea - a southern Ukrainian peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014 - Russia has since said that some of troops have been returning to their permanent bases - but Ukraine and its Western allies are sceptical - In addition, from13 Februarythe Russian Navy has been staging firing exercises in the Black Sea. The drills are set to end on19 February -Meanwhile, Ukraine - fearing that it could be encircled from the north, east and south - has been staging its own military exercises across its territory - Ukraine has also been boosting its territorial defence - weapons-trained civilian volunteers who could be called in case of a foreign invasion  Fergal KeaneBBC News, Northern Ukraine Maj Sergiy Khomenko says he serves to protect Ukraine's independence The Ukrainian border guards scan the snowy forest for any sign of Russian movement. They stand guard at the Senkivka crossing, where the Kremlin once celebrated the unity of the Soviet world. A few truck drivers heading south to the capital, Kyiv, cluster near the Three Sisters monument - a white obelisk erected back in 1975 to mark where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. Maj Sergiy Khomenko, 29, comes from a military family and grew up in a border village. The current crisis with Russia would have been unimaginable in his parents' youth. But he serves a Ukraine that has been consistently pushing away from the orbit of Moscow. ""The independence of Ukraine is enshrined in all our documents. It is in our constitution. As a military man, I need to protect this,"" he tells me. Read the story in full here. In a video posted to its official Twitter account, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has warned that ""a considerable number of civilians will die"" if Russia chooses to attack Ukraine. In a video update posted on Thursday, the MoD said that it has seen no evidence to substantiate Russian claims that its forces are withdrawing from the border region and ""can conduct an invasion without further warning"". The video also outlined a number of reasons that Russian President Vladimir Putin would want to launch a military operation in Ukraine, including a belief that is it is a ""strategically important buffer zone"" between Russia and Nato, as well as its cultural and historical ties to Russia. ""It [Russia] does not accept Ukraine as an independent state,"" the video's narrator says. ""But it is an independent state"". The Russian forces amassed on Ukraine's borders are ""beyond anything needed"" for large-scale military exercises and could directly threaten Kyiv, the MoD video said. ""Defence intelligence assesses that [Putin] would be willing to sustain thousands of casualties to get what he wants,"" it warned. The MoD ends with the message that Putin ""can still choose peace"" and diplomacy to de-escalate tensions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While tensions mount, the US government has urged its citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, citing the threat of an imminent Russian invasion. But not all US citizens who live in Ukraine are taking this advice. Many here don't believe that a full-scale attack on Kyiv is imminent, despite warnings from intelligence sources quoted in the media. BBC News Ukraine has spoken to some Americans living in the country, including businessmen, teachers and volunteers, and asked them about their decision to stay. ""I will not leave the country I call home,"" says Sean Almeida Sean Almeida, from Boston, has been building a business in Kyiv since 2014, and now, despite the threat, does not intend to flee Ukraine. ""Let Biden say what he wants, but I am not going to panic and leave the country that has long since become my home,"" he says. Read more here: 'This is our home': The Americans who refuse to leave Ukraine Reporting by Oleh Chernysh, BBC News Ukrainian, Kyiv  On Thursday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky visited the frontline village of Shyrokyne in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region The president (seen here bottom right) spent about 30 minutes eating and drinking tea with Ukrainian soldiers, in what is seen as a morale-boosting tour Zelensky (seen here from the back) then presented soldiers with watches for their service to Ukraine Shyrokyne - on the Sea of Azov coast - changed hands several times during fierce fighting in 2014-15, but is now controlled by the Ukrainian military Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Any sign of a breakthrough in East-West diplomacy? Not if Russiaâs eleven-page written response to Washingtonâs proposal is anything to go by. The letter is full of criticism of the United States. The tone is bitter,
impatient and pretty uncompromising. Moscow detected âno constructive answerâ from the US to
Russiaâs key demands, such as an end to Nato enlargement eastwards. Russia is not softening its stance. Itâs insisting that all
US troops and weaponry be withdrawn from central and eastern Europe,
south-eastern Europe and the Baltics. Hard to see America agreeing to that. Then came the threat. Itâs one that President Putin has
already delivered: that if Moscow fails to receive the âlegally binding
security guaranteesâ it seeks, it will react with âmilitary-technical means.â What would those be? Moscowâs not saying - intentionally. To
keep the West guessing. Todayâs expulsion of the deputy US ambassador to Moscow adds
to the general sense of diplomacy stalling. Washington interprets the move as
an escalation. Russia doesnât want to be seen to be closing the door to
dialogue. And there are some areas â like arms control and risk reduction â
where common ground could be found. But Moscow has made it quite clear its
main concerns have not been addressed. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media We've had reaction from the Kremlin in response to the US president's comments earlier. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has criticised Joe Biden for saying that Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine ""within the next several days"". In remarks reported by the state RIA Novosti news agency, Peskov said:
   ""Unfortunately, tension continues to be whipped up with such statements."" UK Europe Minister James Cleverly tells the UN Security Council Russia is using ""increasing disinformation"" to ""fabricate a pretext"" to invade Ukraine. ""We are seeing increasing disinformation about events in the Donbas that are straight out of the Kremlin playbook,"" he says. ""A blatant attempt by the Russian Government to fabricate a pretext for the invasion of Ukraine."" Western allies have warned that recent reports of shelling in Ukraine's south-eastern Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" operation to justify an invasion. UK Europe Minister James Cleverly is also in New York addressing the UN Security Council. He says we're at a ""critical juncture to prevent further escalation"". ""Russia has deployed the forces necessary to invade Ukraine and now has them readied for action,"" he says. Despite Russian claims its forces are withdrawing, ""the opposite is in fact true and the Russian military build-up continues"", Cleverly says. ""Russia is patently failing to live up to the international commitments that it has made around military transparency by refusing to adequately explain its military build-up or to provide the necessary transparency to build trust or to de-escalate the situation."" We've heard more from US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, he tells the UN Security Council in New York that he has offered to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Europe next week. Additionally, Blinken says the US is proposing a meeting of the Nato-Russia council and permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, in a bid to resolve the tensions on Ukraine's borders ""without conflict"". These meetings, Blinken adds, could ""pave the way"" for a summit of key leaders to discuss mutual security concerns. ""As lead diplomats, we have a responsibility to make every effort for diplomacy to succeed and leave no diplomatic stone unturned,"" he says. Blinken adds that the US believes that the implementation of the Minsk Agreement is vital to ensuring a diplomatic path forward. He says the US would be ""relieved"" if its warnings about Russia are incorrect and US predictions proven wrong. Â© 2025 BBC.

While tensions mount, the US government has urged its citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, citing the threat of an imminent Russian invasion. But not all US citizens who live in Ukraine are taking this advice. Many here don't believe that a full-scale attack on Kyiv is imminent, despite warnings from intelligence sources quoted in the media. BBC News Ukraine has spoken to some Americans living in the country, including businessmen, teachers and volunteers, and asked them about their decision to stay. ""I will not leave the country I call home,"" says Sean Almeida Sean Almeida, from Boston, has been building a business in Kyiv since 2014, and now, despite the threat, does not intend to flee Ukraine. ""Let Biden say what he wants, but I am not going to panic and leave the country that has long since become my home,"" he says.

Not if Russiaâs eleven-page written response to Washingtonâs proposal is anything to go by. The letter is full of criticism of the United States. The tone is bitter,
impatient and pretty uncompromising. Moscow detected âno constructive answerâ from the US to
Russiaâs key demands, such as an end to Nato enlargement eastwards. Russia is not softening its stance. Itâs insisting that all
US troops and weaponry be withdrawn from central and eastern Europe,
south-eastern Europe and the Baltics. Hard to see America agreeing to that. Then came the threat. Itâs one that President Putin has
already delivered: that if Moscow fails to receive the âlegally binding
security guaranteesâ it seeks, it will react with âmilitary-technical means.â What would those be? Moscowâs not saying - intentionally. To
keep the West guessing. Todayâs expulsion of the deputy US ambassador to Moscow adds
to the general sense of diplomacy stalling. Washington interprets the move as
an escalation. Russia doesnât want to be seen to be closing the door to
dialogue. And there are some areas â like arms control and risk reduction â
where common ground could be found. But Moscow has made it quite clear its
main concerns have not been addressed. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media We've had reaction from the Kremlin in response to the US president's comments earlier. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has criticised Joe Biden for saying that Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine ""within the next several days"". In remarks reported by the state RIA Novosti news agency, Peskov said:
   ""Unfortunately, tension continues to be whipped up with such statements."" UK Europe Minister James Cleverly tells the UN Security Council Russia is using ""increasing disinformation"" to ""fabricate a pretext"" to invade Ukraine. ""We are seeing increasing disinformation about events in the Donbas that are straight out of the Kremlin playbook,"" he says. ""A blatant attempt by the Russian Government to fabricate a pretext for the invasion of Ukraine."" Western allies have warned that recent reports of shelling in Ukraine's south-eastern Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" operation to justify an invasion. UK Europe Minister James Cleverly is also in New York addressing the UN Security Council. He says we're at a ""critical juncture to prevent further escalation"". ""Russia has deployed the forces necessary to invade Ukraine and now has them readied for action,"" he says. Despite Russian claims its forces are withdrawing, ""the opposite is in fact true and the Russian military build-up continues"", Cleverly says. ""Russia is patently failing to live up to the international commitments that it has made around military transparency by refusing to adequately explain its military build-up or to provide the necessary transparency to build trust or to de-escalate the situation."" We've heard more from US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, he tells the UN Security Council in New York that he has offered to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Europe next week. Additionally, Blinken says the US is proposing a meeting of the Nato-Russia council and permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, in a bid to resolve the tensions on Ukraine's borders ""without conflict"". These meetings, Blinken adds, could ""pave the way"" for a summit of key leaders to discuss mutual security concerns. ""As lead diplomats, we have a responsibility to make every effort for diplomacy to succeed and leave no diplomatic stone unturned,"" he says. Blinken adds that the US believes that the implementation of the Minsk Agreement is vital to ensuring a diplomatic path forward. He says the US would be ""relieved"" if its warnings about Russia are incorrect and US predictions proven wrong. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveNo other path than Nato for Ukraine - president3 minutes ago,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia could fabricate an excuse to invade its neighbour He tells a UN meeting that Moscow could ""manufacture"" a pretext to attack, warning that military action could begin imminently But Russia's deputy foreign minister says the allegations - which have been echoed by other Western leaders - are ""baseless"" It comes after US President Joe Biden warned an invasion could be launched in the coming days, but said a diplomatic solution was still possible Western allies earlier warned that reports of shelling in Ukraine's Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" effort Russia says reports of an escalation in violence are concerning, but accuses the West of hysteria It has expelled a senior US diplomat to Moscow as tensions continue to rise over the crisis Russia denies plans to invade Ukraine and says some of the 100,000 troops amassed at the border are leaving after military drills But a senior US official says 7,000 extra Russian troops have arrived at Ukraine's borders in recent days Edited by James Clarke We're ending our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a recap of some of the key events today:  Here's our main story on Biden's comments today. The US embassy in Moscow Russia delivered a list of demands to the US ambassador on Thursday, accusing Washington of ignoring its security demands. âNo âRussian invasion of Ukraineâ, which the United States and its allies have officially been announcing since last fall, is happening, nor is one being planned,â says the letter from the Russian Foreign Ministry. ""In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,"" the lengthy document says. It called the US refusal to commit to never allowing Ukraine to join Nato ""not constructive"" and called for Nato troops to pull back to countries that joined the alliance before 1997. ""We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics,"" it added. The letter adds that Russia is prepared to negotiate on arms control treaties, and the possible Russian inspection of US missile bases in Poland and Romania, but only if its security concerns are addressed. âWe welcome the readiness of the United States for appropriate consultations,â the document says, adding: âThis work cannot replace the settlement of the key problems posed by Russia.â The US did not immediately respond to the list of demands. The UK is scrapping a fast-track visa scheme for foreign investors over ""security concerns"" amid concerns of illicit Russian money in Britain. The Tier 1 investor visas had allowed residency in the UK for those investing at least Â£2m, but new applicants will no longer be accepted. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the Tier 1 scheme is being closed to ""clamp down on illicit finance"". ""This kind of malign activity, including what we are seeing from Russia right now, has no place in the UK,"" she says. Read more on this story here. More details are emerging of the reported shell blast that struck a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine. Three staff at the nursery were injured when a projectile - which Ukraine says was fired by Russian-backed separatists - blew a whole in a wall. A mother of a child at the kindergarten says she and her husband rushed to the kindergarten in a panic when they heard about the strike in the village of Stanitsya Luhanska. A woman stands among the debris after the shelling of a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine The woman, who refused to give her name, told AFP news agency: ""I was very scared. The kindergarten has no bomb shelter. It only has thick walls. But they even managed to puncture those. I still canât calm down."" Natalia Slesareva, who works at the kindergarten, said it was a close call that everybody escaped unharmed. ""The children were eating breakfast when it hit,"" she told AFP. ""It hit the gym. After breakfast, the children had gym class. So another 15 minutes, and everything could have been much, much worse."" A Ukrainian soldier in a trench on the frontline In the past few hours: We've been hearing a lot about the Minsk agreements as tensions  escalate over the crisis. The agreements - named about the capital of Belarus where they were signed in 2014 and 2015 - are designed to keep a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Among the deal's 13 points are a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the withdrawal of ""all foreign armed formations, military equipment and also mercenaries"" from Ukraine. They also give special status to the separatist-controlled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk and give the Ukrainian government ""full control"" of Ukraine's border with Russia. But there are fundamental differences in how the agreements are interpreted by Kyiv and Moscow. While Ukraine sees the agreements as the basis for reuniting Ukraine and re-establish its sovereignty, Russia sees them as a chance to grant autonomy to the separatist territories. The agreements have never been fully implement by both sides. Read more: What are the Minsk agreements? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The latest satellite images provided by the US space technology company Maxar show that wide-scale Russian military activity persists close to Ukraine's borders, despite recent Russian claims of de-escalation and withdrawal. Taken in mid-February, they illustrate that Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides - on its borders with both Russia and Belarus - by Russian military hardware and troop concentrations. It is important to remember that Russia's current military presence of around 30,000 troops in Belarus, while alarming to both Ukraine and NATO, are part of joint, scheduled exercises that are due to conclude on February 20. So a key test of Moscow's intentions will come after that date when satellite images will reveal if the bulk of Russian forces there have remained or departed. Satellite images show Russian military activity Russia says it ordered the expulsion of the deputy ambassador at the US embassy in Moscow in response to the US expulsion of a senior official at the Russian embassy in Washington. Earlier the US called the expulsion of its senior diplomat, Bart Gorman, ""unprovoked"" and an ""escalatory step"". The Russian foreign ministry has issued a statement in response to what it said were media reports presenting it as ""almost a deliberate escalation on the Russian side"". The statement says: ""The American diplomat was indeed ordered to leave Russia,
but strictly in response to the unreasonable expulsion of the
Minister-Counsellor of our Embassy in Washington, despite his
status as a leading official"". Ukrainian-born residents in the south of England say they are worried about family still living in the country. Hanna Greentree lives in Fareham with her husband and daughter, but her 65-year-old mother lives on her own in Ukraine. Khrystyna Chelak moved to the UK 15 years ago and lives in Caversham but still has family in Ukraine.
She says some people are making preparations to leave and have found their nearest bomb shelters. Watch what they have to say below. This video can not be played Ukrainian families in the south speak about concerns Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stopped by the UN Security Council en route to Munich to deliver a dire warning about Russian plans to invade Ukraine. He ignored admonitions by the Russian ambassador to avoid making a âcircusâ out of the meeting by âplaying to the camerasâ with such âspeculation"". His speech was the latest installment of the administrationâs aggressive information war. Itâs made a strategic decision to go public with intelligence, believing that calling out Russiaâs so-called âplaybookâ at every opportunity could serve as a deterrent to conflict. But Blinken was clearly mindful that such interventions carry risks. He made a nod to one of his predecessors, Colin Powell, whoâd argued a case for invading Iraq in 2003 which turned out to be false. âLet me be clear,â he said. âI am here today not to start a war but to prevent one.â The US would be relieved and would gladly accept any criticism about its rhetoric if Russia did not invade, he said. In the meantime, he laid out clearly, step by step, how US intelligence believes Russia could carry out an attack, starting with manufacturing a pretext to raining bombs and missiles on Kyiv. A howitzer fires during Russia-Belarus joint military exercises It's quite easy to lose track of what's been going on with all those military exercises near Ukraine's borders in recent days, with countless claims and counterclaims voiced by different players. Here's a timeline to get you up to speed: - From10 February, Russia has been holding massive drills on the territory of its key ally Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour - US officials have warned that up to30,000 Russian troopsmay have been involved in the drills, which are set to end on20 February - Russia has also massed troops along Ukraine's eastern border, and has been holding exercises in Crimea - a southern Ukrainian peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014 - Russia has since said that some of troops have been returning to their permanent bases - but Ukraine and its Western allies are sceptical - In addition, from13 Februarythe Russian Navy has been staging firing exercises in the Black Sea. The drills are set to end on19 February -Meanwhile, Ukraine - fearing that it could be encircled from the north, east and south - has been staging its own military exercises across its territory - Ukraine has also been boosting its territorial defence - weapons-trained civilian volunteers who could be called in case of a foreign invasion  Fergal KeaneBBC News, Northern Ukraine Maj Sergiy Khomenko says he serves to protect Ukraine's independence The Ukrainian border guards scan the snowy forest for any sign of Russian movement. They stand guard at the Senkivka crossing, where the Kremlin once celebrated the unity of the Soviet world. A few truck drivers heading south to the capital, Kyiv, cluster near the Three Sisters monument - a white obelisk erected back in 1975 to mark where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. Maj Sergiy Khomenko, 29, comes from a military family and grew up in a border village. The current crisis with Russia would have been unimaginable in his parents' youth. But he serves a Ukraine that has been consistently pushing away from the orbit of Moscow. ""The independence of Ukraine is enshrined in all our documents. It is in our constitution. As a military man, I need to protect this,"" he tells me. Read the story in full here. In a video posted to its official Twitter account, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has warned that ""a considerable number of civilians will die"" if Russia chooses to attack Ukraine. In a video update posted on Thursday, the MoD said that it has seen no evidence to substantiate Russian claims that its forces are withdrawing from the border region and ""can conduct an invasion without further warning"". The video also outlined a number of reasons that Russian President Vladimir Putin would want to launch a military operation in Ukraine, including a belief that is it is a ""strategically important buffer zone"" between Russia and Nato, as well as its cultural and historical ties to Russia. ""It [Russia] does not accept Ukraine as an independent state,"" the video's narrator says. ""But it is an independent state"". The Russian forces amassed on Ukraine's borders are ""beyond anything needed"" for large-scale military exercises and could directly threaten Kyiv, the MoD video said. ""Defence intelligence assesses that [Putin] would be willing to sustain thousands of casualties to get what he wants,"" it warned. The MoD ends with the message that Putin ""can still choose peace"" and diplomacy to de-escalate tensions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Why are we having fewer babies and does it matter?,"Many parents are putting their careers first and having children later in life Wales' record low birth rate has ""significant consequences"" for schools and the NHS, the head of the public spending watchdog has said. Wales' birth rate is at a 100-year low, below the European Union average and third out of the UK's four countries. Experts believe a variety of factors are driving the change. They include women having greater roles in the workplace, more control over fertility, and the increasing costs of raising children. The ""childfree movement,"" often motivated by concerns about climate change, may also be growing in significance.

"Why are we having fewer babies and does it matter?Wales' birth rates are at a 100-year low, with warnings of ""consequences"" for public services.Wales","Many parents are putting their careers first and having children later in life Wales' record low birth rate has ""significant consequences"" for schools and the NHS, the head of the public spending watchdog has said. Wales' birth rate is at a 100-year low, below the European Union average and third out of the UK's four countries. Experts believe a variety of factors are driving the change. They include women having greater roles in the workplace, more control over fertility, and the increasing costs of raising children. The ""childfree movement,"" often motivated by concerns about climate change, may also be growing in significance.

Deadly landslides wreak havoc in Brazilian city,"This video can not be played Deluge of rainfall causes a landslide and flooding in PetrÃ³polis, Brazil More than 100 people have died in landslides and flash flooding in the Brazilian city of PetrÃ³polis, officials say. The city, which is located in the mountains north of Rio de Janeiro, was hit by torrential rainfall. Houses in hillside neighbourhoods were destroyed and cars swept away as floodwaters raced through the city's streets. Search and rescue teams are combing the mud for survivors. Brazil's National Civil Defence said that 24 people had been rescued alive by Wednesday night local time. Videos shared on social media showed extensive damage and vehicles floating in the streets. ""The situation is almost like war... Cars hanging from poles, cars overturned, lots of mud and water still,"" Rio de Janeiro Governor ClÃ¡udio Castro told journalists. With more than 30 people reported missing, he said that the search and rescue efforts would continue non-stop. Residents here are holding out hope their loved ones can be found, but it's a complicated situation with so much mud and rubble to clear. People are watching and waiting patiently. You can see how the mudslide came crashing down through this hillside neighbourhood, wiping out everything in its path and creating a valley of mud, rubble and mangled wires. When we arrived there was a family in floods of tears, with a shovel in hand, trying to find where their loved one was. This is a city in trauma - residents are trying to organise themselves to work on the rescue effort along with firefighters. I spoke to a community leader called Paulo. He said that his priority was to try to find his son who was buried in the landslide. PetrÃ³polis is a popular tourist destination in the hills above Rio de Janeiro which used to be the summer getaway for Brazil's monarchs in the 19th Century. But after a month's worth of rain fell on the city in just three hours - the heaviest rainfall since 1932, according to Governor Castro - much of its regal charm lay in ruins, with homes and shops destroyed by the flooding. Search and rescue workers have been deployed to the city In one of the worst-hit neighbourhoods, up to 80 houses were hit by landslides. ""The water came very fast and with great force. My loss was 100%. Our life was already tough with the pandemic... and this tragedy still comes,"" shopkeeper Henrique Pereira told Reuters news agency. Dozens of homes were damaged by landslides after heavy rains in PetrÃ³polis Around 300 people are being housed in schools and shelters, and charities are calling for donations of mattresses, food, clothing and face masks. ""I found a girl who was buried alive,"" Wendel Pio Lourenco, a 24-year-old resident, told the AFP news agency while heading to a local church in search of shelter. ""Everyone is saying it looks like a war zone."" It is the latest in a series of heavy rains to hit Brazil in the past three months, which scientists say are being made worse by climate change. PetrÃ³polis and the surrounding region were previously hit by severe storms in January 2011, when more than 900 people died in flooding and landslides. Cars and entire homes were swept away by the floodwaters 'We lost everything': Deadly rains hit Brazil Brazil floods kill 21 and destroy homes Governor says lack of water for hydrants 'impaired' fight against wildfires 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

West must not be fooled by Russia's claims - Truss,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia could fabricate an excuse to invade its neighbour He tells a UN meeting that Moscow could ""manufacture"" a pretext to attack, warning that military action could begin imminently But Russia's deputy foreign minister says the allegations - which have been echoed by other Western leaders - are ""baseless"" It comes after US President Joe Biden warned an invasion could be launched in the coming days, but said a diplomatic solution was still possible Western allies earlier warned that reports of shelling in Ukraine's Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" effort Russia says reports of an escalation in violence are concerning, but accuses the West of hysteria It has expelled a senior US diplomat to Moscow as tensions continue to rise over the crisis Russia denies plans to invade Ukraine and says some of the 100,000 troops amassed at the border are leaving after military drills But a senior US official says 7,000 extra Russian troops have arrived at Ukraine's borders in recent days Edited by James Clarke We're ending our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis for today. Here's a recap of some of the key events today:  Here's our main story on Biden's comments today. The US embassy in Moscow Russia delivered a list of demands to the US ambassador on Thursday, accusing Washington of ignoring its security demands. âNo âRussian invasion of Ukraineâ, which the United States and its allies have officially been announcing since last fall, is happening, nor is one being planned,â says the letter from the Russian Foreign Ministry. ""In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,"" the lengthy document says. It called the US refusal to commit to never allowing Ukraine to join Nato ""not constructive"" and called for Nato troops to pull back to countries that joined the alliance before 1997. ""We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics,"" it added. The letter adds that Russia is prepared to negotiate on arms control treaties, and the possible Russian inspection of US missile bases in Poland and Romania, but only if its security concerns are addressed. âWe welcome the readiness of the United States for appropriate consultations,â the document says, adding: âThis work cannot replace the settlement of the key problems posed by Russia.â The US did not immediately respond to the list of demands. The UK is scrapping a fast-track visa scheme for foreign investors over ""security concerns"" amid concerns of illicit Russian money in Britain. The Tier 1 investor visas had allowed residency in the UK for those investing at least Â£2m, but new applicants will no longer be accepted. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the Tier 1 scheme is being closed to ""clamp down on illicit finance"". ""This kind of malign activity, including what we are seeing from Russia right now, has no place in the UK,"" she says. Read more on this story here. More details are emerging of the reported shell blast that struck a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine. Three staff at the nursery were injured when a projectile - which Ukraine says was fired by Russian-backed separatists - blew a whole in a wall. A mother of a child at the kindergarten says she and her husband rushed to the kindergarten in a panic when they heard about the strike in the village of Stanitsya Luhanska. A woman stands among the debris after the shelling of a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine The woman, who refused to give her name, told AFP news agency: ""I was very scared. The kindergarten has no bomb shelter. It only has thick walls. But they even managed to puncture those. I still canât calm down."" Natalia Slesareva, who works at the kindergarten, said it was a close call that everybody escaped unharmed. ""The children were eating breakfast when it hit,"" she told AFP. ""It hit the gym. After breakfast, the children had gym class. So another 15 minutes, and everything could have been much, much worse."" A Ukrainian soldier in a trench on the frontline In the past few hours: We've been hearing a lot about the Minsk agreements as tensions  escalate over the crisis. The agreements - named about the capital of Belarus where they were signed in 2014 and 2015 - are designed to keep a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Among the deal's 13 points are a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the withdrawal of ""all foreign armed formations, military equipment and also mercenaries"" from Ukraine. They also give special status to the separatist-controlled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk and give the Ukrainian government ""full control"" of Ukraine's border with Russia. But there are fundamental differences in how the agreements are interpreted by Kyiv and Moscow. While Ukraine sees the agreements as the basis for reuniting Ukraine and re-establish its sovereignty, Russia sees them as a chance to grant autonomy to the separatist territories. The agreements have never been fully implement by both sides. Read more: What are the Minsk agreements? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The latest satellite images provided by the US space technology company Maxar show that wide-scale Russian military activity persists close to Ukraine's borders, despite recent Russian claims of de-escalation and withdrawal. Taken in mid-February, they illustrate that Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides - on its borders with both Russia and Belarus - by Russian military hardware and troop concentrations. It is important to remember that Russia's current military presence of around 30,000 troops in Belarus, while alarming to both Ukraine and NATO, are part of joint, scheduled exercises that are due to conclude on February 20. So a key test of Moscow's intentions will come after that date when satellite images will reveal if the bulk of Russian forces there have remained or departed. Satellite images show Russian military activity Russia says it ordered the expulsion of the deputy ambassador at the US embassy in Moscow in response to the US expulsion of a senior official at the Russian embassy in Washington. Earlier the US called the expulsion of its senior diplomat, Bart Gorman, ""unprovoked"" and an ""escalatory step"". The Russian foreign ministry has issued a statement in response to what it said were media reports presenting it as ""almost a deliberate escalation on the Russian side"". The statement says: ""The American diplomat was indeed ordered to leave Russia,
but strictly in response to the unreasonable expulsion of the
Minister-Counsellor of our Embassy in Washington, despite his
status as a leading official"". Ukrainian-born residents in the south of England say they are worried about family still living in the country. Hanna Greentree lives in Fareham with her husband and daughter, but her 65-year-old mother lives on her own in Ukraine. Khrystyna Chelak moved to the UK 15 years ago and lives in Caversham but still has family in Ukraine.
She says some people are making preparations to leave and have found their nearest bomb shelters. Watch what they have to say below. This video can not be played Ukrainian families in the south speak about concerns Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stopped by the UN Security Council en route to Munich to deliver a dire warning about Russian plans to invade Ukraine. He ignored admonitions by the Russian ambassador to avoid making a âcircusâ out of the meeting by âplaying to the camerasâ with such âspeculation"". His speech was the latest installment of the administrationâs aggressive information war. Itâs made a strategic decision to go public with intelligence, believing that calling out Russiaâs so-called âplaybookâ at every opportunity could serve as a deterrent to conflict. But Blinken was clearly mindful that such interventions carry risks. He made a nod to one of his predecessors, Colin Powell, whoâd argued a case for invading Iraq in 2003 which turned out to be false. âLet me be clear,â he said. âI am here today not to start a war but to prevent one.â The US would be relieved and would gladly accept any criticism about its rhetoric if Russia did not invade, he said. In the meantime, he laid out clearly, step by step, how US intelligence believes Russia could carry out an attack, starting with manufacturing a pretext to raining bombs and missiles on Kyiv. A howitzer fires during Russia-Belarus joint military exercises It's quite easy to lose track of what's been going on with all those military exercises near Ukraine's borders in recent days, with countless claims and counterclaims voiced by different players. Here's a timeline to get you up to speed: - From10 February, Russia has been holding massive drills on the territory of its key ally Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour - US officials have warned that up to30,000 Russian troopsmay have been involved in the drills, which are set to end on20 February - Russia has also massed troops along Ukraine's eastern border, and has been holding exercises in Crimea - a southern Ukrainian peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014 - Russia has since said that some of troops have been returning to their permanent bases - but Ukraine and its Western allies are sceptical - In addition, from13 Februarythe Russian Navy has been staging firing exercises in the Black Sea. The drills are set to end on19 February -Meanwhile, Ukraine - fearing that it could be encircled from the north, east and south - has been staging its own military exercises across its territory - Ukraine has also been boosting its territorial defence - weapons-trained civilian volunteers who could be called in case of a foreign invasion  Fergal KeaneBBC News, Northern Ukraine Maj Sergiy Khomenko says he serves to protect Ukraine's independence The Ukrainian border guards scan the snowy forest for any sign of Russian movement. They stand guard at the Senkivka crossing, where the Kremlin once celebrated the unity of the Soviet world. A few truck drivers heading south to the capital, Kyiv, cluster near the Three Sisters monument - a white obelisk erected back in 1975 to mark where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. Maj Sergiy Khomenko, 29, comes from a military family and grew up in a border village. The current crisis with Russia would have been unimaginable in his parents' youth. But he serves a Ukraine that has been consistently pushing away from the orbit of Moscow. ""The independence of Ukraine is enshrined in all our documents. It is in our constitution. As a military man, I need to protect this,"" he tells me. Read the story in full here. In a video posted to its official Twitter account, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has warned that ""a considerable number of civilians will die"" if Russia chooses to attack Ukraine. In a video update posted on Thursday, the MoD said that it has seen no evidence to substantiate Russian claims that its forces are withdrawing from the border region and ""can conduct an invasion without further warning"". The video also outlined a number of reasons that Russian President Vladimir Putin would want to launch a military operation in Ukraine, including a belief that is it is a ""strategically important buffer zone"" between Russia and Nato, as well as its cultural and historical ties to Russia. ""It [Russia] does not accept Ukraine as an independent state,"" the video's narrator says. ""But it is an independent state"". The Russian forces amassed on Ukraine's borders are ""beyond anything needed"" for large-scale military exercises and could directly threaten Kyiv, the MoD video said. ""Defence intelligence assesses that [Putin] would be willing to sustain thousands of casualties to get what he wants,"" it warned. The MoD ends with the message that Putin ""can still choose peace"" and diplomacy to de-escalate tensions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While tensions mount, the US government has urged its citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, citing the threat of an imminent Russian invasion. But not all US citizens who live in Ukraine are taking this advice. Many here don't believe that a full-scale attack on Kyiv is imminent, despite warnings from intelligence sources quoted in the media. BBC News Ukraine has spoken to some Americans living in the country, including businessmen, teachers and volunteers, and asked them about their decision to stay. ""I will not leave the country I call home,"" says Sean Almeida Sean Almeida, from Boston, has been building a business in Kyiv since 2014, and now, despite the threat, does not intend to flee Ukraine. ""Let Biden say what he wants, but I am not going to panic and leave the country that has long since become my home,"" he says.

Not if Russiaâs eleven-page written response to Washingtonâs proposal is anything to go by. The letter is full of criticism of the United States. The tone is bitter,
impatient and pretty uncompromising. Moscow detected âno constructive answerâ from the US to
Russiaâs key demands, such as an end to Nato enlargement eastwards. Russia is not softening its stance. Itâs insisting that all
US troops and weaponry be withdrawn from central and eastern Europe,
south-eastern Europe and the Baltics. Hard to see America agreeing to that. Then came the threat. Itâs one that President Putin has
already delivered: that if Moscow fails to receive the âlegally binding
security guaranteesâ it seeks, it will react with âmilitary-technical means.â What would those be? Moscowâs not saying - intentionally. To
keep the West guessing. Todayâs expulsion of the deputy US ambassador to Moscow adds
to the general sense of diplomacy stalling. Washington interprets the move as
an escalation. Russia doesnât want to be seen to be closing the door to
dialogue. And there are some areas â like arms control and risk reduction â
where common ground could be found. But Moscow has made it quite clear its
main concerns have not been addressed. BBC MonitoringThe world through its media We've had reaction from the Kremlin in response to the US president's comments earlier. Spokesman Dmitry Peskov has criticised Joe Biden for saying that Russia may launch an attack on Ukraine ""within the next several days"". In remarks reported by the state RIA Novosti news agency, Peskov said:
   ""Unfortunately, tension continues to be whipped up with such statements."" UK Europe Minister James Cleverly tells the UN Security Council Russia is using ""increasing disinformation"" to ""fabricate a pretext"" to invade Ukraine. ""We are seeing increasing disinformation about events in the Donbas that are straight out of the Kremlin playbook,"" he says. ""A blatant attempt by the Russian Government to fabricate a pretext for the invasion of Ukraine."" Western allies have warned that recent reports of shelling in Ukraine's south-eastern Donbas region could be part of a Russian ""false-flag"" operation to justify an invasion. UK Europe Minister James Cleverly is also in New York addressing the UN Security Council. He says we're at a ""critical juncture to prevent further escalation"". ""Russia has deployed the forces necessary to invade Ukraine and now has them readied for action,"" he says. Despite Russian claims its forces are withdrawing, ""the opposite is in fact true and the Russian military build-up continues"", Cleverly says. ""Russia is patently failing to live up to the international commitments that it has made around military transparency by refusing to adequately explain its military build-up or to provide the necessary transparency to build trust or to de-escalate the situation."" We've heard more from US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, he tells the UN Security Council in New York that he has offered to meet with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Europe next week. Additionally, Blinken says the US is proposing a meeting of the Nato-Russia council and permanent council of the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe, in a bid to resolve the tensions on Ukraine's borders ""without conflict"". These meetings, Blinken adds, could ""pave the way"" for a summit of key leaders to discuss mutual security concerns. ""As lead diplomats, we have a responsibility to make every effort for diplomacy to succeed and leave no diplomatic stone unturned,"" he says. Blinken adds that the US believes that the implementation of the Minsk Agreement is vital to ensuring a diplomatic path forward. He says the US would be ""relieved"" if its warnings about Russia are incorrect and US predictions proven wrong. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here's a recap of some of the key events today:  Here's our main story on Biden's comments today. The US embassy in Moscow Russia delivered a list of demands to the US ambassador on Thursday, accusing Washington of ignoring its security demands. âNo âRussian invasion of Ukraineâ, which the United States and its allies have officially been announcing since last fall, is happening, nor is one being planned,â says the letter from the Russian Foreign Ministry. ""In the absence of the readiness of the American side to agree on firm, legally binding guarantees of our security from the United States and its allies, Russia will be forced to respond, including through the implementation of military-technical measures,"" the lengthy document says. It called the US refusal to commit to never allowing Ukraine to join Nato ""not constructive"" and called for Nato troops to pull back to countries that joined the alliance before 1997. ""We insist on the withdrawal of all US armed forces in Central Europe, Eastern Europe and the Baltics,"" it added. The letter adds that Russia is prepared to negotiate on arms control treaties, and the possible Russian inspection of US missile bases in Poland and Romania, but only if its security concerns are addressed. âWe welcome the readiness of the United States for appropriate consultations,â the document says, adding: âThis work cannot replace the settlement of the key problems posed by Russia.â The US did not immediately respond to the list of demands. The UK is scrapping a fast-track visa scheme for foreign investors over ""security concerns"" amid concerns of illicit Russian money in Britain. The Tier 1 investor visas had allowed residency in the UK for those investing at least Â£2m, but new applicants will no longer be accepted. The announcement had been expected next week amid pressure on ministers to cut UK ties to Russia over the threat of invasion to Ukraine, with a source confirming the decision to the BBC on Wednesday. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says the Tier 1 scheme is being closed to ""clamp down on illicit finance"". ""This kind of malign activity, including what we are seeing from Russia right now, has no place in the UK,"" she says. Read more on this story here. More details are emerging of the reported shell blast that struck a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine. Three staff at the nursery were injured when a projectile - which Ukraine says was fired by Russian-backed separatists - blew a whole in a wall. A mother of a child at the kindergarten says she and her husband rushed to the kindergarten in a panic when they heard about the strike in the village of Stanitsya Luhanska. A woman stands among the debris after the shelling of a kindergarten in eastern Ukraine The woman, who refused to give her name, told AFP news agency: ""I was very scared. The kindergarten has no bomb shelter. It only has thick walls. But they even managed to puncture those. I still canât calm down."" Natalia Slesareva, who works at the kindergarten, said it was a close call that everybody escaped unharmed. ""The children were eating breakfast when it hit,"" she told AFP. ""It hit the gym. After breakfast, the children had gym class. So another 15 minutes, and everything could have been much, much worse."" A Ukrainian soldier in a trench on the frontline In the past few hours: We've been hearing a lot about the Minsk agreements as tensions  escalate over the crisis. The agreements - named about the capital of Belarus where they were signed in 2014 and 2015 - are designed to keep a ceasefire between the Ukrainian government and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine. Among the deal's 13 points are a ceasefire, the withdrawal of heavy weapons, and the withdrawal of ""all foreign armed formations, military equipment and also mercenaries"" from Ukraine. They also give special status to the separatist-controlled regions of Luhansk and Donetsk and give the Ukrainian government ""full control"" of Ukraine's border with Russia. But there are fundamental differences in how the agreements are interpreted by Kyiv and Moscow. While Ukraine sees the agreements as the basis for reuniting Ukraine and re-establish its sovereignty, Russia sees them as a chance to grant autonomy to the separatist territories. The agreements have never been fully implement by both sides. Read more: What are the Minsk agreements? Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent The latest satellite images provided by the US space technology company Maxar show that wide-scale Russian military activity persists close to Ukraine's borders, despite recent Russian claims of de-escalation and withdrawal. Taken in mid-February, they illustrate that Ukraine remains surrounded on three sides - on its borders with both Russia and Belarus - by Russian military hardware and troop concentrations. It is important to remember that Russia's current military presence of around 30,000 troops in Belarus, while alarming to both Ukraine and NATO, are part of joint, scheduled exercises that are due to conclude on February 20. So a key test of Moscow's intentions will come after that date when satellite images will reveal if the bulk of Russian forces there have remained or departed. Satellite images show Russian military activity Russia says it ordered the expulsion of the deputy ambassador at the US embassy in Moscow in response to the US expulsion of a senior official at the Russian embassy in Washington. Earlier the US called the expulsion of its senior diplomat, Bart Gorman, ""unprovoked"" and an ""escalatory step"". The Russian foreign ministry has issued a statement in response to what it said were media reports presenting it as ""almost a deliberate escalation on the Russian side"". The statement says: ""The American diplomat was indeed ordered to leave Russia,
but strictly in response to the unreasonable expulsion of the
Minister-Counsellor of our Embassy in Washington, despite his
status as a leading official"". Ukrainian-born residents in the south of England say they are worried about family still living in the country. Hanna Greentree lives in Fareham with her husband and daughter, but her 65-year-old mother lives on her own in Ukraine. Khrystyna Chelak moved to the UK 15 years ago and lives in Caversham but still has family in Ukraine.
She says some people are making preparations to leave and have found their nearest bomb shelters. Watch what they have to say below. This video can not be played Ukrainian families in the south speak about concerns Barbara Plett UsherState Department Correspondent, BBC News Earlier today, US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken stopped by the UN Security Council en route to Munich to deliver a dire warning about Russian plans to invade Ukraine. He ignored admonitions by the Russian ambassador to avoid making a âcircusâ out of the meeting by âplaying to the camerasâ with such âspeculation"". His speech was the latest installment of the administrationâs aggressive information war. Itâs made a strategic decision to go public with intelligence, believing that calling out Russiaâs so-called âplaybookâ at every opportunity could serve as a deterrent to conflict. But Blinken was clearly mindful that such interventions carry risks. He made a nod to one of his predecessors, Colin Powell, whoâd argued a case for invading Iraq in 2003 which turned out to be false. âLet me be clear,â he said. âI am here today not to start a war but to prevent one.â The US would be relieved and would gladly accept any criticism about its rhetoric if Russia did not invade, he said. In the meantime, he laid out clearly, step by step, how US intelligence believes Russia could carry out an attack, starting with manufacturing a pretext to raining bombs and missiles on Kyiv. A howitzer fires during Russia-Belarus joint military exercises It's quite easy to lose track of what's been going on with all those military exercises near Ukraine's borders in recent days, with countless claims and counterclaims voiced by different players. Here's a timeline to get you up to speed: - From10 February, Russia has been holding massive drills on the territory of its key ally Belarus, Ukraine's northern neighbour - US officials have warned that up to30,000 Russian troopsmay have been involved in the drills, which are set to end on20 February - Russia has also massed troops along Ukraine's eastern border, and has been holding exercises in Crimea - a southern Ukrainian peninsula seized by Moscow in 2014 - Russia has since said that some of troops have been returning to their permanent bases - but Ukraine and its Western allies are sceptical - In addition, from13 Februarythe Russian Navy has been staging firing exercises in the Black Sea. The drills are set to end on19 February -Meanwhile, Ukraine - fearing that it could be encircled from the north, east and south - has been staging its own military exercises across its territory - Ukraine has also been boosting its territorial defence - weapons-trained civilian volunteers who could be called in case of a foreign invasion  Fergal KeaneBBC News, Northern Ukraine Maj Sergiy Khomenko says he serves to protect Ukraine's independence The Ukrainian border guards scan the snowy forest for any sign of Russian movement. They stand guard at the Senkivka crossing, where the Kremlin once celebrated the unity of the Soviet world. A few truck drivers heading south to the capital, Kyiv, cluster near the Three Sisters monument - a white obelisk erected back in 1975 to mark where the borders of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus meet. Maj Sergiy Khomenko, 29, comes from a military family and grew up in a border village. The current crisis with Russia would have been unimaginable in his parents' youth. But he serves a Ukraine that has been consistently pushing away from the orbit of Moscow. ""The independence of Ukraine is enshrined in all our documents. It is in our constitution. As a military man, I need to protect this,"" he tells me. Read the story in full here. In a video posted to its official Twitter account, the UK's Ministry of Defence (MoD) has warned that ""a considerable number of civilians will die"" if Russia chooses to attack Ukraine. In a video update posted on Thursday, the MoD said that it has seen no evidence to substantiate Russian claims that its forces are withdrawing from the border region and ""can conduct an invasion without further warning"". The video also outlined a number of reasons that Russian President Vladimir Putin would want to launch a military operation in Ukraine, including a belief that is it is a ""strategically important buffer zone"" between Russia and Nato, as well as its cultural and historical ties to Russia. ""It [Russia] does not accept Ukraine as an independent state,"" the video's narrator says. ""But it is an independent state"". The Russian forces amassed on Ukraine's borders are ""beyond anything needed"" for large-scale military exercises and could directly threaten Kyiv, the MoD video said. ""Defence intelligence assesses that [Putin] would be willing to sustain thousands of casualties to get what he wants,"" it warned. The MoD ends with the message that Putin ""can still choose peace"" and diplomacy to de-escalate tensions. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While tensions mount, the US government has urged its citizens to leave Ukraine immediately, citing the threat of an imminent Russian invasion. But not all US citizens who live in Ukraine are taking this advice. Many here don't believe that a full-scale attack on Kyiv is imminent, despite warnings from intelligence sources quoted in the media. BBC News Ukraine has spoken to some Americans living in the country, including businessmen, teachers and volunteers, and asked them about their decision to stay. ""I will not leave the country I call home,"" says Sean Almeida Sean Almeida, from Boston, has been building a business in Kyiv since 2014, and now, despite the threat, does not intend to flee Ukraine. ""Let Biden say what he wants, but I am not going to panic and leave the country that has long since become my home,"" he says.

Not if Russiaâs eleven-page written response to Washingtonâs proposal is anything to go by. The letter is full of criticism of the United States. The tone is bitter,
impatient and pretty uncompromising. Moscow detected âno constructive answerâ from the US to
Russiaâs key demands, such as an end to Nato enlargement eastwards. Russia is not softening its stance. Itâs insisting that all
US troops and weaponry be withdrawn from central and eastern Europe,
south-eastern Europe and the Baltics. Hard to see America agreeing to that. Then came the threat. Itâs one that President Putin has
already delivered: that if Moscow fails to receive the âlegally binding
security guaranteesâ it seeks, it will react with âmilitary-technical means.â What would those be? Moscowâs not saying - intentionally. To
keep the West guessing. Todayâs expulsion of the deputy US ambassador to Moscow adds
to the general sense of diplomacy stalling. Washington interprets the move as
an escalation. Russia doesnât want to be seen to be closing the door to

Train services down by a fifth after Covid slumpSome commuters have complained amid uncertainty about a return to pre-pandemic service levels.Business,"More than a fifth of train services that were running before the Covid pandemic have not returned, new data provided to the BBC shows. One month after work-from-home guidance was lifted, some commuters say they are struggling to get to work amid a lack of trains and sudden cancellations. Train operating companies said they are starting to bring back more services. But rail minister Wendy Morton could not guarantee that services would return to pre-pandemic levels. The government says it has spent more than Â£14bn propping up the railways after passenger numbers, and ticket revenue, collapsed during the Covid pandemic. Omicron dealt passenger numbers a fresh setback at the end of 2021, as people were again asked to work from home if they could. Timetables across the country were cut back again over the winter which train companies blamed on high levels of staff isolation. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, says 19,500 trains are now running per day, which is equivalent to 79% of overall pre-Covid services. It says that is expected to rise to 85% by the end of the month. The shape of the timetable beyond that is still uncertain. As commuters slowly return, deciding how many services to are needed at which times is a challenge. The industry group points out that current passenger demand is still below the capacity available. The latest figures from the Department for Transport show that on Monday this week, passenger usage was about 64% of pre-pandemic levels. Leisure travel has recovered better than weekdays. The rail industry has launched a rewards programme to incentivise commuters, and a flexible season ticket has been introduced in an attempt to adapt to changed habits. Lee Garrett and Amy Kean say their commuter services have been reduced making returning to the office difficult But Lee Garrett and Amy Kean say the current level of rail service is putting them off returning to regular train trips into the office. They say arriving on time is proving challenging. The couple live in Gipsy Hill, close to Crystal Palace, and commute into Central London, but many of the services they used before the pandemic have been cut. Lee said: ""There's only one train every half an hour at the moment. ""Yesterday was the perfect example. I turn up to get the one that would have got me to work on time and it's cancelled, so I am down to one an hour. ""So I have to change my plan, turn round, and work from home."" This week, that isn't too much of a problem as Lee doesn't have to be in the office. ""At the moment it is voluntary. Next week when it is mandatory it is going to be a problem"" Lee said. He is hoping that more services are soon added. For his wife Amy, getting to the office on time on her mandated days is already proving difficult. ""I have people in my team from Kent and Essex and I'd say at least 25% are having problems every day. ""There are fewer trains an hour, they are very crowded, and they are randomly being cancelled. They are not as frequent or reliable."" Recently appointed rail minister Wendy Morton said people were now working differently in a ""changing landscape"" with people ""starting to blend home and the office"". She said it was necessary to ""balance the mix"". Ms Morton could not confirm that services would ever return to levels before March 2020, and said the government is ""reviewing and monitoring the trains and levels of passengers. ""We are not where we were previously,"" she said. Pointing to more than Â£14bn of taxpayer funding used to keep the railways going, any decisions would need to be ""fair for passengers and fair to taxpayers as well,"" she added. Rail industry insiders say that day-to-day Covid infections are still affecting their ability to run all timetabled services, with staff still off, and train operating crews short of people. They also point to interruption in driver training. Some operators have bid to run more services that would bring them close to pre-Covid levels, but a final decision is still to be made on that. While passenger numbers on trains and buses are still lower than they were, road traffic has rebounded, with car journeys approaching pre-pandemic levels. Business groups say train services need to be running to help local economies, but also to help cut pollution from car journeys. Raj Kandola, from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce said: ""We need an appropriate level of service to get people back to the office. ""To make sure they are frequenting the city centre and using leisure services. ""At the same time, we need to get people get out of their cars if we are going to reduce the amount of congestion on our polluted road networks."" Businesses who traditionally depend on rail trade are also hoping that services and commuters return. Peter Collie owns the Horseshoe Inn near London Bridge railway station, and the Prince of Wales pub a stone's throw from Paddington station. Trade has been 80% down during the pandemic, with the Paddington site the worst hit. ""We've lost probably 50% of the staff we had back in 2019,"" he says. ""We've had to cut back on everything that we wanted to do."" But he believes career opportunities and social benefits will eventually tempt commuters back. ""Being optimistic, we'll hopefully be back to firing on full cylinders within two years,"" he says. And some businesses say that people are now prepared to spend more money when they visit city centres, because they are only commuting two or three days per week.

Rates will rise across all 11 councils areas,"The money generated by rates is used to pay for public services, with bills decided against the value of a property All of Northern Ireland's 11 councils have agreed rates increases for 2022-23. The highest percentage increase was by Mid Ulster District Council at 3.9%. The lowest percentage increase was agreed by the Antrim and Newtownabbey council area, which announced a 1.9% rise. The money generated by rates is used to pay for public services, with bills decided against the value of a property. Councils have cited the affect of the coronavirus pandemic as well as rising energy costs as factors behind the decision to increase rates. Planned council savings 'won't mean service cuts' Some councils froze their rates for last year as a way of acknowledging the financial pressures facing people during the pandemic. Rates are set at a regional level each year by Stormont and a rate is then also decided at a district level by each council in Northern Ireland. They regional rate covers regional services like hospitals and roads maintenance, while the district rate covers services like leisure centre facilities and waste management. Antrim and Newtownabbey Rates in the Antrim and Newtownabbey council area will increase by 1.9%. The SDLP had proposed a rates freeze for the year ahead, but Alliance councillor for Antrim Neil Kelly said that would be ""ridiculous and irresponsible"". Council chief executive Jacqui Dixon said it would be ""difficult to identify"" how to freeze rates ""without having an impact on our financial sustainability"". Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon Those in the ABC Borough Council area will see a rise of 1.97% in their rates for the next financial year. It adds an extra Â£0.19 per week to bills, or Â£9.79 annually for the average household. For businesses, it means an increase of Â£13 per month or Â£156 for the year. Lord mayor of Armagh City, Banbridge and Craigavon, Alderman Glenn Barr, said the rate struck was well below inflation and was ""marginal in comparison to the significant increase in energy costs"". ""The council has tried to absorb as much of these costs as it can and in the face of other unavoidable pressures such as the new health and care levy,"" he said. Ards and North Down The rate agreed by Ards and North Down councillors represents a 2.75% increase for the borough. It equates to an increase of Â£1 per month for the average household (Â£12 a year), or Â£10 a month for the average business (Â£120 a year). The council has said the money will go towards redevelopment plans for Bangor Waterfront, better borough-wide broadband and an Innovation Hub, among other projects. Belfast Councillors have agreed a 2.99% increase for the district for 2022-23. The council said on its website that the rise fell well below the inflation rate. Broken down, the costs will mean an average increase of: Â£1.18 per month, or Â£14.11 per year, for a house Â£19.18 per month, or Â£230.22 per year, for an office unit Â£15.72 per month, or Â£188.60 per year, for a retail unit Causeway Coast and Glens The council agreed a rates rise of 3.49%. It means monthly bills for households in the district will increase by Â£1.40 (based on a house value of Â£121,478). Mayor of Causeway Coast and Glens Borough Council Richard Holmes acknowledged the rise and cited several pressures. ""Unprecedented rises in utility and energy costs along with other factors including the ongoing health crisis and uncertainty around central government funding, has meant the organisation has been faced with more than Â£5.1m of additional financial pressures beyond our control,"" he said. Derry City and Strabane The rates for those in the Derry City and Strabane district will rise by 3.44%. It means the average domestic rate will increase by Â£0.33 per week, or Â£16.97 annually. Mayor of Derry City and Strabane District Council Alderman Graham Warke said the decision had been ""a very challenging process in a difficult economic climate"". Fermanagh and Omagh The rate struck by Fermanagh and Omagh District councillors was 2.72%. The average household (house price listed at Â£114,500) will pay an extra Â£0.23 per week or Â£11.96 annually. The council said the setting of the rate would raise approximately Â£38m in additional revenue, with the majority (Â£10m) earmarked for waste management. Northern Ireland has 11 council areas Lisburn and Castlereagh Councillors agreed to increase rates in the district by 3.64%. The council said that for a house with a value of Â£180,000 this would mean an increase in monthly costs of Â£1.73, or Â£20.70 a year. It cited improvements to full-fibre broadband across the district and investment in community facilities as ways in which the money gathered from rates would be used. Mid and East Antrim The rate struck for the Mid and East Antrim council area is 3.64%. It means the average household's bill will increase by Â£0.34 per week or Â£17.50 per year. The average business will see a Â£4.44 rise per week or Â£231 annually. Alderman Billy Ashe cited rising national insurance payments, national pay awards, fuel and energy increases, as well as insurance and landfill costs as factors behind the increase in rates bills for those in the borough. Mid Ulster Mid Ulster District Council struck the highest percentage increase for rates in Northern Ireland at 3.9%. The council said the increase had to be factored against a rates freeze applied for the 2021-22 financial year and that despite the rise, it was confident its rates would be among the lowest in Northern Ireland. The rates increase equates to a rise of Â£1.68 per month for the average household, or Â£16.75 per year. Factors cited for the rise in rates included Â£4.1m of additional financial pressures beyond the control of the council, which said it would deliver an Â£80m capital investment programme in the next three years. Newry, Mourne and Down The council agreed a 1.95% increase from last year's rates for the district. Councillor Cathy Mason said the council was happy the figure would not increase by more than 2%. ""It is crucially important that we strike a balance between supporting our ratepayers through challenging times and continuing to invest in the future of the district,"" she said.

Train services down by a fifth after Covid slumpSome commuters have complained amid uncertainty about a return to pre-pandemic service levels.,"More than a fifth of train services that were running before the Covid pandemic have not returned, new data provided to the BBC shows. One month after work-from-home guidance was lifted, some commuters say they are struggling to get to work amid a lack of trains and sudden cancellations. Train operating companies said they are starting to bring back more services. But rail minister Wendy Morton could not guarantee that services would return to pre-pandemic levels. The government says it has spent more than Â£14bn propping up the railways after passenger numbers, and ticket revenue, collapsed during the Covid pandemic. Omicron dealt passenger numbers a fresh setback at the end of 2021, as people were again asked to work from home if they could. Timetables across the country were cut back again over the winter which train companies blamed on high levels of staff isolation. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents operators, says 19,500 trains are now running per day, which is equivalent to 79% of overall pre-Covid services. It says that is expected to rise to 85% by the end of the month. The shape of the timetable beyond that is still uncertain. As commuters slowly return, deciding how many services to are needed at which times is a challenge. The industry group points out that current passenger demand is still below the capacity available. The latest figures from the Department for Transport show that on Monday this week, passenger usage was about 64% of pre-pandemic levels. Leisure travel has recovered better than weekdays. The rail industry has launched a rewards programme to incentivise commuters, and a flexible season ticket has been introduced in an attempt to adapt to changed habits. Lee Garrett and Amy Kean say their commuter services have been reduced making returning to the office difficult But Lee Garrett and Amy Kean say the current level of rail service is putting them off returning to regular train trips into the office. They say arriving on time is proving challenging. The couple live in Gipsy Hill, close to Crystal Palace, and commute into Central London, but many of the services they used before the pandemic have been cut. Lee said: ""There's only one train every half an hour at the moment. ""Yesterday was the perfect example. I turn up to get the one that would have got me to work on time and it's cancelled, so I am down to one an hour. ""So I have to change my plan, turn round, and work from home."" This week, that isn't too much of a problem as Lee doesn't have to be in the office. ""At the moment it is voluntary. Next week when it is mandatory it is going to be a problem"" Lee said. He is hoping that more services are soon added. For his wife Amy, getting to the office on time on her mandated days is already proving difficult. ""I have people in my team from Kent and Essex and I'd say at least 25% are having problems every day. ""There are fewer trains an hour, they are very crowded, and they are randomly being cancelled. They are not as frequent or reliable."" Recently appointed rail minister Wendy Morton said people were now working differently in a ""changing landscape"" with people ""starting to blend home and the office"". She said it was necessary to ""balance the mix"". Ms Morton could not confirm that services would ever return to levels before March 2020, and said the government is ""reviewing and monitoring the trains and levels of passengers. ""We are not where we were previously,"" she said. Pointing to more than Â£14bn of taxpayer funding used to keep the railways going, any decisions would need to be ""fair for passengers and fair to taxpayers as well,"" she added. Rail industry insiders say that day-to-day Covid infections are still affecting their ability to run all timetabled services, with staff still off, and train operating crews short of people. They also point to interruption in driver training. Some operators have bid to run more services that would bring them close to pre-Covid levels, but a final decision is still to be made on that. While passenger numbers on trains and buses are still lower than they were, road traffic has rebounded, with car journeys approaching pre-pandemic levels. Business groups say train services need to be running to help local economies, but also to help cut pollution from car journeys. Raj Kandola, from the Greater Birmingham Chambers of Commerce said: ""We need an appropriate level of service to get people back to the office. ""To make sure they are frequenting the city centre and using leisure services. ""At the same time, we need to get people get out of their cars if we are going to reduce the amount of congestion on our polluted road networks."" Businesses who traditionally depend on rail trade are also hoping that services and commuters return. Peter Collie owns the Horseshoe Inn near London Bridge railway station, and the Prince of Wales pub a stone's throw from Paddington station. Trade has been 80% down during the pandemic, with the Paddington site the worst hit. ""We've lost probably 50% of the staff we had back in 2019,"" he says. ""We've had to cut back on everything that we wanted to do."" But he believes career opportunities and social benefits will eventually tempt commuters back. ""Being optimistic, we'll hopefully be back to firing on full cylinders within two years,"" he says. And some businesses say that people are now prepared to spend more money when they visit city centres, because they are only commuting two or three days per week.

Charities' concerns over Andrew's offer of supportThe Duke of York pledged to help the fight against sex trafficking after settling his civil case.UK,"Charities working with survivors of abuse say they have ""significant concerns"" about the Duke of York's offer to support trafficking victims. Prince Andrew made the pledge after settling the US civil sexual assault case brought by Virginia Giuffre, and agreeing to pay her an undisclosed sum. He made no admission of liability and has always denied the allegations. Labour MP Jess Phillips has expressed doubt Andrew could play a constructive role in combating trafficking. ""Those who work in sexual violence [and] human trafficking services are certainly not going to have open arms to his allyship... even if it was just finances,"" she said. Prince Andrew settles US civil sex assault case Who is Prince Andrew and what titles is he losing? Where does Prince Andrew get his money from? Prince Andrew must give up York title - city MP Ms Giuffre had been suing Andrew in a civil action, claiming he sexually assaulted her on three occasions when she was 17 - which the prince has repeatedly denied. On Tuesdayit was announced they had reachedan out-of-court settlement. A statement from their lawyers said the duke would pay an undisclosed sum to Ms Giuffre and make a ""substantial donation"" to her charity in support of victims' rights. It also said the duke regretted his association with late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Prince Andrew hadpreviously told BBC Newsnightin 2019 he did not regret being friends with Epstein. No details of the payout to Ms Giuffre have been made public - and there are calls for more detail about where the money will come from. Labour MP Andy McDonald told BBC Newsnight that he intends to raise the issue in Parliament to find out whether public money is being used for the settlement. Mr McDonald said ""the issue isn't going to go away until people have that information and receive assurances that public money is not going to be used to in any way contribute to the settlement"". The exact amount of the financial settlement has not been revealed but reports have speculated that it could run into millions of pounds. The duke receives a Royal Navy pension and a stipend from the Queen's Duchy of Lancaster income. In a statement released on Tuesday, Andrew also pledged to ""demonstrate his regret for his association with Epstein by supporting the fight against the evils of sex trafficking, and by supporting its victims"". This video can not be played Watch: What did Prince Andrew say about Virginia Giuffre's allegations in the 2019 Newsnight interview? Prince Andrew spoke to BBC Newsnight's Emily Maitlis in 2019 about his relationship with convicted paedophile Jeffrey Epstein. Watch thefull interview on BBC iPlayer. Maitlis: Andrew now seems to contradict answers he gave me Gabrielle Shaw, chief executive of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood (Napac), said: ""Napac acknowledges and is grateful to the many generous fundraisers and donors who are survivors or supporters of survivors themselves,"" she added. ""With this trust being core to Napac's approach, any support for the charity that Prince Andrew may offer would raise significant concerns as to the ethical implications of accepting money or patronage from an individual who is a suspected perpetrator and who had ties to a convicted offender."" Beyond the Streets, a charity working to end sexual exploitation, said it was unlikely it would accept any support offered by Andrew. ""We think the priority of organisations who support women who have been exploited should be on their beneficiaries and not on the profile and activities of those who support them,"" a spokesperson said. ""This is particularly important in situations such as this where it could be perceived that there is a benefit to the potential supporter and there have been serious accusations involved."" Jayne Butler, chief executive of Rape Crisis England and Wales said while it had not been offered any support, financial or otherwise by Andrew or Ms Giuffre, it would not do so ""without consulting with our Rape Crisis member centres and with survivors"". Ms Phillips, shadow minister for domestic violence and safeguarding, told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour: ""It's going to take a huge amount of effort and I think it will be incredibly hard for Prince Andrew to make that effort."" Prince Andrew, Virginia Roberts - now Virginia Giuffre - and Ghislaine Maxwell in 2001 Ms Giuffre, now 38, claims she was the victim of sex trafficking and abuse by financier Epstein from the age of 16. Epstein died while awaiting trial in 2019. She claimed the duke sexually assaulted her on three separate occasions in London, New York, and on Epstein's private island in the US Virgin Islands. Who is Virginia Giuffre? Who was Jeffrey Epstein? In a 2019 interview with BBC Newsnight, Prince Andrew said he didn't recall meeting Ms Giuffre and that an incident in which she alleges they had sex at the Belgravia home of Ghislaine Maxwell ""didn't happen"". In January, a New York court ruled that the civil action against him could go ahead. Shortly afterwards, Buckingham Palace said the prince's military titles and royal patronages had been returned to the Queen and that he would defend Ms Giuffre's civil case as a ""private citizen"". If Prince Andrew had gone to court in the US to fight it out with Virginia Giuffre, it would have made headlines as tall as a New York skyscraper. That royal disaster zone has been averted by an out-of-court settlement. But it comes with high costs to Prince Andrew, both financial and reputational, and it will be a long road back before there is any chance of clearing his name in terms of public opinion.

MPs call for full compensation for postmasters,"Post Office workers who successfully challenged faulty Horizon software in civil courts should be fully compensated, MPs have said. A new report from a cross-party group of MPs says the 555 people who took the Post Office to court should receive money for their losses. It comes days after a public inquiry into the Post Office scandal began. Hundreds were taken to court for fraud after Horizon led to accounting errors at branches across the UK. But in 2019, a group of 555 subpostmasters and mistresses successfully challenged the Post Office over the Horizon system in the High Court. While the government has since opened a fund to compensate more than 700 wrongfully convicted former branch managers, the 555 people were not able to claim from this because of settlements with the Post Office. They claim they are out of pocket due to legal costs, while others have since passed away. Former Post Office manager speaks of scandal 'hell' Post Office scandal inquiry 'a waste of time' Why were hundreds of sub-postmasters prosecuted? Labour MP Darren Jones, who chairs the Business Select Committee which wrote the report, described the scandal as ""one of the largest miscarriages of justice in British history"". ""It is clearly entirely unacceptable that the group of 555 victims who first brought this scandal successfully to court are being left in a worse position than those who are being compensated thanks to their action,"" he added. In December,the government came forward with a support packageto foot the bill for compensation. But the committee called for clarity about whether this funding would be available to the 555 former branch managers who won the civil case. Its interim report said the funding the government had provided was ""far in excess of the costs incurred so far"", with estimated pay-outs of about Â£258m to date. Mr Jones also said that it was his ""personal view"" that the families of sub-postmasters who had died without being refunded for the scandal should be able to claim compensation. Speaking as part of the public inquiry on Wednesday, the widow of a former subpostmaster spoke of her disbelief that her husband was not given a chance to defend himself against charges of theft, fraud and false accounting. Mrs Karen Wilson was appearing on behalf of her late husband, Julian, who died of bowel cancer in 2017 before his conviction was overturned. He had been a subpostmaster in Worcestershire. Karen Wilson said her husband was left broken by the investigation and conviction She described Julian's strong business background and how the couple would work until late into the night trying to work out why the Horizon IT system would not balance. Her husband received a community service order, to clean graves, after arranging a plea bargain with the Post Office. The couple's assets were frozen by a confiscation order and they had to borrow money from family members. Mrs Wilson sold all her jewellery - including her engagement ring - to pay the mortgage. The couple also had to pay Â£36,000 which the system had shown as missing and Â£3,000 in court costs. Mrs Wilson said on Wednesday she would like to see some ""accountability"" above all. This video can not be played Watch: Tracy Felstead was sent to Holloway Prison for a crime she didn't commit The public inquiry into this scandal is about establishing why this miscarriage of justice happened, and who should be held to account, but that will take time. So this Parliamentary committee have made some quick-fix demands of the government that would make a big difference to those who have suffered so much. Many of the victims I've spoken to have told me of their fear of having to face their accusers at the Post Office once again, and re-engage with a system they have done their best to put behind them. It's no wonder so few have come forward to request documents from a company they have lost all faith in. An independent go-between could help. The civil court case brought by 555 sub-postmasters two years ago was the moment the tables were turned in this scandal. Yet the trailblazers who spent their own money and time bringing the case to court, and creating that vital legal precedent, have been locked out of the compensation scheme. There are clear indications from the government that it is working behind the scenes to make some kind of payment to those 555 individuals soon. But time is not on the side of many sub-postmasters who are still suffering financial ruin with many well beyond retirement age. The Post Office has previously said it is ""sincerely sorry for the impact of the Horizon scandal on the lives of victims and their families and we are in no doubt about the human cost"". ""In addressing the past, our first priority is that full, fair and final compensation is provided and we are making good progress,"" it added. The committee's report also raised concerns about the time taken to make settlements to those who have had their convictions overturned. It recommended that the government provides regular updates when compensation is refused for sub-postmasters who have had their convictions overturned, the reasons for this, and if compensation is later sought and awarded. A spokesperson for the Department for Business said that it acknowledged the ""devastating impact"" on postmasters and their families. ""That is why we have set up a statutory inquiry to set out exactly what went wrong, and we are providing financial support for compensation."" ""We are eager to see all Horizon-related issues resolved fairly and quickly, including for the 555, who played a crucial role in bringing this scandal to light,"" they added.

Coveney to meet Stormont parties amid NI crisis,"Simon Coveney is visiting Northern Ireland for the first time since the executive collapsed Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has played down the prospect of a breakthrough on the Northern Ireland Protocol in UK-EU talks next week. He was speaking as he arrived in Belfast for talks with the Stormont parties. Mr Coveney was asked about the next UK-EU joint committee meeting due to happen on Monday. He said it was more likely to be a ""staging post"" for the two sides to issue a statement on progress so far. Mr Coveney has previously said he believes negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocolmust conclude by the end of this month. The Irish foreign minister also told the media in Belfast on Thursday that the Irish and British governments are not ""bystanders"" in trying to resolve the latest political crisis at Stormont. It is the first time the minister has visited since thepower-sharing executive collapsed earlier this month. He is to have talks with four of the five main parties to discuss the political crisis, as well as negotiations over the protocol. Mr Coveney said Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson is travelling and would be unable to meet him in person on Thursday, but they would remain in contact. Following a meeting with the European Commission vice-president MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ on Thursday, Sir Jeffrey warned that ""unionism is rapidly losing faith that a negotiated solution is possible"". ""It is time for the government to take action which restores fairness and reinstates Northern Ireland's access to the UK internal market,"" he said in a statement. ""This is the only way to build a better future for everyone in Northern Ireland."" Mr Coveney said officials in London, Dublin and Brussels were all actively involved in trying to find solutions to the Northern Ireland Protocol. However, he added that it was up to the Stormont parties alone to return to government together and that he would continue to support them to reach a resolution. Mr Coveney is also expected to meet civic society leaders in Armagh during his visit. The minister was involved in negotiations that helped lead to the signing of theNew Decade New Approach,externalagreement in January 2020, restoring Stormont's institutions after a three-year impasse. The UK government has insisted it wants to reach a solution urgently, in light of the latest crisis at Stormont. Its lead negotiator, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, met her EU counterpart last Friday for a further round of talks. Liz Truss said she wants to work with the EU towards solutions that deliver for people in Northern Ireland Earlier, Mr Coveney said those involved in the negotiations are ""putting in a lot of time"" to make progress before the upcoming assembly elections on 5 May. ""Liz Truss and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ were the two key negotiators on each side but are very much supported by the Irish government and many others who want to try a way forward here,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He described the decision of the DUP to withdraw Paul Givan as first minister as part of its ongoing opposition to the Irish Sea border as ""very unfortunate"". The party has argued that unless the arrangements are changed, political institutions in Northern Ireland cannot continue as normal. ""We're trying to find a way of ensuring that the Northern Ireland Protocol, which is part of an international agreement that the UK government designed, helped to write and then ratified, can be implemented in a way that's acceptable for all sides, including unionists,"" Mr Coveney said. ""The Irish government is going to work closely with the British government and the EU to try to find a solution that everybody can live with."" Sinn FÃ©in Vice-President Michelle O'Neill said she believed the UK government had moved back from its threat to override part of the protocol by triggering Article 16. She said the issue had been raised during her meetings with Mr Coveney and the EU's chief negotiator, Maros Sefcovic on Thursday. ""It appears off the boil for now - but the Tory government has shown before there are many twists and turns still to go but we'll continue doing all we can to work with the EU and find a solution to make the protocol work."" UK and EU to continue 'intensive' protocol talks Protocol negotiations 'need to end by February' A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Speaking after his meeting with Mr Coveney and Mr Å efÄoviÄ, Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie said they were ""as far away now as we were last year"" in reaching a deal on the protocol. ""We're far away from any form of solution,"" he said. ""But what I do think they want on February 21 is to finish the joint committee and come out with a positive statement of intent that we're going in a particular direction"". SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said he believed there would not be much progress before May's assembly election, warning that the DUP's decision to collapse the executive had not sparked a change in negotiations. ""This will end in tears for the DUP, what they've set out as red lines were always going to be in achievable,"" he added. Without a first and deputy first minister in place it is not yet clear who will attend a meeting of the joint committee on behalf of the Northern Ireland institutions, but it is likely that a senior civil servant could take part instead.

The fairy tale estate where you pay cheap rent,"This video can not be played Fairy tale estate helps keep young people local Nestled in the mountains of north Wales and surrounded by rivers and waterfalls are a series of striking and unique properties, which some describe as ""the stuff of fairy tales"". But, perhaps more unusual than the vivid blue doors that unite them is the fact that those living there aren't wealthy individuals or holiday makers, but millennials paying cheap rents. The Brondanw estate community, which boasts views of Snowdon, has been made possible by a radical housing scheme. Its foundations were laid by the architect behind the nearbyenchanting Italianate-style village Portmeirion. Tough choices as rising living costs hit home North Wales 'one of world's top places' What's Wales' problem with second homes? Sir Clough Williams-Ellis wanted something different than to leave his estate of about 50 historical properties to descendants. So he set up a charitable trust in the 1970s which now helps families in the area to find affordable homes to rent. Sir Clough Williams-Ellis hoped Portmeirion would inspire others ""We try to set the rent somewhere between market rate and social housing,"" explained Sir Clough's great-granddaughter, Seran Dolma, who is trustee of the estate. ""It means we have a really thriving community - lots of young people, lots of children. People know each other and care about each other."" It is perhaps unsurprising that the estate has a long waiting list of applicants, but priority is always given to those with a connection to the area, who speak Welsh and have the ability to contribute to the community. Although it is not exclusively for Welsh speakers, Ms Dolma believes ""it's important people are able to live in the communities that they were born"". Seran Dolma says the community is tight-knit and full of young people Jasper Atkinson grew up a few miles away from the estate in Gwynedd, but never realised it existed until a friend encouraged him to apply for a house. ""I had definitely noticed the strange, coloured doors and windows before, but I'd never really questioned it,"" he laughed. Last year he and his partner were offered a cottage to rent in the woods nearby. ""We're in the middle of a mossy forest, we have a river running through the garden, snowdrops everywhere,"" he said. ""It's absolutely beautiful and our closest neighbours are a ten-minute walk away,"" says Jasper Atkinson But the most important factor for the 28-year-old is what the low rent has meant for them both. ""I have lived absolutely on the edge of only just making it every month and getting into more and more debt. ""It drives down your mental health and you end up just working to exist."" ""Portmeirion blue"" is used on all the estate's properties Jasper said the rent he and his partner pay is about half what he would expect to pay for a terraced house where he grew up, and that's enabled him to start his eco-building company. ""When you have those really high rent rates and inflated rent rates you lose all the young people,"" he said. ""We do have a very young community here, the highest concentration I've seen in rural Wales."" As opposed to new arrivals like Jasper, many other tenants grew up on the estate before returning in their 20s. Silvia Rose, 29, moved into one of the former gardener's cottages two years ago and loves the ""very old woodland, fields and beautiful rivers you can swim in all year round"". Despite spending her childhood at a different house on the estate, Silvia said it wasn't until she was faced with living costs herself that she appreciated how different her community was. For Silvia Rose, renting a three-bedroom house anywhere else would be out of the question ""What's unique is that me and my partner Jack are able to rent a three-bedroom house together in such a beautiful place. I think it would otherwise certainly be an Airbnb by now. ""I suppose I always was aware that there was something special about this place, but maybe I didn't quite understand it."" Silvia said the area has always had a reputation for attracting ""slightly alternative"" people, and that the current community, which features several artists and creatives, would have stayed true to Sir Clough's original vision. Stunning views surround properties on the estate About a mile down the road, Steffan Smith and his young family have potentially one of the estate's most unique properties. ""I don't think I'd always planned to come back - but there was always something about this particular valley that drew you back in,"" explained the 31-year-old. He said 50 years ago a young family like his may have been able to afford such a property, but today the housing market makes that ""impossible"". ""We benefitted from the estate as children and are benefitting from it doubly so as adults."" He said the mountains to climb are freely available to the community, which means ""you don't need to flash your bank card at everything"". Steffan Smith grew up on the estate and now, with his partner Lowri, rent the former woollen mill Housing in Wales' most scenic and rural areas is a subject of heated debate. Many communities say they feel under threat from second homes and holiday lets pushing up market prices. But many second homeowners say they feel scapegoated for wider housing issues. Seran said the estate would like to do more to help and does actively bid on new properties nearby, but resources are limited. ""It's difficult for us to create a role outside of the limited area that we have influence over - we only own these properties."" However, she said the Clough Williams-Ellis Foundation is perhaps an ""example"" that could be followed by others with means.

What a day. Great Britain are finally guaranteed a medal at these Winter Olympics courtesy of the men's curlers. You can read all about their winhere. We're going to leave our text updates here but you can still watch the BBC TV coverage above. There will be a lot of dissection and discussion on a dramatic but controversial day. You can scroll down too for headlines, clips and reaction. We'll be back late tonight! Medal events:4 Biathlon(men's mass start),freestyle skiing(women's halfpipe, men's ski cross),speed skating(men's 1,000m) Attention will be firmly on the halfpipe and curling rink from a British perspective on Friday. Zoe Atkingoes in women's ski halfpipe (01:30-02:49) final, having qualified in fourth-place. At 12:05 GMT, theGreat Britain women's teamlook to follow their male counterparts in reaching the curling final. They meet Sweden in the semi-final. Elsewhere,Ollie Davies, who became the first Briton to reach the ski cross big final at a World Championship last year, marks his Olympic debut with the knockout runs beginning at 06:45 and the finals starting just before 08:00. Cornelius Kerstenreturns in speed skating's 1000m event. He's ranked 11th in the world over this distance in the 2021-22 season. Mica McNeillandMontell Douglasgo in the first two runs of the two-woman bobsleigh (12:00 and 13:30). Figure Skating - women's free skate Christopher DeanFormer Olympic champion on BBC TV The whole process has been farcical. The organisation, the politics surrounding it to get to this point has been a real mess. And the loser is figure skating, the women's event is suffering from it. The doping hasn't made her have the ability she has. It may have allowed her to train harder and longer, but her technique is second to none. The other two Russians competing are out of the same school so it casts a shadow over of the whole system. Did we not have this when the Olympics were in Sochi? They said 'ok, we are going to ban Russia, but we are going to let them all come under a different flag'. But it's the same systemic issue of the Russians coming to compete. But for sure I don't think Valieva knew what she was taking. Jayne TorvillFormer Olympic champion on BBC TV It's a difficult one. For her personally I would want her to be in the final. But is that fair to the other competitors? But as a young 15-year-old I don't think this was any of her doing, she has been very misguided. Figure skating - women's free skate Robin CousinsOlympic gold medallist figure skater on BBC TV The reaction toKamila Valieva's struggles in the women's singles finale continues. She missed out on the medal places after a poor final routine. Someone thought having her do
that was better than having her go home to her family and to wait and sort this
out, knowing she could have two more Olympics ahead of her. To see the talent and the
unquestionable quality of Valieva... To see it put into this arena in that way
should never have happened. Men's curling BBC Sport The rest of the men's curling team break down their performance: Grant Hardie:""After my missed shot in
the second end for them to steal a two, you're fearing the worst but we all
stuck together, turned that round and we're chuffed."" Bobby Lammy:""They're
quite out there as a team, they speak a lot, but we knew we had to bring that
energy as well. Even after that two, we knew we still had to keep together,
keep fighting, keep going for it and thankfully we managed to pull through. Hammie McMillan:""We
kept control. We were quite happy blanking and we knew the percentages at the
seventh end and not giving up a two was key.

I'm shaking. On having to play twice in one day:""We play a lot of these two games days on tour so we were happy to get the win.
