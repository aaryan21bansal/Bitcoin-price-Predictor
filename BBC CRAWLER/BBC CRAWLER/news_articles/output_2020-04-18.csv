'Critical' to get protective kit to NHS front line,"It is ""critical"" personal protective equipment gets to NHS staff so they can follow the best possible guidance on its use, a senior official has said. Public Health England changed its adviceon Friday to allow the reuse of gowns if stocks run low. NHS England's medical director Prof Stephen Powis said the previous guidance remained the ""best"" - but required adequate kit supply. The communities secretary said 400,000 gowns were arriving on Sunday. But Robert Jenrick did not dispute the suggestion from a reporter that this would only last NHS England around three days. And he acknowledged that the ""short supply"" in areas such as masks and aprons was causing an ""extremely anxious time for people on the front line"". It comes as the UK recorded another 888 coronavirus deaths, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 15,464. Coronavirus cases to be tracked by ethnicity Parks and cemeteries must stay open, says minister Carer, 26, dies after contracting coronavirus Speaking at the daily coronavirus briefing at No 10, Prof Powis said the government was ""working incredibly hard"" to supply protective gear to front-line healthcare workers. This video can not be played Mr Jenrick announces that 400,000 gowns are due to arrive from Turkey on Sunday PHE guidance previously said healthcare staff treating Covid-19 patients should wear long-sleeved disposable fluid-repellent gowns. But this was changed on Friday, with PHE outlining three options if gowns were not available as it said ""some compromise"" was needed ""in times of extreme shortages"". Prof Powis said the former guidance remained ""the best possible guidance for the state of the epidemic we've reached"". ""In order to ensure that that guidance can be followed, it's absolutely critical above everything else that we have the supplies of PPE going out to the front line,"" he said, adding that the safety of NHS staff was an an issue of ""personal"" importance. ""I'm a doctor, I've worked for many years on the front line and I can absolutely assure you for me and my clinical colleagues, this is very personal,"" he said. ""These are my friends, colleagues, extended family."" Analysis by BBC health reporter Philippa Roxby An 84-tonne shipment of gowns from Turkey on Sunday will be welcomed, but it won't last long given there are around half a million front-line NHS staff. That means they soon face the prospect of re-using gowns or wearing alternatives that are not designed to repel fluids, according to new guidance from Public Health England. While ministers have always said the shortage is a result of huge global demand for protective equipment, doctors and nurses are not impressed. Prof Steve Powis, a doctor who has worked on the front line for many years, appeared to take it personally. And he suggested what his ""clinical colleagues"" needed was what they were promised two weeks ago before the guidance changed. In the new guidance, which is to be adopted if shortages occur, three options are presented for when gowns are not available. One option is for hospitals to reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which are likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. It also asks staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". Earlier, the Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. Dr Rob Harwood, consultants committee chairman at the BMA, said: ""Too many healthcare workers have already died. ""More doctors and their colleagues cannot be expected to put their own lives on the line in a bid to save others, and this new advice means they could be doing just that. It's not a decision they should have to make."" Dr Harwood added: ""It's a real disappointment to us that the government has been unable, even after a month, to address this progressively worsening shortage of PPE.""

Prof Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said surgeons should ""not risk their health"" if fluid repellent gowns or coveralls were not available. He said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the new guidance, which, he said, implied that ""even in the operating theatre"" surgeons and their teams may not require proper PPE.

Coronavirus cases to be tracked by ethnicity,"Sylvia Douglas, 82, was a pastor and died after becoming infected with coronavirus Public Health England is to start recording coronavirus cases and deaths by ethnicity, BBC News understands. It comes after research suggests people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid-19. Downing Street has commissioned an investigation into the issue. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""There does appear to be a disproportionate impact of the virus on BAME communities in the UK."" Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, he added: ""It is for that reason that the Chief Medical Officer commissioned work from Public Health England to better understand this issue. It is right we do thorough research swiftly, so we can better understand it and then take any action that is required."" Coronavirus: Ethnic minorities 'are a third' of patients Are ethnic minorities being hit hardest by coronavirus? Nine in 10 dying with virus have existing illness The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre,externalfound that 34% of more than 4,800 critically-ill patients with Covid-19 identified as black, Asian or minority ethnic. This is despite only 14% of people in England and Wales being from ethnic minority backgrounds, according to the 2011 census. This video can not be played Robert Jenrick: ""There does appear to be a disproportionate impact of the virus upon BAME communities"". Almost three-quarters of the 51 healthcare workers whose deaths have been announced are also from BAME backgrounds, BBC analysis shows. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said it was vital to find out why ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected. ""We must do everything we can now to prevent further deaths,"" he said. ""We may need to risk assess certain groups of NHS workers if they are older or have other medical conditions - they should be shielded and prevented from exposure to the virus."" Dr Nagpaul said there was not enough data on why there was greater illness and deaths being seen in ethnic minorities because it was not routinely collected. He also said death certificates currently don't have information on ethnicity, so it is not possible to see if other factors have played a part. Robert Murray, 56, said his family was concerned about the treatment his aunt had received in hospital and were ""extremely upset"" to be told by staff they were ""not going to do much for her"". Sylvia Douglas, a pastor at Bethel United Church in Slough, was admitted to Wexham Park Hospital by ambulance on 1 April after developing breathing problems following a dry cough. Sylvia and husband Aston Douglas The 82-year-old, who had high blood pressure, tested positive for coronavirus and died the next day after being placed on a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. Mrs Douglas, who was part of the Windrush generation, was described by her family as a ""caring, kind and supportive woman"" who was hugely loved by her community. ""We were all shocked that she died so quickly and thought she would pull through,"" Mr Murray said. ""We would really like some clear answers about what happened in those last hours so we can feel confident that we're not being treated differently in the system."" De-Shaine Murray, 25, from the West Midlands, said he was concerned about ""ridiculous"" suggestions on social media suggesting black people could not contract the disease. The bioengineering PhD student from Imperial College London said the government needed to do more to reach communities who ""historically already have distrust of certain authorities"". An undertaker from London, who asked to be anonymous, told the BBC he usually processed three deaths a week but was now ""preparing three a day"". ""I think the NHS is simply overwhelmed coping with Covid-19 patients and those admitted with more common health concerns,"" he said. ""We've had relatives saying their elderly loved ones went into hospital even with underlying health conditions and passed away after being admitted within days.""

HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Coronavirus: Remembering the NHS workers who have died Coronavirus: Coming 5,000 miles to die for the NHS Dr Riyaz Patel, associate professor of cardiology at University College London, said there were numerous reasons why black and Asian patients could be at greater risk. These include socio-economic factors, such as BAME patients being more likely to live with many different generations in the same household and in densely populated areas, as well as biological factors. ""One thing very visible to us in London intensive care units now is how diabetes, high blood pressure and possibly being a little overweight, seem to be such potent risk factors for having a severe lung illness, perhaps even more so than having an existing lung disease which you would think would be a greater risk,"" Dr Patel said. ""All of these risk factors are more common in Black and Asian patients, so there could be a link here which needs further exploration."" The research on critical care patients with Covid-19 also found: the average of patients was 59.5 years there were nearly three times the number of men as women - 72% male; 27.9% female more than a third were overweight - with a BMI of 25-30 38% were obese - with a BMI of over 30 the younger the patient, the more likely they were to survive How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

Concern over protective kit guidance change,"Concerns have been raised that updated government guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) could put hospital staff and patients at risk. Healthcare workers have been advised to reuse gowns or wear different kit if stocks in England run low. Unions representing doctors and nurses have expressed concerns about the updated Public Health England guidance. It comes as the UK recorded another 888 coronavirus deaths, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 15,464. There have been warnings some hospitals could run out of the gowns used in intensive care units this weekend. The government said it is working to provide the PPE stocks hospitals need. Healthcare staff treating patients with Covid-19 have previously been advised to wear long-sleeved disposable fluid-repellent gowns. But Public Health Englandchanged its guidance on Friday,external, outlining three options if the gowns are not available as ""some compromise is needed to optimise the supply of PPE in times of extreme shortages"". One option is for hospitals to reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which are likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. Are NHS staff getting the protective gear they need? Another is for staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". Front-line workers are particularly at risk. The British Transport Police has announced thata 53-year-old detective has died with coronavirus, leaving behind a wife and child. Greater Manchester Police announced that Marcia Pryce, 61, who worked in the force's intelligence bureau, died after contracting Covid-19. Meanwhile, councils in England havewarned that the coronavirus crisis is pushing them to the brink of financial failure. Elsewhere,Buckingham Palace has confirmedthe Queen will not be marking her 94th birthday next Tuesday with gun salutes this year. There have been warnings that trusts across England will run out of PPE over the weekend. Chris Hopson, chairman of NHS Providers, which represents healthcare trusts across England,said in a tweet,external: ""We have now reached the point where the national stock of fully fluid-repellent gowns and long-sleeved laboratory coats will be exhausted in the next 24 to 48 hours."" He said that national leaders have left ""no stone unturned"" - but the gowns are made in China and those that were ordered weeks ago are currently only arriving in ""fits and starts"". The Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. Dr Rob Harwood, consultants committee chairman at the British Medical Association, said: ""Too many healthcare workers have already died.

Unison, the UK's largest trade union, has warned that staff in ""high risk areas"" might refuse to work if gowns run out. Prof Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said surgeons should ""not risk their health"" if fluid repellent gowns or coveralls were not available. He said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the new guidance, which, he said, implied that ""even in the operating theatre"" surgeons and their teams may not require proper PPE.

The spokesman added the advice is in line with World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control guidance on PPE use in ""exceptional circumstances"". Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing health service trusts, said the situation was ""worrying"" and ""less than satisfactory"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The reality is that there is a chance, and I don't think it's definite, but there is a chance that hospitals could run out or, indeed other parts of the system could run out of the gowns which are required to treat some, not all, Covid patients."" Meanwhile, former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the government needs to ""bring the British people into its confidence"" over how it plans to end the lockdown. ""People have done what they were asked with good humour and common sense,"" he told BBC News, adding that businesses in particular needed clarity. Jonathan Blake, political correspondent In a sign of growing frustration at the lack of detail from the government about how it plans to end the lockdown, Conservative MPs are adding their voices to the calls for clarity. Senior figures on the backbenches have gently suggested that ministers need to do more to explain when and how restrictions on our daily lives may end. The government says any talk of lifting the lockdown would distract from the critical message for people to stay at home in order to slow the spread of the virus. But Tory MPs are joining Labour and others who say people are capable of doing that while being kept informed about the eventual return to something like normality. Downing Street has acknowledged that there is a debate taking place across government departments about how an exit strategy might work, when the time comes. But while ministers insist they are guided by scientific and medical evidence, the political decision to move towards lifting the lockdown may have to wait until the prime minister has recovered and is able to return to work.

Hotel scheme 'will cut rough sleeping after virus',"Kris has been put up in a hotel in west London during the coronavirus outbreak Giving rough sleepers rooms in hotels should lead to a significant long-term reduction in rough sleeping  after the coronavirus outbreak, says a charity for homeless people. Around 2,000 people have been brought in off the streets in England and put into Travelodges and budget hotels. St Mungo's charity says it is an unprecedented opportunity to stop people returning to the street. ""It's a silver lining in a very grey sky,"" said charity CEO Howard Sinclair. ""Out of something awful, something positive has come,"" said Mr Sinclair, whose charity has helped to house rough sleepers in hotels, protecting them and preventing the spread of the coronavirus. He says it unexpectedly created a huge opportunity to assess the needs of people suddenly taken off the streets, allowing charity workers to look for accommodation and provide support for mental health problems or addictions. Big Issue sellers struggle for cash in the lockdown Homeless get places to stay in coronavirus outbreak Safe places needed for homeless in the lockdown Mr Sinclair says this could ""change the landscape"" in terms of reducing the long-term numbers of rough sleepers. He says there are still rough sleepers who have avoided being brought under a roof. But he is confident that this mass-scale intervention will make a ""significant dent"" in how many will return to the streets. Rough sleepers have been brought inside during the coronavirus outbreak The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government says 90% of rough sleepers in England have been invited to come indoors during the coronavirus outbreak. The opportunity followed the collapse in the tourist industry during the lockdown measures, which left many hotels empty. The government and local authorities paid for hotel rooms to house rough sleepers, who could not be left on the streets during the pandemic, either as a risk to themselves or the wider community. Mr Sinclair says the average life expectancy for someone living on the streets is 45 - and that the ill-health of rough sleepers made them highly vulnerable to the coronavirus. The biggest number of people being put up in hotels or other temporary accommodation is in London - but there are also people in Bristol, Brighton, Reading, Oxford and Bournemouth. Charities such as St Mungo's are providing staff in hotels - in which drug use is banned and alcohol discouraged, with the temporary residents getting their own room, meals and laundry. ""I'm grateful, more than anything,"" says Kris, who is staying in a hotel near Paddington, west London. He says it can be lonely being stuck in a hotel room for 23 hours a day for weeks at a time, but he is being well-treated and he hopes it will be ""a great opportunity to get something permanent"". ""What's going round in my mind is the uncertainty of what happens next,"" he says. But for the moment he has the security of being indoors. He usually sells the Big Issue and says he misses his customers and the social life outside, as the magazine has had to stop sales on the streets. Lord Bird, founder of the Big Issue, says putting homeless people into empty hotels has become a chance to get to grips with rough sleeping. ""We believe very strongly it's an opportunity to move people indoors - and that it's something that should become permanent."" He says there is an irony that attitudes towards rough sleepers have ""gone from utter neglect from the authorities to saying you matter because of fear of spreading the virus"". But he warns ""not to expect a happy-ever-after"" outcome - as people living on the streets will have many complex problems from ""decades of neglect"" and might not find it easy to be kept alone indoors. ""The streets have been turned into a theatre of social collapse,"" says Lord Bird, whose magazine is now being sold in supermarkets and online. Dave, who has been homeless for 15 years, has been put up in a flat in Devon. He misses the outdoors and the sounds of sleeping by the sea, but says he has adapted to the indoor life. With a roof over his head, he is thinking of volunteering for the NHS. ""The extra security is nice,"" Dave says, and he thinks it will help homeless people who were at risk from ""undesirables"" who might prey on them. ""A lot of vulnerable people on the streets will be away from that now. It's great. ""It raises a few questions about why they couldn't do it before,"" he says. Nickie Aiken, MP for the Cities of London and Westminster, said there had to be ""plans in place to avoid a cliff edge situation once the lockdown is lifted"". She said funding specialist workers to go into the hotels to help rough sleepers ""kick their drink and drugs habits"" would ""pay for itself"" in the long run. ""We have a golden opportunity to help more people to turn their lives around and seek the support they so desperately need. It would be unforgivable to waste this chance,"" said Ms Aiken. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said there had been a ""massive collaborative effort across government, local authorities, health providers and charities - backed by Â£1.6bn of government funding to help councils respond to coronavirus"". She said the scheme for rough sleepers would ensure ""some of the most vulnerable in society are protected from the pandemic.

Coronavirus cases to be tracked by ethnicityPublic Health England is investigating why ethnic minority groups seem to be disproportionately affected.Health,"Sylvia Douglas, 82, was a pastor and died after becoming infected with coronavirus Public Health England is to start recording coronavirus cases and deaths by ethnicity, BBC News understands. It comes after research suggests people from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds are at greater risk of becoming seriously ill with Covid-19. Downing Street has commissioned an investigation into the issue. Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said: ""There does appear to be a disproportionate impact of the virus on BAME communities in the UK."" Speaking at the daily Downing Street press conference, he added: ""It is for that reason that the Chief Medical Officer commissioned work from Public Health England to better understand this issue. It is right we do thorough research swiftly, so we can better understand it and then take any action that is required."" Coronavirus: Ethnic minorities 'are a third' of patients Are ethnic minorities being hit hardest by coronavirus? Nine in 10 dying with virus have existing illness The Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre,externalfound that 34% of more than 4,800 critically-ill patients with Covid-19 identified as black, Asian or minority ethnic. This is despite only 14% of people in England and Wales being from ethnic minority backgrounds, according to the 2011 census. This video can not be played Robert Jenrick: ""There does appear to be a disproportionate impact of the virus upon BAME communities"". Almost three-quarters of the 51 healthcare workers whose deaths have been announced are also from BAME backgrounds, BBC analysis shows. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, chair of the British Medical Association, said it was vital to find out why ethnic minorities are disproportionately affected. ""We must do everything we can now to prevent further deaths,"" he said. ""We may need to risk assess certain groups of NHS workers if they are older or have other medical conditions - they should be shielded and prevented from exposure to the virus."" Dr Nagpaul said there was not enough data on why there was greater illness and deaths being seen in ethnic minorities because it was not routinely collected. He also said death certificates currently don't have information on ethnicity, so it is not possible to see if other factors have played a part. Robert Murray, 56, said his family was concerned about the treatment his aunt had received in hospital and were ""extremely upset"" to be told by staff they were ""not going to do much for her"". Sylvia Douglas, a pastor at Bethel United Church in Slough, was admitted to Wexham Park Hospital by ambulance on 1 April after developing breathing problems following a dry cough. Sylvia and husband Aston Douglas The 82-year-old, who had high blood pressure, tested positive for coronavirus and died the next day after being placed on a continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) machine. Mrs Douglas, who was part of the Windrush generation, was described by her family as a ""caring, kind and supportive woman"" who was hugely loved by her community. ""We were all shocked that she died so quickly and thought she would pull through,"" Mr Murray said. ""We would really like some clear answers about what happened in those last hours so we can feel confident that we're not being treated differently in the system."" De-Shaine Murray, 25, from the West Midlands, said he was concerned about ""ridiculous"" suggestions on social media suggesting black people could not contract the disease. The bioengineering PhD student from Imperial College London said the government needed to do more to reach communities who ""historically already have distrust of certain authorities"". An undertaker from London, who asked to be anonymous, told the BBC he usually processed three deaths a week but was now ""preparing three a day"". ""I think the NHS is simply overwhelmed coping with Covid-19 patients and those admitted with more common health concerns,"" he said. ""We've had relatives saying their elderly loved ones went into hospital even with underlying health conditions and passed away after being admitted within days.""

HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Coronavirus: Remembering the NHS workers who have died Coronavirus: Coming 5,000 miles to die for the NHS Dr Riyaz Patel, associate professor of cardiology at University College London, said there were numerous reasons why black and Asian patients could be at greater risk. These include socio-economic factors, such as BAME patients being more likely to live with many different generations in the same household and in densely populated areas, as well as biological factors. ""One thing very visible to us in London intensive care units now is how diabetes, high blood pressure and possibly being a little overweight, seem to be such potent risk factors for having a severe lung illness, perhaps even more so than having an existing lung disease which you would think would be a greater risk,"" Dr Patel said. ""All of these risk factors are more common in Black and Asian patients, so there could be a link here which needs further exploration."" The research on critical care patients with Covid-19 also found: the average of patients was 59.5 years there were nearly three times the number of men as women - 72% male; 27.9% female more than a third were overweight - with a BMI of 25-30 38% were obese - with a BMI of over 30 the younger the patient, the more likely they were to survive How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

Lockdown sees home electricity use surge during workday,"Home energy use is up by up to 30% during the middle of the day, new analysis by energy firms reveals. Much of the population is working from home and schools have closed, meaning home computers and televisions are busier than ever. The highest peak is at lunchtime, when cooking is added to the power consumption of working from home. But overall, the country is actually using less energy because of businesses being closed. The National Grid reports that morning and afternoon electricity demand is down by nearly 20%. But most of that is due to lower demand from large, industrial users like factories. At home, where individuals are paying, overall demand is up - and may reveal some details about our new habits. Many people are no longer commuting to the office - giving them longer to stay in bed before getting ready for work. Energy providers can see that, in a ""delay"" to early electricity demand. ""Households are consuming 21% less electricity than usual at 07:30, as fewer people commute to work, and are taking back the time to sleep later instead,"" a spokeswoman for Bulb Energy said, based on data from more than 2,000 smart meters. Ovo Energy is seeing similar results from a sample of 230,000 customers. ""Morning routines are less structured and therefore the peak has reduced by up to 20%, as many people are working from home or not working at all,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We are seeing big changes in the way people consume energy during the lockdown period."" Energy bills to fall for millions of households Energy bill help for vulnerable amid outbreak Any energy being saved in the morning is being consumed later. Ovo reports seeing up to a 30% increase in the midday period, and Bulb reports a 27% rise. EDF did not provide figures, but said it was seeing notably higher consumption in the middle of the day. Bulb also says it is seeing a 7% drop in energy use between 21:00 and 23:00, ""suggesting people are switching off earlier too"". Despite the midday surge, overall domestic demand has increased by only a few percentage points, rather than dramatically surging - partly due to weekend use remaining mostly the same. This video can not be played The surprising truth about UK energy use Ovo says that ""balancing out the ups and downs"", it is only seeing a 6% overall increase in domestic consumption. EDF says it is only seeing a 3% rise. Bulb said overall use across the week is flat. But it also calculated its weekday usage separately - and said use is up by 17% between 09:00 and 17:00 Monday-Friday. At the weekend, electricity use is actually down 3% - which it attributes to the warmer weather. Gas use, too, is not showing any clear surge in demand, since many people use it for central heating, and the lockdown coincided with warmer weather. Despite those small overall numbers, energy bills may rise for some more than others. Professionals who use power-hungry computing equipment, or shared households with many people, could see their bills increase. In March,the government agreed a deal with energy providers,externalto support those who may have difficulty paying their bills during the crisis, which has left many people out of work. ""With millions of people having to stay at home, our energy bills will likely rise as we use more gas and electricity,"" says Guy Anker, deputy editor of financial site MoneySavingExpert.com. ""So with money tight for so many, it makes it even more imperative to cut back on usage where you can, and also to cut back on your bills by ditching rip-off tariffs."" Switching from a standard tariff could save people up to Â£350 a year, he says - and using one of the many available price comparison sites should only take five minutes. ""Your supply isn't cut off as part of the process, while no one visits your home unless you want or need smart meters - though installations are paused for now, so it's not an issue during the lockdown.""

The document - entitled ""what constitutes a reasonable excuse to leave the place where you live"" - was issued by the National Police Chiefs' Council and the College of Policing, On exercise, it states driving to the countryside for a walk is ""reasonable"" if ""far more time"" is spent walking than driving. If you don't need to travel in your car to go for a walk, because you can walk from your house, then actually don't do that.. There is opportunity for the majority of our communities in the county to go from their home address or very close to their home address without the need to travel half an hour to the coast"". Jason Harwin, Deputy Chief Constable of Lincolnshire Police Public Health England is keen to reiterate its message that staying in will reduce the risk of spreading coronavirus - even if it doesn't feel that way.

An extra Â£1.6bn has been given to local authorities since the outbreak began. A spokesman from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said Mr Jenrick had ""been clear that [they] will support councils to provide services to their communities during the pandemic"". Councils face increased costs from supporting vulnerable people, while their income from fees and rates is falling. English councils 'on brink of financial failure' Social care concerns revealed in letter 'London-only lockdown' was considered by government Mr Watts - the LGA's resource chairman - began his letter by thanking the minister for his ""hard work on behalf of local government"", and said measures, including the Â£1.6bn funding and deferral of business rates payments, were ""helpful in providing some stability and certainty"". But he said the cash was an ""insufficient sum"" and members of the LGA had heard from the department that ""further funding may not be forthcoming despite previous promises"". He wrote: ""This is having a real impact on councils' confidence that they will be given the financial means to see this challenge through and could cause some to take extreme cost-cutting and rationing measures.""

"Concern over protective kit guidance changeThe warning that hospital staff could be put at risk comes as the number of UK deaths surpasses 15,000.","Concerns have been raised that updated government guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) could put hospital staff and patients at risk. Healthcare workers have been advised to reuse gowns or wear different kit if stocks in England run low. Unions representing doctors and nurses have expressed concerns about the updated Public Health England guidance. It comes as the UK recorded another 888 coronavirus deaths, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 15,464. There have been warnings some hospitals could run out of the gowns used in intensive care units this weekend. The government said it is working to provide the PPE stocks hospitals need. Healthcare staff treating patients with Covid-19 have previously been advised to wear long-sleeved disposable fluid-repellent gowns. But Public Health Englandchanged its guidance on Friday,external, outlining three options if the gowns are not available as ""some compromise is needed to optimise the supply of PPE in times of extreme shortages"". One option is for hospitals to reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which are likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. Are NHS staff getting the protective gear they need? Another is for staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". Front-line workers are particularly at risk. The British Transport Police has announced thata 53-year-old detective has died with coronavirus, leaving behind a wife and child. Greater Manchester Police announced that Marcia Pryce, 61, who worked in the force's intelligence bureau, died after contracting Covid-19. Meanwhile, councils in England havewarned that the coronavirus crisis is pushing them to the brink of financial failure. Elsewhere,Buckingham Palace has confirmedthe Queen will not be marking her 94th birthday next Tuesday with gun salutes this year. There have been warnings that trusts across England will run out of PPE over the weekend. Chris Hopson, chairman of NHS Providers, which represents healthcare trusts across England,said in a tweet,external: ""We have now reached the point where the national stock of fully fluid-repellent gowns and long-sleeved laboratory coats will be exhausted in the next 24 to 48 hours."" He said that national leaders have left ""no stone unturned"" - but the gowns are made in China and those that were ordered weeks ago are currently only arriving in ""fits and starts"". The Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. Dr Rob Harwood, consultants committee chairman at the British Medical Association, said: ""Too many healthcare workers have already died. ""More doctors and their colleagues cannot be expected to put their own lives on the line in a bid to save others, and this new advice means they could be doing just that. It's not a decision they should have to make."" Dr Harwood added: ""It's a real disappointment to us that the government has been unable, even after a month, to address this progressively worsening shortage of PPE."" Unison, the UK's largest trade union, has warned that staff in ""high risk areas"" might refuse to work if gowns run out. Prof Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said surgeons should ""not risk their health"" if fluid repellent gowns or coveralls were not available. He said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the new guidance, which, he said, implied that ""even in the operating theatre"" surgeons and their teams may not require proper PPE. This video can not be played Staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital show how health care workers put on PPE A Department of Health spokesman said: ""New clinical advice has been issued today to make sure that if there are shortages in one area, front-line staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk."" The spokesman added the advice is in line with World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control guidance on PPE use in ""exceptional circumstances"". Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing health service trusts, said the situation was ""worrying"" and ""less than satisfactory"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The reality is that there is a chance, and I don't think it's definite, but there is a chance that hospitals could run out or, indeed other parts of the system could run out of the gowns which are required to treat some, not all, Covid patients."" Meanwhile, former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the government needs to ""bring the British people into its confidence"" over how it plans to end the lockdown. ""People have done what they were asked with good humour and common sense,"" he told BBC News, adding that businesses in particular needed clarity. Jonathan Blake, political correspondent In a sign of growing frustration at the lack of detail from the government about how it plans to end the lockdown, Conservative MPs are adding their voices to the calls for clarity. Senior figures on the backbenches have gently suggested that ministers need to do more to explain when and how restrictions on our daily lives may end. The government says any talk of lifting the lockdown would distract from the critical message for people to stay at home in order to slow the spread of the virus. But Tory MPs are joining Labour and others who say people are capable of doing that while being kept informed about the eventual return to something like normality. Downing Street has acknowledged that there is a debate taking place across government departments about how an exit strategy might work, when the time comes. But while ministers insist they are guided by scientific and medical evidence, the political decision to move towards lifting the lockdown may have to wait until the prime minister has recovered and is able to return to work.

Electricity use up during day as nation works from home,"Home energy use is up by up to 30% during the middle of the day, new analysis by energy firms reveals. Much of the population is working from home and schools have closed, meaning home computers and televisions are busier than ever. The highest peak is at lunchtime, when cooking is added to the power consumption of working from home. But overall, the country is actually using less energy because of businesses being closed. The National Grid reports that morning and afternoon electricity demand is down by nearly 20%. But most of that is due to lower demand from large, industrial users like factories. At home, where individuals are paying, overall demand is up - and may reveal some details about our new habits. Many people are no longer commuting to the office - giving them longer to stay in bed before getting ready for work. Energy providers can see that, in a ""delay"" to early electricity demand. ""Households are consuming 21% less electricity than usual at 07:30, as fewer people commute to work, and are taking back the time to sleep later instead,"" a spokeswoman for Bulb Energy said, based on data from more than 2,000 smart meters. Ovo Energy is seeing similar results from a sample of 230,000 customers. ""Morning routines are less structured and therefore the peak has reduced by up to 20%, as many people are working from home or not working at all,"" a spokeswoman said. ""We are seeing big changes in the way people consume energy during the lockdown period."" Energy bills to fall for millions of households Energy bill help for vulnerable amid outbreak Any energy being saved in the morning is being consumed later. Ovo reports seeing up to a 30% increase in the midday period, and Bulb reports a 27% rise. EDF did not provide figures, but said it was seeing notably higher consumption in the middle of the day. Bulb also says it is seeing a 7% drop in energy use between 21:00 and 23:00, ""suggesting people are switching off earlier too"". Despite the midday surge, overall domestic demand has increased by only a few percentage points, rather than dramatically surging - partly due to weekend use remaining mostly the same. This video can not be played The surprising truth about UK energy use Ovo says that ""balancing out the ups and downs"", it is only seeing a 6% overall increase in domestic consumption. EDF says it is only seeing a 3% rise. Bulb said overall use across the week is flat. But it also calculated its weekday usage separately - and said use is up by 17% between 09:00 and 17:00 Monday-Friday. At the weekend, electricity use is actually down 3% - which it attributes to the warmer weather. Gas use, too, is not showing any clear surge in demand, since many people use it for central heating, and the lockdown coincided with warmer weather. Despite those small overall numbers, energy bills may rise for some more than others. Professionals who use power-hungry computing equipment, or shared households with many people, could see their bills increase. In March,the government agreed a deal with energy providers,externalto support those who may have difficulty paying their bills during the crisis, which has left many people out of work. ""With millions of people having to stay at home, our energy bills will likely rise as we use more gas and electricity,"" says Guy Anker, deputy editor of financial site MoneySavingExpert.com. ""So with money tight for so many, it makes it even more imperative to cut back on usage where you can, and also to cut back on your bills by ditching rip-off tariffs."" Switching from a standard tariff could save people up to Â£350 a year, he says - and using one of the many available price comparison sites should only take five minutes. ""Your supply isn't cut off as part of the process, while no one visits your home unless you want or need smart meters - though installations are paused for now, so it's not an issue during the lockdown.""

Virus could prompt 'extreme' council cuts,"Local councils in England are ""extremely concerned"" they will not get more funding to tackle coronavirus. The Local Government Association's Richard Watts has written to Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick warning of ""extreme cost-cutting"". In his letter, obtained by the BBC, Mr Watts appeals for a guarantee the government is ""still willing to do whatever it takes"" to help them. An extra Â£1.6bn has been given to local authorities since the outbreak began. A spokesman from the Ministry for Housing, Communities and Local Government said Mr Jenrick had ""been clear that [they] will support councils to provide services to their communities during the pandemic"". Councils face increased costs from supporting vulnerable people, while their income from fees and rates is falling. English councils 'on brink of financial failure' Social care concerns revealed in letter 'London-only lockdown' was considered by government Mr Watts - the LGA's resource chairman - began his letter by thanking the minister for his ""hard work on behalf of local government"", and said measures, including the Â£1.6bn funding and deferral of business rates payments, were ""helpful in providing some stability and certainty"". But he said the cash was an ""insufficient sum"" and members of the LGA had heard from the department that ""further funding may not be forthcoming despite previous promises"". He wrote: ""This is having a real impact on councils' confidence that they will be given the financial means to see this challenge through and could cause some to take extreme cost-cutting and rationing measures."" Mr Watts said he had seen evidence some social care authorities had already committed up to three times more spending than the grant allocation allows because they expected extra funding, and the cash put forward already was ""vanishingly small"" compared to what they are needing to spend on increased homelessness. He also claimed finance directors from the councils have been holding off issuing reports that show they are ""spending beyond [their] means"" because of promises of extra funding. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Mr Watts said there were pressures that would go beyond the coronavirus outbreak too, such as an increased demand in social care and council tax support. He said the ""income base is collapsing"" for councils, with leisure centres shut, public transport cut and parking fees not coming in, as well as lower business rates being collected. ""This loss of income represents a real reduction in the resources available to councils to fund services and will mean that, in the absence of any compensation, the balanced budgets set by councils will not be deliverable,"" wrote Mr Watts. He said the ""point of focus"" for the government should be ensuring local authorities have ""confidence that the government will support them"". Mr Watts concluded his letter, saying: ""We would like urge you and the Chancellor of the Exchequer to set out in a clear joint letter of intent that the government is still willing to do whatever it takes and provide further funding to councils up front."" And he called for a ""commitment to compensate [councils] fully for costs, net loss of income and savings that cannot be delivered as result of this crisis, so that they can continue to focus on delivering the response to the greatest challenge the UK and the world have seen in decades, as opposed to worrying about whether they need to start rationing because no further support might be forthcoming"". The government has previously said it would keep funding for local councils under review.

He backed the government's approach to the outbreak so far, but said businesses and traders needed more information about how and when they can begin operating again. ""The government must absolutely plan how to bring economy out of this lockdown and secondly bring the British people into its confidence,"" Sir Iain told the BBC.

Greenâs retail empire could close over 100 stores,"Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group is serving notice on landlords to walk away from more than 100 stores by the end of the summer. The fashion group owns brands such as Topshop and Dorothy Perkins and has 550 stores across the UK, but all are shut due to coronavirus restrictions. Arcadia was struggling before the pandemic. In 2019 it did a deal to survive with landlords to cut rents and close 23 stores - and 12 more closed this year. Like other retailers grappling with the fallout from deserted high streets and a collapse in sales, Sir Philip's retail empire has been thrown into turmoil. Sir Philip Green's retail empire, Arcadia, had earlier this year closed some sites after tough Christmas trading Most of his 16,000 staff are being paid through the government's furlough scheme and bosses are taking a pay cut. But the coronavirus crisis is now accelerating a potentially dramatic shrinkage of the business. Arcadia has already been closing stores over the years as leases expired. Last June's rescue deal, known as a company voluntary arrangement, also included many break clauses on leases which allow Arcadia to hand back the keys at relatively short notice. A number of other leases are also coming up for renewal. The BBC understands that Arcadia has typically given three months' notice on at least 100 leases, and potentially it could be significantly higher than that. However, it does not mean all the affected stores will shut. New agreements could be reached with some property owners who would have to swallow further rent reductions. Other retailers are also reviewing store portfolios. Debenhams said on Friday that seven of its stores would not reopen. It is trying to secure new deals with landlords that include a five-month rent and service charge holiday. The department store chain has agreed terms on 120 of its 142 stores so far and is in advanced discussions about the remainder of its estate. The business is in administration to protect it from creditors during the lockdown. Arcadia's move buys the business flexibility amid huge uncertainty about the economic landscape ahead. High street retailers are all trying to hoard cash and slash costs and are worried about trading once restrictions are eased. ""I'm not blaming him [Sir Philip]. You've got to do what you've got to do to protect the business,"" said one landlord. Arcadia declined to comment.

Lockdown sees seasonal workers stranded on islands,"About 2,500 people live on Scilly, with the majority of businesses reliant on the tourism sector Some seasonal workers on the Isles of Scilly have been left stranded without income due to the coronavirus lockdown. The islands, 28 miles off Cornwall, shut down transport links on 21 March, after the workers had arrived. Staff can only receive 80% of their pay through furlough if they were registered for tax before 19 March. The tourism board for Scilly said the outbreak had come at ""the worst possible time, coinciding exactly with the start of the tourist season"". ""The impact is completely extraordinary and catastrophic - nothing happens here without the tourism industry,"" said Nick Bond, executive director of the Islands Partnership. The vast majority of income has traditionally been generated between March and October, when the weather would be better, but also when the transport links to the mainland UK would usually be fully operational. The Partnership had projected 70,000 visitors would spend Â£34m on Scilly during 2020 and said tourism accounted for 85% of the economy. ""The great difficulty for small and medium sized businesses is not knowing when we might be back to normal again,"" Mr Bond said. ""We are talking to members and businesses about how government measures don't meet the needs of the tourism and visitor economy. Seasonal staff who arrived after the date that the government scheme applies to - the staff members are stranded."" Scillonians have been showing their support for key workers Seasonal workers fill many of the hospitality and retail roles on Scilly between these months each year. Marley Morgan from Penzance in Cornwall arrived on 15 March to start work as a chef at a hotel on St Mary's and said he felt ""helpless"". ""It is a beautiful place and a great escape, but the reason we are all here is that it's a great opportunity to make money,"" he said. His hotel is allowing the nine staff who have arrived from Cornwall, Yorkshire, Hungary and Latvia to stay in their accommodation without charge, for now. ""We are hoping we may reopen in late June,"" Mr Morgan said. The government pushed the date back for furloughed workers to 19 March but this would only help people who had been registered for tax purposes by this date. Many seasonal workers, including Mr Morgan would not qualify. Marley Morgan arrived on Scilly as a seasonal worker but has been left with no income He said workers were looking out for each other and scraping by, but said: ""Morale is pretty low. It's rough at the moment."" Mr Morgan said his previous employer was currently unable to help him and it would take five weeks to receive any universal credit. Having given up his tenancy and full time job before moving to Scilly he said he was reluctant to return home and put himself at risk through travelling. ""This was a really good opportunity for me work-wise as well as financially so I'd beat myself up if things were to go back to normal and I missed out,"" he said. Arriving on 13 March was Adrian Pinnell, who was hoping to do his 16th straight season and his 11th as restaurant manager at another hotel. After initial confusion that saw him and his wife Sit told to move out of the hotel for insurance purposes, a compromise has been reached. Adrian Pinnell has worked the season in Scilly for many years ""They have asked me to do 10 hours' work a week in a caretaker role. They pay me Â£100, and Â£50 of that goes back to them in rent,"" he said. The Pinnells split their year between Thailand and Scilly, have no home in the UK and are also not eligible for the furlough scheme. ""We may have to go to my mum in Cheltenham but we aren't sure if that classes as essential travel,"" Mr Pinnell said. The Duchy of Cornwall owns the majority of the land and has offered tenants an interest-free deferral for rent payments as ""there is likely to be a significant financial hardship due to the local economy's reliance on tourism"". The Prince of Wales has also ""sent his own personal message of support"". All flights and passenger ferry services to the islands have been suspended, other than for key workers and essential travel. A consortium including the local MP has written to the government to ask for ""support for the islands' strategic transport infrastructure at this unprecedented time"". The Council of the Isles of Scilly has employed two Royal Navy military planners to help coordinate its response, having declared a major incident. The Isles of Scilly Council said it would consider each case individually regarding essential travel. Nick Bond said: ""Businesses have brought staff over after the deadline and those individuals are rather stranded. Their employer, or the organisation that was to be their employer, has a moral obligation to look after them. ""There's an awful lot of planning in terms of bringing those teams on board and getting them over to Scilly to get up and running. Not knowing when we will be back in business makes that whole process problematic."" Mr Bond said some businesses would fold but added ""we have got to be optimistic that there will be recourse to funds through different channels"". ""People's safety is first and foremost, and then ensuring businesses remain in business,"" he said. ""Looking forward we have a great tourism offer here and the industry will bounce back.""

Concerns over reuse of protective medical kit,"Concerns have been raised that updated government guidance on personal protective equipment (PPE) could put hospital staff and patients at risk. Healthcare workers have been advised to reuse gowns or wear different kit if stocks in England run low. Unions representing doctors and nurses have expressed concerns about the updated Public Health England guidance. It comes as the UK recorded another 888 coronavirus deaths, taking the total number of hospital deaths to 15,464. There have been warnings some hospitals could run out of the gowns used in intensive care units this weekend. The government said it is working to provide the PPE stocks hospitals need. Healthcare staff treating patients with Covid-19 have previously been advised to wear long-sleeved disposable fluid-repellent gowns. But Public Health Englandchanged its guidance on Friday,external, outlining three options if the gowns are not available as ""some compromise is needed to optimise the supply of PPE in times of extreme shortages"". One option is for hospitals to reserve the gowns for surgical operations and procedures which are likely to transmit respiratory pathogens. Are NHS staff getting the protective gear they need? Another is for staff to reuse ""(washable) surgical gowns or coveralls or similar suitable clothing (for example, long-sleeved laboratory coat, long-sleeved patient gown or industrial coverall) with a disposable plastic apron for AGPs (aerosol-generating procedures) and high-risk settings with forearm washing once gown or coverall is removed"". Front-line workers are particularly at risk. The British Transport Police has announced thata 53-year-old detective has died with coronavirus, leaving behind a wife and child. Greater Manchester Police announced that Marcia Pryce, 61, who worked in the force's intelligence bureau, died after contracting Covid-19. Meanwhile, councils in England havewarned that the coronavirus crisis is pushing them to the brink of financial failure. Elsewhere,Buckingham Palace has confirmedthe Queen will not be marking her 94th birthday next Tuesday with gun salutes this year. There have been warnings that trusts across England will run out of PPE over the weekend. Chris Hopson, chairman of NHS Providers, which represents healthcare trusts across England,said in a tweet,external: ""We have now reached the point where the national stock of fully fluid-repellent gowns and long-sleeved laboratory coats will be exhausted in the next 24 to 48 hours."" He said that national leaders have left ""no stone unturned"" - but the gowns are made in China and those that were ordered weeks ago are currently only arriving in ""fits and starts"". The Royal College of Nursing said the guidance was developed without a full consultation and the British Medical Association (BMA) - which represents doctors - said any change must be driven by science, not availability. Dr Rob Harwood, consultants committee chairman at the British Medical Association, said: ""Too many healthcare workers have already died. ""More doctors and their colleagues cannot be expected to put their own lives on the line in a bid to save others, and this new advice means they could be doing just that. It's not a decision they should have to make."" Dr Harwood added: ""It's a real disappointment to us that the government has been unable, even after a month, to address this progressively worsening shortage of PPE."" Unison, the UK's largest trade union, has warned that staff in ""high risk areas"" might refuse to work if gowns run out. Prof Neil Mortensen, from the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said surgeons should ""not risk their health"" if fluid repellent gowns or coveralls were not available. He said he was ""deeply disturbed"" by the new guidance, which, he said, implied that ""even in the operating theatre"" surgeons and their teams may not require proper PPE. This video can not be played Staff at Addenbrooke's Hospital show how health care workers put on PPE A Department of Health spokesman said: ""New clinical advice has been issued today to make sure that if there are shortages in one area, front-line staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk."" The spokesman added the advice is in line with World Health Organization and Centers for Disease Control guidance on PPE use in ""exceptional circumstances"". Niall Dickson, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, representing health service trusts, said the situation was ""worrying"" and ""less than satisfactory"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The reality is that there is a chance, and I don't think it's definite, but there is a chance that hospitals could run out or, indeed other parts of the system could run out of the gowns which are required to treat some, not all, Covid patients."" Meanwhile, former Conservative leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith said the government needs to ""bring the British people into its confidence"" over how it plans to end the lockdown. ""People have done what they were asked with good humour and common sense,"" he told BBC News, adding that businesses in particular needed clarity. Jonathan Blake, political correspondent In a sign of growing frustration at the lack of detail from the government about how it plans to end the lockdown, Conservative MPs are adding their voices to the calls for clarity. Senior figures on the backbenches have gently suggested that ministers need to do more to explain when and how restrictions on our daily lives may end. The government says any talk of lifting the lockdown would distract from the critical message for people to stay at home in order to slow the spread of the virus. But Tory MPs are joining Labour and others who say people are capable of doing that while being kept informed about the eventual return to something like normality. Downing Street has acknowledged that there is a debate taking place across government departments about how an exit strategy might work, when the time comes. But while ministers insist they are guided by scientific and medical evidence, the political decision to move towards lifting the lockdown may have to wait until the prime minister has recovered and is able to return to work.

How California kept ahead of the curve,"California has stayed ahead of the curve After a resident of California died of coronavirus on 4 March, Governor Gavin Newsom declared a state of emergency. It was the first Covid-19 related death in the US outside of Washington state. More than 24,424 people have tested positive for coronavirus in California and 821 people have died. Yet the losses, while tragic, are a fraction of what experts predicted the state's 40 million people would face. The virus is spreading fast in southern California and the state's Central Valley - so it's not out of trouble yet. But considering the dire prediction made by Governor Gavin Newsom in March that up to 25 million Californians could be infected with coronavirus, the situation in California has been surprisingly well controlled. State officials maintain they think the virus will peak in mid-May. Others think California could reach its peak this week. The University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation projected in March that more than 6,000 people in California would die of coronavirus. This week, the institute revised their forecast - projecting that California will reach its peak on 17 April - with 1,783 deaths. California has only tested 212,900 people - and not all of the tests have been processed - so the number of confirmed cases will likely be considerably higher. But the death rate is much lower than many expected. So why is California faring so much better than many predicted? California was the first place in the United States to issue shelter in place orders. Gov Newsom ordered California to shelter in place on 19 March - three days before New York. The statewide order followed similar ones issued on 16 March by several Bay Area counties and cities - including San Francisco. Residents were urged to stay home and only go to essential businesses, like grocery stores and pharmacies, when necessary. But can a day or two really make that much difference? ""Oh yes,"" said Dr Neha Nanda, the medical director of infection prevention and antimicrobial stewardship at Keck Medicine, University of Southern California. ""Even being one day ahead can have a huge impact,"" she told the BBC. ""The morbidity we will be able to avert, the mortality we will be able to avert - it's huge."" Because so little is known about the virus or how it can be treated, it makes prevention ""more important than anything else,"" she said. ""The most potent tool that you have in tool kit is social distancing."" On 9 March, Santa Clara county banned gatherings of more than 1,000 people. The ban came hours after a woman died in Santa Clara county. Soon, the limits on gatherings of 1,000 people became limits on groups of 50 people. Many were shocked at the time about what limited gatherings would do to sports teams and musical and theatrical events. But this didn't deter local officials - and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and Oakland Mayor Libby Schaaf announced bans on gatherings several days later. ""Our first priority remains the health, safety and wellbeing of all Oaklanders, as well as those who visit our city,"" Mayor Schaaf said at the time. ""Although there are no known positive cases of Covid-19 within Oakland right now, postponing large gatherings will help prevent the spread of the virus. We take these measures to prepare and protect our community and ground our decisions in facts, not fear."" This video can not be played US death rates v China, Italy and South Korea At the time it was inconceivable that e-sports would replace live sports and concerts would be staged on living room couches and filmed on phones. ""We've been proactive,"" Dr Nanda said, and a result ""we have not seen that huge uptick"". Unlike densely packed New York where most people rely on public transportation, California is known for its urban sprawl and its love affair with the car. New York City is three times as dense as the city of Los Angeles. And although Los Angeles County has more than 10 million people, many more Angelenos drive cars than New Yorkers. According to a UCLA study from 2018, fewer than 3% of people in Southern California ride public transport frequently. The US governor who saw it coming early Trump feuds with governors over Covid authority UCLA epidemiologist Dr Timothy Brewer said our urban sprawl may be helping stop the virus from spreading faster than in cities like New York or Detroit. ""We certainly don't have the population density of New York City,"" Dr Brewer said. ""The less dense the population, the more easy it is to maintain physical distances from each other."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health But Dr Brewer said he thinks it was California's aggressive social distancing policies put in place early that account for most of the state's success so far. California could well have had more cases ""had they followed a similar trajectory as New York, New Jersey or some other locations in the United States"" when it came to social distancing, he added. The state initially got off to a bumpy start when it came to public spaces. The weekend of 15 March sent many Californians panic shopping for seemingly all the toilet paper, yeast and sourdough bread flour in the state, and the following weekend saw Californians flocking to the state's beautiful beaches and hiking trails. Beaches were packed. Popular trails like Runyon Canyon in LA were more crowded than ever making social distancing impossible. Eventually, officials closed beaches and hiking trails throughout the state and urged people to walk in their own neighbourhoods. Authorities have closed piers and beaches Sometimes the authorities enforce the rules - though not consistently. California was ridiculed on Fox News after video emerged of multiple boats involved in the arrest of a lone paddle-boarder in Malibu who defied lifeguard warnings to leave the water. Wet weather in Los Angeles meant snow in the local mountains and two snowboarders were caught sneaking onto the slopes. Officials across the state say they'd rather not enforce the rules - but they will crack down on scofflaws. Some tickets have been issued across the state. In San Diego, homeless advocates have objected to the ticketing and arrest of homeless people for sleeping in the streets. And in Los Angeles, Mayor Garcetti encouraged people to ""snitch"" on anyone violating the shelter-in-place order, or operating businesses not considered essential. ""You know the old expression about snitches, well in this case snitches get rewards,"" Mayor Garcetti said earlier this month. ""We want to thank you for turning folks in and making sure we are all safe."" Many people criticised the mayor's snitch policy, and it's not clear how many people have reported infractions. But California's leaders have mostly been applauded for acting early to control the virus.

The untold story behind America's biggest outbreak,"How did the biggest cluster in the US emerge in a corner of South Dakota? Infections spread like wildfire through a pork factory and questions remain about what the company did to protect staff. On the afternoon of 25 March, Julia sat down at her laptop and logged into a phony Facebook account. She'd opened it in middle school, to surreptitiously monitor boys she had crushes on. But now, many years later, it was about to serve a much more serious purpose. ""Can you please look into Smithfield,"" she typed in a message to an account called Argus911, the Facebook-based tip line for the local newspaper, the Argus Leader. ""They do have a positive [Covid-19] case and are planning to stay open."" By ""Smithfield"", she was referring to the Smithfield Foods pork-processing plant located in her town of Sioux Falls, South Dakota. The factory - a massive, eight-story white box perched on the banks of the Big Sioux River - is the ninth-largest hog-processing facility in the US. When running at full capacity, it processes 19,500 freshly-slaughtered hogs per day, slicing, grinding and smoking them into millions of pounds of bacon, hot dogs and spiral-cut hams. With 3,700 workers, it is also the fourth-largest employer in the city. ""Thank you for the tip,"" the Argus911 account responded. ""What job did the worker who tested positive have?"" ""We are not exactly sure,"" Julia wrote back. ""OK, thanks,"" Argus911 replied. ""We'll be in touch."" The next day, at 7:35am, the Argus Leaderpublished the story on its website,external: ""Smithfield Foods employee tests positive for coronavirus"". The reporter confirmed through a company spokeswoman that, indeed, an employee had tested positive, was in a 14-day quarantine, and that his or her work area and other common spaces had been ""thoroughly sanitised"". But the plant, deemed part of a ""critical infrastructure industry"" by the Trump administration, would remain fully operational. ""Food is an essential part of all our lives, and our more than 40,000 US team members, thousands of American family farmers and our many other supply chain partners are a crucial part of our nation's response to Covid-19,"" Smithfield CEO Kenneth Sullivan said in an online video statement released 19 March to explain the decision to keep factories open. ""We are taking the utmost precautions to ensure the health and well-being of our employees and consumers."" But Julia was alarmed. ""There had been rumours there were cases even before that,"" she recalled. ""I heard about people getting hospitalised from Smithfield specifically. They only know from word of mouth."" Julia does not work at the factory. She is a graduate student in her 20s, stuck back at home after her university shut in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Her parents, two long-time Smithfield employees with whom she is especially close, told her what was happening at the factory that day. She is just one of several adult children of factory workers - many the first-generation children of immigrants, some calling themselves Children of Smithfield - who have taken it upon themselves to speak out about the outbreak. ""My parents don't know English. They can't advocate for themselves,"" said Julia. ""Someone has to talk for them."" Why US could be more at risk from coronavirus Why are African Americans hit so hard by virus? Her family, like many others in Sioux Falls, did everything they could to avoid falling ill. Julia's parents used up all their remaining vacation time to stay home. After work, they took off their shoes outside and headed straight into the shower. Julia bought them cloth headbands at Walmart to pull over their mouths and noses while on the line. For Julia, alerting the media was just the next logical step in trying to keep them all healthy, by creating public pressure to close the plant down and keep her parents home. Instead, it marked the beginning of nearly three anxiety-filled weeks during which her mother and father continued to report to a factory they knew could be contaminated, to jobs they could not afford to lose. They stood side-by-side less than a foot away from their colleagues on production lines, they passed in and out of crowded locker rooms, walkways and cafeterias. During that time, the number of confirmed cases among Smithfield employees slowly mounted, from 80 to 190 to 238. By 15 April, when Smithfield finally closed under pressure from the South Dakota governor's office, the plant had become the number one hotspot in the US, with a cluster of 644 confirmed cases among Smithfield employees and people who contracted it from them. In total, Smithfield-related infections account for 55% of the caseload in the state, which is far outpacing its far more populous Midwestern neighbour states in cases per capita. According to the New York Times, the Smithfield Foods case numbers have surpassed the USS Theodore Roosevelt naval ship and the Cook County Jail in Chicago, Illinois. Those figures were released one day after the first Smithfield employee died in hospital. ""He got that virus there. He was very healthy before,"" his wife, Angelita, told the BBC in Spanish. ""My husband will not be the only one to die."" The Smithfield pork plant, located in a Republican-led state that is one of five in the US that has not issued any kind of shelter-in-place order, has become a microcosm illustrating the socioeconomic disparities laid bare by the global pandemic. While many white-collar workers around the country are sheltering in place and working from home, food industry workers like the employees at Smithfield are deemed ""essential"" and must remain on the front lines. ""These jobs for essential workers are lower paying than the average job across America, in some cases by significant margins. So home health aides, cashiers - absolutely essential, on the front lines, have to physically report to work,"" said Adie Tomer, a fellow at the Brookings Institute. ""They are more predominantly African American or Hispanic than the overall working populations."" The workforce at Smithfield is made up largely of immigrants and refugees from places like Myanmar, Ethiopia, Nepal, Congo and El Salvador. There are 80 different languages spoken in the plant. Estimates of the mean hourly wage range from $14-16 an hour. Those hours are long, the work is gruelling, and standing on a production line often means being less than a foot away from your co-workers on either side. The BBC spoke to half a dozen current and former Smithfield employees who say that while they were afraid to continue going to work, deciding between employment and their health has been an impossible choice. ""I have a lot of bills. My baby's coming soon - I have to work,"" said one 25-year-old employee whose wife is eight months pregnant. ""If I get a positive, I'm really worried I can't save my wife."" Food processing plants throughout the country are experiencing coronavirus outbreaks which have the potential to disrupt the country's food supply chain. A JBS meatpacking plant in Colorado has shut after five deaths and 103 infections among its employees. Two workers at a Tyson Foods plant in Iowa also died, while 148 others were sickened. The closure of a large meat processing facility like the one in Sioux Falls causes massive upstream disruption, stranding farmers without a place to sell their livestock. About 550 independent farms send their pigs to the Sioux Falls plant. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health When announcing the shutdown, Smithfield CEO Sullivan warned of ""severe, perhaps disastrous, repercussions"" for the supply of meat. But according to Smithfield employees, their union representatives, and advocates for the immigrant community in Sioux Falls, the outbreak that led to the plant closure was avoidable. They allege early requests for personal protective equipment were ignored, that sick workers were incentivised to continue working, and that information regarding the spread of the virus was kept from them, even when they were at risk of exposing family and the broader public. ""If the federal government wants the company to stay open, then whose responsibility is it to make sure these companies are doing what they have to do to keep them safe?"" said Nancy Reynoza, founder of Que Pasa Sioux Falls, a Spanish-language news source who said she's been hearing from distraught Smithfield workers for weeks. The BBC submitted a detailed list of questions and worker allegations to Smithfield, and they did not comment on the allegations put to them on individual cases. ""First and foremost, the health and safety of our employees and communities is our top priority each and every day,"" the statement said. ""Beginning in February, we instituted a series of stringent and detailed processes and protocols in early March that follow the strict guidance of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to effectively manage any potential Covid-19 cases in our operations."" The outbreak left people like Julia, whose mother has underlying, chronic health conditions, overwhelmed by the fear that her parents were putting their lives at risk in an attempt to keep their jobs. ""My parents are all I have. I have to think about potentially not having them in my life,"" she said, her voice breaking. ""I want to share what's going on so there's an actual track record of what the company isn't doing."" Ahmed first saw Neela on the Smithfield floor during one of their shifts. He liked her skin, she liked his laugh. When he started asking around about her, Ahmed learned that they were both from the same village in Ethiopia and they both spoke the same language, Oromo. ""Wow, I'm so excited. In my breaktime, I  keep searching where she work,"" Ahmed recalled. ""Right away, I stop by her line. I say, 'Hey, what's up.' I tell her she's beautiful."" Ahmed took Neela to a trendy New American restaurant. They went on a week-long vacation to Wisconsin Dells, a campy Midwest vacation destination known for its water slides and hot springs. They fell in love and got married. Now Neela is eight months pregnant with their first child. Although she quit Smithfield back in December, Ahmed continued going to work during the outbreak even though he was terrified that he would infect his wife and their unborn baby with the virus. Because Neela started having difficulty walking in her third trimester, Ahmed needed to help her - they can't isolate from one another. Ahmed says two of his friends in the plant have tested positive. Then he began exhibiting symptoms himself. ""Smithfield - they don't care about employees,"" said Neela. ""They only care about their money."" According to Kooper Caraway, president of the Sioux Falls AFL-CIO, union officials approached management at Smithfield in early March to request multiple measures to increase worker safety, including staggering shifts and lunch schedules, which can pack 500 workers into the factory cafeteria at once. He said they also requested personal protective gear like masks and overcoats, temperature-checking at the doors and sanitation stations. ""This was before anyone at the plant tested positive,"" said Caraway. ""Management dragged their feet, didn't take worker demands seriously."" Largest pork producer in the world Founded in Smithfield, Virginia, in 1936 Owned by Chinese company WH Group Ltd, under its CEO, the billionaire Wan Long Over 54,000 employees and $15bn in sales (in 2018) Facilities located in Germany, Romania, Mexico, Poland and the UK WH Group acquired Smithfield for $4.7bn in 2013, which at the time was the largest acquisition of a US company by a Chinese business Tim was a new employee going through orientation when he heard about the first case from someone sitting next to him. But he says after that initial announcement, the company got very quiet. ""We didn't really hear nothing more about the coronavirus outbreak,"" he said. ""We thought it was good."" Then, on 8 April, the South Dakota State Health Department confirmed there were 80 cases at the plant. Multiple employees told the BBC that they found out from media reports, not from management at Smithfield. ""I've found out about some people having the virus in my department, but other co-workers told me,"" said Julia's mother, Helen. A temperature checking station was erected under a white tent at the main entrance to the factory, but Reynoza and Caraway both said that they were told workers with running elevated temperatures were allowed to come into the factory anyway. According to Helen, if workers wanted to avoid the temperature check, they could enter a side door. Smithfield instituted other changes, like building cardboard cubicles around lunch table seats to create a barrier between workers, staggering shifts, and putting out hand sanitiser stations. But multiple workers said - and photos sent to the BBC seem to confirm - that personal protective equipment came in the form of beard nets to wear over their faces, which do not protect from airborne particles like a surgical or N95 mask would. ""I haven't read anything from the CDC that says a hair net over your face will do much good,"" said Caraway. Smithfield did not respond to questions about the beard nets or provide details about what PPE they made available to workers, writing instead that, ""given the stress on supply chains, we have been working around the clock to procure thermal scanning equipment and masks, both of which are in short supply"". At a JBS Plant in Worthington, Minnesota, 30 minutes away from Sioux Falls, union representatives said their company provided workers with ""gloves, surgical masks, face shields, overcoats"",according to the Star Tribune.,external(On Friday, it emerged that the JBS Plant has 19 confirmed cases).A spokesman for Tyson Foodstold the New York Times,externalthat their policy is to notify employees if they have been in contact with anyone who is confirmed to have the virus. In response, some employees started bringing their own masks to the plant. Others began quarantining themselves from family. Kaleb, who has been with Smithfield for 12 years, told the BBC that for the past two weeks, he's been sealing himself in a room away from his wife, his six-month-old daughter and his three-year-old son because he can't be sure he isn't bringing the virus home with him everyday. ""My little boy you know, I lock the door - he knock on the door. 'Hey, daddy you wanna come out?' I say, 'Go with your mom,'"" he says. ""I don't have a choice. What can I do? I want to try to save my family."" If employees like Kaleb were to quit, they would be ineligible for unemployment. Advocates are hearing from visa-holders who fret that even if they were to apply for unemployment, they might be considered ""public charges"" which could render them ineligible for permanent residency under a new rule enacted by the Trump administration last year. (According to a spokeswoman for the Ways and Means Committee, unemployment compensation is an ""earned benefit"" that would not disqualify visa-holders from residency.)"" The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (Cares) Act excludes anyone living in a mixed-status household with an undocumented family member. ""They do not qualify for anything,"" said Taneeza Islam, the executive director of South Dakota Voices for Peace and an immigration lawyer. ""Their choice is between putting food on the table, and going to work and getting exposed."" On 9 April, with 80 cases confirmed, Smithfield released a statement saying that the plant would close for three days over the Easter weekend for deep cleaning, and return to full capacity that Tuesday. ""The company will suspend operations in a large section of the plant on April 11 and completely shutter on April 12 and April 13,"" a statement from the company read. But the BBC learned through interviews with workers and advocates that Smithfield employees were still being called into work on all three days. Reynoza took videos showing the company parking lot filled with cars, and employees entering the plant. Caraway said he learned subsequently that the plant was running at about 60-65% capacity, meaning hundreds of workers were still coming in. ""I haven't stopped working yet. I worked Friday, Saturday, Sunday and they want me to come back today,"" Tim told the BBC on the Monday after Easter weekend. ""I'm terrified. Terrified. Like I'm at a loss for words. [But] I got four kids to take care of. That income is what provides a roof over my head."" Sioux Falls Mayor Paul TenHaken, who said he was impressed and satisfied by the mitigation efforts taking place at Smithfield, admitted he felt surprised when he learned that the plant was still partially open. ""There could have been more transparency by them on the measures they were taking,"" he said. ""The message to the public didn't match the actual plan."" Smithfield began offering employees a $500 ""responsibility bonus"" if they finished their shifts through the end of the month,  which Islam characterised as a ""bribe"" to work in unsafe conditions. Sara Telahun Birhe, an organiser with Children of Smithfield, said her mother had previously decided she would not return, but changed her mind when she heard about the bonus. ""We're devastated by the idea that she's going to go in just for $500,"" Telahun Birhe said. In its statement, Smithfield wrote that the bonus is part of Smithfield's #ThankAFoodWorker initiative, adding: ""Employees who miss work due to Covid-19 exposure or diagnosis will receive the Responsibility Bonus."" In part due to the incomplete shutdown and in part due to the rising number of cases coming out of the plant, on 11 April both South Dakota Governor Kristi Noem and TenHaken sent a joint letter to Smithfield calling for a 14-day ""pause"" in operations. The next day, Smithfield leadership announced that they would comply - on 15 April, meaning there was still one more day of work in a building. Caraway said workers who went in on the final Tuesday received roughly double their normal wages but there had been no deep clean. ""They're still going into a dirty building."" Smithfield did not respond to questions about when its Sioux Falls factory underwent deep cleaning, writing that ""our facilities are thoroughly cleaned and sanitized every single day"". Both of Julia's parents were scheduled to work at Smithfield on Tuesday 14 April, its final day in business before the 14-day shutdown. Then, on Saturday, Helen started to cough. The next day, as fluffy white snow flew over Sioux Falls, Julia insisted that her mother get tested. Helen tried to put it off, saying it was nothing. ""My mom just really hates going to the doctor,"" said Julia, who eventually won the argument and Helen went to a drive-in testing centre at the local hospital. They stuck a swab into the back of each nostril and sent her home. ""If I were to have Covid-19, I clearly would have gotten it at the factory,"" she said. ""This week I have worked on three different floors. I've eaten in two different cafeterias. Just imagine every place I've been in, touched inside that factory. I've been walking through the whole place."" On the Tuesday they were scheduled to return to work, Julia's parents woke up at 4am like they normally do and called into Smithfield to explain that they couldn't come while awaiting Helen's test result. The call finally came later that afternoon. Julia spoke to the medical technician on her mother's mobile phone, while her parents sat watching her face for a reaction. When Julia heard the words ""positive for Covid-19"" she gave them a thumbs up, which she meant to indicate ""positive"". Helen and Juan misunderstood, and reached out for one another, a gesture of celebration that horrified Julia as she scrambled to explain that, no, Helen does have the virus. Her father retreated into the kitchen, where Julia glimpsed him trying to hold back tears. On the same day that Helen received her results, the issue of the Smithfield plant had turned fully political. Mayor TenHaken formally requested that Governor Noem issue a shelter-in-place order for Sioux Falls' surrounding counties as well as an isolation centre. She denied both requests. Despite the steep increase in cases, Noem also continued to decline to issue a shelter-in-place order in South Dakota, specifically saying that such an order would not have prevented the Smithfield outbreak. ""That is absolutely false,"" she said. Instead, she approved the first state test of hydroxychloroquine, a drug that President Donald Trump has frequently cited as a possible treatment for coronavirus. It was also the same day that Agustin Rodriguez Martinez, a quiet, deeply religious man originally from El Salvador, died from the illness, alone in hospital. He was 64, the first known death connected to the outbreak at Smithfield Foods. Reynoza, a friend of his for the past decade, said that he rarely complained about his gruelling job sawing the legs off pig carcasses and that he doted on his wife Angelita, whom he knew for only a month before they married. They were together for 24 years. ""He was her prince."" Angelita says she noticed something was off when her husband started coming home with the lunch she had packed him untouched. He began experiencing symptoms on 1 April, seven days after the first case of coronavirus was reported publicly at the factory. First there were the headaches, then aches and chills. Next came the shortness of breath. According to Angelita, on his final day of work at the factory, he was mopping the floors with a fever. By that Sunday, he could no longer breathe. Angelita brought him to hospital, but was not allowed to go with him. She learned through her pastor that he was put on a ventilator almost immediately. He was on it for 10 days before he died on 14 April. ""I took him to the hospital and left with nothing,"" she said. ""Now I have nothing."" Alongside her grief, Angelita is also angry at Smithfield Food for not closing the factory earlier. ""They care more about their money than our lives,"" she said in tears. ""The owners don't care about our pain. Mothers are crying for their children. Wives are crying for their husbands. There are so many cases of the virus there."" The 73-year-old widow also shared that she has developed a cough. Two days after her mother's positive coronavirus diagnosis, Julia woke up on the couch with a headache, a cough and a dry throat. For the first time since the pandemic arrived in her life, she had slept through the night but awoke feeling more exhausted than ever. After calling the Covid hotline and informing them she was the daughter of a Smithfield worker, Julia pulled on her faux fur-trimmed parka, disinfected the steering wheel and gear shift in her mom's car, and set out towards the drive-thru testing site. She was in relatively good spirits, despite the fact that almost everything she had attempted to prevent when she tipped off the local newspaper nearly a month ago had come to pass. The factory had remained open. Her mother had the virus and her father was exposed. Her city had become the epicentre of the pandemic in the state of South Dakota. People died. And now, she might be sick, too. ""I just wanna cry,"" she said, as she steered towards the hospital. All over the city, Smithfield workers and their families were going through a similar experience. The same day Julia's mother got her diagnosis, Sara Telahun Birhe was relieved to find out that her mother's Covid-19 test was negative. Neela and Ahmed got the call that he was infected, and the couple sealed themselves away from one another in separate bedrooms. They communicate via text. She makes him ginger tea and leaves it for him on the counter. He obsessively disinfects everything he touches. Tim said he worked his final shift at Smithfield while experiencing symptoms on Tuesday 14 April, and went in for a test the following day. He is still awaiting results. He said 20 people on his crew have tested positive. At about the same time that Julia set off to get her test, officials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were entering the Smithfield plant, along with representatives for the state and local health departments. According to the South Dakota governor's office, CDC officials were flown in from Washington DC to ""assess"" what it would take to safely reopen the plant. Meanwhile, Smithfield announced the closure of two more of its facilities in Missouri and Wisconsin, where ""a small number of employeesâ¦ have tested positive for Covid-19"". Although she arrived just 20 minutes after the testing site opened, Julia was greeted by a line of 15 cars ahead of her. ""I hate waiting in line,"" she muttered, sipping from her water bottle, every now and then emitting a soft cough. After 30 minutes, she pulled up to what looked like a huge garage and a sign that instructed, ""have ID and insurance card ready"". ""OK, now I'm anxious,"" she said. ""I don't want to do this."" She and the car ahead of her pulled into the bay, and a healthcare worker in a full protective suit, mask, gloves and face shield plunged a long swab into Julia's right nostril and then her left. She grimaced and shuddered. ""Do you need a Kleenex?"" the tester asked.  ""Yes, please,"" said Julia. With instructions to ""go home, stay home, don't go anywhere,"" the bay doors opened and Julia pulled back out into the sunlight. ""That was so uncomfortable that I actually am crying,"" she said, pulling into a parking spot to collect herself. Julia sat at the steering wheel watching cars go in and out of the parking lot. She lamented the fact that now their household had a new potential infection, the clock on their quarantine had to restart.  ""I just want to go to TJ Maxx,"" she said, smiling. After a few minutes, it was time to turn towards home, her parents, and the house Helen and Juan worked so many hours in the plant in order to afford, where they would all quarantine together for at least the next 14 days. ""Now it's just a waiting game,"" said Julia. ""I guess I can't get too in my head about it. But I will."" She should have her results in five days. Names have been changed.

Lockdown sees seasonal workers stranded on islandsWorkers have travelled to the Isles of Scilly and been left with no income as tourism comes to a halt.Cornwall,"About 2,500 people live on Scilly, with the majority of businesses reliant on the tourism sector Some seasonal workers on the Isles of Scilly have been left stranded without income due to the coronavirus lockdown. The islands, 28 miles off Cornwall, shut down transport links on 21 March, after the workers had arrived. Staff can only receive 80% of their pay through furlough if they were registered for tax before 19 March. The tourism board for Scilly said the outbreak had come at ""the worst possible time, coinciding exactly with the start of the tourist season"". ""The impact is completely extraordinary and catastrophic - nothing happens here without the tourism industry,"" said Nick Bond, executive director of the Islands Partnership. The vast majority of income has traditionally been generated between March and October, when the weather would be better, but also when the transport links to the mainland UK would usually be fully operational. The Partnership had projected 70,000 visitors would spend Â£34m on Scilly during 2020 and said tourism accounted for 85% of the economy. ""The great difficulty for small and medium sized businesses is not knowing when we might be back to normal again,"" Mr Bond said. ""We are talking to members and businesses about how government measures don't meet the needs of the tourism and visitor economy. Seasonal staff who arrived after the date that the government scheme applies to - the staff members are stranded."" Scillonians have been showing their support for key workers Seasonal workers fill many of the hospitality and retail roles on Scilly between these months each year. Marley Morgan from Penzance in Cornwall arrived on 15 March to start work as a chef at a hotel on St Mary's and said he felt ""helpless"". ""It is a beautiful place and a great escape, but the reason we are all here is that it's a great opportunity to make money,"" he said. His hotel is allowing the nine staff who have arrived from Cornwall, Yorkshire, Hungary and Latvia to stay in their accommodation without charge, for now. ""We are hoping we may reopen in late June,"" Mr Morgan said. The government pushed the date back for furloughed workers to 19 March but this would only help people who had been registered for tax purposes by this date. Many seasonal workers, including Mr Morgan would not qualify. Marley Morgan arrived on Scilly as a seasonal worker but has been left with no income He said workers were looking out for each other and scraping by, but said: ""Morale is pretty low. It's rough at the moment."" Mr Morgan said his previous employer was currently unable to help him and it would take five weeks to receive any universal credit. Having given up his tenancy and full time job before moving to Scilly he said he was reluctant to return home and put himself at risk through travelling. ""This was a really good opportunity for me work-wise as well as financially so I'd beat myself up if things were to go back to normal and I missed out,"" he said. Arriving on 13 March was Adrian Pinnell, who was hoping to do his 16th straight season and his 11th as restaurant manager at another hotel. After initial confusion that saw him and his wife Sit told to move out of the hotel for insurance purposes, a compromise has been reached. Adrian Pinnell has worked the season in Scilly for many years ""They have asked me to do 10 hours' work a week in a caretaker role. They pay me Â£100, and Â£50 of that goes back to them in rent,"" he said. The Pinnells split their year between Thailand and Scilly, have no home in the UK and are also not eligible for the furlough scheme. ""We may have to go to my mum in Cheltenham but we aren't sure if that classes as essential travel,"" Mr Pinnell said. The Duchy of Cornwall owns the majority of the land and has offered tenants an interest-free deferral for rent payments as ""there is likely to be a significant financial hardship due to the local economy's reliance on tourism"". The Prince of Wales has also ""sent his own personal message of support"". All flights and passenger ferry services to the islands have been suspended, other than for key workers and essential travel. A consortium including the local MP has written to the government to ask for ""support for the islands' strategic transport infrastructure at this unprecedented time"". The Council of the Isles of Scilly has employed two Royal Navy military planners to help coordinate its response, having declared a major incident. The Isles of Scilly Council said it would consider each case individually regarding essential travel. Nick Bond said: ""Businesses have brought staff over after the deadline and those individuals are rather stranded. Their employer, or the organisation that was to be their employer, has a moral obligation to look after them. ""There's an awful lot of planning in terms of bringing those teams on board and getting them over to Scilly to get up and running. Not knowing when we will be back in business makes that whole process problematic."" Mr Bond said some businesses would fold but added ""we have got to be optimistic that there will be recourse to funds through different channels"". ""People's safety is first and foremost, and then ensuring businesses remain in business,"" he said. ""Looking forward we have a great tourism offer here and the industry will bounce back.""

As it happened: Trump says lockdown protesters being treated 'rough',"President Trump said lockdown protesters being treated ""rough"", after calling for the ""liberation"" of some states Vice-President Mike Pence said states have enough test kits to begin reopening today The WHO advised countries to plot a cautious path out of lockdown rather than relying on antibody tests The UK launched a vaccine taskforce, funding 21 research projects The UK death toll reached 14,576 as 847 new deaths are reported in hospitals Germany said its outbreak is under control - each virus carrier is infecting less than one other person on average China denies cover-up of Wuhan outbreak, where the pandemic began, despite revised death toll There have now been more than 2.15 million confirmed cases worldwide and 145,000 deaths Edited by Jude Sheerin Thanks for tuning in to today's live coverage. We're wrapping things up now but before we go, here's some of the biggest stories of the day. Trump says he hopes to get back on the campaign trail soon, and that social mitigation measures won't be required as they are in the White House press briefing room. Having half as many journalists in the room means his news conferences, ""loses, to me, a lot of flavour"", he says. ""I certainly hope we can have rallies,"" he adds, saying they are ""a tremendous way of getting the word out"". He ends by calling campaign rallies, ""an important part of politics actually"". Trump says he is pleased with the US response so far. He cites his decision to trust his vice-president and ""listening to my gut"". Trump repeats his assertion that if not for his administration's actions, at least two million Americans would have died, and maybe ""much more than that"". The president's critics accuse him of trying to spin tens of thousands of US deaths as a win. Trump, seen through the White House windows Trump disputes figures suggesting the US is leading the world in coronavirus-related deaths. ""We don't have the most-in-the-world deaths.  The most in the world has to be China,"" he says. Numbers released by Johns Hopkins University say the US is leading the world in total deaths. But on Friday China said it had recalculated the Wuhan death toll to be 4,000 higher, after changing its counting technique. A conservative reporter asks why the Obama administration gave a $3.7m grant to the Wuhan Institute of Virology, where unnamed US officials have speculated in US media that the coronavirus may have leaked. ""Why would the US have a grant like that to China?"" asks the One America News Network journalist. Trump says: ""We will end that grant very quickly."" ""Who was president then, I wonder?"" says Trump, noting the grant was made in 2015. The Washington Post reported this week that US diplomats were concerned about safety protocols at the Wuhan lab and asked for more help. The French president said today there was no evidence for the Wuhan lab coronavirus origin theory. Trump is asked about an accusation by Washington Governor Jay Inslee that the president was fomenting rebellion by encouraging states to liberate themselves from lockdowns. He is asked how that squares with the ""sober and methodical guidance"" he issued yesterday. Trump says of certain stay-at-home orders: ""Elements of what theyâve done is too much."" He specifically mentions Virginia, which has closed firing ranges after designating them non-essential businesses. Asked if he is concerned that protesters will spread the disease, Trump says: âNo, these are people expressing their views. ""I see where they are and I see the way they are working. They seem to be very responsible to me. Theyâve been treated a little bit rough.â After President Trump steps out of the briefing room, top US infectious diseases doctor Anthony Fauci says totally unprompted that the government made mistakes in the early days of the pandemic. ""No doubt, no doubt that early on we had a problem,"" he says referring to the initial US inability to conduct mass testing. He adds: ""It was a problem that was a technical problem from within. ""It was an issue of embracing, the way we have now and should have, the private sector, who clearly has the capability of making and providing tests at the level that we will need them."" This is uncomfortable because the official who has been widely blamed for the testing setback - Dr Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control - was also on stage at the briefing. Dr Fauci's comment is, yet again, unlikely to endear him to the president, who never likes to admit error. Trump recently shared a retweet with the hashtag ""#FireFauci"". Dr Fauci's lack of harmony with White House talking points has triggered attacks from some Trump supporters who see him as a disloyal globalist infiltrator. Dr Anthony Fauci says people may require as many as one test every other day to be sure they have not recently become infected. He says he himself was tested negative today. ""We've been hearing testing is everything and it isn't,"" he says, stressing that mitigation strategies tamp down outbreaks. Dr Fauci, the top US disease expert, points out it is not necessarily testing that contained the spread of other viruses like HIV/AIDS, but rather strict mitigation practices. Vice-President Mike Pence says states have enough test kits in supply to begin moving to phase one of the plan that the White House outlined on Thursday. He says that 120,000 tests are being done each day in hospitals around the US. But some experts have said the US will need to test millions of people daily before the nation can start returning to economic normality. Phase one calls for schools to remain shut and social distancing measure to stay in place. Businesses should continue teleworking and groups of 10 should remain banned. A coronavirus testing site in New York Trump notes that the federal government made available 2,900 extra hospital beds for New York City, but they did not end needing the capacity at the Javits Center or the US Navy hospital ship that was sent to Manhattan. He says âwe wanted to err on the side of caution - this is what the governors wantedâ. âWe did a spectacular job,â Trump says. âI think Iâd rather tell you that we were over-prepared, than we were under-prepared, and that was a good faith effort by New York,â he says. These appear to be gracious comments about Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo - the two were feuding just earlier today. Trump has been accused by critics of being under-prepared for the pandemic. While the government took action in late January by limiting travel from China, Mr Trump downplayed the virus for weeks, and did not advise all Americans to socially distance themselves until mid March.  Trump complains that ""very partisan and misleading voices in the media and politics"" have voiced concerns about how quickly the US has scaled up testing. Without naming New York state's governor, who said earlier today that the federal government must move quicker to provide testing, he says that some people have been ""demonstrating a complete failure to imagine the scope of the testing abilities we have brought online."" The US got off to the difficult start with testing for coronavirus -initially it tested far fewer people than other countries, and Dr Fauci said in March that the US was ""failing"" on testing. It has since massively ramped up its testing numbers, although somebusiness leaders have said that ""vastly more testing capacity"" is needed,externalto help get the economy back up and running.  Trump begins by saying he has been speaking with faith leaders about the plan he outlined yesterday, which calls for a ""phased, safe and gradual reopening of America"". He says the guidelines provide governors with the ""fact-driven and science based metrics they will need"" to end lockdowns in their states. Trump also announces a new $19bn (Â£15bn) relief programme for farmers and ranchers. It's called the Coronavirus Food Assistance Programme, and includes $16bn in direct payments, says Trump. The US government also plans to purchase $3bn in food products to distribute to food banks and Americans in need. Trump had already announced $28bn in aid for farmers affected by tariffs, as of the end of last year. Donald Trump is now hosting the White House coronavirus taskforce daily briefing. He is joined by taskforce co-ordinator Deborah Birx, top US infectious diseases expert Anthony Fauci, and director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Robert Redfield. Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Purdue is also on stage. You canwatch it live here. The Trump campaign team have confirmed they are planning to restart rallies on the campaign trail. However it is unclear when these rallies will start and whether they would implement social distancing. The campaign did not mention whether they would prioritise ""low risk"" states first. Tim Murtaugh, Trump 2020 communications director, said: ""The coronavirus will pass and the president is looking forward to getting back out on the campaign trail and holding rallies."" The news comes a day after President Trump announced his plan to reopen America. The plan included guidance for governors on reopening state economies in the coming months. The daily White House coronavirus taskforce briefing is due to begin imminently. It comes as President Trump feuds with New York Governor Andrew Cuomo over whether the federal government is doing enough to help states fight the pandemic. Cuomo said on Friday that the federal government must be responsible for importing PPE and testing equipment from China, rather than each individual state. Trump swiftly hit back, saying Cuomo should stop ""complaining"" and be grateful for the federal assistance he has already received. On Thursday, the White House released guidelines for governors to consider when determining how to reopen their state. The three phases outlined by the White House call for robust testing for all medical workers - something the US has yet to accomplish on a wide scale - in order to move towards a ""new normal"". Danny ShawBBC Home Affairs Correspondent A UK government scheme to release prisoners early in order to help jails cope with coronavirus has been suspended after six offenders were freed by mistake. The inmates were mistakenly let out of two ""open"" prisons - Leyhill in Gloucestershire and Sudbury, Derbyshire. A spokesperson for the prisons service said they were ""low-risk"" offenders who ""returned compliantly to prison when asked to do so"". However, the mistake is deeply embarrassing for Justice Secretary Robert Buckland, who has emphasised the rigorous checks that would take place before inmates are let out. The prison service attributed the release to âhuman errorâ and said processes were being changed to reduce the likelihood of it happening again. Up to 4,000 prisoners, who are due to be freed within two months, are eligible for the early release programme across England and Wales. On Tuesday officials said four had been released with âhundredsâ more due to be freed this week. Fourteen pregnant prisoners and mothers with babies had also been freed early, by Tuesday. Sailors on the Roosevelt have their temperatures taken earlier this month (FILE PHOTO) The US Navy will begin antibody testing of the crew of the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier that has docked in Guam amid an outbreak of coronavirus. ""We have scheduled the outbreak investigation to begin Monday and we are seeking crew member volunteers to provide an additional swab sample and a routine blood draw for laboratory testing,"" announced Navy Surgeon General Rear Admiral Bruce Gillingham, adding that crew would be asked to answer a survey. The ship, which includes a crew of 5,000, has been allowed to wait in Guam as the sailors quarantine in local hotels. More than 500 crew members have so far tested positive, and one has died. Testing for antibodies, which tries to establish if someone has previously had coronavirus, has only been created in the past week. The accuracy of the tests is still questionable, and it's unclear whether the presence of antibodies in the blood does actually indicate immunity.The BBC's James Gallagher explained more a little earlier. Katy WatsonBBC South America correspondent In Ecuador, the death toll stands at 403 but new figures from one province suggest thousands have died. The government in Guayas province reported 6,700 deaths in the first two weeks of April, far more than the usual 1,000 deaths there in the same period. The first recorded case was of an Ecuadorean woman returning from Spain. It backs the perception in Latin America that Covid-19 is a rich person's disease - a virus introduced to the region by affluent parts of society who had been travelling abroad. The high death toll is also a devastating consequence of the combination of an overburdened healthcare system and a deeply unequal society which means not everybody is able - or willing - to socially distance and stop work. Authorities argue they were quick to impose strict regulations and people chose to disregard measures but experts argue more could be done - and one thing that could help is testing. While Ecuador is not the worst offender in the region, low testing rates have made it very difficult to understand how the virus has moved through communities, some of which have been devastated by the high death toll.

Hundreds of classical musicians and singers - from the National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain and the National Youth Choirs of Great Britain - led a mass doorstep singalong to the legendary composer's most famous melody. Musicians of all levels, and playing any instrument, were invited to get involved in the rousing crowd-pleaser. And people of all ages, using string instruments to synthesisers, turned out in their droves. Here are a selection of some of the participants... Allow Twitter content?

Ninety-five people died with coronavirus in California in the latest 24-hour period, making it the state's deadliest day so far. Governor Gavin Newsom said that the spike was due to a few hotspots, including a nursing home in Tulare County, south-east of Fresno. Local media reported that the state'stotal death toll was expected to surpass 1,000,externalby the end of Friday. All of the losses are, of course, tragic. However, so far the death toll in California - a state of 40 million people - is a fraction of what experts predicted, the BBC's Regan Morris reports. Here she looks at how California kept ahead of the curve.  Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
