Wrightbus fate to be known in hours - Paisley,"Wrightbus went into administration last month after a period of financial difficulties The fate of Wrightbus will be known in hours, Ian Paisley MP has said. The Ballymena business was placed into administration last month and is up for sale. The English industrialist Jo Bamford, son of JCB chairman Lord Bamford, is understood to have made a bid for the company. However, the ownership of the Wrightbus factory, at Galgorm just outside Ballymena, remains a barrier to an overall resolution. The union, Unite, said the deadline to resolve the current impasse over site ownership was now 10:00 BST on Thursday. Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure The premises are owned separately from the manufacturing business and held in a company called Whirlwind Property Two, which is not part of the Wrights group and is therefore not under the control of the administrator. The property company is controlled by Jeff Wright, the former owner of Wrightbus. Mr Paisley said the land remained the final hurdle to the deal, and Mr Bamford was not going to invest tens of millions of pounds if he did not control the asset. The Unite union has said the livelihoods of 1,200 workers hang in the balance ""This is the last chance and I really hope that a deal can be done,"" the Democratic Unionist Party MP said. ""The banks have accepted it, the administrators have accepted it and now the bell tolls for the landlord. ""At teatime tonight this deal effectively ceases to exist and sometime tomorrow I believe the administrator will be forced to liquidate this company."" About 1,200 jobs were lost after the company failed to find a new owner before it went into administration. ""This is theÂ eleventh hour in theÂ effort to save these jobs,"" said Unite's George Brash. ""Unite is calling on Jeff Wright to do the right thing - by thisÂ workforce, by their families, and by this town."" Wrightbus workers gather near the factory, hoping for some good news Wrightbus went into administration last month after a period of financial difficulties. Pre-administration attempts to sell the business were also complicated by the factory ownership issue. The Wright family said it had not acted unreasonably during that sales process. It said that one bidder had agreed to rent the factory, but then later withdrew the offer.

"Thomas Cook buyers pledge to save 2,500 jobs","John and Irene Hays run the business, set up 40 years ago All 555 Thomas Cook shops are to be bought by rival Hays Travel in a move that could save up to 2,500 jobs. The independent travel agent said the move gives it shops in areas where it had little or no presence, including Scotland and Wales. John Hays, who set up the Sunderland-based firm 40 years ago, said he hoped the shops would reopen within days. It had been an emotional day, he said, with many staff crying when they were told their jobs were saved. He said it was difficult to give cast-iron guarantees about every Thomas Cook shop, because there would now be talks with individual landlords. However, ""it is certainly our intention to take on all the staff; to welcome them back,"" he added. The shops will be branded under the Hays name. All the Thomas Cook stores will be rebranded as Hays Travel There is likely to be some overlap of stores, and the BBC estimates that there are more than 30 locations where there would be two competing High Street branches. In Yorkshire and the North East, for instance, there are branches just streets apart in Sunderland, Newcastle, York, Leeds, Doncaster, and at Morpeth, South Shields. Who are the family buying Thomas Cook shops? The acquisition, for an undisclosed sum, is a significant step for Hays, which has 190 shops, 1,900 staff, and last year had sales of Â£379m, reporting profits of Â£10m. Mr Hays, who owns the business with wife Irene, said: ""It is a game-changer for us, almost trebling the number of shops we have and doubling our workforce - and for the industry, which will get to keep some of its most talented people."" The takeover deal was struck with the travel industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, after several days of negotiations. He said he was ""elated to get the deal over the line. It's been emotional"". Many ex-Thomas Cook staff had cried when told they still had jobs, he said. ""These people did nothing wrong. One day they were in jobs, and the next day they were locked out."" He expected many of the shops to reopen on Thursday, ""although probably with a skeleton staff"". There were some logistics problems - Hays had still to locate many of the shop keys, he said. More than 100 new jobs will be based at the company's Sunderland headquarters, with the rest in shops across the UK. The company has tweeted, urging former Thomas Cook staff to apply.

When Thomas Cook collapsed, it put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, including 9,000 in the UK. It also sparked the biggest ever peacetime repatriation by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to bring more than 150,000 British holidaymakers back to the UK. The last flight to repatriate Thomas Cook customers landed at Manchester Airport on Monday. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she hoped the deal ""will provide significant re-employment opportunities for former Thomas Cook employees, alongside the advice and support we will continue to provide to help people find a new job as quickly as possible"".

Samantha Kennedy, 34, from Alness in Scotland worked at an Inverness branch of Thomas Cook for six years. She told the BBC that her WhatsApp chat group had been ""going crazy this morning since the media started reporting"" the deal. ""We've not been told anything. My manager hasn't been told anything. It would be absolutely amazing if it was true,"" she said. Samantha said she was sad the Thomas Cook brand had gone, but she loved working in the industry. ""To continue to work in the industry would be amazing and there's not many travel shops in Inverness, so if Hays were to take over I think people would be pleased."" The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association  (TSSA) union, which had members in Thomas Cook shops around the UK and in its head office in Peterborough, welcomed the move. Manuel Cortes, TSSA's general secretary,  said it offered ""real hope of reemployment to former Thomas Cook retail staff, many of whom are our members."" The business is thought to have a licence for six months to occupy Thomas Cook stores, giving Hays time to strike new deals with landlords. Ian Bell, head of travel and tourism at accountancy firm RSM, said it was a ""shrewd move"" for Hays, but would also represent a quadrupling of its travel agency stores at a time when customers are increasingly booking holidays online. ""Much may depend on the deals that Hays can strike with its new High Street landlords,"" said Mr Bell. As Hays bought the stores from the administrators, it means it will have bought them at a lower price than if Thomas Cook was still trading. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said that in waiting, Hays had got a ""best price"" for the stores. Thomas Cook collapses as last-ditch rescue talks fail Thomas Cook passenger: 'I'm stuck in Tunisia' However, she questioned the logic for the transaction at a time when customers are turning away from High Street travel agents. ""You have to wonder what Hays' plan is and how they can make it a success. ""Has the travel firm been gung-ho in trying to secure a cheap deal without assessing the viability of taking on these stores?,"" she asked. Hays Travel is not like Thomas Cook, which owned hotels and an airline. Pippa Jacks, group editor of Travel Trade Gazette, told the BBC: ""They don't have a [large] tour operating arm, they don't have an airline, they don't own hotels or cruise shipsâ¦ so it makes them quite nimble in terms of what they sell"". Hays is said to have beaten off other bidders, which she said suggested that the package holiday industry was not dead. ""If you're spending a lot of money, if you're not particularly confident and you want some personal recommendations, actually going to see a real human who will sit and listen and take time to understand your personal requirements is very valued by a lot of holidaymakers,"" she said.

Johnson 'fails to answer Arcuri questions',"Boris Johnson spoke at four of Jennifer Arcuri's events in London when he was mayor Boris Johnson is under fire for failing to provide details of his contacts with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri to a London Assembly inquiry. The PM responded to the assembly's request for information on Tuesday. But the assembly said the letter it received - marked ""confidential and not for publication"" - did not answer any of its questions. Mr Johnson denies claims of a conflict of interest over his friendship with Ms Arcuri when he was London mayor. The assembly had asked for details and a timeline of all contact between the pair, including private text messages and emails. A London Assembly spokeswoman told the BBC the letter ""doesn't answer any of the questions we asked"", adding: ""I can't understand why it is labelled confidential."" No 10 responds to Arcuri details request No 'favouritism' over Johnson links, Arcuri says Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? The assembly is now seeking legal advice over whether members of its oversight committee can discuss the contents of the letter at their meeting next week. In a statement, Len Duvall, Labour chairman of the committee, said: ""We did finally receive a response from Boris Johnson, through his solicitors, which they have indicated may not be published. At this stage we are respecting that, but we are seeking further clarification. ""Nothing in the response, in our opinion, reflects the need for confidentiality. In fact, the response is insufficient as far as our request for information is concerned. ""We are focused on our investigation and considering next steps. A number of options are open to us; they include speaking to various people and using our power of summons."" Len Duvall says his committee is considering its next move He said the committee was liaising with the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which has been asked to consider whether Mr Johnson, who as mayor was responsible for policing in London, should be investigated for misconduct in public office. Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: ""With an issue as serious as potential abuse of public office, it is absolutely in the public interest that this letter be published. ""Boris Johnson might think he is above the law but he cannot hide from scrutiny."" If the PM fails to answer the assembly's questions, added Mr Trickett, ""he is showing contempt for the inquiry and the people of this country."" Mr Johnson held the office of London mayor between 2008 and 2016. According to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story, technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is also understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mr Johnson was ""a really good friend"" who had spoken at event she organised - but denied the then mayor had shown any ""favouritism"" towards her. The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. The prime minister has denied breaking any rules of conduct and insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Separately, the current Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked a senior lawyer to review a 2013 decision by London and Partners, the mayor's promotional agency, to sponsor a conference organised one of Ms Arcuri's companies, for Â£10,000. London and Partners say they have found no evidence of Mr Johnson's involvement in the decision. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is, meanwhile, ""reviewing"" a Â£100,000 grant made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's cyber-security business Hacker House.

"Civic leader 'sorry' for Â£8,000 clothing expenses","Lord Provost Eva Bolander receives a civic allowance The Lord Provost of Glasgow has apologised and vowed to repay some of her expenses, after facing criticism for charging Â£8,000 worth of clothing to the public purse. On Tuesday it emerged Eva Bolander had claimed for 23 pairs of shoes. In a email to council members, she defended the claims, ""made in good faith"", with each ""within the rules"". However, she added that ""on reflection"", she should not have chosen to reclaim some items. She continued: ""I am sorry about that and I am in discussion with financial services to come to an arrangement to repay the relevant expenditure"". The figures,obtained by the Daily Record under a Freedom of Information request,external, cover claims between May 2017 and August this year. The paper reported Ms Bolander spent Â£1,150 on shoes, including a single order for two pairs from Watford-based Sole Bliss which cost Â£308. The Lord Provost's expenses also included Â£389 for Harris Tweed fabric, about Â£992 for 14 dresses and Â£435 for seven blazers. Ms Bolander - who earns Â£39,310 - had her nails done 20 times and claimed for 10 hair appointments totalling Â£751. The most expensive items were a pair of Â£358 spectacles and Â£200 hat from milliner William Chambers. In a letter to councillors, the Lord Provost said she was ""privileged to represent and advocate for Glasgow"". She said that it had ""always been recognised"" that the provost's role ""carries an additional cost, taking place as it does almost entirely in the public eye"". Ms Bolander justified the spending, saying that her role ""must be open to any elected member of the council"", and that no one be excluded from taking on the job ""by not having the resources to carry out the role"". She added that when submitting claims, she has always considered whether she would require the item were she not Lord Provost. ""Each has been made in good faith and scrupulously accounted for, within the rules"", she continued. ""Although the spending incurred was within the rules, on reflection there are items which I should not have chosen to reclaim. ""I am sorry about that and I am in discussion with financial services to come to an arrangement to repay the relevant expenditure."" Civic leader claimed 23 pairs of shoes on expenses On Monday, a council spokesman said: ""The national committee that oversees councillors' pay recognises that the requirement to represent their city at hundreds of events means Lord Provosts often incur personal expenses. ""For that reason, the Scottish government allocates a civic allowance to each council. ""For Glasgow City Council, this is subject to a yearly maximum of Â£5,000."" The civic allowance, which was introduced by the Scottish Local Authorities Remuneration Committee, replaced the clothing allowance and reflects a councillor's public profile. For that reason the Lord Provost is eligible to claim more than a backbench councillor.

EU leaders criticise UK Brexit proposals,"EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier (r) sat with President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker EU leaders have pulled apart the UK's Brexit proposals, accusing Boris Johnson of putting forward untested ideas to solve the Irish border crisis. Chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU needed workable solutions ""today not tomorrow"". European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker told MEPs that while he would ""not exclude"" a deal in the coming days, progress had been limited. Mr Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal. He will meet his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on Thursday to try and break the deadlock, while continuing to insist the UK will leave on 31 October with or without an agreement. In Westminster, meanwhile, a group of Conservative MPs has been demanding assurances from the PM that he will not take the party into the next general election - whenever it comes - on a straightforward promise to leave with no deal. And earlier, it emerged MPs would becalled to Parliament for a special Saturday sitting on 19 October- the day after a crunch EU summit, which is seen as the last chance for a deal ahead of the Halloween deadline. Could no-deal still happen? Deal by deadline very difficult - Irish PM Kuenssberg: Will 'Super Saturday' be a decisive Brexit moment? Adler: The end for negotiations in Brussels? The UK put forward fresh proposals for a Brexit deal last week, but so far the reaction from the EU has not been encouraging. Updating MEPs on the state of talks, Mr Barnier said he believed ""with goodwill"" on both sides there could be an agreement in the run-up to the summit. But he said ""to put things very frankly and to try to be objective, we are not really in a position where we are able to find an agreement"". As it stood, he said, the UK was proposing replacing an ""operable, practical and legal solution"" to avoid a hard Irish border with ""one that is simply a temporary solution"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Mr Barnier said the UK's suggested alternative to the Irish backstop - which would see customs checks conducted away from the border at business premises or electronically - ""had not been tested"" and was ""largely based"" on exemptions for small businesses and technology that ""has yet to be developed"". ""We need operational real controls, credible controls, we are talking about the credibility of the single market here - its credulity to consumers, to companies, and to third counties that we have agreements with."" Brexit deal essentially impossible - No 10 source Where are the Brexit talks at right now? What is in Boris Johnson's plan? The border blocking Brexit Mr Barnier also questioned the viability of the UK's proposals to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a veto over whether it aligned with EU single market rules for goods from 2021 onwards and whether to diverge from them in the future. However, he did confirm the two sides were looking at ""a more important role"" for the Northern Irish political institutions. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with only a ""very small number"" of physical checks Mr Juncker, meanwhile, took a swipe at the UK in the wake of a political row over the details of Tuesday's phone call between Mr Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Following the call, a No 10 source claimed the German leader had said a deal based on the UK's proposals was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"" and made new demands which made an agreement ""essentially impossible"". ""We remain in discussion with the UK,"" Mr Juncker said. ""Personally I don't exclude a deal. I do not accept this blame game that started in London."" During a sometimes bad-tempered debate in the European Parliament, former Belgian prime minister Guy Verhofstadt, accused Mr Johnson of treating those seeking to prevent a no-deal Brexit as ""traitors, collaborators and surrenderers"". ""The reason this is happening is very simple. It is a blame game. A blame game against everybody - against the EU, against Ireland, against Mrs Merkel, against the British judicial system, against Labour, against the Lib Dems, even against Mrs May,"" he said. ""The only person who is not being blamed is Mr Johnson apparently. All the rest are part of the problem."" The government has said there will be few physical customs checks Lib Dem MEP Jane Brophy urged the EU to give the UK as long an extension as possible to allow time for a general election and a referendum. But Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage suggested Brussels was no longer negotiating in ""good faith"" and the UK was fed up with being ""talked down to and insulted"" by EU leaders. ""You are not looking for solutions. You are looking to put obstacles in our way."" Mr Farage also suggested a no-deal Brexit would be a ""winning ticket"" at a future general election - a prospect which has reportedly caused some disquiet among Conservative MPs. At a meeting on Wednesday afternoon with a group of One Nation Tories - led by ex-minister Damian Green - the PM was told that dozens of his MPs would not be willing to support a straightforward manifesto promise to leave without a deal if there was a snap election before the end of the year. Mr Johnson sought to reassure them he was still very much focused on getting a deal. But the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said while no decision had been taken, she understood a future manifesto could include a promise to leave with an agreement if possible, alongside a vow to leave anyway ""within days or weeks"" if the Tories won a Commons majority and there was no chance of a deal. The prime minister has said he is determined the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, despite legislation, known as the Benn Act, which requires him to write to Brussels requesting a further delay if a deal is not signed off by Parliament by 19 October - or unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Scottish judges decided on Wednesday to delay a decisionon whether to sign the letter if Mr Johnson refused to do so, saying instead they would wait until the political debate had ""played out"". What is a no-deal exit? Elsewhere, there was anger among some Brexiteers after European Parliament President David Sassoli met Commons Speaker John Bercow in London. A statement after the meeting from Mr Sassoli said they both ""fully agreed on the important role that our parliaments play in the Brexit process"" and the European institution would support any request from the UK for an extension. Mr Farage said it was ""disgraceful"" the pair had ""agreed to work to prevent a no-deal Brexit"". Conservative MP Marcus Fysh said it was ""so far beyond his (Mr Bercow's) constitutional role"" and accused him of ""colluding with a foreign power"".

"EU heading for no-deal by mistake, Hunt warns","This video can not be played Jeremy Hunt: ""Catastrophic failure in statecraft"" could prevent Brexit deal Former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has issued a plea to EU foreign ministers to avoid a ""catastrophic failure in statecraft"" over Brexit. He has urged them in an open letter to reach a compromise with Prime Minister Boris Johnson while they still can. Delaying Brexit would only increase the chances of a no-deal exit, he warned. ""If they think this is bad - just wait until what happens after Boris wins an election,"" he told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg in an exclusive interview. Mr Hunt - who lost out to Mr Johnson in July's Conservative leadership contest - has written to the 27 EU foreign ministers, urging them to show greater flexibility in talks with the UK. EU leaders criticise UK Brexit proposals Irish PM: Difficult to get Brexit deal by deadline How could a no-deal Brexit happen? In his interview with Laura Kuenssberg, he said: ""I think we could be about to see a catastrophic failure in statecraft, not because of malevolence by the EU. I think they are sincere in wanting a deal. ""But just because they haven't really understood what's happening in British politics right now. ""And there is bureaucratic inertia. If you're trying to get 27 countries to agree a common position the easiest thing is always to do nothing. And that's the risk we face."" Allow Twitter content?

Mr Hunt, who backed Remain in the 2016 EU referendum but went on to be a strong supporter of Mrs May's withdrawal agreement, quit the cabinet in July after Mr Johnson attempted to remove him as foreign secretary. He told the BBC Mr Johnson had made mistakes in his handling of Brexit, although he declined to say what they were, but stressed they both agreed on the need for a speedy resolution to Brexit. He argued that the EU had been guilty of misreading the political situation in the UK in the past - over David Cameron's ill-fated renegotiation attempt in 2015 and Theresa May's withdrawal agreement - and could do so again. ""My worry is that they're about to make the same profound miscalculation that 'oh we can just hang tight, see if there's an election and if Boris Johnson wins it we can negotiate on the same deal but if he doesn't, so much the better because maybe we'll have a second referendum.' ""If Boris wins, which is what the polls are saying, at the moment, and he comes back with a majority, that British government will be much less willing to compromise,"" he said. This, he argues in his open letter to his former EU colleagues, will make a no-deal Brexit more likely - an outcome they had always agreed it was ""vital"" to avoid. ""I fear a profound and mutual lack of understanding is leading the EU to make the same mistakes over and over again,"" he writes. Leo Varadkar is set for further talks with Boris Johnson ""I am hoping and praying that does not happen because the implications for our future relationship would be extremely grave."" Mr Johnson has said he remains ""cautiously optimistic"" about a deal, while continuing to insist the UK will leave on 31 October with or without an agreement. He is set to meet his Irish counterpart, Leo Varadkar, on Thursday to try and break the deadlock. Mr Varadkar has expressed concern about Mr Johnson's proposal to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote over entering into a ""regulatory zone"" with the EU, which would involve it leaving the customs union. Mr Hunt said: ""I'm sure they would love to keep Northern Ireland in the single market and customs union in perpetuity. ""But in the end, that is not going to work for the UK, I don't think this is just the strong supporters of Boris Johnson who feel this, this would be to divide up a sovereign country, and that wouldn't be acceptable I don't think any other country in Europe either."" He urged Ireland to take a ""statesmanlike approach at this stage"" adding that there was a ""deal to be done which prevents a hard border on the island of Ireland, which allows regulatory alignment, the smooth flow of people and products across that border, which is so important for the Belfast Good Friday Agreement, it's going to need compromise on all sides"". He added: ""It's Ireland's call now because I don't think that the EU are going to budge unless they get that signal from Varadkar.""

Call of Duty game breaks records as boycott hits,"Call of Duty: Mobile was released on 1 October A mobile version of video game Call of Duty has been downloaded more than 100 million times in its first week. However, a boycott aimed at the game's publisher, Activision Blizzard, has been launched after Blizzard placed a 12-month ban on a Hearthstone gamerwho staged an online protest over the political crisis in Hong Kong. The hashtag #Blizzardboycott is now trending on Twitter. Boycotters included Mark Kern, a developer who has worked for Blizzard. ""It's done,""tweeted Mr Kern,external, with a screenshot suggesting he had just cancelled his subscription to World of Warcraft. ""Unless/until they completely reverse their stance on this issue (which, unfortunately, doesn't seem likely) they will get no more money from me,"" wrote one Reddit user in a long thread about the boycott. The latest title in the hugely popular Call of Duty franchise has been well received by gamers, according to download statistics from Sensor Tower. The company said the game, which was released on 1 October, had enjoyedthe biggest mobile launch yet,external. A PC and console title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, is due to be released on 25 October. Some social media users encouraged those who had pre-ordered the game to ask for refunds. Meanwhile, video game industry commentator Rod Breslau noticed that in another live-streamed Hearthstone tournament game, one player held up a sign saying, ""Free Hong Kong, boycott Blizz[ard]"". Hearthstone gamer banned for Hong Kong protest Hong Kong protest: City reels from 'one of its most violent days Activision Blizzard's share price had fallen by 2.3% by the close of trading on Tuesday. However, the backlash was unlikely to cause serious commercial problems for Activision Blizzard, said James Batchelor, UK Editor at GamesIndustry.biz. ""It's negative PR and that's never great for a company but I can't remember an instance where a consumer-led boycott has led to a significant drop in sales in the video games industry,"" he told the BBC. ""These games have such a vast audience that I would almost say almost half don't even know what's happening... The vast majority of Call of Duty players are so casual, so mainstream."" Seth Barton, editor of gaming industry magazine MCV, agreed that the boycott was unlikely to have a significant impact. Activision Blizzard didn't have much choice in the matter, he argued: ""by allowing any such protests it would have to either allow all such protests, or become arbiter of what's acceptable and what's not"". BBC News has contacted Activision Blizzard for comment. Ng Wai Chung is the name of the gamer banned for 12 months by Blizzard. He uses the pseudonym Blitzchung. During a post-match interview on the official Hearthstone Taiwan video stream, he donned a gas mask and shouted: ""Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age."" Blizzard said tournament rules said players must not offend people or damage the company's image.

Crash death parents 'let down' by governments,"This video can not be played Dunn family on Raab meeting: ""We feel let down"" The family at the centre of a row over diplomatic immunity after their son died in a car crash described a meeting with Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab as feeling like a ""publicity stunt"". Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash with a Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August. American diplomat's wife Anne Sacoolas, suspected of driving the other vehicle, later left the UK to return to the US. Boris Johnson has spoken to President Trump who told a press briefing Harry's death was a ""terrible accident"". This video can not be played Trump says fatal car crash by diplomat's wife was 'accident' Police have said CCTV of the crash which killed the teenager shows the Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road. Speaking after his conversation with the prime minister, President Trump said: ""The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. ""You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. ""So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet. ""It was an accident, it was a terrible accident."" Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was in a crash with a Volvo After meeting the foreign secretary, Harry's mother Charlotte Charles said  she felt ""let down"" by both the UK and US governments. She said: ""I can't really see the point as to why we were invited to see Dominic Raab. We are no further forward than where we were this time last week. ""Part of me is feeling like it was just a publicity stunt on the UK Government side to show they are trying to help. ""But, although he is engaging with us, we have no answers. We are really frustrated that we could spend half an hour or more with him and just come out with nothing."" Together with Harry's father Tim Dunn, she met Mr Raab in the hope he would urge the US to waive Ms Sacoolas' diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn said: ""I felt extremely let down by the Government today, or by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. ""I'm deeply, deeply disappointed that they think it's okay to kill a young lad on his bike and they can just walk away. ""I don't think the government or the Commonwealth Office have any clout to do anything."" Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles felt there was little point to their meeting with the foreign secretary Number 10 said the Prime Minister urged US President Donald Trump to reconsider the decision to allow Ms Sacoolas immunity in order that ""the individual involved can return to the UK, cooperate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice"". Downing Street said the ""leaders agreed to work together to find a way forward as soon as possible"" during their conversation on Wednesday evening. Following the meeting with Harry's parents, the foreign secretary said: ""I share the frustration of Harry's mother and father. ""They have lost their son and the justice process is not being allowed to properly run its course."" Meanwhile, Ms Charles urged Ms Sacoolas to do the ""humane thing to do and get on a plane and come back"". Crash death mother 'will appeal to US president' Police urge US to waive crash suspect's immunity What is diplomatic immunity? Their lawyer Radd Seiger said they were in talks to launch a civil case against Ms Sacoolas and they were ""going to Washington soon to help us get that justice for Harry"". He also invited the US President to meet the family about the case. ""If meeting with President Trump would help us get a step closer to seek justice for Harry, to get justice for that boy who died that night needlessly, one of the most wonderful kids in our community, if that's what it takes then I will extend an invitation now to President Trump. ""Meet us. Let's have a chat. Nobody wants to litigate."" Mr Johnson had already urged the USto reconsider its decision to allow Ms Sacoolas immunity, while Mr Raab has previously spoken to the US ambassador and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Northamptonshire's chief constable and its police and crime commissioner have also urged the Americans to waive Ms Sacoolas's diplomatic immunity. About 23,000 individuals in the UK have diplomatic immunity, a status reserved for foreign diplomats and their families, as long as they don't have British citizenship. It is granted by the 1961 Vienna Convention and means that, in theory, diplomats cannot face court proceedings for any crime or civil case. The convention also states that those entitled to immunity are expected to obey the law. Where crimes are committed, the Foreign Office can ask a foreign government to waive immunity where they feel it is appropriate. Diplomatic immunity is by no means restricted to those named on the Diplomatic List from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Drivers, cooks and other support staff whose names do not appear, but have been accredited to Britain (""the receiving state"") have the same diplomatic status and immunity as those who are listed. Equally, there are a number of foreign nationals in Britain attached to international organizations who have the same status and protection. Harry Dunn died after his Kawasaki motorcycle was in a crash with a black Volvo XC90 in Croughton, close to an RAF base. He was taken to Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford where he died. Chief Constable Nick Adderley said ""based on CCTV evidence"", officers knew that ""a vehicle alighted from the RAF base at Croughton"" and was ""on the wrong side of the road"". He said the suspect, Ms Sacoolas, had ""engaged fully"" following the crash and said ""she had no plans to leave the country in the near future"". However, she then left for the United States and has not returned.

Will Typhoon Hagibis affect World Cup matches?,"Typhoon Hagibis is expected to make landfall in the Tokyo region on Saturday 2019 Rugby World Cup Hosts:JapanDates:20 September to 2 November Coverage:Full commentary on every game across BBC Radio 5 Live and Radio 5 Live Sports Extra, plus text updates on the BBC Sport website and app. England and Scotland's final World Cup pool matches this weekend are under threat from violent Typhoon Hagibis. Hagibis is moving towards Japan and expected to make landfall on Saturday. Both England's game against France in Yokohama on Saturday (09:15 BST) and Scotland's vital match with hosts Japan at the same venue on Sunday (11:45 BST) could be affected. BBC weather presenter and meteorologist Simon King said it is ""one of the most powerful tropical cyclones this year"". World Rugby has called a news conference on Thursday at 04:00 BST to discuss what action will be taken. If the Scotland-Japan match was to be cancelled, under tournament rules Gregor Townsend's side are likely to be knocked out of the World Cup. When the weather changed a sporting result England prepare for typhoon disruption A Met Office spokesperson said on Wednesday that Typhoon Hagibis was in the western North Pacific and on track to hit Japan this weekend. It was located around 900 miles south of Tokyo with estimated wind speeds of around 120mph and gusts of 170mph. The Met Office says strong and severe winds, very heavy rain and large waves mean a risk of flash flooding in the Tokyo region. Yokohama is approximately 17 miles south of Tokyo. King explained: ""It is equivalent to a category five hurricane, making it one of the most powerful tropical cyclones around the world this year. ""The typhoon will start to weaken as it continues its track northward. However, forecasts from the Joint Typhoon Warning centre and the Japanese Meteorological Service suggest it will make landfall in southern Honshu, around the Tokyo area on Saturday lunchtime UK time. ""By this point, it'll still be categorised as a 'very strong typhoon' with wind gusts in excess of 100mph and bring between 200-500mm of rain. ""This will be significant in a built-up area such as Tokyo with damage and flooding expected."" ""Yes, it could,"" added King. ""Forecasting the path of a typhoon is a tricky one and while there is growing confidence of a landfall near to Tokyo, it still could shift path slightly, even up to 24 hours before time. ""However, Typhoon Hagibis is huge, covering a diameter of around 500 miles. ""On landfall, the most powerful winds are expected to extend out 60 miles from its centre. Therefore, even if the location of direct landfall changes, the winds, flooding rain and impacts will still be felt over a large area."" Organisers could move games away from the area where Typhoon Hagibis is expected to make landfall. It had been suggested that England's meeting with France, due to be played in Yokohama, could be shifted 600 miles away to Oita. However, Oita is a far smaller venue, with space for 40,000 spectators compared to Yokohama's capacity of 72,327, and that option is considered unlikely. Instead the matches could be played behind closed doors to limit the risk to spectators. It has also been suggested Scotland's match with Japan could delayed by 24 hours but, accordingto the tournament rules,,externalit is not possible to postpone pool-stage matches to another day. If both matches are cancelled, this would result in them declared a draw, with two points awarded to each team. England and France are vying for top spot in Pool C having both already qualified for the quarter-finals, but should their match be cancelled it would mean England will progress as winners. Eddie Jones' side would then face a probable quarter-final against Australia, who knocked them out at the pool stage of the last World Cup en route to the final, with Wales expected to top their group and therefore play France. The consequences would be far worse for Scotland if their game against Japan is called off. Townsend's team need to win to go through and may also have to rely on bonus points but - if Ireland beat Samoa in Fukuoka on Saturday - a weather-enforced two-point haul would mean they finish third in Pool A and go out. Who needs to do what to reach quarter-finals? World Rugby has announced a media conference to discuss the impacts of Typhoon Hagibis on the tournament for 04:00 BST on Thursday. Alan Gilpin, World Rugby tournament director, and Akira Shimazu, chief executive of Japan Rugby 2019, will be there.

"Teaching assistant cuts 'heartbreaking' for pupilsA generation of school children have been let ""down by the system"", says head teacher Jane Jenkins.WalesComments","This video can not be played Teaching assistants ""invaluable to schools"" Cutting the numbers of teaching assistants has had a ""heartbreaking"" impact on pupils, a primary school head teacher has said. There are almost 1,400 fewer support staff working in Welsh primary schools compared with four years ago. Jane Jenkins, head of Moorland primary in Cardiff, said she had to axe three out of 30 such posts with budget cuts. The Welsh Government said it was making ""the biggest single investment"" in the school workforce since 1999. Data from the annual school census shows there has been a 7.5% cut to primary school support staff from 18,655 in 2014-15 to 17,261 in 2018-19. That includes the loss of more than 1,000 standard teaching assistants (TAs) and 300 special needs support staff, although there was an increase in the number of higher level teaching assistants from 1,128 to 1,435. Teachers in Wales set for 2.75% pay rise School uniforms to be cheaper and gender neutral Male teaching assistants 'stereotyped' Head teacher Jane Jenkins says a ""generation of children has been let down by the system"" Jane Jenkins toldBBC Wales Livethat losing teaching assistants meant less one-to-one support for pupils for things like speech and language help. ""This generation of children has been let down by the system,"" she said. ""It's absolutely heartbreaking to think the interventions and support we were giving in the school 12 months ago, we're no longer able to deliver."" The adult to pupil ratio in her reception class has increased from 1:10 to 1:12, and she fears she will have to make further staff cuts. ""I'm really concerned about the future, I'm already dreading next year's budget,"" she said. ""I've been a head since 1997 and I've never known a budget settlement like the one we had this year."" Rob Williams, from the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, said recruiting and retaining important staff had become an ""intractable"" problem for schools. ""We know that schools are having to reduce the number of teaching assistants they have, or the number of hours TAs are contracted to work, because their budgets are at breaking point,"" he said. ""It is obvious that until we address this combination of factors, and return to a situation where taking a job in a school is an enjoyable, manageable and decently paid career choice, the young people of Wales will always be losing out on their right to a decent education."" In April, independent research found that school funding in Wales hadfallen by Â£500 per pupil over ten years. And anassembly committee concluded there was not enough money,externalgoing into the education system. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""In July this year we published theProfessional Standards for Assisting Teaching,externalto support all teaching assistants with their development and progression. ""We are also delivering the biggest ever investment of Â£24m in teachers' professional learning and a proposed additional inset day to give staff more time for training. ""Teaching assistants, head teachers, regional consortia and other key partners tested and contributed to the standards, which reflect the importance of collaboration for a highly-skilled, well-supported teaching community.""

Northern California hit by mega power cuts,"A huge wildfire killed 86 people in Paradise, California, last year A power company is cutting electricity to around 800,000 homes, businesses and other locations in Northern California, in an attempt to prevent wildfires. Large swathes of the San Francisco Bay Area - though not the city itself - have lost power, angering residents. The regionâs utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), has warned the shutdown could last several days. The company's transmission lines started the deadliest wildfire in Californiaâs history last year. With weather forecasts predicting high winds, the move is intended to prevent the risk of fallen power lines igniting more wildfires. ""The conditions are ripe: dry fuel, high winds, warm event. Any spark can create a significant event,"" said Ray Riordan, director of the Office of Emergency Management in San Jose, during a press conference on Tuesday. The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning for the Santa Cruz Mountains, North and East Bay regions until Thursday, warning that conditions could result in ""the strongest offshore wind event in the area since the October 2017 North Bay fires"". This video can not be played California braces for Santa Ana winds As of Wednesday morning, PG&E said around 500,000 customers were without power. Another 200,000 were scheduled to lose power by noon, local time, but the utility company has delayed further shutdowns until later in the afternoon due to changing weather conditions. The huge âCamp Fire"" in the town of Paradise last year burned 150,000 acres and left 86 people dead. An investigation determined that poorly maintained PG&E equipment was to blame for starting the historic blaze. The day Paradise burned down California fires 'can now happen any year' 'Losing everything has made me stronger' The firm was also blamed for deadly fires in 2017.Subsequent lawsuits led the publicly traded company to declare bankruptcy in 2019, a process that is still ongoing. PG&E is the sole provider of gas and electricity for much of Northern California, and so the vast majority of consumers in the region do not have an alternative source of power. This video can not be played Rebuilding Paradise: 'Our town is gone' âWe have experienced an unprecedented fire season the past two years,â said Tamar Sarkissian, a PG&E spokeswoman, speaking to BBC partner CBS News. ""And what we learned from that is that we need to be taking further steps to ensure the safety of our customers and the communities that we serve. Public safety power shut off is one of the many steps that we're taking."" PG&E has carried out several planned outages over the course of the past year, though none at the scale of what is scheduled this week. âNone of us are happy about it,â said California governor, Gavin Newsom. âBut this is part of something that we knew was likely to occur several months ago, when PG&E finally woke up to their responsibility to keep people safe.â The outages are expected to affect more than half of the state's counties. The warnings stretch north of the San Francisco Bay Area, in areas such as Napa and Sonoma, famed for wine-making. Further south, many cities synonymous with Silicon Valley giants could be affected, such as Cupertino, home to Apple. Local shops reported an influx of customers buying up supplies for a black out that could, if the weather remains adverse, last for several days. Experts are concerned gusty winds could produce the conditions for wildfires to ignite ""The idea of five days without electricity is devastating,â said Libby Schaaf, mayor of Oakland, but added: ""We fully expect that to be a worst-case scenario. This is our first time going through this.â But websites providing information about the cuts have buckled under heavy traffic loads. Many residents have taken to PG&Eâs social media channels to express their frustration. Snapshots from California 'apocalypse' town Volunteers fighting fires in California's 'forgotten canyon' ""This is ridiculous!â wrote Veronica Key. ""You wasted the money you should have been using on safety precautions to give dividends to your stockholders. Now you have to shut down our power like some sort of third world country. ""When you do shut down the power you canât even get your notification website to work properly! Get it together PG&E! No more rate increases to pay for your incompetence.â Allow Twitter content?

PG&E has opened 28 Community Resource Centers in the region to provide ârestrooms, bottled water and electronic-device chargingâ during daylight hours. Many schools in the area have told students to stay at home on Wednesday and await further information for the remainder of the week. Despite widespread frustration, local meteorologist Mike Pechner told CBS the move was warranted. ""It's not an overreaction at all. As the wind comes in, the wires, of course, oscillate back and forth. If they touch, they start a fire. ""[Cutting power] is taking downed wires and high winds out of the fire equation.""

"Stormont given Â£31m to prepare for no-deal BrexitCivil servants set aside millions for roads, ports and ""vehicle parks"", according to a spending plan.Northern IrelandComments","Stormont has set aside Â£8m for capital spending on roads and port infrastructure Northern Ireland's Department of Finance was given Â£31.4m during the summer to help Stormont departments prepare for a no-deal Brexit. The Treasury allocated the money froma pot of Â£2.1bn, announced on 1 Augustfor no-deal preparations across the UK. Stormont's share was confirmed to SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon when she asked for a breakdown of the figures. She expressed concern that a ""huge sum"" had been allocated by civil servants without input from MLAs. What is 'no-deal Brexit'? How would no deal affect life in NI? Ms Mallon told BBC News NI the money would have been better spent on employing more nurses and building more housing and she accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""reckless and dangerous"" tactics on Brexit. She added that the spending plans ""threw up significant questions"" about the government's plan for borders if there is no deal with the EU. More than a quarter - Â£8m - of Stormont's extra Â£31m has been set aside for capital spending on roads and port infrastructure. Almost Â£6m of it has been allocated to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) for ""trade, inspection, legislation and policy staffing"". A further Â£3m has been allocated for capital spending on ""vehicle parks"" in Northern Ireland although there are no details about locations. New signage, CCTV and ""communication equipment"" will cost Â£2.3m, according to the figures. The majority of the cash has been split between two departments - DAERA and the Department for Infrastructure. Stormont's Executive Office has been allocated Â£400,000 to run a no-deal Brexit ""public information campaign"". The Department of Finance initially planned to hold back Â£2m in reserve to deal with what it called ""emerging pressures"". The public transport company Translink has been allocated Â£600,000 for cross-border contingency planning while Northern Ireland Water, which manages the water and sewerage infrastructure, is in line for Â£2.2m for ""maximising chemical stock levels"". However, almost half of that Â£2m - Â£800,000 - has since been allocated to the Department of Health to cope with potential ""medicines shortage and medical device shortage"". By John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor The most intriguing items in these budget documents are the capital spending commitments for roads, vehicle parks and CCTV. That is exactly the sort of infrastructure the government says it won't be building at the border, even if there is no deal. So perhaps it's money that will be directed towards the Irish Sea ports. The Scottish government also has a no-deal contingency planto ""repurpose"" land at the old port of Stranraer as a lorry park. It says that may be necessary if there are increased traffic flows between Northern Ireland and Scotland. One reason for these increased flows could be the government's zero-tariff no-deal plan for the Irish border. They may provide an opportunity for Irish traders to trade tariff-free through Northern Ireland and onwards to Scotland, whereas product leaving Dublin for Holyhead in Wales would face tariffs. Stormont's no-deal spending plan was released bySue Gray, the most senior civil servant in the Department of Finance, in response to a request from the SDLP deputy leader. In a series of written questions to the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the SDLP's Ms Mallon had asked: ""Who took the decision and under what authority to allocate this funding?"" Sue Gray is the permanent secretary at Stormont's Department of Finance Ms Gray replied: ""I took the decision, acting under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act 2018, to allocate this funding."" That legislation was passed by MPs at Westminster in order to keep Northern Ireland's public services running in the absence of locally-elected ministers. The Northern Ireland Assembly and its governing executive have not functioned for almost three years. Thepower-sharing executive collapsed in January 2017when relations between its two biggest parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in - broke down. Ms Mallon, whose party is opposed to Brexit, said Â£31.4m was a ""huge sum of public money"" and its allocation had been ""decided on without an executive"". ""There is no scrutiny or accountability and despite requesting it, no explanation or rationale has been provided for these decisions,"" she added. Nichola Mallon accused Boris Johnson of ""cliff-edge tactics"" on Brexit She said the money could have been used instead to fund about over 1,300 new nurses or build more than 240 homes. She explained the average cost to build new social housing in Northern Ireland was Â£130,000 per home, while the average salary for a registered nurse in Belfast was just under Â£24,000. Ms Mallon questioned the large amount of money allocated for CCTV in the event of no-deal. She asked: ""Does any of this involve border infrastructure? We need the detail behind these headlines."" The SDLP MLA said she had asked for the thinking behind the allocation of the money to be explained to her but that further detail had yet to be presented. What would change with a no-deal Brexit?

Johnson 'fails to answer Arcuri questions'The London Assembly criticises the PM's response to its inquiry into his contacts with the US businesswoman.UK Politics,"Boris Johnson spoke at four of Jennifer Arcuri's events in London when he was mayor Boris Johnson is under fire for failing to provide details of his contacts with US businesswoman Jennifer Arcuri to a London Assembly inquiry. The PM responded to the assembly's request for information on Tuesday. But the assembly said the letter it received - marked ""confidential and not for publication"" - did not answer any of its questions. Mr Johnson denies claims of a conflict of interest over his friendship with Ms Arcuri when he was London mayor. The assembly had asked for details and a timeline of all contact between the pair, including private text messages and emails. A London Assembly spokeswoman told the BBC the letter ""doesn't answer any of the questions we asked"", adding: ""I can't understand why it is labelled confidential."" No 10 responds to Arcuri details request No 'favouritism' over Johnson links, Arcuri says Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? The assembly is now seeking legal advice over whether members of its oversight committee can discuss the contents of the letter at their meeting next week. In a statement, Len Duvall, Labour chairman of the committee, said: ""We did finally receive a response from Boris Johnson, through his solicitors, which they have indicated may not be published. At this stage we are respecting that, but we are seeking further clarification. ""Nothing in the response, in our opinion, reflects the need for confidentiality. In fact, the response is insufficient as far as our request for information is concerned. ""We are focused on our investigation and considering next steps. A number of options are open to us; they include speaking to various people and using our power of summons."" Len Duvall says his committee is considering its next move He said the committee was liaising with the Independent Office for Police Conduct, which has been asked to consider whether Mr Johnson, who as mayor was responsible for policing in London, should be investigated for misconduct in public office. Labour's shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said: ""With an issue as serious as potential abuse of public office, it is absolutely in the public interest that this letter be published. ""Boris Johnson might think he is above the law but he cannot hide from scrutiny."" If the PM fails to answer the assembly's questions, added Mr Trickett, ""he is showing contempt for the inquiry and the people of this country."" Mr Johnson held the office of London mayor between 2008 and 2016. According to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story, technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is also understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mr Johnson was ""a really good friend"" who had spoken at event she organised - but denied the then mayor had shown any ""favouritism"" towards her. The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. The prime minister has denied breaking any rules of conduct and insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Separately, the current Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked a senior lawyer to review a 2013 decision by London and Partners, the mayor's promotional agency, to sponsor a conference organised one of Ms Arcuri's companies, for Â£10,000. London and Partners say they have found no evidence of Mr Johnson's involvement in the decision. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is, meanwhile, ""reviewing"" a Â£100,000 grant made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's cyber-security business Hacker House.

Special sitting for MPs to decide Brexit future,"MPs will be called to Parliament for a special Saturday sitting in a decisive day for the future of Brexit. Parliament will meet on 19 October after a crunch EU summit - seen as the last chance for the UK and EU to agree a deal ahead of 31 October deadline. If a deal is agreed, Boris Johnson will ask MPs to approve it - but if not, a range of options could be presented. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg says these could include leaving without a deal, and halting Brexit altogether. MPs will have to agree a business motion in the Commons for the sitting to take place. Assuming they do, the additional day would coincide with an anti-Brexit march run by the People's Vote campaign, which could see thousands of protesters heading to Westminster. The House of Commons has only sat on four Saturdays since 1939, including on 2 September that year, due to the outbreak of World War Two. The last time there was a Saturday sitting was 3 April 1982, due to the invasion of the Falkland Islands. Could no-deal still happen? Deal by deadline very difficult - Irish PM Brexit deal essentially impossible - No 10 source The end for negotiations in Brussels? The prime minister has said he is determined the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, despite legislation, known as the Benn Act, which requires him to write to Brussels requesting a further delay if a deal is not signed off by Parliament by 19 October - or unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. Scottish judges said on Wednesday they would not rule on a legal challengefrom campaigners seeking to force the PM to send the letter - or to allow an official to send it on his behalf if he refused. They said they would delay the decision until the political debate had ""played out"". No 10 has insisted Mr Johnson will comply with the law, but Laura Kuenssberg says there are still conversations going on in Downing Street about writing a second letter, making the case that a delay is unnecessary. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said his MPs would ""do everything we can in Parliament, including legislating if necessary, to ensure [Mr Johnson] makes that application"". ""The idea that the prime minister will defy the law yet again is something that needs to be borne in mind,"" he added, appearing to referencethe unlawful suspension of Parliament last month. But former Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, who now sits as an independent after rebelling over Brexit, said he was a ""bit mystified"" at the need for a one-off Saturday sitting. ""I realise we are in the middle of a political crisis, but it is not a political crisis which makes me think we could not be sitting on the day before or on the following Monday,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One. ""The government simply has not explained itself."" Talks are ongoing between the UK and EU after Mr Johnson submitted new proposals for a Brexit deal, centred on replacing the Irish backstop - the policy negotiated between Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. However, the EU has said there would have to be ""fundamental changes"" to the ideas put forward in order for them to be acceptable. For example, Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Leo Varadkar told the Dail (Parliament) on Wednesday the UK's proposal to take Northern Ireland out of the EU customs union was a ""grave difficulty"" for his government. Mr Varadkar and Mr Johnson are expected to meet for further talks later this week, but after the two leaders spoke on the phone for 45 minutes on Tuesday night, the Irish PMtold broadcaster RTEhe believed it would be ""very difficult"" to reach an agreement before the end of the month. What is in Boris Johnson's plan? The border blocking Brexit The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, will meet European Commission officials later - but sources on both sides told BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming that technical talks had effectively reached the limit of what they could achieve. However, Home Secretary Priti Patel said the government had been putting in ""very intense"" work in recent weeks to get a deal, so ""nothing is over"". While getting an agreement was still their preference, they were ""absolutely clear"" that the UK would leave the EU on 31 October ""come what may"", she added. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier will also have a lunch meeting on Thursday to discuss the state of play. This video can not be played Priti Patel on Brexit: ""Nothing is over yet"" As the clock ticks down towards the summit, the political tension has been rising. A row broke out on Tuesdayafter a No 10 source said a call between Mr Johnson and the German chancellor, Angela Merkel, had made a deal ""essentially impossible"", claiming she made clear a deal based on his proposals was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"". Mrs Merkel's office said it would not comment on ""private"" conversations. But the President of the European Council Donald Tusk sent a public tweet to Mr Johnson, accusing him of playing a ""stupid blame game"" - a criticism echoed by a number of opposition parties in the UK. This video can not be played Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he wants a deal ""but not at any cost"" Meanwhile, the UK has been told it will still be liable to pay into the EU budget until the end of next year, even if it leaves without a deal this month. The budget commissioner, Gunther Oettinger, said the UK was fully signed up for the whole of 2020 - the last year's of the bloc's current financial framework. ""If the British are not prepared to pay, we are sure we will get the money at a later stage but not immediately,"" he said. This special sitting will be a huge day. That is because it will be the moment when Boris Johnson either returns to chants of ""hail the conquering hero"" - if he manages to get this elusive Brexit deal - or, more likely, returns with no-deal and has to set out his next steps. And we are hearing that No 10 may seek to seize the initiative by putting down a series of motions for MPs to vote on - in other words asking them do they want to leave with no deal, do they want to revoke Article 50, etc. But at the same time that Boris Johnson wants to use that moment to try and grasp the initiative, it is clear the rebel alliance of opposition MPs also wants to seize the day. They want to ensure Boris Johnson sits down, gets out the Basildon Bond and writes that letter to the European Commission asking for a further delay. So both sides are now poised to try and gain control of that Saturday to map out the next steps, assuming - and I think it is a fairly widespread assumption in Westminster now - that there is not going to be a deal.

""Unless/until they completely reverse their stance on this issue (which, unfortunately, doesn't seem likely) they will get no more money from me,"" wrote one Reddit user in a long thread about the boycott. The latest title in the hugely popular Call of Duty franchise has been well received by gamers, according to download statistics from Sensor Tower.

A PC and console title, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare, is due to be released on 25 October. Some social media users encouraged those who had pre-ordered the game to ask for refunds.

Hearthstone gamer banned for Hong Kong protest Hong Kong protest: City reels from 'one of its most violent days Activision Blizzard's share price had fallen by 2.3% by the close of trading on Tuesday. However, the backlash was unlikely to cause serious commercial problems for Activision Blizzard, said James Batchelor, UK Editor at GamesIndustry.biz. ""It's negative PR and that's never great for a company but I can't remember an instance where a consumer-led boycott has led to a significant drop in sales in the video games industry,"" he told the BBC. ""These games have such a vast audience that I would almost say almost half don't even know what's happening... The vast majority of Call of Duty players are so casual, so mainstream."" Seth Barton, editor of gaming industry magazine MCV, agreed that the boycott was unlikely to have a significant impact. Activision Blizzard didn't have much choice in the matter, he argued: ""by allowing any such protests it would have to either allow all such protests, or become arbiter of what's acceptable and what's not"". BBC News has contacted Activision Blizzard for comment. Ng Wai Chung is the name of the gamer banned for 12 months by Blizzard. He uses the pseudonym Blitzchung.

Northern California braced for mega power cut,"A huge wildfire killed 86 people in Paradise, California, last year A power company is cutting electricity to around 800,000 homes, businesses and other locations in Northern California, in an attempt to prevent wildfires. Large swathes of the San Francisco Bay Area - though not the city itself - have lost power, angering residents. The regionâs utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), has warned the shutdown could last several days. The company's transmission lines started the deadliest wildfire in Californiaâs history last year. With weather forecasts predicting high winds, the move is intended to prevent the risk of fallen power lines igniting more wildfires. ""The conditions are ripe: dry fuel, high winds, warm event. Any spark can create a significant event,"" said Ray Riordan, director of the Office of Emergency Management in San Jose, during a press conference on Tuesday. The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning for the Santa Cruz Mountains, North and East Bay regions until Thursday, warning that conditions could result in ""the strongest offshore wind event in the area since the October 2017 North Bay fires"". This video can not be played California braces for Santa Ana winds As of Wednesday morning, PG&E said around 500,000 customers were without power. Another 200,000 were scheduled to lose power by noon, local time, but the utility company has delayed further shutdowns until later in the afternoon due to changing weather conditions. The huge âCamp Fire"" in the town of Paradise last year burned 150,000 acres and left 86 people dead. An investigation determined that poorly maintained PG&E equipment was to blame for starting the historic blaze. The day Paradise burned down California fires 'can now happen any year' 'Losing everything has made me stronger' The firm was also blamed for deadly fires in 2017.Subsequent lawsuits led the publicly traded company to declare bankruptcy in 2019, a process that is still ongoing. PG&E is the sole provider of gas and electricity for much of Northern California, and so the vast majority of consumers in the region do not have an alternative source of power. This video can not be played Rebuilding Paradise: 'Our town is gone' âWe have experienced an unprecedented fire season the past two years,â said Tamar Sarkissian, a PG&E spokeswoman, speaking to BBC partner CBS News. ""And what we learned from that is that we need to be taking further steps to ensure the safety of our customers and the communities that we serve. Public safety power shut off is one of the many steps that we're taking."" PG&E has carried out several planned outages over the course of the past year, though none at the scale of what is scheduled this week. âNone of us are happy about it,â said California governor, Gavin Newsom. âBut this is part of something that we knew was likely to occur several months ago, when PG&E finally woke up to their responsibility to keep people safe.â The outages are expected to affect more than half of the state's counties. The warnings stretch north of the San Francisco Bay Area, in areas such as Napa and Sonoma, famed for wine-making. Further south, many cities synonymous with Silicon Valley giants could be affected, such as Cupertino, home to Apple. Local shops reported an influx of customers buying up supplies for a black out that could, if the weather remains adverse, last for several days. Experts are concerned gusty winds could produce the conditions for wildfires to ignite ""The idea of five days without electricity is devastating,â said Libby Schaaf, mayor of Oakland, but added: ""We fully expect that to be a worst-case scenario. This is our first time going through this.â But websites providing information about the cuts have buckled under heavy traffic loads. Many residents have taken to PG&Eâs social media channels to express their frustration. Snapshots from California 'apocalypse' town Volunteers fighting fires in California's 'forgotten canyon' ""This is ridiculous!â wrote Veronica Key. ""You wasted the money you should have been using on safety precautions to give dividends to your stockholders. Now you have to shut down our power like some sort of third world country. ""When you do shut down the power you canât even get your notification website to work properly! Get it together PG&E! No more rate increases to pay for your incompetence.â Allow Twitter content?

PG&E has opened 28 Community Resource Centers in the region to provide ârestrooms, bottled water and electronic-device chargingâ during daylight hours. Many schools in the area have told students to stay at home on Wednesday and await further information for the remainder of the week. Despite widespread frustration, local meteorologist Mike Pechner told CBS the move was warranted. ""It's not an overreaction at all. As the wind comes in, the wires, of course, oscillate back and forth. If they touch, they start a fire. ""[Cutting power] is taking downed wires and high winds out of the fire equation.""

Turkey v Syria's Kurds,"Syria's Kurds said they would defend their territory at all costs A deal between Turkey and Russia has brought an end to a Turkish military operation in north-eastern Syria against a Kurdish-led militia alliance previously allied to the United States. We've boiled down why it matters. Turkey considers the biggest militia in the Kurdish-led alliance a terrorist organisation. It says it is an extension of a Kurdish rebel group fighting in Turkey. On 9 October, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels launched an offensive to create a 30km (20-mile) deep ""safe zone"" along the Syrian side of the border. Turkey's president says its aim is to ""destroy the terror corridor formed on our southern border"" It came after the withdrawal of US troops, who had relied on the Kurds to defeat the Islamic State group. The Kurds asked Syria's government and its ally, Russia, to help stop the assault. Turkey and Russia subsequently agreed to take joint control of the border area. Turkey wants to push back from its border members of a Syrian Kurdish militia called the People's Protection Units (YPG). Turkish leaders view the YPG as a terrorist organisation. They say it is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The Syrian Democratic Forces alliance led the fight against the Islamic State group in Syria The YPG dominates an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which drove IS out of a quarter of Syria with the help of a US-led multinational coalition. When the US declared the defeat of IS in March, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan pushed it to create a ""safe zone"" clear of YPG fighters in north-eastern Syria where refugees could be resettled. The US agreed to establish one together with Turkey in August and the YPG complied. But two months later, US troops pulled back from the border after Mr Erdogan decided to launch an operation to create a 440km-long ""safe zone"" unilaterally. The SDF said it had been ""stabbed in the back"" by the US and warned the defeat of IS might be reversed. On 9 October, Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels attacked. Four days later, the SDF turned to the Syrian government and its backer, Russia, for help. They agreed to deploy Syrian soldiers to stop the advance. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Russia's Vladimir Putin agreed a deal to end the offensive The US negotiated a 5-day ceasefire on 17 October to allow YPG fighters to withdraw from a 120km-long stretch of the frontier from Ras al-Ain to Tal Abyad where the fighting was focused. Just before the ceasefire expired, Mr Erdogan reached a deal with Russian President Vladimir Putin. They agreed Turkey could keep its forces in the area between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad, and that Russian and Syrian troops would take control of the rest of the border. It feels threatened by the People's Protection Units (YPG), the military wing of the Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). The Turkish government insists the YPG is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey since 1984 and is designated as a terrorist group by the US and EU. The YPG and PKK share a similar ideology, but say they are separate entities. This is Turkey's third cross-border military operation against Syrian Kurdish-led forces The YPG is the dominant force in an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF). With the help of air strikes by a US-led multinational coalition against the jihadist group Islamic State (IS), SDF fighters captured tens of thousands of square kilometres of territory in north-eastern Syria between 2015 and 2019. The SDF set up an autonomous administration to govern the region, home to three million people. It avoided conflict with the Syrian government, but sought recognition for Kurdish autonomy. Despite being a member of Nato and the US-led coalition against IS, Turkey opposed the support the US gave the SDF. This video can not be played A young face destroyed by war: The impact of an air strike one year on In 2016, the Turkish military supported an offensive by allied Syrian rebel factions that drove IS militants out of the border area around Jarablus and stopped SDF fighters moving west, towards the Kurdish enclave of Afrin. In January 2018, after US officials said they were helping the SDF build a new ""border security force"" to prevent IS infiltration, Turkish-led forces launched an operation to expel YPG fighters from Afrin. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has long sought what he has called a ""safe zone"" clear of YPG fighters in north-east Syria. But the issue came to the fore after the SDF captured the last pocket of IS territory in Syria in March 2019. In August, the US and Turkey agreed to a ""security mechanism"" covering a predominantly Arab border area between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad. Turkish and US troops took part in joint patrols before the offensive US and Turkish troops carried out joint patrols and YPG began dismantling fortifications. But on 6 October, Mr Erdogan told US President Donald Trump that Turkey was about to start a unilateral operation to set up a ""safe zone"". Mr Trump ordered US troops to pull back from the area. At the start of ""Operation Peace Spring"" on 9 October, Mr Erdogan said Turkish troops and allied Syrian rebels aimed to ""neutralize terror threats against Turkey and lead to the establishment of a safe zone, facilitating the return of Syrian refugees to their homes"". SDF commanders warned that a Turkish offensive would ""spill the blood of thousands of innocent civilians"" and might pave the way for the return of IS. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, said 120 civilians were killed, along with 275 SDF fighters, 196 Turkish-backed Syrian rebels, 10 Turkish soldiers, and five Syrian soldiers. Dozens of civilians and combatants were killed in the first week of the assault President Erdogan said 775 ""terrorists"" had been ""neutralised"" and that 79 Syrian rebels and seven Turkish soldiers had been killed. He denied any civilians had been killed in Syria but said 20 had died in YPG attacks on Turkey. The UN said at least 176,000 people had been displaced by the fighting and that critical civilian infrastructure had been damaged. After four days of fighting, the US began a full withdrawal from northern Syria and the Kurds agreed a deal with Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's government for the Syrian army to deploy along the northern border for the first time in years to confront the Turkish-led forces. Russia, Mr Assad's staunch ally, sent military police to key locations. On 17 October, the US persuaded Mr Erdogan to ""pause"" Turkey's offensive to allow it to ""facilitate the withdrawal of YPG forces from the Turkish-controlled safe zone"". The ceasefire largely held and on 22 October the head of the SDF said the withdrawal had been completed. Residents of the town of Tal Tamer welcomed the arrival of the Syrian army That same day, Mr Erdogan and Russian President Vladimir Putin announced a plan to end the offensive. They agreed: Turkish forces would be allowed to remain in the 120km-long strip of territory they had captured between Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad Russian and Syrian troops would take control of the rest of the border area and ensure YPG fighters pulled back 30km from the border Turkish and Russian troops would start joint patrols inside a 10km-deep zone along the border on 29 October There are questions about the deal, such as how long the Turkish forces can stay and what will happen to the tens of thousands of people being detained by the SDF on suspicion of links to IS. But there is no doubt it has cemented Russia's role as the pivotal player in Syria.

Deal by deadline 'very difficult',"This video can not be played Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he wants a deal ""but not at any cost"" It will be ""very difficult"" for the UK and the EU to reach a Brexit agreement before the 31 October deadline, Irish leader Leo Varadkar has said. He toldIrish broadcaster RTE,external""big gaps"" remained between the two sides. Amid claims on Tuesday that talks were close to collapse, he also suggested the language around the discussions had turned toxic ""in some quarters"". Mr Varadkar and Boris Johnson are expected to meet for further Brexit talks later this week. The UK has said the EU needs to ""move quickly"" to stop it leaving without an agreement at the end of the month. The end for negotiations in Brussels? Brexit deal essentially impossible - No 10 source How could a no-deal Brexit happen? Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who spoke with Mr Johnson by phone for about 45 minutes on Tuesday, said he would strive until the ""last moment"" to reach a deal with the UK, but ""not at any cost"" to his country, Northern Ireland and the rest of Europe. He also downplayed the chances of any agreement being struck before the crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, during which next steps for Brexit are likely to be decided. This video can not be played A new Brexit deal is possible but cannot come at any cost, says Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney ""I think it's going to be very difficult to secure an agreement by next week, quite frankly,"" Mr Varadkar said. ""Essentially, what the UK has done is repudiated the deal that we negotiated in good faith with prime minister [Theresa] May's government over two years and have sort of put half of that now back on the table, and are saying that's a concession. And of course it isn't really."" Mr Varadkar added that it was his job to hold the UK to commitments it had made since the 2016 referendum to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and uphold the Good Friday Agreement. Irish PM: I'll work flat out for a deal Kuenssberg: Is no-deal about to become PM's policy? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame game The Irish leader's comments came after a No 10 source claimed on Tuesday that Germany was now making it""essentially impossible"" for the UK to leave the EU with a deal. That assessment followed a ""frank"" phone call between Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, during which they discussed Brexit proposals the UK prime minister put forward last week to the EU. After the call, a No 10 source said Mrs Merkel had made clear a deal based on the prime minister's plans was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"" - though the BBC's Adam Fleming said there was ""scepticism"" within the EU that she would have used such language. The No 10 source also suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods. This, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal ""essentially impossible"". Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson spoke on the phone on Tuesday morning In response, the EU's top official, European Council President Donald Tusk, accused Mr Johnson of engaging in a ""stupid blame game"". In atweet to the prime minister,external, he added: ""At stake is the future of Europe and the UK, as well as the security and interests of our people. ""You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis (where are you going)?"" European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that if negotiations fail, ""the explanation will be found in the British camp (because) the original sin is found on the islands and not on the continent"". Speaking to the French Les Echos newspaper, he added: ""A no-deal Brexit would lead to a collapse of the United Kingdom and a weakening of growth on the continent."" In his interview with RTE, Mr Varadkar was asked whether he was concerned the language around the talks was ""getting toxic"". ""I think it is, from some quarters, but you know I don't play dirty. You know, I don't think most EU leaders do either. We've been very straight up from when the referendum happened."" The prime minister also hosted European Parliament president David Sassoli in Downing Street on Tuesday, but the MEP left saying ""no progress"" had been made. Mr Sassoli later told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Angela Merkel's opinions must be taken seriously. We are all very worried because there are only a few days left. ""Because we understand that going out without an agreement leads to having a real problem, if not a real catastrophe."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Following the meeting, Downing Street said there was ""little time"" left to negotiate a new legally-binding withdrawal agreement, but Mr Johnson remained committed to doing all he could. ""We need to move quickly and work together to agree a deal,"" a No 10 spokesman said. ""He [the prime minister] reiterated that if we did not reach an agreement then the UK will leave without a deal on 31 October."" The PM's pledge comes despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. While negotiations are continuing in Brussels, Mr Sassoli said a deal likely to command the support of MEPs was a ""long way off"". Meanwhile,19 Labour MPs have written to the European Commission president Mr Junker,externalcalling for a Brexit deal to be made with the government without any further delay. Caroline Flint, who represents the leave-supporting constituency of Don Valley, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""uncertainty of Brexit has gone on too long"" and the group did not think it was ""impossible"" to resolve the Irish border issue. Tuesday 8 October- The House of Commons was prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

The end for negotiations in Brussels?,"Donald Tusk lost his cool with Boris Johnson on Twitter The EU has tried very, very hard throughout this Brexit process to present a cool, calm, united front while political volatility reigns in the UK. ""They want to come across as the adults in the room,"" one Spanish journalist put it to me. But sometimes the EU's distant, business-like veneer noticeably cracks. There are a few memorable examples: President Macron describing Brexiteers who promised the UK a better life outside the EU as liars; Luxembourg's prime minister recently pouring out in public the frustrations with the Brexit process felt privately by many in the EU; and now, on Tuesday, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk,responding angrily to Downing Street,externalfinger-pointing about the state of Brexit renegotiations by addressing this tweet directly to the prime minister. Mr Tusk's flash of emotion did not go down well in European government circles at this sensitive juncture, as the EU leaders summit and the 31 October Brexit deadline fast approach. The EU wants a deal and, if negotiations fail, it wants voters across the EU to believe that Brussels did its best - staying focussed on the facts at the negotiating table, rather than getting involved in cross-Channel mud-slinging. And bang on cue, not long after Mr Tusk's blame game outburst, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator tweeted that ""efforts continue to find an agreement with the UK"". Is no-deal about to become the PM's policy? What will happen with Brexit in the next four weeks? But no-one I speak to in the EU is holding his or her breath. ""We have no idea where the UK government wants to go in the next 20 days,"" (ie before the 31 October Brexit deadline) a diplomat from northern Europe told me. He said the EU was still unclear how high getting a Brexit deal featured right now on the prime minister's list of priorities - compared, for example, with winning a general election. The EU is unclear on what the prime minister's priorities are So is the search for a deal now over in EU eyes? Not really. The EU says it's still open for talks. It hasn't entirely ruled out the possibility of a deal by the end of this month. Realistically though the prime minister's proposals on how to replace the Irish backstop in a Brexit deal are hugely problematic for Brussels. How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame Academy While diplomats praise some aspects of Boris Johnson's offer, his insistence that Northern Ireland remains in the UK's customs territory after Brexit leaves the EU with unpalatable choices: Either a) having customs infrastructure on the island of Ireland, which Dublin says is a no no. or b) the EU not controlling its customs border which Brussels says would both lead to smuggling and contravene WTO regulations. One high-level EU diplomat joked: ""If that customs border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were left open, as the UK pretty much asks, then I would quit my job and start a smuggling enterprise. Far more lucrative."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But the EU isn't laughing. Or playing politics, insists Brussels. It says its objections to Boris Johnson's customs proposals are practical, not political. EU technocrats maintain that leaving a post-Brexit customs border open on the island of Ireland would compromise food safety and the safety of children's toys, for example. They warn that any accident or contamination would affect the whole single market plus the EU's reputation amongst other trading partners. ""We won't do that,"" said a diplomat from a country traditionally close to the UK. ""We can't risk that."" What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Divisions continue over opposition Brexit strategy And if the EU did take that risk, then diplomats warn that Dublin would pay the price. Goods entering the single market via Ireland would be regarded with suspicion, they say, and the free movement of goods in the single market would be seriously compromised. EU sources insist that whatever the Johnson government threatens or however it cajoles,  the EU ""can't be bullied"" into accepting the prime minister's proposals as they stand. ""It would be easier if this discussion were about money,"" a European civil servant told me. ""Then both sides could haggle and reach agreement but there's no compromising over food safety."" This video can not be played What could Brexit mean for sausage rolls? EU diplomats say they accept the principle of two customs systems (EU and UK) on the island of Ireland but that it has to work. EU leaders still look to the UK to be more flexible in its demands. Though they hear Boris Johnson when he says Northern Ireland must remain in the UK's customs union to preserve UK unity. As always when it comes to the backstop, Ireland has a big role to play here too. What could no deal mean for the Irish border? 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Since the EU won't compromise the single market, EU diplomats say Brussels will take its cue from Dublin as to how many checks/controls it could stomach on the island of Ireland. The EU attitude here is: ""What's ok for Dublin, works for the rest of us"". But the Johnson government has expressed frustration with the Irish government. Their belief is that Dublin is ""holding out"" on making compromises since they believe a new Brexit extension is around the corner. And that is exactly what the EU thinks. Though no-one I speak to is starry-eyed about the possibility of having more time to talk.

Teaching assistant cuts 'heartbreaking' for pupils,"This video can not be played Teaching assistants ""invaluable to schools"" Cutting the numbers of teaching assistants has had a ""heartbreaking"" impact on pupils, a primary school head teacher has said. There are almost 1,400 fewer support staff working in Welsh primary schools compared with four years ago. Jane Jenkins, head of Moorland primary in Cardiff, said she had to axe three out of 30 such posts with budget cuts. The Welsh Government said it was making ""the biggest single investment"" in the school workforce since 1999. Data from the annual school census shows there has been a 7.5% cut to primary school support staff from 18,655 in 2014-15 to 17,261 in 2018-19. That includes the loss of more than 1,000 standard teaching assistants (TAs) and 300 special needs support staff, although there was an increase in the number of higher level teaching assistants from 1,128 to 1,435. Teachers in Wales set for 2.75% pay rise School uniforms to be cheaper and gender neutral Male teaching assistants 'stereotyped' Head teacher Jane Jenkins says a ""generation of children has been let down by the system"" Jane Jenkins toldBBC Wales Livethat losing teaching assistants meant less one-to-one support for pupils for things like speech and language help. ""This generation of children has been let down by the system,"" she said. ""It's absolutely heartbreaking to think the interventions and support we were giving in the school 12 months ago, we're no longer able to deliver."" The adult to pupil ratio in her reception class has increased from 1:10 to 1:12, and she fears she will have to make further staff cuts. ""I'm really concerned about the future, I'm already dreading next year's budget,"" she said. ""I've been a head since 1997 and I've never known a budget settlement like the one we had this year."" Rob Williams, from the National Association of Head Teachers Cymru, said recruiting and retaining important staff had become an ""intractable"" problem for schools. ""We know that schools are having to reduce the number of teaching assistants they have, or the number of hours TAs are contracted to work, because their budgets are at breaking point,"" he said. ""It is obvious that until we address this combination of factors, and return to a situation where taking a job in a school is an enjoyable, manageable and decently paid career choice, the young people of Wales will always be losing out on their right to a decent education."" In April, independent research found that school funding in Wales hadfallen by Â£500 per pupil over ten years. And anassembly committee concluded there was not enough money,externalgoing into the education system. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""In July this year we published theProfessional Standards for Assisting Teaching,externalto support all teaching assistants with their development and progression. ""We are also delivering the biggest ever investment of Â£24m in teachers' professional learning and a proposed additional inset day to give staff more time for training. ""Teaching assistants, head teachers, regional consortia and other key partners tested and contributed to the standards, which reflect the importance of collaboration for a highly-skilled, well-supported teaching community.""

Coastal towns 'forgotten' after industries failed,"This video can not be played The Coram family say low wages make daily life a struggle in Penzance Workers living in seaside areas in Great Britain earn on average Â£1,600 less per year than those living inland, BBC News analysis has found. The research also found two-thirds of coastal areas had seen a real terms fall in wages since 2010. The All Parliamentary Group for Coastal Communities said the findings showed seaside towns were ""being left behind"". But the government said its Â£200m Coastal Communities Fund was changing lives. This week BBC News is profiling what life is like in seaside communities across the country as part of the Coastal Britain project. The most deprived places in England are found by the sea, according to government figures. Young workers such as Danny (second left), Tamia (second right) and Jack (far right) say low wages in Penzance are a real problem In Penzance in Cornwall young workers said they were struggling to find well paid, long-term employment by the coast. ""I love Penzance but I'm also sick of it,"" said 18-year-old Danny Hammond, who works as a waiter in a local restaurant. ""I earn Â£6.30 an hour, which isn't great and people older than me really struggle to pay the rent or the mortgage."" Tamia Mallam said she could not see many long-term career prospects in Penzance Tamia Mallam, 20, said many people she knew struggled in seasonal jobs connected with the tourism industry. ""When I worked In St Ives, between May and September there was lots of work because of the summer season, but then you'll be told suddenly that you're going to be unemployed. That is really tough,"" she said. ""There aren't many prospects for a career around here. It's a choice of working either in a boring retail job or as waitress."" Trainee carpenter Jack Slater was more optimistic about his future job prospects. ""Lots of my friends have moved away from Penzance to look for better paid jobs and that's why I want to get myself a trade,"" the 18-year-old said. ""I want to stay in Cornwall because it's beautiful and this is my home, and they're always building new homes round here which should mean I'll always have work."" The issue of low pay affects coastal communities across the whole country. BBC News has analysedincome data collected by the Office for National Statistics,externalfor 632 parliamentary in England, Scotland and Wales. Comparable data for Northern Ireland is not avaialble. Taking into account full and part time workers the analysis found: In coastal constituencies, the typical (median) worker in 2018 earned Â£22,104 before tax That was Â£1,681 less than the typical worker in a non-coastal area, who earned Â£23,785 before tax When inflation was taken into account annual wages fell in two-thirds of constituencies between 2010 and 2018, a ""real terms"" decrease The coastal constituencies of Wirral West and Weston-Super-Mare have seen real terms wages fall by around 25% since 2010 Low wages tended to be prevalent in coastal areas because a higher proportion of people worked in low skilled, low paid seasonal jobs. A major report published by the House of Lords,externalearlier this year said seaside towns had for too long been reliant on tourism to drive their local economies. Seaside areas named England's most deprived The seaside towns where the young might disappear Seaside towns 'desperate for reinvention' Mike Hill MP, chair of the all Parliamentary Group for Coastal Communities, said ""for a long time coastal communities have felt forgotten"". ""Many of these areas have lost industries like shipbuilding that once provided thousands of well paid jobs,"" he said. ""There's research that shows that without major changes, by 2030 places like my own constituency of Hartlepool could see lots of young people leave coastal areas, which underlines why we need the right investment to protect the long term future of our coastal towns."" At its party conference in September,Labour promised to build 37 offshore wind farms, which it claimed would generate more than 60,000 new well paid jobs in coastal areas. People who live by the coast are among the lowest paid in the country The government said since 2012 its dedicatedCoastal Communities Fund,externalhad invested more than Â£200m in seaside areas, while more than a quarter of the 100 towns initially selected to share its Â£3.6bn Stronger Towns Fund were on the coast. Jake Berry, minister for the Northern Powerhouse and Local Growth, said these initiatives had begun to transform people's lives. ""For years government has only talked about creating growth in our cities.

Lithium-ion batteries take chemistry NobelThree scientists have been awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of lithium-ion batteries.,"(L-R) John B Goodenough, M Stanley Whittingham, Akira Yoshino Three scientists have been awarded the 2019 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of lithium-ion batteries. John B Goodenough, M Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino share the prize for their work on these rechargeable devices, which are used for portable electronics. At the age of 97, Prof Goodenough is the oldest ever Nobel laureate. Professor of chemistry Olof RamstrÃ¶m said lithium-ion batteries had ""enabled the mobile world"". The trio will share the prize money of nine million kronor (Â£738,000). The lithium-ion battery is a lightweight, rechargeable and powerful battery that is used in everything from mobile phones to laptops to electric cars. The Nobel Committee said: ""Lithium-ion batteries are used globally to power the portable electronics that we use to communicate, work, study, listen to music and search for knowledge."" Planets and Big Bang win Nobel physics prize How our cells sense oxygen wins Nobel prize This video can not be played How do you they pick a Nobel prize winner? Committee member Sara Snogerup Linse, from Lund University, said: ""We have gained access to a technical revolution. The laureates developed lightweight batteries of high enough potential to be useful in many applications."" In addition to their use in electric vehicles, the rechargeable devices could also store significant amounts of energy from renewable sources, such as solar and wind power. Speaking at an event held at the UK's Royal Society, where he had already been scheduled to receive the society's Copley Medal honouring his work, Prof Goodenough said: ""I didn't ever lobby for or look forward to this particular day, but I'm very happy it arrived."" The foundation of the lithium-ion battery was laid during the oil crisis of the 1970s. M Stanley Whittingham, 77, who was born in Nottingham, UK, worked to develop energy technologies that did not rely on fossil fuels. He discovered an energy-rich material called titanium disulphide, which he used to make a cathode - the positive terminal - in a lithium battery. Whittingham, who is now based atBinghamton University in Vestal, US,external, made the anode, the battery's negative terminal, from metallic lithium. This has a strong preference for releasing electrons, making it very suitable for use in batteries. The lithium-ion battery ""enabled the mobile world"" This resulting device was able to release just over two volts, but the metallic lithium made it explosive. John B Goodenough, who is American but was born in Germany, predicted that the cathode could be improved if it was made from a metal oxide, rather than a sulphide. In 1980, after searching for the ideal material, Goodenough, who is a professor at theUniversity of Texas, Austin,external, used cobalt oxide to boost the lithium battery's potential to four volts. With Goodenough's cathode as a basis, Akira Yoshino, 71, created the first commercially viable lithium-ion battery in 1985. Yoshino, who was born in Osaka, Japan, works for theAsahi Kasei Corporation,externalandMeijo University,external. Sony released the first commercial lithium-ion batteries in 1991, based on Yoshino's configuration. Prof Goodenough was in the UK to receive the Royal Society's Copley Medal Prof RamstrÃ¶m, a Nobel committee member from the University of Massachusetts, Lowell, in the US, commented: ""This battery is such a very, very good battery. It's high-powered with high energy efficiency, so it has found applications almost everywhere."" Prof Dame Carol Robinson, president of the UK's Royal Society of Chemistry, said of the laureates: ""Their pioneering research is everywhere you look and a great example of how chemistry has paved the way for everything from the mobile phone in your pocket to the electric vehicles and home energy storage of the future."" Bonnie Charpentier, president of the American Chemical Society (ACS), commented: ""In the face of increasing threats from extreme climate change, today's announcement shines a welcome bright light on the portability of energy that has enabled unprecedented advances in communication, transportation and other tools to support critical aspects of life around the world."" Prof Sir Venki Ramakrishnan, president of the Royal Society, said: ""Scientific breakthroughs are rarely - if ever - a solo endeavour and it is absolutely fitting that this year's Nobel Prize for Chemistry should be shared in this way.""

UK fast food âlinked to Brazilian forest firesâ,"Some 2.5 million tonnes of soya beans are shipped to the UK each year Some of the UK's largest fast-food chains have been selling meat from animals fed on soya beans linked to Brazil's forest fires, campaigners say. Some Â£240m of its soya was shipped to the UK in 2018, EU trade figures show. Greenpeace said it wanted the companies to stop using soya from Brazil in their supply chains until the environment was better protected. Brazil's environment minister told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme any boycott could make the situation worse. This video can not be played Brazil's highly biodiverse Cerrado is being destroyed for soybean production, conservationists say Some 2.5 million tonnes of soya is imported into the UK each year, with a large proportion used to feed farm animals. In 2018, about a third of these - 761,739 tonnes - came from Brazil, BBC News analysis of the EU figures showed. And just 14% of total soya imports are certified ""deforestation free,"" according to the Sustainable Trade Initiative - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Greenpeace head of forests Richard George said: ""All of the big fast-food companies use soya in animal feed, none of them know where it comes from and soya is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation worldwide."" Traders have agreed not to buy from farms linked to recent deforestation Environmental campaigners claim ongoing fires in both the Amazon and Cerrado regions of Brazil are being lit deliberately to clear land for raising animals and growing crops. In 2019, the total number of firessurpassed 144,000, a 50% rise on the same period in 2018 - but far fewer than in 2010. In 2006, Greenpeace and other environmental groups negotiated landmark restrictions on new soya cultivation in the Amazon, with huge agricultural traders agreeing not to buy from farms linked to recent deforestation. But campaigners say that has pushed much of the problem south to the Cerrado, a vast tropical savanna where the natural habitat is less well protected. Brazil's National Institute for Space Research recorded 19,925 fires there in September, significantly higher than the number in the Amazon. In October 2017, 23 brands, including McDonald's, Tesco and Marks & Spencer, signed the Cerrado Manifesto, which recognised the need to prevent further deforestation. But the agricultural trader Cargill, which acts as a middleman between farmers and food companies, has yet to sign up. It is the largest importer to the UK, shipping 78% of the soya from Brazil in 2017, according to data from Trase.Earth, a partnership of non-governmental organisations. Although, Cargill told BBC News that figure was ""not accurate and significantly inflated"". In July, Cargill told its Brazilian suppliers it would not support a temporary ban on soya grown on newly deforested land in the Cerrado - which has left environmental groups fuming. ""We remain committed to the soy moratorium in the Amazon but we believe that is not the right solution for the Cerrado,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Asking companies to exit won't solve the problem - it will simply move it. By pushing farmers to other buyers, the same practices will continue."" It has pledged $30m (Â£24m) to fund new ideas for ending deforestation. A new analysis of satellite data by the Rapid Response project, seen by BBC News, suggests Cargill has been buying soya directly from farms in the region of the Cerrado responsible for forest fires. The project is a partnership between three groups, Aidenvironment, MapHubs and Mighty Earth. On one farm, it says, 837 hectares (3.2 sq miles) of wooded savannah was cleared between April and June 2019 and fires were detected by the satellite imagery on 23 August. It is impossible to say if crop from that specific farm was exported but trade data shows 7,103 tonnes of soya beans were shipped from the same municipality, Formosa Do Rio Preto, to the UK in 2017, the majority by Cargill. Cargill accepts it does buy soya from the farm in question but says the farm met all compliance criteria and was not on the Brazilian government's embargoed list. ""As soon as we received an inquiry regarding potential non-compliance... we initiated our grievance process and an investigation is currently under way,"" a spokeswoman for the company told BBC News. ""We will take immediate action if illegal activity is found."" Environmental groups have been trying to increase the pressure on western retailers. Tesco, Sainsbury and M&S have all pledged to achieve zero deforestation in their supply chains by 2020, although it is accepted that target is almost certain to be missed. Environmental groups say the fast food sector is a particular concern - Burger King and KFC source some chicken directly from Brazil. Along with chains such as McDonald's, Nando's, Pret a Manger and Five Guys they also sell British meat reared, at least in part, on soya shipped from the regions. The proportion of animal feed made up of soya can vary dramatically between suppliers and farms in the UK, with some using a diet of grass and grain instead. McDonald's says it is working to determine the level of deforestation risk in specific parts of the Cerrado and assessing whether fires are being lit at an individual farm level. Other retailers and fast-food outlets, including Waitrose and Nando's, buy financial credits designed to offset the deforestation risk. Mr George said: ""This may sound persuasive but the actual soya they use may still come from farms that are destroying forests."" Burger King has been particularly criticised after pledging to end deforestation in its supply chains by 2030, a target criticised as ""embarrassingly weak"". The company told BBC News it had written to its meat suppliers to remind them of its policy of not accepting products raised on former rainforest land. It says its beef suppliers in the UK use soya as a minor food additive only. A spokeswoman said: ""We are aware that in some of our beef, there are trace amounts of soya in the feed. We are also aware that there is no traceability programme in place anywhere in the world that can currently track all soy beans to a single farm in a single country."" Soya based foods like soya milk, tofu and meat replacement products are also made from soya beans, but the companies tend to be smaller in scale and more able to trace their supply chain. The Vegan Society said: ""The use of Amazonian soya in vegan food manufacturing is fairly insignificant, given that most brands source from Europe, and up to 91% of deforestation in the rainforest comes directly from animal agriculture. Farmed animals eat far more soya than we would if we ate it directly, therefore wasting resources and harming the environment."" The Brazilian government has faced intense criticism for policies environmentalists believe have encouraged the fires. But Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told the Victoria Derbyshire programme pressure to shun Brazilian soya would be counterproductive. ""We need sustainable economic development... and boycotts or behaviours like this will only make things even worse,"" he said.

Man wins $8bn court case over breast growthA US jury finds Johnson & Johnson guilty of negligence over an anti-psychotic drug.Business,"US drug firm Johnson & Johnson has been told to pay $8bn (Â£6.6bn) in punitive damages to a man over claims he was not warned that an anti-psychotic drug could lead to breast growth. A Philadelphia jury made the award to Nicholas Murray, 26, whose case was one of thousands pending in the state. His lawyers argued J&J's subsidiary Janssen put ""profits over patients"" in marketing the drug Risperdal. J&J will appeal the ruling, which it said was ""grossly disproportionate"". Professor Carl Tobias of the University of Richmond School of Law said he expected the large damages award to be lowered on appeal. ""A jury, if it's outrageous enough conduct, will award a big number and let the lawyers and judges work it out,"" he said. However, Prof Tobias said the jury's verdict could mean the firm faces more large damages awards in other Risperdal cases. ""The kind of evidence in this trial may persuade another jury or judge to do something similar,"" he said. The company is facing a series of complaints in the US for allegedly failing to properly warn of Risperdal's side effects. The US giant is also facing court challenges over vaginal mesh implants and baby powder allegedly tainted with asbestos. Those cases are in addition to an ongoing legal battle over its role in the US opioid addiction crisis. Johnson & Johnson reaches settlement with Ohio over opioid crisis In numbers: the US opioid crisis Johnson & Johnson shares drop after asbestos report In August, Johnson & Johnson was ordered to pay $572m after a judge in Oklahoma ruled that the company contributed to an opioid epidemic in the state by running a ""false and dangerous"" sales campaign. The firm said it will appeal. More recently, it agreed a $20.4m settlement with two counties in Ohio ahead of a trial about the opioid crisis, scheduled to take place later this month. In the Risperdal lawsuit, Mr Murray said he developed breasts after his doctors prescribed the drug in 2003 when they diagnosed him with autism spectrum disorder. Risperdal is approved for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, but doctors can legally prescribe medicine for any condition they see fit. The company said it is confident the ruling will be overturned, and said the court prevented their legal team from presenting ""key evidence"" on the drug's labelling. A jury in 2015 awarded Mr Murray $1.75m after finding the company was negligent in failing to warn consumers of the risks. A state appeals court upheld the verdict in last year, but reduced it to $680,000.

Thomas Cook's 555 shops to be bought by rival,"John and Irene Hays run the business, set up 40 years ago All 555 Thomas Cook shops are to be bought by rival Hays Travel in a move that could save up to 2,500 jobs. The independent travel agent said the move gives it shops in areas where it had little or no presence, including Scotland and Wales. John Hays, who set up the Sunderland-based firm 40 years ago, said he hoped the shops would reopen within days. It had been an emotional day, he said, with many staff crying when they were told their jobs were saved. He said it was difficult to give cast-iron guarantees about every Thomas Cook shop, because there would now be talks with individual landlords. However, ""it is certainly our intention to take on all the staff; to welcome them back,"" he added. The shops will be branded under the Hays name. All the Thomas Cook stores will be rebranded as Hays Travel There is likely to be some overlap of stores, and the BBC estimates that there are more than 30 locations where there would be two competing High Street branches. In Yorkshire and the North East, for instance, there are branches just streets apart in Sunderland, Newcastle, York, Leeds, Doncaster, and at Morpeth, South Shields. Who are the family buying Thomas Cook shops? The acquisition, for an undisclosed sum, is a significant step for Hays, which has 190 shops, 1,900 staff, and last year had sales of Â£379m, reporting profits of Â£10m. Mr Hays, who owns the business with wife Irene, said: ""It is a game-changer for us, almost trebling the number of shops we have and doubling our workforce - and for the industry, which will get to keep some of its most talented people."" The takeover deal was struck with the travel industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, after several days of negotiations. He said he was ""elated to get the deal over the line. It's been emotional"". Many ex-Thomas Cook staff had cried when told they still had jobs, he said. ""These people did nothing wrong. One day they were in jobs, and the next day they were locked out."" He expected many of the shops to reopen on Thursday, ""although probably with a skeleton staff"". There were some logistics problems - Hays had still to locate many of the shop keys, he said. More than 100 new jobs will be based at the company's Sunderland headquarters, with the rest in shops across the UK. The company has tweeted, urging former Thomas Cook staff to apply.

When Thomas Cook collapsed, it put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, including 9,000 in the UK. It also sparked the biggest ever peacetime repatriation by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to bring more than 150,000 British holidaymakers back to the UK. The last flight to repatriate Thomas Cook customers landed at Manchester Airport on Monday. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she hoped the deal ""will provide significant re-employment opportunities for former Thomas Cook employees, alongside the advice and support we will continue to provide to help people find a new job as quickly as possible"".

Samantha Kennedy, 34, from Alness in Scotland worked at an Inverness branch of Thomas Cook for six years. She told the BBC that her WhatsApp chat group had been ""going crazy this morning since the media started reporting"" the deal. ""We've not been told anything. My manager hasn't been told anything. It would be absolutely amazing if it was true,"" she said. Samantha said she was sad the Thomas Cook brand had gone, but she loved working in the industry. ""To continue to work in the industry would be amazing and there's not many travel shops in Inverness, so if Hays were to take over I think people would be pleased."" The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association  (TSSA) union, which had members in Thomas Cook shops around the UK and in its head office in Peterborough, welcomed the move. Manuel Cortes, TSSA's general secretary,  said it offered ""real hope of reemployment to former Thomas Cook retail staff, many of whom are our members."" The business is thought to have a licence for six months to occupy Thomas Cook stores, giving Hays time to strike new deals with landlords. Ian Bell, head of travel and tourism at accountancy firm RSM, said it was a ""shrewd move"" for Hays, but would also represent a quadrupling of its travel agency stores at a time when customers are increasingly booking holidays online. ""Much may depend on the deals that Hays can strike with its new High Street landlords,"" said Mr Bell. As Hays bought the stores from the administrators, it means it will have bought them at a lower price than if Thomas Cook was still trading. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said that in waiting, Hays had got a ""best price"" for the stores. Thomas Cook collapses as last-ditch rescue talks fail Thomas Cook passenger: 'I'm stuck in Tunisia' However, she questioned the logic for the transaction at a time when customers are turning away from High Street travel agents. ""You have to wonder what Hays' plan is and how they can make it a success. ""Has the travel firm been gung-ho in trying to secure a cheap deal without assessing the viability of taking on these stores?,"" she asked. Hays Travel is not like Thomas Cook, which owned hotels and an airline. Pippa Jacks, group editor of Travel Trade Gazette, told the BBC: ""They don't have a [large] tour operating arm, they don't have an airline, they don't own hotels or cruise shipsâ¦ so it makes them quite nimble in terms of what they sell"". Hays is said to have beaten off other bidders, which she said suggested that the package holiday industry was not dead. ""If you're spending a lot of money, if you're not particularly confident and you want some personal recommendations, actually going to see a real human who will sit and listen and take time to understand your personal requirements is very valued by a lot of holidaymakers,"" she said.

Retail giant Amazon facing eviction threat,"About 300 people work at Amazon's centre in Gourock Amazon has said it will fight a court's decision to uphold an eviction notice from its landlord at a distribution warehouse in Inverclyde. The site is owned by the M7 property investment firm which gave the online giant six months' notice to quit in February. Amazon challenged the move at the Court of Session, arguing it was entitled to a year's notice. But the courts backed M7, though the US firm has said it will appeal again. About 300 people work at the Gourock site and Amazon says it remains ""business as usual"" for them and customers. Insiders have told BBC Scotland the court battle is a high-stakes negotiation on rent. Amazon operated its ""fulfilment centre'"" with a 15-year lease running out in August this year. It was previously owned by Scottish Enterprise, the government agency, and it is claimed the rent is as much as 60% below the market rate. Last February, the current owner M7 Real Estate gave Amazon six months' notice to quit. Amazon responded that it was entitled to a year's notice. Taking its case to the Court of Session, Amazon lost with a ruling that the six-month notice period was fair and legal. M7 is seeking not only to evict Amazon but it also wants damages from the retailer for remaining on the site since August. However, that issue has been postponed to a future sitting of the Court of Session. Behind the eviction notice and court action is a highly unusual rent negotiation. London-based M7 Real Estate owns 800 industrial assets in 13 countries on behalf of its investors, with a fund worth more than Â£4bn. It believes its action was the only way to get Amazon to respond to its demand for a rent increase, and those discussions are now under way. Retail chains have been putting immense pressure on commercial landlords to lower rents. Although Amazon relies on a different type of commercial property, it is known for its muscular use of bargaining power. But the property investor is warning that there are no other similar sites in central Scotland to which Amazon could move at short notice. In other words, M7 also has leverage in these negotiations. An Amazon spokeswoman said: ""It's business as usual for our customers and associates and we will be appealing the court decision."" John Murnaghan, head of UK and Ireland real estate for M7, said: ""We're here to engage constructively and proactively with Amazon over this lease. However, we need to ensure we're getting fair value for our investors.""

Deal by Brexit deadline very difficult - Irish PM,"This video can not be played Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar says he wants a deal ""but not at any cost"" It will be ""very difficult"" for the UK and the EU to reach a Brexit agreement before the 31 October deadline, Irish leader Leo Varadkar has said. He toldIrish broadcaster RTE,external""big gaps"" remained between the two sides. Amid claims on Tuesday that talks were close to collapse, he also suggested the language around the discussions had turned toxic ""in some quarters"". Mr Varadkar and Boris Johnson are expected to meet for further Brexit talks later this week. The UK has said the EU needs to ""move quickly"" to stop it leaving without an agreement at the end of the month. The end for negotiations in Brussels? Brexit deal essentially impossible - No 10 source How could a no-deal Brexit happen? Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, who spoke with Mr Johnson by phone for about 45 minutes on Tuesday, said he would strive until the ""last moment"" to reach a deal with the UK, but ""not at any cost"" to his country, Northern Ireland and the rest of Europe. He also downplayed the chances of any agreement being struck before the crucial summit of EU leaders on 17 October, during which next steps for Brexit are likely to be decided. This video can not be played A new Brexit deal is possible but cannot come at any cost, says Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney ""I think it's going to be very difficult to secure an agreement by next week, quite frankly,"" Mr Varadkar said. ""Essentially, what the UK has done is repudiated the deal that we negotiated in good faith with prime minister [Theresa] May's government over two years and have sort of put half of that now back on the table, and are saying that's a concession. And of course it isn't really."" Mr Varadkar added that it was his job to hold the UK to commitments it had made since the 2016 referendum to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland and uphold the Good Friday Agreement. Irish PM: I'll work flat out for a deal Kuenssberg: Is no-deal about to become PM's policy? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame game The Irish leader's comments came after a No 10 source claimed on Tuesday that Germany was now making it""essentially impossible"" for the UK to leave the EU with a deal. That assessment followed a ""frank"" phone call between Boris Johnson and German Chancellor Angela Merkel, during which they discussed Brexit proposals the UK prime minister put forward last week to the EU. After the call, a No 10 source said Mrs Merkel had made clear a deal based on the prime minister's plans was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"" - though the BBC's Adam Fleming said there was ""scepticism"" within the EU that she would have used such language. The No 10 source also suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods. This, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal ""essentially impossible"". Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson spoke on the phone on Tuesday morning In response, the EU's top official, European Council President Donald Tusk, accused Mr Johnson of engaging in a ""stupid blame game"". In atweet to the prime minister,external, he added: ""At stake is the future of Europe and the UK, as well as the security and interests of our people. ""You don't want a deal, you don't want an extension, you don't want to revoke, quo vadis (where are you going)?"" European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker said that if negotiations fail, ""the explanation will be found in the British camp (because) the original sin is found on the islands and not on the continent"". Speaking to the French Les Echos newspaper, he added: ""A no-deal Brexit would lead to a collapse of the United Kingdom and a weakening of growth on the continent."" In his interview with RTE, Mr Varadkar was asked whether he was concerned the language around the talks was ""getting toxic"". ""I think it is, from some quarters, but you know I don't play dirty. You know, I don't think most EU leaders do either. We've been very straight up from when the referendum happened."" The prime minister also hosted European Parliament president David Sassoli in Downing Street on Tuesday, but the MEP left saying ""no progress"" had been made. Mr Sassoli later told the BBC's Newsnight programme: ""Angela Merkel's opinions must be taken seriously. We are all very worried because there are only a few days left. ""Because we understand that going out without an agreement leads to having a real problem, if not a real catastrophe."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Following the meeting, Downing Street said there was ""little time"" left to negotiate a new legally-binding withdrawal agreement, but Mr Johnson remained committed to doing all he could. ""We need to move quickly and work together to agree a deal,"" a No 10 spokesman said. ""He [the prime minister] reiterated that if we did not reach an agreement then the UK will leave without a deal on 31 October."" The PM's pledge comes despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. While negotiations are continuing in Brussels, Mr Sassoli said a deal likely to command the support of MEPs was a ""long way off"". Meanwhile,19 Labour MPs have written to the European Commission president Mr Junker,externalcalling for a Brexit deal to be made with the government without any further delay. Caroline Flint, who represents the leave-supporting constituency of Don Valley, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""uncertainty of Brexit has gone on too long"" and the group did not think it was ""impossible"" to resolve the Irish border issue. Tuesday 8 October- The House of Commons was prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

Brexit: The end for negotiations in Brussels?,"Donald Tusk lost his cool with Boris Johnson on Twitter The EU has tried very, very hard throughout this Brexit process to present a cool, calm, united front while political volatility reigns in the UK. ""They want to come across as the adults in the room,"" one Spanish journalist put it to me. But sometimes the EU's distant, business-like veneer noticeably cracks. There are a few memorable examples: President Macron describing Brexiteers who promised the UK a better life outside the EU as liars; Luxembourg's prime minister recently pouring out in public the frustrations with the Brexit process felt privately by many in the EU; and now, on Tuesday, the president of the European Council, Donald Tusk,responding angrily to Downing Street,externalfinger-pointing about the state of Brexit renegotiations by addressing this tweet directly to the prime minister. Mr Tusk's flash of emotion did not go down well in European government circles at this sensitive juncture, as the EU leaders summit and the 31 October Brexit deadline fast approach. The EU wants a deal and, if negotiations fail, it wants voters across the EU to believe that Brussels did its best - staying focussed on the facts at the negotiating table, rather than getting involved in cross-Channel mud-slinging. And bang on cue, not long after Mr Tusk's blame game outburst, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator tweeted that ""efforts continue to find an agreement with the UK"". Is no-deal about to become the PM's policy? What will happen with Brexit in the next four weeks? But no-one I speak to in the EU is holding his or her breath. ""We have no idea where the UK government wants to go in the next 20 days,"" (ie before the 31 October Brexit deadline) a diplomat from northern Europe told me. He said the EU was still unclear how high getting a Brexit deal featured right now on the prime minister's list of priorities - compared, for example, with winning a general election. The EU is unclear on what the prime minister's priorities are So is the search for a deal now over in EU eyes? Not really. The EU says it's still open for talks. It hasn't entirely ruled out the possibility of a deal by the end of this month. Realistically though the prime minister's proposals on how to replace the Irish backstop in a Brexit deal are hugely problematic for Brussels. How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame Academy While diplomats praise some aspects of Boris Johnson's offer, his insistence that Northern Ireland remains in the UK's customs territory after Brexit leaves the EU with unpalatable choices: Either a) having customs infrastructure on the island of Ireland, which Dublin says is a no no. or b) the EU not controlling its customs border which Brussels says would both lead to smuggling and contravene WTO regulations. One high-level EU diplomat joked: ""If that customs border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were left open, as the UK pretty much asks, then I would quit my job and start a smuggling enterprise. Far more lucrative."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. But the EU isn't laughing. Or playing politics, insists Brussels. It says its objections to Boris Johnson's customs proposals are practical, not political. EU technocrats maintain that leaving a post-Brexit customs border open on the island of Ireland would compromise food safety and the safety of children's toys, for example. They warn that any accident or contamination would affect the whole single market plus the EU's reputation amongst other trading partners. ""We won't do that,"" said a diplomat from a country traditionally close to the UK. ""We can't risk that."" What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? Divisions continue over opposition Brexit strategy And if the EU did take that risk, then diplomats warn that Dublin would pay the price. Goods entering the single market via Ireland would be regarded with suspicion, they say, and the free movement of goods in the single market would be seriously compromised. EU sources insist that whatever the Johnson government threatens or however it cajoles,  the EU ""can't be bullied"" into accepting the prime minister's proposals as they stand. ""It would be easier if this discussion were about money,"" a European civil servant told me. ""Then both sides could haggle and reach agreement but there's no compromising over food safety."" This video can not be played What could Brexit mean for sausage rolls? EU diplomats say they accept the principle of two customs systems (EU and UK) on the island of Ireland but that it has to work. EU leaders still look to the UK to be more flexible in its demands. Though they hear Boris Johnson when he says Northern Ireland must remain in the UK's customs union to preserve UK unity. As always when it comes to the backstop, Ireland has a big role to play here too. What could no deal mean for the Irish border? 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Since the EU won't compromise the single market, EU diplomats say Brussels will take its cue from Dublin as to how many checks/controls it could stomach on the island of Ireland. The EU attitude here is: ""What's ok for Dublin, works for the rest of us"". But the Johnson government has expressed frustration with the Irish government. Their belief is that Dublin is ""holding out"" on making compromises since they believe a new Brexit extension is around the corner. And that is exactly what the EU thinks. Though no-one I speak to is starry-eyed about the possibility of having more time to talk. Whether next week or next month, a deal still needs to be found that's acceptable to both sides - and not just to negotiators but to the European and the UK parliaments. And no-one is sure what that would look like. Which is why the feeling in Brussels is that the chances of no deal have gone up again. Extension or no extension.

Eviction threat facing retail giant Amazon,"About 300 people work at Amazon's centre in Gourock Amazon has said it will fight a court's decision to uphold an eviction notice from its landlord at a distribution warehouse in Inverclyde. The site is owned by the M7 property investment firm which gave the online giant six months' notice to quit in February. Amazon challenged the move at the Court of Session, arguing it was entitled to a year's notice. But the courts backed M7, though the US firm has said it will appeal again. About 300 people work at the Gourock site and Amazon says it remains ""business as usual"" for them and customers. Insiders have told BBC Scotland the court battle is a high-stakes negotiation on rent. Amazon operated its ""fulfilment centre'"" with a 15-year lease running out in August this year. It was previously owned by Scottish Enterprise, the government agency, and it is claimed the rent is as much as 60% below the market rate. Last February, the current owner M7 Real Estate gave Amazon six months' notice to quit. Amazon responded that it was entitled to a year's notice. Taking its case to the Court of Session, Amazon lost with a ruling that the six-month notice period was fair and legal. M7 is seeking not only to evict Amazon but it also wants damages from the retailer for remaining on the site since August. However, that issue has been postponed to a future sitting of the Court of Session. Behind the eviction notice and court action is a highly unusual rent negotiation. London-based M7 Real Estate owns 800 industrial assets in 13 countries on behalf of its investors, with a fund worth more than Â£4bn. It believes its action was the only way to get Amazon to respond to its demand for a rent increase, and those discussions are now under way. Retail chains have been putting immense pressure on commercial landlords to lower rents. Although Amazon relies on a different type of commercial property, it is known for its muscular use of bargaining power. But the property investor is warning that there are no other similar sites in central Scotland to which Amazon could move at short notice. In other words, M7 also has leverage in these negotiations. An Amazon spokeswoman said: ""It's business as usual for our customers and associates and we will be appealing the court decision."" John Murnaghan, head of UK and Ireland real estate for M7, said: ""We're here to engage constructively and proactively with Amazon over this lease. However, we need to ensure we're getting fair value for our investors.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsRival buys all 555 Thomas Cook storesAll 555 Thomas Cook stores to be bought by rival Hays Travel in a move that could save up to 2,500 jobsBusiness","John and Irene Hays run the business, set up 40 years ago All 555 Thomas Cook shops are to be bought by rival Hays Travel in a move that could save up to 2,500 jobs. The independent travel agent said the move gives it shops in areas where it had little or no presence, including Scotland and Wales. John Hays, who set up the Sunderland-based firm 40 years ago, said he hoped the shops would reopen within days. It had been an emotional day, he said, with many staff crying when they were told their jobs were saved. He said it was difficult to give cast-iron guarantees about every Thomas Cook shop, because there would now be talks with individual landlords. However, ""it is certainly our intention to take on all the staff; to welcome them back,"" he added. The shops will be branded under the Hays name. All the Thomas Cook stores will be rebranded as Hays Travel There is likely to be some overlap of stores, and the BBC estimates that there are more than 30 locations where there would be two competing High Street branches. In Yorkshire and the North East, for instance, there are branches just streets apart in Sunderland, Newcastle, York, Leeds, Doncaster, and at Morpeth, South Shields. Who are the family buying Thomas Cook shops? The acquisition, for an undisclosed sum, is a significant step for Hays, which has 190 shops, 1,900 staff, and last year had sales of Â£379m, reporting profits of Â£10m. Mr Hays, who owns the business with wife Irene, said: ""It is a game-changer for us, almost trebling the number of shops we have and doubling our workforce - and for the industry, which will get to keep some of its most talented people."" The takeover deal was struck with the travel industry regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority, after several days of negotiations. He said he was ""elated to get the deal over the line. It's been emotional"". Many ex-Thomas Cook staff had cried when told they still had jobs, he said. ""These people did nothing wrong. One day they were in jobs, and the next day they were locked out."" He expected many of the shops to reopen on Thursday, ""although probably with a skeleton staff"". There were some logistics problems - Hays had still to locate many of the shop keys, he said. More than 100 new jobs will be based at the company's Sunderland headquarters, with the rest in shops across the UK. The company has tweeted, urging former Thomas Cook staff to apply.

When Thomas Cook collapsed, it put 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, including 9,000 in the UK. It also sparked the biggest ever peacetime repatriation by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) to bring more than 150,000 British holidaymakers back to the UK. The last flight to repatriate Thomas Cook customers landed at Manchester Airport on Monday. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said she hoped the deal ""will provide significant re-employment opportunities for former Thomas Cook employees, alongside the advice and support we will continue to provide to help people find a new job as quickly as possible"".

Samantha Kennedy, 34, from Alness in Scotland worked at an Inverness branch of Thomas Cook for six years. She told the BBC that her WhatsApp chat group had been ""going crazy this morning since the media started reporting"" the deal. ""We've not been told anything. My manager hasn't been told anything. It would be absolutely amazing if it was true,"" she said. Samantha said she was sad the Thomas Cook brand had gone, but she loved working in the industry. ""To continue to work in the industry would be amazing and there's not many travel shops in Inverness, so if Hays were to take over I think people would be pleased."" The Transport Salaried Staffs' Association  (TSSA) union, which had members in Thomas Cook shops around the UK and in its head office in Peterborough, welcomed the move. Manuel Cortes, TSSA's general secretary,  said it offered ""real hope of reemployment to former Thomas Cook retail staff, many of whom are our members."" The business is thought to have a licence for six months to occupy Thomas Cook stores, giving Hays time to strike new deals with landlords. Ian Bell, head of travel and tourism at accountancy firm RSM, said it was a ""shrewd move"" for Hays, but would also represent a quadrupling of its travel agency stores at a time when customers are increasingly booking holidays online. ""Much may depend on the deals that Hays can strike with its new High Street landlords,"" said Mr Bell. As Hays bought the stores from the administrators, it means it will have bought them at a lower price than if Thomas Cook was still trading. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said that in waiting, Hays had got a ""best price"" for the stores. Thomas Cook collapses as last-ditch rescue talks fail Thomas Cook passenger: 'I'm stuck in Tunisia' However, she questioned the logic for the transaction at a time when customers are turning away from High Street travel agents. ""You have to wonder what Hays' plan is and how they can make it a success. ""Has the travel firm been gung-ho in trying to secure a cheap deal without assessing the viability of taking on these stores?,"" she asked. Hays Travel is not like Thomas Cook, which owned hotels and an airline. Pippa Jacks, group editor of Travel Trade Gazette, told the BBC: ""They don't have a [large] tour operating arm, they don't have an airline, they don't own hotels or cruise shipsâ¦ so it makes them quite nimble in terms of what they sell"". Hays is said to have beaten off other bidders, which she said suggested that the package holiday industry was not dead. ""If you're spending a lot of money, if you're not particularly confident and you want some personal recommendations, actually going to see a real human who will sit and listen and take time to understand your personal requirements is very valued by a lot of holidaymakers,"" she said.

"Northern California braced for mega power cutIn a bid to stop wildfires, San Francisco Bay Area residents could be denied power for several days.US & Canada","A huge wildfire killed 86 people in Paradise, California, last year A power company is cutting electricity to around 800,000 homes, businesses and other locations in Northern California, in an attempt to prevent wildfires. Large swathes of the San Francisco Bay Area - though not the city itself - have lost power, angering residents. The regionâs utility company, Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E), has warned the shutdown could last several days. The company's transmission lines started the deadliest wildfire in Californiaâs history last year. With weather forecasts predicting high winds, the move is intended to prevent the risk of fallen power lines igniting more wildfires. ""The conditions are ripe: dry fuel, high winds, warm event. Any spark can create a significant event,"" said Ray Riordan, director of the Office of Emergency Management in San Jose, during a press conference on Tuesday. The National Weather Service has issued a red flag warning for the Santa Cruz Mountains, North and East Bay regions until Thursday, warning that conditions could result in ""the strongest offshore wind event in the area since the October 2017 North Bay fires"". This video can not be played California braces for Santa Ana winds As of Wednesday morning, PG&E said around 500,000 customers were without power. Another 200,000 were scheduled to lose power by noon, local time, but the utility company has delayed further shutdowns until later in the afternoon due to changing weather conditions. The huge âCamp Fire"" in the town of Paradise last year burned 150,000 acres and left 86 people dead. An investigation determined that poorly maintained PG&E equipment was to blame for starting the historic blaze. The day Paradise burned down California fires 'can now happen any year' 'Losing everything has made me stronger' The firm was also blamed for deadly fires in 2017.Subsequent lawsuits led the publicly traded company to declare bankruptcy in 2019, a process that is still ongoing. PG&E is the sole provider of gas and electricity for much of Northern California, and so the vast majority of consumers in the region do not have an alternative source of power. This video can not be played Rebuilding Paradise: 'Our town is gone' âWe have experienced an unprecedented fire season the past two years,â said Tamar Sarkissian, a PG&E spokeswoman, speaking to BBC partner CBS News. ""And what we learned from that is that we need to be taking further steps to ensure the safety of our customers and the communities that we serve. Public safety power shut off is one of the many steps that we're taking."" PG&E has carried out several planned outages over the course of the past year, though none at the scale of what is scheduled this week. âNone of us are happy about it,â said California governor, Gavin Newsom. âBut this is part of something that we knew was likely to occur several months ago, when PG&E finally woke up to their responsibility to keep people safe.â The outages are expected to affect more than half of the state's counties. The warnings stretch north of the San Francisco Bay Area, in areas such as Napa and Sonoma, famed for wine-making. Further south, many cities synonymous with Silicon Valley giants could be affected, such as Cupertino, home to Apple. Local shops reported an influx of customers buying up supplies for a black out that could, if the weather remains adverse, last for several days. Experts are concerned gusty winds could produce the conditions for wildfires to ignite ""The idea of five days without electricity is devastating,â said Libby Schaaf, mayor of Oakland, but added: ""We fully expect that to be a worst-case scenario. This is our first time going through this.â But websites providing information about the cuts have buckled under heavy traffic loads. Many residents have taken to PG&Eâs social media channels to express their frustration. Snapshots from California 'apocalypse' town Volunteers fighting fires in California's 'forgotten canyon' ""This is ridiculous!â wrote Veronica Key. ""You wasted the money you should have been using on safety precautions to give dividends to your stockholders. Now you have to shut down our power like some sort of third world country. ""When you do shut down the power you canât even get your notification website to work properly! Get it together PG&E! No more rate increases to pay for your incompetence.â Allow Twitter content?

PG&E has opened 28 Community Resource Centers in the region to provide ârestrooms, bottled water and electronic-device chargingâ during daylight hours. Many schools in the area have told students to stay at home on Wednesday and await further information for the remainder of the week. Despite widespread frustration, local meteorologist Mike Pechner told CBS the move was warranted. ""It's not an overreaction at all. As the wind comes in, the wires, of course, oscillate back and forth. If they touch, they start a fire. ""[Cutting power] is taking downed wires and high winds out of the fire equation.""

The end for negotiations?,"Donald Tusk lost his cool with Boris Johnson on Twitter The EU has tried very, very hard throughout this Brexit process to present a cool, calm, united front while political volatility reigns in the UK.

Brexit deal 'essentially impossible',"Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson spoke on the phone on Tuesday morning A No 10 source has said a Brexit deal is ""essentially impossible"" after a call between the PM and Angela Merkel. Boris Johnson and the German chancellor spoke earlier about the proposals he had put forward to the EU - but the source said she made clear a deal based on them was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"". Mrs Merkel's office said it would not comment on ""private"" conversations. But the BBC's Adam Fleming said there was ""scepticism"" within the EU that Mrs Merkel would have used such language. And the EU's top official warned the UK against a ""stupid blame game"". President of the European Council Donald Tusk sent a public tweet to Mr Johnson, telling him ""the future of Europe and the UK"" was at stake. Allow Twitter content?

With efforts to get a deal by the end of the month on an apparent knife edge, Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have said they hope to meet later in the week. But Mr Varadkar told an interviewer on Tuesday eveninghe thought it would be ""very difficult"" to secure an agreement by next week. He said the UK had ""repudiated"" the deal negotiated previously with Theresa May's government and had ""sort of put half of that now back on the table, and are saying that's a concession. And of course it isn't, really"". And following talks in Downing Street, the president of the European Parliament said there had been ""no progress"" and MEPs would not agree to a compromise deal ""at any price"". David Sassoli said the UK's new proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland were a ""long way from something to which the Parliament could agree"". The president of the European Parliament said the EU faced a no-deal exit or a further delay Amid frantic diplomatic manoeuvring in European capitals, details of a call earlier on Tuesday between the UK and German leaders have reignited tensions across the continent. The No 10 source suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods. Latest on Brexit deal talks Kuenssberg: Is no-deal about to become PM's policy? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame game This, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal ""essentially impossible"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the conversation had been ""frank"" but denied the negotiations were all but over. Norbert Rottgen, an ally of the chancellor who is chair of the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee, said there was ""no new German position"". He tweeted that a deal,externalbased on the UK's latest proposals had ""been unrealistic from the beginning and yet the EU has been willing to engage"". The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said it was ""no secret"" Berlin found the UK's proposed new customs solution for Northern Ireland problematic. Allow Twitter content?

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is continuing to meet EU counterparts in Brussels, but the No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down."" They said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland, or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals. Hands up if all this stuff about ""spokesman"" and ""sources"" is driving you bonkers? Here's the in-brief explanation of how it works at Westminster. The prime minister has an official spokesman. They work for the government, not the political party that is in government. They give two briefings a day to reporters when Parliament is sitting and they are on the record. That is to say we report what is said and we report who said it - although by convention we don't actually name the spokesman. There are two reasons for this: they are speaking on behalf of the PM, not themselves. And sometimes a deputy does the briefing instead. In addition to the official spokesman, there are other people in Downing Street who will talk to journalists. For some, that is their specific job. For others, it is not. These people will always talk to us off the record - so we can quote them, but not name them, or do anything that risks identifying them. Journalists always prefer on the record quotes, but in politics as in life, people are often more candid in private, and so we can get a greater sense of what is going on in return for respecting the terms on which the information has been given to us. Updating MPs on contingency planning for a no-deal exit, minister Michael Gove said there was still ""every chance"" of a deal but the EU must engage with the UK's plans. ""In setting out these proposals, we've moved - it is now time for the EU to move too,"" he said. Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister), Simon Coveney, said a deal was still possible but ""not any at cost"" - and the UK must accept it had ""responsibilities"" on the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The UK and Irish leaders spoke on the phone for 40 minutes on Tuesday, after which No 10 said both sides ""strongly reiterated"" their desire to reach a deal. But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told MPs the government was ""intent on collapsing the talks and engaging in a reckless blame game"". ""The stark reality is the government put forward proposals that were designed to fail,"" he said, adding that it was ""beneath contempt"" that, according toa Downing Street source reported by the Spectator,external, the UK could withdraw security co-operation from other EU countries if it were forced to remain beyond 31 October. How could no-deal happen? Brexit deal possible but not at any cost - Coveney Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal. That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin - but talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism. That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out. So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made. The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point. After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done. Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole. Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is will be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.

Stormont given Â£31m to prepare for no-deal Brexit,"Stormont has set aside Â£8m for capital spending on roads and port infrastructure Northern Ireland's Department of Finance was given Â£31.4m during the summer to help Stormont departments prepare for a no-deal Brexit. The Treasury allocated the money froma pot of Â£2.1bn, announced on 1 Augustfor no-deal preparations across the UK. Stormont's share was confirmed to SDLP deputy leader Nichola Mallon when she asked for a breakdown of the figures. She expressed concern that a ""huge sum"" had been allocated by civil servants without input from MLAs. What is 'no-deal Brexit'? How would no deal affect life in NI? Ms Mallon told BBC News NI the money would have been better spent on employing more nurses and building more housing and she accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""reckless and dangerous"" tactics on Brexit. She added that the spending plans ""threw up significant questions"" about the government's plan for borders if there is no deal with the EU. More than a quarter - Â£8m - of Stormont's extra Â£31m has been set aside for capital spending on roads and port infrastructure. Almost Â£6m of it has been allocated to the Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs (DAERA) for ""trade, inspection, legislation and policy staffing"". A further Â£3m has been allocated for capital spending on ""vehicle parks"" in Northern Ireland although there are no details about locations. New signage, CCTV and ""communication equipment"" will cost Â£2.3m, according to the figures. The majority of the cash has been split between two departments - DAERA and the Department for Infrastructure. Stormont's Executive Office has been allocated Â£400,000 to run a no-deal Brexit ""public information campaign"". The Department of Finance initially planned to hold back Â£2m in reserve to deal with what it called ""emerging pressures"". The public transport company Translink has been allocated Â£600,000 for cross-border contingency planning while Northern Ireland Water, which manages the water and sewerage infrastructure, is in line for Â£2.2m for ""maximising chemical stock levels"". However, almost half of that Â£2m - Â£800,000 - has since been allocated to the Department of Health to cope with potential ""medicines shortage and medical device shortage"". By John Campbell, BBC News NI economics and business editor The most intriguing items in these budget documents are the capital spending commitments for roads, vehicle parks and CCTV. That is exactly the sort of infrastructure the government says it won't be building at the border, even if there is no deal. So perhaps it's money that will be directed towards the Irish Sea ports. The Scottish government also has a no-deal contingency planto ""repurpose"" land at the old port of Stranraer as a lorry park. It says that may be necessary if there are increased traffic flows between Northern Ireland and Scotland. One reason for these increased flows could be the government's zero-tariff no-deal plan for the Irish border. They may provide an opportunity for Irish traders to trade tariff-free through Northern Ireland and onwards to Scotland, whereas product leaving Dublin for Holyhead in Wales would face tariffs. Stormont's no-deal spending plan was released bySue Gray, the most senior civil servant in the Department of Finance, in response to a request from the SDLP deputy leader. In a series of written questions to the Northern Ireland Civil Service, the SDLP's Ms Mallon had asked: ""Who took the decision and under what authority to allocate this funding?"" Sue Gray is the permanent secretary at Stormont's Department of Finance Ms Gray replied: ""I took the decision, acting under the Northern Ireland (Executive Formation and Exercise of Functions) Act 2018, to allocate this funding."" That legislation was passed by MPs at Westminster in order to keep Northern Ireland's public services running in the absence of locally-elected ministers. The Northern Ireland Assembly and its governing executive have not functioned for almost three years. Thepower-sharing executive collapsed in January 2017when relations between its two biggest parties - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FÃ©in - broke down. Ms Mallon, whose party is opposed to Brexit, said Â£31.4m was a ""huge sum of public money"" and its allocation had been ""decided on without an executive"". ""There is no scrutiny or accountability and despite requesting it, no explanation or rationale has been provided for these decisions,"" she added. Nichola Mallon accused Boris Johnson of ""cliff-edge tactics"" on Brexit She said the money could have been used instead to fund about over 1,300 new nurses or build more than 240 homes. She explained the average cost to build new social housing in Northern Ireland was Â£130,000 per home, while the average salary for a registered nurse in Belfast was just under Â£24,000. Ms Mallon questioned the large amount of money allocated for CCTV in the event of no-deal. She asked: ""Does any of this involve border infrastructure? We need the detail behind these headlines."" The SDLP MLA said she had asked for the thinking behind the allocation of the money to be explained to her but that further detail had yet to be presented. What would change with a no-deal Brexit?

US halts China visas over Uighur issue,"Protests calling for Uighur freedom have been happening all year The US has said it will impose visa restrictions on Chinese officials accused of involvement in repression of Muslim populations. It follows the decision on Monday to blacklist 28 Chinese organisations linked by the US to allegations of abuse in the Xinjiang region. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the Chinese government had instituted ""a highly repressive campaign"". China has dismissed the allegations as groundless. In a statement,external, Mr Pompeo accused the Chinese government of a string of abuses against Uighurs, ethnic Kazakhs, Kyrgyz Muslims and other minority Muslim groups. The vanished Uighurs of Xinjiang China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained These included ""mass detentions in internment camps; pervasive, high-tech surveillance; draconian controls on expressions of cultural and religious identities; and coercion of individuals to return from abroad to an often perilous fate in China"". China has rebuffed the US moves. ""There is no such thing as these so-called 'human rights issues' as claimed by the United States,"" foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said on Monday. ""These accusations are nothing more than an excuse for the United States to deliberately interfere in China's internal affairs."" This video can not be played The BBC visits the camps where Chinaâs Muslims have their ""thoughts transformed"" Visa restrictions are to be imposed on Chinese government and Communist Party officials, as well as their family members. ""The United States calls on the People's Republic of China to immediately end its campaign of repression in Xinjiang, release all those arbitrarily detained, and cease efforts to coerce members of Chinese Muslim minority groups residing abroad to return to China to face an uncertain fate,"" the US statement said. The US and China are currently embroiled in a trade war, and have sent delegations to Washington for a meeting about the tensions later this week. 'We're all paying for this': People in the trade war crossfire US-China trade war in 300 words The US-China trade war in charts China has been carrying out a massive security operation in Xinjiang, in its far west, in recent years. Human rights groups and the UN say China has rounded up and detained more than a million Uighurs and other ethnic minorities in vast detention camps, where they are forced to renounce Islam, speak only in Mandarin Chinese and learn obedience to the communist government. But China says they are attending ""vocational training centres"" which are giving them jobs and helping them integrate into Chinese society, in the name of preventing terrorism. This video can not be played The BBC's John Sudworth meets Uighur parents in Turkey who say their children are missing in China There have been increasingly vocal denunciations from the US and other countries about China's actions in Xinjiang. Last week,Mr Pompeo alleged that China ""demands its citizens worship government, not God"",externalin a press conference in the Vatican. And in Julymore than 20 countries at the UN Human Rights Council signed a joint lettercriticising China's treatment of the Uighurs and other Muslims. Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims. They make up about 45% of the Xinjiang region's population; 40% are Han Chinese. China re-established control in 1949 after crushing short-lived state of East Turkestan. Why is there tension between China and the Uighurs? Since then, there has been large-scale immigration of Han Chinese and Uighurs fear erosion of their culture. Xinjiang is officially designated an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south.

"Lower paid coastal residents 'being left behind'People living on the coast typically earn Â£1,600 less than those inland, BBC News analysis finds.England","This video can not be played The Coram family say low wages make daily life a struggle in Penzance Workers living in seaside areas in Great Britain earn on average Â£1,600 less per year than those living inland, BBC News analysis has found. The research also found two-thirds of coastal areas had seen a real terms fall in wages since 2010. The All Parliamentary Group for Coastal Communities said the findings showed seaside towns were ""being left behind"". But the government said its Â£200m Coastal Communities Fund was changing lives. This week BBC News is profiling what life is like in seaside communities across the country as part of the Coastal Britain project. The most deprived places in England are found by the sea, according to government figures. Young workers such as Danny (second left), Tamia (second right) and Jack (far right) say low wages in Penzance are a real problem In Penzance in Cornwall young workers said they were struggling to find well paid, long-term employment by the coast. ""I love Penzance but I'm also sick of it,"" said 18-year-old Danny Hammond, who works as a waiter in a local restaurant. ""I earn Â£6.30 an hour, which isn't great and people older than me really struggle to pay the rent or the mortgage."" Tamia Mallam said she could not see many long-term career prospects in Penzance Tamia Mallam, 20, said many people she knew struggled in seasonal jobs connected with the tourism industry. ""When I worked In St Ives, between May and September there was lots of work because of the summer season, but then you'll be told suddenly that you're going to be unemployed. That is really tough,"" she said. ""There aren't many prospects for a career around here. It's a choice of working either in a boring retail job or as waitress."" Trainee carpenter Jack Slater was more optimistic about his future job prospects. ""Lots of my friends have moved away from Penzance to look for better paid jobs and that's why I want to get myself a trade,"" the 18-year-old said. ""I want to stay in Cornwall because it's beautiful and this is my home, and they're always building new homes round here which should mean I'll always have work."" The issue of low pay affects coastal communities across the whole country. BBC News has analysedincome data collected by the Office for National Statistics,externalfor 632 parliamentary in England, Scotland and Wales. Comparable data for Northern Ireland is not avaialble. Taking into account full and part time workers the analysis found: In coastal constituencies, the typical (median) worker in 2018 earned Â£22,104 before tax That was Â£1,681 less than the typical worker in a non-coastal area, who earned Â£23,785 before tax When inflation was taken into account annual wages fell in two-thirds of constituencies between 2010 and 2018, a ""real terms"" decrease The coastal constituencies of Wirral West and Weston-Super-Mare have seen real terms wages fall by around 25% since 2010 Low wages tended to be prevalent in coastal areas because a higher proportion of people worked in low skilled, low paid seasonal jobs. A major report published by the House of Lords,externalearlier this year said seaside towns had for too long been reliant on tourism to drive their local economies. Seaside areas named England's most deprived The seaside towns where the young might disappear Seaside towns 'desperate for reinvention' Mike Hill MP, chair of the all Parliamentary Group for Coastal Communities, said ""for a long time coastal communities have felt forgotten"". ""Many of these areas have lost industries like shipbuilding that once provided thousands of well paid jobs,"" he said. ""There's research that shows that without major changes, by 2030 places like my own constituency of Hartlepool could see lots of young people leave coastal areas, which underlines why we need the right investment to protect the long term future of our coastal towns."" At its party conference in September,Labour promised to build 37 offshore wind farms, which it claimed would generate more than 60,000 new well paid jobs in coastal areas. People who live by the coast are among the lowest paid in the country The government said since 2012 its dedicatedCoastal Communities Fund,externalhad invested more than Â£200m in seaside areas, while more than a quarter of the 100 towns initially selected to share its Â£3.6bn Stronger Towns Fund were on the coast. Jake Berry, minister for the Northern Powerhouse and Local Growth, said these initiatives had begun to transform people's lives. ""For years government has only talked about creating growth in our cities. But we are investing in coastal areas and we've given councils across the country a real terms increase in their budgets for next year,"" he added.

UK fast food âlinked to Brazilian forest firesâGreenpeace asks fast-food chains to stop selling meat from animals fed on soya from Brazil.UK,"Some 2.5 million tonnes of soya beans are shipped to the UK each year Some of the UK's largest fast-food chains have been selling meat from animals fed on soya beans linked to Brazil's forest fires, campaigners say. Some Â£240m of its soya was shipped to the UK in 2018, EU trade figures show. Greenpeace said it wanted the companies to stop using soya from Brazil in their supply chains until the environment was better protected. Brazil's environment minister told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme any boycott could make the situation worse. This video can not be played Brazil's highly biodiverse Cerrado is being destroyed for soybean production, conservationists say Some 2.5 million tonnes of soya is imported into the UK each year, with a large proportion used to feed farm animals. In 2018, about a third of these - 761,739 tonnes - came from Brazil, BBC News analysis of the EU figures showed. And just 14% of total soya imports are certified ""deforestation free,"" according to the Sustainable Trade Initiative - one of the lowest rates in the EU. Greenpeace head of forests Richard George said: ""All of the big fast-food companies use soya in animal feed, none of them know where it comes from and soya is one of the biggest drivers of deforestation worldwide."" Traders have agreed not to buy from farms linked to recent deforestation Environmental campaigners claim ongoing fires in both the Amazon and Cerrado regions of Brazil are being lit deliberately to clear land for raising animals and growing crops. In 2019, the total number of firessurpassed 144,000, a 50% rise on the same period in 2018 - but far fewer than in 2010. In 2006, Greenpeace and other environmental groups negotiated landmark restrictions on new soya cultivation in the Amazon, with huge agricultural traders agreeing not to buy from farms linked to recent deforestation. But campaigners say that has pushed much of the problem south to the Cerrado, a vast tropical savanna where the natural habitat is less well protected. Brazil's National Institute for Space Research recorded 19,925 fires there in September, significantly higher than the number in the Amazon. In October 2017, 23 brands, including McDonald's, Tesco and Marks & Spencer, signed the Cerrado Manifesto, which recognised the need to prevent further deforestation. But the agricultural trader Cargill, which acts as a middleman between farmers and food companies, has yet to sign up. It is the largest importer to the UK, shipping 78% of the soya from Brazil in 2017, according to data from Trase.Earth, a partnership of non-governmental organisations. Although, Cargill told BBC News that figure was ""not accurate and significantly inflated"". In July, Cargill told its Brazilian suppliers it would not support a temporary ban on soya grown on newly deforested land in the Cerrado - which has left environmental groups fuming. ""We remain committed to the soy moratorium in the Amazon but we believe that is not the right solution for the Cerrado,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Asking companies to exit won't solve the problem - it will simply move it. By pushing farmers to other buyers, the same practices will continue."" It has pledged $30m (Â£24m) to fund new ideas for ending deforestation. A new analysis of satellite data by the Rapid Response project, seen by BBC News, suggests Cargill has been buying soya directly from farms in the region of the Cerrado responsible for forest fires. The project is a partnership between three groups, Aidenvironment, MapHubs and Mighty Earth. On one farm, it says, 837 hectares (3.2 sq miles) of wooded savannah was cleared between April and June 2019 and fires were detected by the satellite imagery on 23 August. It is impossible to say if crop from that specific farm was exported but trade data shows 7,103 tonnes of soya beans were shipped from the same municipality, Formosa Do Rio Preto, to the UK in 2017, the majority by Cargill. Cargill accepts it does buy soya from the farm in question but says the farm met all compliance criteria and was not on the Brazilian government's embargoed list. ""As soon as we received an inquiry regarding potential non-compliance... we initiated our grievance process and an investigation is currently under way,"" a spokeswoman for the company told BBC News. ""We will take immediate action if illegal activity is found."" Environmental groups have been trying to increase the pressure on western retailers. Tesco, Sainsbury and M&S have all pledged to achieve zero deforestation in their supply chains by 2020, although it is accepted that target is almost certain to be missed. Environmental groups say the fast food sector is a particular concern - Burger King and KFC source some chicken directly from Brazil. Along with chains such as McDonald's, Nando's, Pret a Manger and Five Guys they also sell British meat reared, at least in part, on soya shipped from the regions. The proportion of animal feed made up of soya can vary dramatically between suppliers and farms in the UK, with some using a diet of grass and grain instead. McDonald's says it is working to determine the level of deforestation risk in specific parts of the Cerrado and assessing whether fires are being lit at an individual farm level. Other retailers and fast-food outlets, including Waitrose and Nando's, buy financial credits designed to offset the deforestation risk. Mr George said: ""This may sound persuasive but the actual soya they use may still come from farms that are destroying forests."" Burger King has been particularly criticised after pledging to end deforestation in its supply chains by 2030, a target criticised as ""embarrassingly weak"". The company told BBC News it had written to its meat suppliers to remind them of its policy of not accepting products raised on former rainforest land. It says its beef suppliers in the UK use soya as a minor food additive only. A spokeswoman said: ""We are aware that in some of our beef, there are trace amounts of soya in the feed. We are also aware that there is no traceability programme in place anywhere in the world that can currently track all soy beans to a single farm in a single country."" Soya based foods like soya milk, tofu and meat replacement products are also made from soya beans, but the companies tend to be smaller in scale and more able to trace their supply chain. The Vegan Society said: ""The use of Amazonian soya in vegan food manufacturing is fairly insignificant, given that most brands source from Europe, and up to 91% of deforestation in the rainforest comes directly from animal agriculture. Farmed animals eat far more soya than we would if we ate it directly, therefore wasting resources and harming the environment."" The Brazilian government has faced intense criticism for policies environmentalists believe have encouraged the fires. But Environment Minister Ricardo Salles told the Victoria Derbyshire programme pressure to shun Brazilian soya would be counterproductive. ""We need sustainable economic development... and boycotts or behaviours like this will only make things even worse,"" he said.

No 10 responds to Arcuri details requestDowning Street complies with a London Assembly order to hand over details of the PM's contact with businesswoman.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Jennifer Arcuri: ""I'm not going to put myself in a position where you can weaponise my answer"" Downing Street has complied with an order to hand over details of Boris Johnson's contacts with Jennifer Arcuri, the London Assembly has said. But No 10 has asked the Assembly not to publish the document as it is ""confidential"", an Assembly spokesperson said. The PM is facing questions about his friendship with the US businesswoman when he was London mayor. He has denied claims of failing to declare a conflict of interest. Mr Johnson had been given until Tuesday to provide details of contacts with Ms Arcuri. The Assembly has said that they will comply with Downing Street's request for confidentiality, having previously said that they would publish the response. Speaking before the details were released, Len Duvall, chairman of the Assembly's oversight committee, said: ""The allegations are serious, I hope the prime minister is treating them seriously."" No 'favouritism' over Johnson links, Arcuri says Jennifer Arcuri: What's the story about? He said the assembly's powers to take action against Mr Johnson, if he was found to have breached its code of conduct, were limited because he was no longer mayor of London. He held the office between 2008 and 2016. But it could still summon the prime minister to appear before the oversight committee to answer further questions about his contacts with Ms Arcuri, along with others connected to the case. The committee has asked for the details and a timeline of all contact between Mr Johnson and Ms Arcuri, including private text messages and emails. According to the Sunday Times, which first reported the story, Ms Arcuri joined trade missions led by Mr Johnson when he was mayor and received thousands of pounds in public money. It is also understood she attended events on two of the trade missions - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The prime minister has denied breaking any rules of conduct and insisted everything was done ""entirely in the proper way"". Ms Arcuri told ITV's Good Morning Britain Mr Johnson was ""a really good friend"" - but denied the then mayor had shown any ""favouritism"" towards her. The code governing conduct at London City Hall states that public office holders should not act in any way to gain benefits for families or friends, and should declare private interests to resolve any conflicts. Mr Duvall, a Labour member of the London Assembly, said his committee was attempting to ""make a judgement call on what the relationship was"" before deciding what, if any, action it would take at a meeting next week. Separately, the Independent Office for Police Conduct has been asked to consider whether Mr Johnson, who as mayor was responsible for policing in London, should be investigated for misconduct in public office, a criminal offence. Current Mayor Sadiq Khan has asked a senior lawyer to review a 2013 decision by London and Partners, the mayor's promotional agency, to sponsor a conference organised one of Ms Arcuri's companies, for Â£10,000. London and Partners say they have found no evidence of Mr Johnson's involvement in the decision. The Department for Culture, Media and Sport is, meanwhile, ""reviewing"" a Â£100,000 grant made in February this year to Ms Arcuri's cyber-security business Hacker House.

"Norwich council estate wins top architecture awardThe eco-friendly Goldsmith Estate of 100 homes in Norwich is described as a ""pioneering exemplar "".","This video can not be played A resident explains what she enjoys about her home An eco-friendly council estate in Norwich has scooped this year's prestigious Riba Stirling Prize for architecture. The Royal Institute of British Architects gives out the award each year to the UK's best new building. The estate, called Goldsmith Street, is made up of almost 100 ultra low-energy homes for Norwich City Council. It beat the likes of London Bridge Station and the Nevill Holt Opera, Market Harborough, to the prize. Goldsmith Street meets rigorous ""Passivhaus"" environmental standards, which means it ""provides a high level of occupant comfort while using very little energy for heating and cooling"", according to thePassivhaus Trust,external. Riba said the estate's environmental credentials made it a ""beacon of hope"" and highly unusual for a mass housing development. Meet the residents of Goldsmith Street Riba Stirling Prize: The nominees in full ""Faced with a global climate emergency, the worst housing crisis for generations and crippling local authority cuts, Goldsmith Street is a beacon of hope,"" said Riba president Alan Jones. ""It is commended not just as a transformative social housing scheme and eco-development, but a pioneering exemplar for other local authorities to follow."" Goldsmith Street is made up of two-storey houses, bookended by three-storey flats. The estate has been designed by architect company Mikhail Riches to be eco-friendly down to the smallest of detail. Letterboxes are built into external porches, rather than the front doors, to reduce draughts. Homes run on a passive solar scheme, estimated to bring residents annual energy bills which are 70% cheaper than those for the average household. All face south to get as much sunlight as possible; walls are more than 60cm thick and the roofs are tilted in such a way to avoid blocking sunlight from the neighbours. As for the aesthetic, they are made in materials referencing Norwich's history, such as glossy black roof pantiles, which are a nod to the city's Dutch trading links, and creamy clay bricks similar to Victorian terraces nearby. To give residents a sense of individuality and ownership, touches have been included such coloured front doors, generous lobby space for prams and bikes and private balconies. And to encourage a community spirit, the back gardens of the central terraces share a secure play area for children and a landscaped walkway for communal gatherings runs through the middle of the estate. ""It is not often we are appointed to work on a project so closely aligned with what we believe matters; buildings people love which are low impact,"" said David Mikhail of Mikhail Riches. ""We hope other local authorities will be inspired to deliver beautiful homes for people who need them the most, and at an affordable price. ""To all the residents - thank you for sharing your enthusiasm, and your homes, with everyone who has visited.""

Brexit deal essentially impossible - No 10 source,"Angela Merkel and Boris Johnson spoke on the phone on Tuesday morning A No 10 source has said a Brexit deal is ""essentially impossible"" after a call between the PM and Angela Merkel. Boris Johnson and the German chancellor spoke earlier about the proposals he had put forward to the EU - but the source said she made clear a deal based on them was ""overwhelmingly unlikely"". Mrs Merkel's office said it would not comment on ""private"" conversations. But the BBC's Adam Fleming said there was ""scepticism"" within the EU that Mrs Merkel would have used such language. And the EU's top official warned the UK against a ""stupid blame game"". President of the European Council Donald Tusk sent a public tweet to Mr Johnson, telling him ""the future of Europe and the UK"" was at stake. Allow Twitter content?

With efforts to get a deal by the end of the month on an apparent knife edge, Mr Johnson and his Irish counterpart Leo Varadkar have said they hope to meet later in the week. But Mr Varadkar told an interviewer on Tuesday eveninghe thought it would be ""very difficult"" to secure an agreement by next week. He said the UK had ""repudiated"" the deal negotiated previously with Theresa May's government and had ""sort of put half of that now back on the table, and are saying that's a concession. And of course it isn't, really"". And following talks in Downing Street, the president of the European Parliament said there had been ""no progress"" and MEPs would not agree to a compromise deal ""at any price"". David Sassoli said the UK's new proposed customs arrangements for Northern Ireland were a ""long way from something to which the Parliament could agree"". The president of the European Parliament said the EU faced a no-deal exit or a further delay Amid frantic diplomatic manoeuvring in European capitals, details of a call earlier on Tuesday between the UK and German leaders have reignited tensions across the continent. The No 10 source suggested Mrs Merkel told her counterpart the only way to break the deadlock was for Northern Ireland to stay in the customs union and for it to permanently accept EU single market rules on trade in goods. Latest on Brexit deal talks Kuenssberg: Is no-deal about to become PM's policy? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Brexitcast: Blame game This, the source said, marked a shift in Germany's approach and made a negotiated deal ""essentially impossible"". The prime minister's official spokesman said the conversation had been ""frank"" but denied the negotiations were all but over. Norbert Rottgen, an ally of the chancellor who is chair of the Bundestag's Foreign Affairs Committee, said there was ""no new German position"". He tweeted that a deal,externalbased on the UK's latest proposals had ""been unrealistic from the beginning and yet the EU has been willing to engage"". The BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler said it was ""no secret"" Berlin found the UK's proposed new customs solution for Northern Ireland problematic. Allow Twitter content?

Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The UK's chief negotiator, David Frost, is continuing to meet EU counterparts in Brussels, but the No 10 source said Tuesday morning's phone call had been a ""clarifying moment"", adding: ""Talks in Brussels are close to breaking down."" They said the UK was not willing to move away from the principle of providing a consent mechanism for Northern Ireland, or the plan for leaving the customs union, and if the EU did not accept those principles, ""that will be that"" and the plan moving forward would be an ""obstructive"" strategy towards Brussels. They also accused the EU of being ""willing to torpedo the Good Friday agreement"" - the peace process agreed in Northern Ireland in the 1990s - by refusing to accept Mr Johnson's proposals. Hands up if all this stuff about ""spokesman"" and ""sources"" is driving you bonkers? Here's the in-brief explanation of how it works at Westminster. The prime minister has an official spokesman. They work for the government, not the political party that is in government. They give two briefings a day to reporters when Parliament is sitting and they are on the record. That is to say we report what is said and we report who said it - although by convention we don't actually name the spokesman. There are two reasons for this: they are speaking on behalf of the PM, not themselves. And sometimes a deputy does the briefing instead. In addition to the official spokesman, there are other people in Downing Street who will talk to journalists. For some, that is their specific job. For others, it is not. These people will always talk to us off the record - so we can quote them, but not name them, or do anything that risks identifying them. Journalists always prefer on the record quotes, but in politics as in life, people are often more candid in private, and so we can get a greater sense of what is going on in return for respecting the terms on which the information has been given to us. Updating MPs on contingency planning for a no-deal exit, minister Michael Gove said there was still ""every chance"" of a deal but the EU must engage with the UK's plans. ""In setting out these proposals, we've moved - it is now time for the EU to move too,"" he said. Ireland's TÃ¡naiste (Deputy Prime Minister), Simon Coveney, said a deal was still possible but ""not any at cost"" - and the UK must accept it had ""responsibilities"" on the island of Ireland. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics The UK and Irish leaders spoke on the phone for 40 minutes on Tuesday, after which No 10 said both sides ""strongly reiterated"" their desire to reach a deal. But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer told MPs the government was ""intent on collapsing the talks and engaging in a reckless blame game"". ""The stark reality is the government put forward proposals that were designed to fail,"" he said, adding that it was ""beneath contempt"" that, according toa Downing Street source reported by the Spectator,external, the UK could withdraw security co-operation from other EU countries if it were forced to remain beyond 31 October. How could no-deal happen? Brexit deal possible but not at any cost - Coveney Judge dismisses no-deal Brexit court move What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? The PM has insisted the UK will leave the EU on that date, with or without a deal. That is despite legislation passed by MPs last month, known as the Benn Act, which requires Mr Johnson to write to the EU requesting a further delay if no deal is signed off by Parliament by 19 October - unless MPs agree to a no-deal Brexit. No-one really wants to comment directly on this phone call - certainly not Berlin - but talking to EU officials and diplomats in Brussels, there is considerable scepticism. That's because the words attributed to Angela Merkel do not reflect the EU's agreed language. For one, Mrs Merkel and the EU have repeatedly said they will keep talking to the last second and will not pull the plug before that. And secondly, the No 10 source claims the EU wants to keep Northern Ireland permanently ""trapped"" in the customs union - Brussels insists it doesn't want that at all, it just wants the option for Northern Ireland stay inside temporarily until something else is worked out. So as I say, scepticism. It could be a misinterpretation or it could be a deliberate bit of spin, because we're now entering into a blame game about whose fault it is that progress isn't being made. The key focus of the new UK plans is to replace the so-called backstop - the policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland - which has long been a sticking point. After presenting them, government sources hoped the sides might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of talks almost immediately, but a number of senior EU figures, including Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar, warned they did not form the basis for deeper negotiations - even if they believed a deal could still be done. Mr Varadkar has warned the Johnson plan could actually undermine that principle by giving one party in Northern Ireland a veto over what happens to the country as a whole. Tuesday 8 October- Last working day in the House of Commons before it is will be prorogued - suspended - ahead of a Queen's Speech to begin a new parliamentary session. Monday 14 October- The Commons is due to return, and the government will use the Queen's Speech to set out its legislative agenda. The speech will then be debated by MPs throughout the week. Thursday 17 October- Crucial two-day summit of EU leaders begins in Brussels. This is the last such meeting currently scheduled before the Brexit deadline. Saturday 19 October- Date by which the PM must ask the EU for another delay to Brexit under the Benn Act, if no Brexit deal has been approved by Parliament and they have not agreed to the UK leaving with no-deal. Thursday 31 October- Date by which the UK is due to leave the EU, with or without a withdrawal agreement.
