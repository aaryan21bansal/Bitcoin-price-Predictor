Telford abuse 'like son's still goes on',"This video can not be played Telford abuse mother claims son was used by men for sex A mother who claims her teenage son was groomed for sex by men in Telford says abuse in the town is ongoing. Speaking anonymously, she said her son was given money, drugs and alcohol by men who until six months ago ""were using him for sex"". The Shropshire town is beingdogged by fresh child abuse claims, including reports of widespread grooming dating back to the 1980s. West Mercia Police said preventing child sexual abuse was a ""priority"". But the mother told the BBC abuse there was not simply historical and she knew people who were ""still going through it"". Midlands Live: Man in court over girl's bin lorry death; School service for hit-and-run brothers Telford has been in the spotlight after the Sunday Mirror reported up to 1,000 girls may have been abused since the 1980s Saying her son was abused over a five-year period, she claimed his abusers were ""giving him money, taking advantage of him, getting him drunk, giving him drugs"". She said: ""I feel angry, upset - I want to go and kill them. ""There's no way anyone can say it's historic, because I know it's not. ""My son has been going through it and there are other people I know who are still going through it."" She said she had reported her son's experience to police. In a statement, the West Mercia force said: ""Although we have and continue to put significant time and effort with partners into preventing offences of child sexual exploitation, it is right to acknowledge that there will still, sadly, be cases where this is happening in our communities. ""Unfortunately, there are depraved offenders in towns and cities right across the country exploiting young people and along with our partner agencies, we are working tirelessly to do all we can to prevent this from happening."" Who are the victims? Who are the perpetrators? 'Nobody asked me any questions' Telford grooming gangs 'tip of iceberg' Telford has been at the heart of a media storm which has triggered a feeling of anger - confusion - and disgust among many of its residents. Having spoken to dozens of people, the questions that keep coming up are - is child sexual exploitation worse here than in any other place in the country and if so, why has it taken so long to bring that into the spotlight? Police officers and the local council say they're doing all they can to tackle the problem. Seven men were jailed in 2012 after a police crackdown on CSE, known as Operation Chalice New abuse claims followed aSunday Mirror story,externalwhich reported ""groups of mainly Asian men"" had been targeting girls in Telford. The newspaper projected a figure of up to 1,000 victims since the 1980s, but Supt Tom Harding from West Mercia Police said numbers suggesting such scale were ""sensationalised"", adding police and authorities in Telford were working with approximately 46 victims of child sexual exploitation (CSE). CSE in the town fell under national scrutiny in 2012 when seven men were jailed for their part in girls' abuse following West Mercia Police's Operation Chalice. The convicted, Telford MP Lucy Allan said, were of Pakistani origin and the victims of white origin. The abused boy's mother told the BBC her son was abused by ""different white men"" and the abuse was ""going on in all races"". ""It's not just Asian men who are doing it,"" she said. ""It's white men, it's black men"". She added victims were also of different background types. ""The girls are white, Indian, black, there's even Pakistani girls"". This video can not be played Lucy Allan MP says 'many young girls' have come to her to share their experiences. Ms Allan told Parliament on 13 Marchvulnerable white working class girlswere being traded for sex ""in a routine way"". She said after she spoke in the Commons, she had been""inundated"" with reports of child grooming victims. If you're worried that a child or young person is at risk or is being abused you can contact the children's social care team at their local council. You can choose not to give your details. You canreport it online,externalto the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (CEOP). Or you can call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support. If a child is at immediate risk call 999, or call the police on 101 if you think a crime has been committed. Children and young people can call Childline free on 0800 1111 where trained counsellors are available 24 hours a day, every day.

'Excessive salaries' paid by some academies,"Some academy trusts in England stand accused of paying ''unjustifiably'' high salaries to trustees and depriving ""the front line of vital funds."" MPs on the Public Accounts Committee (PAC) highlighted how 102 academy trusts paid some senior staff over Â£150,000 a year. And in two-thirds of cases where the government had challenged this, it had not been satisfied with the response. The government said all trusts operated under a strict accountability system. The committee's latest report on the finances of state-funded but privately run academy schools welcomed the first publication of an annual report on academy accounts. But the PAC said: ""Unjustifiably high salaries use public money that could be better spent on improving children's education and supporting front-line teaching staff and do not represent value for money.'' 'Fat cat' academy bosses face challenge Heads want fair pay for academy bosses Meg Hillier, who chairs the committee, said academies needed to be held to account more effectively. And part of this meant having access to transparent, detailed and timely information that could be judged in the same way the accounts of maintained, council, schools were judged. Ms Hillier said: ""More than two million pupils are taught by academies in England. The governance and financial management of these schools is fundamentally important to pupils' educational outcomes and future life prospects. ""If parents, Parliament and others are to hold them properly to account, it is vital they have timely access to transparent and detailed information. ""Excessive trustee salaries deprive the front line of vital funds. And it is alarming that, in two-thirds of cases where government has challenged individual trusts on pay exceeding Â£150,000, it has not been satisfied by the response."" The committee report is published as the National Education Union (NEU) meets for its annual conference in Brighton. A motion to its conference will call for a public inquiry into academy chain finances, including the pay of senior employees. The teaching union, formerly the NUT, will also discuss the difficult funding issues faced by many schools. Reacting to the PAC report, joint NEU general secretary Dr Mary Bousted said: ''While most schools face brutal budget cuts, and teachers are experiencing real-term pay cuts, this report confirms what we have long known - that some academy trusts appear to be using public money to pay excessive salaries.'' The Department for  Education said 450,000 pupils studied in academies which were previously underperforming. It added: ''To ensure all pupils get the excellent education they deserve we continue to scrutinise the system on an annual basis and take action where necessary, such as recently asking all trusts paying high salaries to justify them.''

Engineering giant GKN loses takeover battle,"GKN is a partner on the F-35 joint strike aircraft One of Britain's oldest engineering firms has been sold for Â£8.1bn to a controversial investment firm. GKN, which has had a hand in making everything from Minis to Spitfires, lost its battle to stay independent. Melrose Industries, which specialises in turning round troubled manufacturing businesses and selling them on, won the backing of 52% of GKN shareholders. Business Secretary Greg Clark said Melrose now had to honour its commitments to stay UK based. Labour called Melrose a ""short-termist asset-stripper"" and condemned the deal. Admitting defeat, GKN's management said it would now work with Melrose to ensure the success of the new company. The battle for GKN, which employs 58,000 staff worldwide, 6,000 of them in the UK, drew protests from government, unions and GKN customers. GKN's board had promised it would overhaul itself and sell off its car parts division, but it was not enough to stop investors agreeing to sell their shares to Melrose. Christopher Miller, chairman of Melrose, said: ""We are delighted and grateful to have received support from GKN shareholders for our plan to create a UK industrial powerhouse with a market capitalisation of over Â£10bn and a tremendous future."" News of the successful bid sent GKN's share price up over 6% to 450p. Melrose's offer is equivalent to 462p a share. GKN's businesses cover aerospace and automotive engineering. Its Driveline division makes systems for roughly half the world's passenger cars and light trucks. Its aerospace division is a major supplier to the US military and a key partner on defence programmes such as the F-35 joint strike aircraft in which the UK government has a stake. Melrose's strategy,externalit says, is to keep the company together ""to improve all of the businesses in GKN, only realising their value once they have reached full potential."" GKN Driveline supplies some of the world's biggest car manufacturers However, what happens afterwards has alarmed politicians and unions and some of GKN's customers. Mr Clark said: ""During the bid, Melrose made commitments which they are bound to honour including investment in research and development and maintaining itself as a UK business. ""Now that shareholders have made their decision the government has a statutory responsibility to consider whether the merger in its proposed final form gives rise to public interest concerns in the areas of media plurality, financial stability and national security. ""This assessment will be made by the appropriate authorities and the conclusion set out in due course."" Airbus has said new business with GKN after a Melrose takeover would be ""practically impossible"" Before Melrose won the bid Airbus, which is supplied by GKN, said it would be ""practically impossible"" to give new business to GKN if Melrose's offer was accepted because it damaged long-term investment prospects in the company, which could reduce R&D budgets and limit innovation. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the ADS trade organisation, which represents the aerospace and defence sectors, said: ""GKN is an important part of the UK industrial landscape and it is important that its owners continue to invest for the long-term and support high value jobs both directly and throughout its UK supply chain."" The Unite union said it would be holding Melrose's ""feet to the fire"" over concessions it had made in recent days and seeking ""concrete guarantees"" on job security, investment and future work in the UK. Melrose launched its bid in January, initially at Â£7bn. It increased that this month to Â£8.1bn, with up to another Â£1bn to support the pension fund. It argued that it could increase GKN's profitability which has been falling steadily over the last five years. In the run up to the bid, GKN had also suffered a crisis of leadership, with its chief executive-in-waiting, Kevin Cummings, forced to step down after problems in the company's US aerospace division. The new chief executive, Anne Stevens, a former Ford executive, devised a plan to merge GKN's Driveline with the US car components group Dana to create a new company. GKN would have got a 47% stake in it and $1.8bn (Â£1.28bn) in cash from Dana. But Melrose called the plans ""panicked and fraught with contradictions"".

China's space lab set for fiery re-entry,"This video can not be played China's space lab Tiangong-1 tracked on radar The estimated window of re-entry for the defunct Chinese space lab Tiangong-1 has narrowed sharply. The timeframe for the fall to Earth is centred on 01:07 Monday GMT (02:07 BST), plus or minus two hours. Experts are tracking the module as it orbits at an ever decreasing altitude. However, they will only be sure of the timing of the final plunge very late in the descent because of the uncertainties over Tiangong's interactions with the high atmosphere. China has lost communication with the module and there is no way to control its downward flight. However, the risk of any parts of Tiangong hitting a populated area is considered very low. ""Given Tiangong-1 has a larger mass and is more robust, as it is pressurised, than many other space objects that return uncontrolled to Earth from space, it is the subject of a number of radar tracking campaigns,"" explained Richard Crowther, the UK Space Agency's chief engineer. ""The majority of the module can be expected to burn up during re-entry heating, with the greatest probability being that any surviving fragments will fall into the sea,"" he told BBC News. Precise knowledge of the re-entry time and location will come late Typically, only in the last hour or so are experts very confident Most of the module's components will burn up in the high atmosphere Its orbital path means any debris is restricted in where it can fall Perhaps 20-40% could survive to the surface - that's 1.5-3.5 tonnes The highest probability is that this material would hit the ocean Any debris path at the surface would be hundreds of km long Tiangong is the 50th most massive object to come back uncontrolled Launched in 2011 and visited by six Chinese astronauts, the 10m-long, 8.5-tonne Tiangong module should really have been de-orbited in a planned manner. Traditionally, thrusters are fired on large vehicles to drive them towards a remote zone over the Southern Ocean. But this option appears not to be available, especially after the loss of command links in 2016. Tiangong is now brushing through the top of the atmosphere, which is dragging on the spacecraft and causing it to lose altitude rapidly. Big harpoon is 'solution to space junk' Space junk threatens Earth's future The place spacecraft go to die Thirteen space agencies,under the leadership of the European Space Agency,external, have been using radar and optical observations to follow its path around the globe, modelling its behaviour. This collective, known as the Inter-Agency Space Debris Coordination Committee (IADC), has issued regular updates on the descent progress, and Esa itself gave its own final bulletin on Sunday. This forecast was for a four-hour re-entry window centred on 01:07 GMT Monday. This video can not be played Holger Krag: Something of the size of Tiangong comes back ""roughly every three to four years"" ""A confidence of one hour is only reached about four hours beforehand. And one hour still means almost one revolution around the Earth,"" said Holger Krag, the head of Esa's space debris office. ""But that's still good enough to exclude many countries and even some continents."" What can be said with certainty is that nothing will fall outside of 43 degrees from the equator, north or south. This encompasses a region up to the Mediterranean and down to Tasmania, for example. It is governed by the inclination on which Tiangong was launched. China has limited national tracking facilities around the globe and so had no choice but to keep the vessel on a reasonably tight equatorial path. The International Space Station by contrast reaches 52 degrees north and south. Astronaut Wang Yaping memorably gave a lecture to school children from Tiangong-1 The module was launched in 2011 to practise rendezvous and docking Two astronaut crews visited in Shenzhou capsules - in 2012 and 2013 They included China's first female astronauts Liu Yang and Wang Yaping China plans a more permanent space station in the next decade It has developed a heavy-lift rocket, Long March 5, for the purpose Although about 5.2 billion people live within the re-entry zone, most of it is ocean, which explains the high probability that any debris that survives to the surface will hit water. Dr Krag said: ""We know from similar events that on average between 20% and 40% of the initial mass has the chance to survive re-entry heating. ""We could apply this rule of thumb also to Tiangong, I believe, because typically the same amount of heat-resistant material in relative terms is onboard all spacecraft. ""So that would mean between 1.5 tonnes and 3.5 tonnes might be able to survive,"" he told BBC News. The components that most often seem to avoid burning up in the atmosphere are tanks. These objects are interior to the spacecraft and so are protected for much of the descent. But they are also made from steel, titanium or carbon-reinforced plastics and these materials are generally more resistant to high temperatures should they become exposed. Tiangong is certainly on the large size for uncontrolled re-entry objects but it is far from being the biggest, historically. The US space agency's Skylab was almost 80 tonnes in mass when it came back partially uncontrolled in 1979. Parts struck Western Australia but no-one on the ground was injured. Nasa's Columbia shuttle would also have to be classed as an uncontrolled re-entry. Its mass was over 100 tonnes when it made its tragic return from orbit in 2003. Again, no-one on the ground was hit as debris scattered through the US states of Texas and Louisiana. The redoubtable cataloguer of space activity, Jonathan McDowell from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, reckons Tiangong is only the 50th most massive object to come back uncontrolled.

China is participating in the IADC campaign and is sharing some of its data. The nation has since launched a second lab, Tiangong-2, which continues to be operational. It was visited by a re-fuelling freighter, Tianzhou-1, just last year. The Tiangongs were put up to demonstrate orbital rendezvous and docking capabilities - to be testbeds to rehearse activities ahead of China's more permanent space station. This facility, which is expected to comprise a large core module and two smaller ancillary modules, will be in service early next decade, the Asian nation says. A new rocket, the Long March 5, was recently introduced to perform the heavy lifting that will be required to get the core module in orbit.

Bodies found 'six hours after crash',"Ella Alford (left) and Aimee Clayton both went to Peter Symonds College in Winchester Two 18-year-old college friends were found dead more than six hours after their car careered off the road and crashed into trees, police have said. Ella Alford and Aimee Clayton were found in a Fiat 500 at the side of the A30 near The Hatch pub in Basingstoke, Hampshire, at 05:00 BST on Wednesday. Police believe the car hit some trees at about 22:30 the previous evening. The women went to Peter Symonds College in Winchester whose principal said they ""both had such bright futures ahead"". Stephen Carville added: ""We are deeply saddened to hear of the loss of two of our students. They both had such bright futures ahead of them. The crash happened on the A30 eastbound near Basingstoke ""We will be doing our very best to support our students."" He added: ""In time, we will talk to the students and parents about the best way that we can celebrate the lives of these girls and find some way of creating a lasting memorial."" Paying tribute, fellow student Peter Banks said: ""My prayers and thoughts are solely with the close friends and family of Aimee and Ella. ""The grief we share is massive, but the burden of their loss on your shoulders alone is unimaginable. ""The whole Peter Symonds College community is with you through this awful time.""

May: Brexit allows more for NHS and schools,"This video can not be played Theresa May: Brexit will offer new opportunities for the UK Theresa May has said that Brexit means there will be more money available to spend on the NHS and schools. The prime minister told the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg Brexit ""would deliver a country that will be different"" but with the chance ""of a bright future"". The PM visited England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, with one year to go to the UK leaving the EU. Meanwhile ex-Prime Minister Tony Blair said Brexit could still be stopped, saying it was ""not too late"". Mr Blair, a strong backer of UK membership of the EU, told BBC Radio 4's Today the ""sensible"" option was to ""take a final decision"" once the terms of the deal have been set out. Blair: It is not too late to stop Brexit UK hopes to 'roll over' 40 EU trade deals What do people think about Brexit? Reality Check: Can I keep my citizenship? On 29 March 2019, the UK will formally leave the EU and is due to enter a 21-month transition period during which much of the current arrangements continue, before the final permanent post-membership relationship is due to kick-in. Since formal negotiations began between the two sides last June, an agreement has been struck on a Brexit ""divorce bill"" - but the crucial issue of how they will trade together in the longer term has yet to be settled. In her interview with the BBC's political editor, Mrs May was asked if there would be a ""Brexit dividend"". She replied: ""Of course when we leave the European Union, we'll no longer be spending vast sums of money, year in and year out, sending that money to the European Union, so there will be money available here in the UK to spend on our priorities like the NHS and schools."" Mrs May said she was confident of securing a deal which was good for all parts of the UK. Asked if she thought Brexit was worth it, she added: ""I think there are real opportunities for the UK, I think there's a bright future out there and, yes, I think Brexit is going to deliver a country that will be different, for us to be an independent nation for the future."" This video can not be played With a year until our departure, what do voters make of the Brexit progress so far? The issue of whether there would be a Brexit dividend was a contentious issue during the 2016 EU referendum. The Leave campaign said money sent to the EUshould be spent on the NHSinstead, while the Remain side said the economic impact of leavingwould mean less moneybeing available to spend on public services. At some stage - most likely in October - the PM will have to put an outline of the Brexit deal to Parliament, with some opponents seeing that as a chance to force a rethink. The government only has a majority in the Commons with the support of DUP MPs so Labour's position in that vote will be important. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Labour's ""tests"" on any proposed deal were ""nowhere near being met"" and insisted Labour would not vote for the deal unless ""the government are sensible and they negotiate properly... [so we can] get a deal that meets the six tests"". Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: A timeline Why is leaving the EU taking so long? Quick guide to Brexit - in 300 words Mrs May began her tour by visiting a textile factory in Ayrshire with other stops at a parent and toddler group in Newcastle, lunch with farmers near Belfast before meeting businesses in Barry, south Wales. She vowed to regain control of ""our laws, our borders and our money"" and that the UK will ""thrive as a strong and united country that works for everyone, no matter whether you voted Leave or Remain"". The prime minister has been accused of a power grab by the Scottish and Welsh governments over plans to repatriate some powers from Brussels to Westminster rather than to the devolved administrations. She insisted each of the devolved administrations would see ""an increase in their decision-making powers"" and that her government remained ""absolutely committed"" to the devolution settlements. But Wales' First Minister Carwyn Jones warned that Mrs May's Brexit plan would ""do serious damage to our economy"". And Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she wanted to see progress in the talks over devolving powers to UK nations from Brussels. ""This is about powers over the environment, agriculture, fishing, justice - perhaps whether in future trade deals, our health service could be put up for grabs,"" she said. ""These things really matter and that's why this is such an issue of importance for us."" By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg Voters were promised an additional Â£350m a week to fund the NHS As was crystal clear with a focus group in Coventry last night, for many voters, Brexit was a demand for something else, a response to big promises made by politicians. With only a year to go, and the government's main achievement so far being establishing a grace period that will pretty much keep us in the EU for another couple of years, I can't help using the phrase that haunted the prime minister in the election: ""Nothing has changed."" And nothing will change any time soon either. But the argument over how to keep perhaps the biggest of those promises is alive and kicking. Without mentioning the bus (yes, that bus), the boldest promise in the referendum that sticks in people's minds was to provide more money for the NHS. Read more from Laura's blog. The PM also promised to ""protect the integrity of the United Kingdom as a whole"", restating her opposition to a controversial EU ""backstop"" option which effectively keeps Northern Ireland inside its customs union.

Kay's Car Share returning to TV in May,"Kay stars alongside Sian Gibson in Car Share The final two episodes of Peter Kay's Car Share are to be broadcast on BBC One in May, it's been confirmed. Fans of the sitcom will finally see what happens between his character John and Kayleigh, played by Sian Gibson. The episodes - which have already been filmed - will come a year after Kay said the show wascoming to an endfollowing its second series. There will be an unscripted episode before the finale, which will reveal if John and Kayleigh have a happy ending. A charity screening of the two episodes is taking place in Blackpool next month before the rest of the UK gets to watch them, a tweet from Peter Kay's account announced on Thursday. It was the first tweet from the account since Kay said in December that he wascancelling his comeback tour- his first tour in eight years - due to ""unforeseen family circumstances"".

The event, on 7 April, will raise money for The Lily Foundation, which treats children with mitochondrial disease. In a statement, Kay said of the screening: ""I've had first-hand experience of the foundation's work and I'm proud to raise both awareness and much needed funds to help with the inspiring work they provide to children and their families."" It's not the first time there's been a charity screening of Car Share, with money raised for Comic Relief last March ahead of the launch of the second series. Will John and Kayleigh finally have a happy ending? The second series of Car Share ended with Kayleigh declaring her love for John. When he refused to say how he felt, she walked out of his car - and his life. The ending surprised and disappointed many viewers, who were convinced the show, about two employees thrown together in a company car share scheme, was building up to a romantic finish. Kay admittedin November that people had been ""angry"" about how the series had ended. At the time, he described Car Share Unscripted as ""half an hour of us basically making the script up and improvising,"" adding: ""It's nothing to do with the story - just us having a laugh."" Car Share won two Bafta TV Awards in 2016, for best scripted comedy and best male performance in a comedy programme.

'Artificial baby feeding' note criticised,"A hospital trust has been criticised for describing mothers who use formula milk as ""artificially"" feeding babies. Worcestershire Acute Hospitals NHS Trust made the comment in a letter that said it would no longer provide formula milk in its maternity units to mothers who had decided not to breastfeed. One woman who said she had been unable to breastfeed said the letter's wording made her ""sick to the stomach"". The trust said it would ""consider carefully"" feedback it had received. How formula milk shaped the modern workplace The mothers who share breast milk online Under the heading ""What do I need to bring with me if I wish to artificially feed my baby?"", the trust's letter said from 1 May expectant mothers who planned not to breastfeed would have to bring a first milk starter pack with them to hospital for when they gave birth. It added that if there was a medical reason for giving formula milk, ""this will be discussed with you and given if necessary"". The note was shared on Twitter by Kathryn Booth, who criticised its language and said mothers needed ""support and understanding"". Allow Twitter content?

U-turn on housing benefit for young,"Ministers have reversed a 2014 move stopping people under the age of 21 automatically getting housing benefit. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey said the change would ""reassure all young people that housing support is in place if they need it"". It was estimated that 10,000 young people would have been hit by the move. Labour welcomed the move which it says was one of its 2017 manifesto promises, but added that young people still struggle to get affordable housing. Ms McVey said that in return for the benefit ""young people in return will have a Youth Obligation - an intensive package of labour market support for 18-21 year-olds looking to get into work"". Idris Elba joins housing benefit critics Almost 30,000 lone parent families made homeless in England in 2017 May: Public anger over housing justified - PM In a written parliamentary statement she said: ""Universal Credit provides them with intensive, personalised support to move into employment, training or work experience; so no young person is left behind as they could be under the old benefits system."" She added that the decision means there are no ""unintended barriers"" young people trying to access housing face ""on the basis of their age alone"". Although there was an exemption for parents, carers and those who cannot live with their parents, around 10,000 people were thought to have been affected by the removal of the benefit in the year since its introduction. The removal had been criticised by charities, who claimed it added to the UK's homelessness problem. Housing charity Shelter said young people ""just need the helping hand that housing benefit can provide, so we're thrilled at the decision to provide support to all 18 to 21s if they need it"". Downing Street said the policy was scrapped partly because it was proving ""complicated"". The prime minister's official spokesman said that the government could not guarantee that a ""small number of vulnerable people"" were not experiencing ""unnecessary barriers to housing"". He added that ""96% of 18 to 21 year olds who were requesting support for housing costs were being granted it"". But Labour said the policy change did not go far enough, especially given that housing support levels would be frozen until 2020. ""The sight of young people sleeping on our streets has become all too common under this Conservative government. Behind the homelessness figures, there are many young adults having to sofa-surf or remain living with their parents,"" said Margaret Greenwood MP, the shadow work and pensions secretary. She said that Labour would ""invest in genuinely affordable housing"" and ""regulate the private rented sector"" so that ""all young people have a secure home"".

France's Sarkozy to face corruption trial,"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is to face trial for corruption and influence peddling, prosecutors say. The case centres on an alleged attempt by Mr Sarkozy to get a judge to reveal information about an investigation into illegal funding of his 2007 campaign. The judge and Mr Sarkozy's lawyer have also been ordered to stand trial. They have all denied wrongdoing. Mr Sarkozy's team says he will appeal against the decision. He faces other legal problems over campaign spending. In a separate case, the ex-president is accused of receiving funding from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In 2014, two years after being voted out of office, the former French president reportedly contacted Mr Azibert, then a senior magistrate at France's highest court, the Court of Cassation. Mr Sarkozy, 63, is accused of phoning him and offering to use his contacts to secure a prestigious role in Monaco for Mr Azibert, in exchange for the information on a financing case. Sarkozy's legal woes under investigation The call - in which Mr Sarkozy allegedly used the alias Paul Bismuth - was wiretapped by police. His challenge over the legality of the wiretaps was rejected. Mr Azibert is facing the same charges, as is one of the ex-president's lawyers, Thierry Herzog. The lawyer is accused of helping Mr Sarkozy contact Mr Azibert. In the funding scandal, Mr Sarkozy was accused of taking cash from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt to help him win the 2007 election. He was eventually cleared. Last week Mr Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation over allegations that he received campaign funding from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2007. He denies the claims, saying his Libyan accusers want revenge for his decision to send French warplanes during the 2011 uprising. Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy Mr Sarkozy also faces criminal proceedings over claims that he engaged in accounting fraud to exceed the limit for campaign expenditure in his failed bid for re-election in 2012. The case is known in France as the Bygmalion affair, after the name of the firm that allegedly provided false invoices to Mr Sarkozy's party rather than the campaign. Mr Sarkozy again denies any wrongdoing. Nicolas Sarkozy, a centre-right leader, trained as a lawyer but forged a career as a politician. He was mayor of the Paris suburb of Neuilly, and rose to be finance minister under President Jacques Chirac, before succeeding him as president in 2007. His term was overshadowed by the global economic crisis and resulting downturn. In 2008, he married Italian supermodel and singer Carla Bruni. The couple had a daughter, Giulia, a few months before the 2012 election. Nicolas Sarkozy married Carla Bruni after a whirlwind romance His re-election attempt was thwarted by socialist candidate FranÃ§ois Hollande, making him the first French president since 1981 not to win a second term. His 15-hour stay in police custody in 2014 - over the allegations relating to the wiretapped calls - was also unprecedented for an ex-president in France. Mr Sarkozy sought the presidency again in 2016, but the Republicans instead nominated ex-Prime Minister FranÃ§ois Fillon, who later lost toliberal Emmanuel Macron.

Cambridge Analytica files spell out tactics,"Documents shared by Cambridge Analytica whistleblower Christopher Wylie spell out how parent company SCL Group tried to influence elections worldwide. One letter also refers to its support of 15 psychological operations involving the UK's Ministry of Defence as of January 2012. The Foreign Office is quoted as saying another part of SCL was ""a joy to work with"" on a counter-terror operation. The files also refer to work done for Ambassador Bolton on US votes. This appears to be a reference to John Bolton, the former US ambassador to the UN. He was recently appointed as President Trump's National Security Adviser. The Guardian,externalhad previously reported on his involvement in a Cambridge Analytica experiment to target YouTube videos at profiled US voters. The political consultancy is in the spotlight after reports that it amassed the data of millions of Facebook users without their consent and used this in political campaigns. The firm has said that it ""destroyed"" the information when Facebook demanded, althoughChannel 4 News has reported,externalthat copies of at least part of the trove are still in circulation. ""We take allegations of unethical practices in the past by our former global (non-US) political consultancy very seriously, and they are currently the subject of a full and independent investigation which we have instigated to establish the facts,"" said Cambridge Analytica in a statementit published on Tuesday.,external ""Its findings will be made available in due course."" The files were released by the UK's Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Committee. They detail some of the work undertaken by Cambridge Analytica and companies it has been linked with, including SCL Group, Global Science Research and Aggregate IQ. Cambridge Analytica-linked firm 'boasted of poll interference' Cambridge Analytica offices searched over data storage The data firm's global influence Mr Wylie had referred to several of the documents in his appearance before the committee on Monday. In one document, SCL said that encouraging people ""not to vote"" might be more effective than trying to motivate swing voters. Describing its work in a Nigerian election, SCL Global said it had advised that ""rather than trying to motivate swing voters to vote for our clients, a more effective strategy might be to persuade opposition voters not to vote at all"". Christopher Wylie worked with Cambridge Analytica It said this had been achieved by ""organising anti-election rallies on the day of polling in opposition strongholds"" and using ""local religious figures to maximise their appeal especially among the spiritual, rural communities"". It boasted of devising a political graffiti campaign to create a youth ""movement"" in Trinidad and Tobago and of disseminating ""campaign messages that, whilst ostensibly coming from the youth, were unattributable to any specific party"". It said as a result ""a united youth movement was created"". In Latvia, it said it had recognised that ""unspoken ethnic tensions"" were ""at the heart of the election"". ""The locals secretly blamed the Russians for stealing their jobs... armed with this knowledge, SCL was able to reflect these real issues in its client's messaging,"" the document said. The files spell out how SCL helped the UK's Foreign and Commonwealth Office ""in strategic planning to counter violent jihadism"" in Pakistan. ""I wouldn't only recommend them, I'd work with them again in an instant,"" wrote an official, whose name has been redacted.

The strange expressions that have sprung out of Brexit,"The UK and the European Union are in talks about how they could live and work together after Brexit. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - here is what some of the key ones mean. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Britain's exit from the European Union. A period lasting from 31 January to 31 December 2020, when the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but still follows all its rules. It was agreed by the UK and the EU to allow both sides time to reach a deal on their future relationship. Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers such as: Taxes that must be paid when trading Limits on how much of certain goods can be imported Rules on things such as hygiene or labelling of food How the agreement between the EU and the UK would be enforced if there is a dispute. One controversial issue has been about what role, if any, the European Court of Justice should play. A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Rules on who can fish where, and how much of each species can be caught. A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements often include level playing field measures. EU laws which prevent a government in one country from supporting companies there - over competitors in another country. This support could be financial - for instance, allowing companies to borrow more cheaply, or charging them less in tax. The 2019 agreement which set out how the UK would leave the EU. It covered: Money the UK still has to pay the EU The rights of EU citizens who already live in the UK and UK citizens in the EU The Northern Ireland protocol is part of this agreement. It set out special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid the need for checks along the Irish border. This will be the situation if the UK and the EU don't reach a trade agreement by the end of 2020. It means that both sides would have to charge tariffs - or taxes - on goods crossing borders. If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under what's called WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, where each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering, and applies them equally to all its trading partners. The government currently refers to this as an ""Australian-style deal"".

What do we know so far?,"Police released CCTV showing two suspects arriving at Gatwick Airport on 2 March, whom the UK believes are from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU On 4 March, a former Russian spy and his daughter were found seriously ill on a bench in Salisbury. They had been poisoned by a nerve agent, in an attack ""almost certainly"" approved by the Russian state. An extraordinary series of accusations and denials from the highest levels of governments came in the months that followed, culminating in diplomatic expulsions and international sanctions. The attack on Sergei Skripal, 66, and his 33-year-old daughter, Yulia, in Salisbury, left them hospitalised for weeks. Police linked the attack to another poisoning in June in which Dawn Sturgess and her partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in nearby Amesbury, after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser. Ms Sturgess died in hospital in July. This video can not be played Dominic Casciani shows us the locations where Sergei Skripal spent Sunday 4 March with his daughter Yulia Skripal flew into London's Heathrow Airport from Russia at about 14:40 GMT on Saturday, 3 March On Sunday, 4 March, at about 09:15 GMT, Mr Skripal's car was seen in Salisbury around London Road, Churchill Way North and Wilton Road At 13:30 GMT his car was seen driving down Devizes Road, towards the town centre Mr Skripal and his daughter arrived at the Sainsbury's upper level car park at the Maltings shopping precinct at 13:40 GMT Police said the pair went to The Mill pub before going to Zizzi restaurant at 14:20 GMT, where they stayed until 15:35 GMT At 16:15 GMT, emergency services received the first report of an incident Police found the pair on a bench outside Zizzi in an ""extremely serious condition"" Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who fell ill after attending the incident, was treated in hospital but discharged on 22 March Det Sgt Nick Bailey was seriously ill 48 people were assessed in hospital in relation to the incident Ms Skripal was released from hospital on 9 April and her father was discharged on 18 May. Both were taken to a secure location Police believe the Skripals were ""targeted specifically"" and are treating the case as attempted murder. Detectives believe the pair first came into contact with the nerve agent Novichok at the front door of their home. Traces of Novichok were alsofound at the Mill and Zizzi, where the Skripals spent the afternoon. Up to 500 people who visited the pub or the restaurant at the same time weretold to wash their clothes and possessions. Officers later focused searches in and around Mr Skripal's home and a nearby children's play area at Montgomery Gardens was cordoned off by police. Police appealed for anyone who saw the pair in Mr Skripal's red BMW - licence plate number HD09 WAO - on the morning of the attack. Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident A vehicle that is believed to have been used by Mr Skripal's friend to pick up Yulia from the airport on 3 March was removed from Durrington, Wiltshire, by the Army on 19 March. Witness Jamie Paine said he saw a woman on a bench frothing at the mouth and her eyes ""were wide open but completely white"". A doctor, who was shopping with her husband in the city centre on Sunday, said Ms Skripal was ""slumped in her seat, completely unconscious"" and had lost control of her bodily functions. This video can not be played Witness: ""They looked like they'd been taking something quite strong"" The investigation has so far involved 250 specialist counter-terrorism officers and about 180 military personnel, who were deployed to Salisbury to help remove vehicles and objects that may have been contaminated. Prof Dame Sally Davies, the chief medical officer for England, stressed the risk of harm to the public was ""low"" but there was some concern that prolonged exposure could cause health problems. Personnel from the Defence Chemical Biological Radiological and Nuclear Centre at Porton Down in Wiltshire identified the nerve agent. Its head saidthe precise source of the nerve agent had not been verified, but it was likely to have been deployed by a ""state actor"". Experts from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) tested samples of the chemical. Russia accused Britain of blocking access to the OPCW inquiry, but its proposal for a new, joint investigationwas voted down at the international chemical weapons watchdog at The Hagueon 4 April. Russia lost the vote by 15 votes to six, while 17 member states abstained. Police are appealing for information on Alexander Petrov (left) and Ruslan Boshirov Two Russian nationals, who go by the names Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, are suspects in the attempted murder. They are understood to have arrived at Gatwick Airport on Russian passports from Moscow on 2 March, and stayed at the City Stay Hotel in Bow Road, east London. The following day they visited Salisbury for reconnaissance before contaminating Mr Skripal's front door with Novichok on 4 March, police say. Officers believe a modified perfume bottle was used to spray the door. The pair flew from Heathrow to Moscow later that same night. The men, whose movements were captured on various CCTV cameras, are thought to be aged about 40 and operating under aliases. The officers are thought to be from Russia's military intelligence service, the GRU, and the attack was ""almost certainly"" approved at a senior level of the Russian state, Theresa May has said. In an interview with Russia's state-run international broadcaster, RT, the men said they were tourists, in the UK to visit the ""wonderful town"" of Salisbury andsee its famous cathedral. Details have since emerged showing the man calling himself Alexander Petrov has made around 10 trips to Europe in the last two years. Documents first obtained by the investigative group Bellingcat, shared with the BBC, show that as well as visiting Paris, Geneva and Amsterdam, he appears to have visited the UK three times. He seems to have visited once in September 2016, again between 28 February and 5 March 2017 and finally in March this year- during the period Sergei Skripal was poisoned. On the final visit, the pair both travelled on genuine Russian passports. Recently published pages from Mr Petrov's passport dossiers contain unusual stamps and a blank page where there is normally biographical data - all evidence which may point to the men being undercover intelligence officers, BBC security correspondent Gordon Corera said. An investigation by Bellingcat has claimed thereal identity of the man calling himself Ruslan Boshirov is actually Colonel Anatoliy Chepiga- a highly decorated military officer. Bellingcat later said the suspect calling himselfAlexander Petrov is Alexander Mishkin, a doctorwho has worked for Russian intelligence since 2010. This video can not be played President Vladimir Putin says the suspects are civilians Since the attack, the Kremlin's media machine has responded with a combination of denials and sarcasm. Russian President Vladimir Putin said the two suspects are civilians, not criminals and he hoped the men would tell their story soon. A day later an interview with the men was broadcast by Russia's state-run international broadcaster. The Russian foreign ministry had previously called Mrs May's allegations ""insane"", and said the names and photographs of the two suspects ""do not mean anything to Moscow"". At a UN Security Council meeting in September to discuss the attack, Russia dismissed evidence presented by the UK as ""lies"". In a lengthy rebuttal of the allegations, Russia accused the UK of ""disgusting anti-Russian hysteria"". Russian ambassador to the UN, Vasily Nebenzya, accused the British authorities of ""Russiaphobia"" and misleading the international community and its own citizens. Mission implausible: Russians mock improbable spy duo Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Putin, power and poison: Russiaâs elite FSB spy club Previously, a Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman said the UK was one of the most likely sources of the nerve agent, along with the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Sweden or possibly the United States. Another theory - offered by Russia's EU ambassador, Vladimir Chizhov - suggested a UK research laboratory in Wiltshire could be the source. No. Prosecutors will not apply to Russia for the men to be extradited because Russia does not have extradition agreements with the UK. However, a European Arrest Warrant has been obtained, should they travel to the EU. Sue Hemming, of the UK Crown Prosecution Service (CPS), said there was enough evidence to provide a ""realistic prospect of conviction"" and it was ""clearly in the public interest"" to charge them with the Salisbury attack. Police say officers continue to work with the CPS on the Amesbury incident. Could the suspects be returned to the UK? Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK. In recent years Mr Skripal is thought to have given lectures at military academies offering insights into Russia's foreign military intelligence agency, the GRU. A friend from college, Vladimir Svyatski, described Mr Skripal as ""very active, with a positive attitude and creative"". Former colleague Oleg Ivanov told the BBC he was ""the life and soul of the party"". Hiscondition improved from critical to stableon 6 April, and Salisbury District Hospital said he was  responding well to treatment and ""improving rapidly"". He was discharged on 18 May and moved to a secure location. Read more about the poisoned spy Skripal and the 14 deaths under scrutiny Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father His daughter, Yulia, regularly travelled to the UK from her Moscow home to visit her father, relatives told the BBC. ""She told me she liked everything [in the UK],"" childhood friend Irina Petrova said. ""They had an amazing place, and amazing house."" She had an ""excellent"" relationship with her father, Ms Petrova said, and had been the ""perfect kid"", achieving excellent grades at school. Ms Skripal, who friends say worked for multinationals including Nike and PepsiCo, was ""always smiling, just like her mother"", Ms Petrova added. The 33-year-old was discharged from Salisbury District Hospital on 9 April and taken to a secure location. It is not known what long-term effects she might suffer. This video can not be played CCTV shows Sergei Skripal at a shop in Salisbury just five days before he and his daughter collapsed Mr Skripal's wife, Liudmila, died in 2012 after suffering from cancer. His elder brother and son have died in the past two years. Some of the deaths, the family believe, happened in suspicious circumstances. The grave of Liudmila Skripal, Sergei's wife, is in London Road Cemetery in Salisbury His son, Alexander Skripal, died aged 43 last July in St Petersburg from liver failure. He is buried in Salisbury, close to his mother. Mr Skripal's family deny that he worked for MI6 and believe that the espionage case was fabricated by Russia. On 5 April, an unverified recording purported to be between Yulia Skripal and her cousin, Viktoria Skripal, who lives in Russia, was broadcast on Russian TV. In the recording, Viktoria said she hoped to travel to the UK to visit her relatives, if she can get a visa, but the voice said to be Yulia's tells her that no-one will give her one. The Foreign Office said its Moscow embassy was expected to give Viktoria a visa and that she would be given full consular help in the UK. Doubts have been cast on the authenticity of the recording. In the weeks after the poisoning, Theresa May pointed the finger at Russia and expelled 23 Russian diplomats and their families from the UK. She also said: Ministers and the Royal Family would not attend the Fifa World Cup in Russia Russian state assets would be frozen if there was evidence they would be used as a weapon against UK nationals and residents Checks on private flights, customs and freight would be increased All planned high-level contacts between the UK and Russia would be suspended The state invitation to Russian's foreign minister Sergei Lavrov was retracted In solidarity, 29 countries, including the US, Canada, Germany and France, expelled 145 Russian officials - and Nato ordered 10 Russians out of its mission in Belgium. Moscow initially responded in kind, expelling 23 British diplomats, 60 US diplomats and several from other countries. It also closed the British Council in Russia and the British Consulate in St Petersburg. Russia then increased that number to 50, as its ambassador in the UK said Moscow had no nerve agent stockpile. Since the UK named the two suspects, US, France, Germany and Canada have agreed that the Russian government ""almost certainly"" approved the poisoning of the Skripals. Together they have urged Russia to provide full disclosure of its Novichok programme. Referring to the expulsion of Russian diplomats from their countries, the leaders said they had already ""taken action together to disrupt the activities of the GRU"". GRU officers are often stationed in embassies around the world. Dawn Sturgess and Charlie Rowley were poisoned by Novichok Police are linking the attack on the Skripals to a separate Novichok poisoning on 30 June in Amesbury, that led to the death of 44-year-old mother-of-three Dawn Sturgess. She and her partner Charlie Rowleywere exposed to the nerve agent after handling a contaminated perfume dispenser, labelled Nina Ricci Premier Jour. Mr Rowley told police he found the box containing a small bottle and an applicator - all found to be counterfeit - in a charity bin. He tried to put the two parts together and got some of the contents on himself. Ms Sturgess applied some of the contents to her wrists and became unwell. Scotland Yard said the bottle, with a modified nozzle, had contained a ""significant amount"" of Novichok. The counterfeit perfume bottle recovered from Mr Rowley's home and the box police say it came in. The name Novichok means ""newcomer"" in Russian, and applies to a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union in the 1970s and 1980s. Novichok agents are liquids, although others are thought to exist in solid form and could be dispersed as an ultra-fine powder. Some of the agents are also said to be ""binary weapons"", meaning the nerve agent is typically stored as two less toxic chemical ingredients that are easier to handle. When these are mixed, they react to produce the active toxic agent which can cause convulsions, shortness of breath, profuse sweating and nausea. Read more about Novichok nerve agents The possibility of an unknown substance being involved has drawn comparisons with the 2006 poisoning ofAlexander Litvinenko. The former Russian intelligence officer died in London after drinking tea laced with a radioactive substance. Apublic inquiry concludedthat his killing had probably been carried out with the approval of the Russian President, Vladimir Putin. An investigation by Buzzfeed News,externalclaimed that there have been at least 14 deaths in the UK that US officials suspected were connected to Russia.

Russia expels US diplomats,"The US Consulate in St Petersburg is to be closed Russia has expelled 60 US diplomats and closed the St Petersburg consulate in a tit-for-tat response to US action over a spy poisoning case in the UK. Russia's foreign minister said other countries that expelled Russians could expect a ""symmetrical"" response. On Friday, several ambassadors from Western countries were summoned to the Russian foreign ministry. The move comes amid a row over the nerve agent attack on a former Russian spy and his daughter in the UK. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia were found unconscious on a bench in the city of Salisbury on 4 March, and the UK government has blamed Russia for the attack. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33, have been in hospital since the attack Russia has vehemently denied any role in the Salisbury attack. Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition.His daughter's condition is said to be improving. More than 20 countries have expelled Russian envoys in solidarity with the UK. Among them is the US, which earlier this week ordered 60 diplomats to leave and closed the Russian consulate general in Seattle. How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? Full coverage of the Russia spy poisoning Russia declared 58 US diplomats in Moscow and two in the city of Yekaterinburg to be ""personae non gratae"". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Russia would respond ""in kind"" Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said US ambassador Jon Huntsman had been informed of the ""retaliatory measures"". ""As for the other countries, everything will also be symmetrical in terms of the number of people from their diplomatic missions who will be leaving Russia,"" he added. Later, a US state department spokeswoman said America reserved the right to take further action. The Russian foreign minister also accused Britain of ""forcing everyone to follow an anti-Russian course"". He said Moscow was responding to ""absolutely unacceptable actions that are taken against us under very harsh pressure from the United States and Britain under the pretext of the so-called Skripal case"". He reiterated Russian calls for consular access to Yulia Skripal - a Russian citizen. Russia, he said, was also seeking a meeting with leaders of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) to ""establish the truth"". Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? What was the Cold War? Russian spy: The story so far Following the incident in Salisbury, British Prime Minister Theresa May announced a series of sanctions, including the expulsion of 23 Russian diplomats alleged to be intelligence agents. The Kremlin responded by expelling an equal number of UK diplomats and closing the country's British Council. Then - in what has been cited as the largest collective expulsion of Russian intelligence officers in history - more than 20 governments expelled diplomats in their countries. UK National Security Adviser Mark Sedwill, speaking in Washington on Thursday, said expulsions by Western countries were aimed at rooting out covert Russian intelligence networks. Britain says the chemical used in the attack was part of a group of nerve agents developed by the Soviet Union known as Novichok. Experts from the OPCW arrived in the UK on 19 March to test samples. The results are expected to take a minimum of two weeks, the government says. Police say the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at Mr Skripal's home in Salisbury, with the highest concentration found on the front door.

"Police, the public & the poison","Police stand outside the home of Sergei Skripal It is clear that Sergei Skripal's house was not regarded as crucial to the investigation, or a potential health risk, until several days after the incident. The BBC was told on Monday, 5 March, the day after the attack, thatformer Russia spy Mr Skripal,externaland his daughter Yulia, had been poisoned in Salisbury. This had not been made public and the police refused to discuss it. Russian spy: What we know so far Russian spy: What are Novichok agents? Skripal niece: 'I'd really like to know how they are' Even when questioned about false reports that drug-taking was the cause, Wiltshire Police press officers would only say they did not know where that had come from. At that point, Wiltshire Police had simply said it was dealing with a major incident after two people were exposed to an 'unknown substance in Salisbury'. Allow Twitter content?

A number of locations were said to have been cordoned off. As part of our attempts to check what we had been told we went to Mr Skripal's publicly listed address, arriving around 24 hours after the incident at the Maltings Shopping Centre - the area where the pair had collapsed. There was a police car on the drive, an officer sitting inside, but there was no cordon.  We were able to walk within a few metres of the door, but we didn't knock. We were aware there might be a health risk, and one of our team had received past training in chemical and biological threats. There is no suggestion the police had not assessed the risk at the house. But the response was markedly different there compared to the measures in place at Salisbury District Hospital, and the Maltings, where a team in full protective gear had already carried out some decontamination. Members of the emergency services in biohazard suits afix a tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found At 18:00 GMT that day, the BBC broke the news that Mr Skripal was at the centre of the incident. Meanwhile police were reviewing CCTV images and realised the pair had visited the Zizzi restaurant and a nearby pub. These sites were sealed off that evening, after closing time. Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? When is a diplomat really just a spy? Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? But, only on Thursday, 8 March, four days after the poisoning, did police cordon off Mr Skripal's street, and begin a forensic and scientific examination, with full protection. There were other places which were left open to the public for days, including the cemetery, where the couple are thought to have visited Sergei's son's grave. Forensic police work at the grave site where Sergei Skripal's wife and son are buried The BBC understands police believe the nerve agent was left on the door handleat the house and that the father and daughter had it on their hands.  They drove into town, parking close to the Maltings shopping area. A car park ticket machine they may have touched was only covered around eight days after the incident. Public Health England released limited information that week, but only on Sunday, 11 March, after the BBC revealed that the nerve agent had been detected in the Zizzi restaurant,was detailed advice issued. People who had been at the restaurant and a pub, the Mill, were told to wash or bag their clothing. Other than the Skripals,the only person seriously affected was DS Nick Baileywho is believed to have visited the house. Even a doctor who treated Yulia Skripal that day and came into close contact with her told the BBC she has experienced no symptoms.  Dozens of others sought medical advice but have been assessed as in the clear. However the authorities have not given detailed information about what they know of the nerve agent's potency over time, and the form it had taken.The government's Porton Down facilityhas been studying the Novichok-class substance for several weeks. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The handling of this chilling incident is likely to be reviewed at least internally by the emergency services, and questions may be asked about whether the public was given enough information and protection in the early stages. But it is also clear that this is an extremely difficult investigation. The authorities not only have to piece together when and how someone might have targeted the Skripals. They also have to manage the massive decontamination operation of public spaces which were affected by the deliberate use of a chemical weapon in a British city.

Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon,"The UK and the European Union are in talks about how they could live and work together after Brexit. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - here is what some of the key ones mean. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Britain's exit from the European Union. A period lasting from 31 January to 31 December 2020, when the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but still follows all its rules. It was agreed by the UK and the EU to allow both sides time to reach a deal on their future relationship. Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers such as: Taxes that must be paid when trading Limits on how much of certain goods can be imported Rules on things such as hygiene or labelling of food How the agreement between the EU and the UK would be enforced if there is a dispute. One controversial issue has been about what role, if any, the European Court of Justice should play. A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Rules on who can fish where, and how much of each species can be caught. A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements often include level playing field measures. EU laws which prevent a government in one country from supporting companies there - over competitors in another country. This support could be financial - for instance, allowing companies to borrow more cheaply, or charging them less in tax. The 2019 agreement which set out how the UK would leave the EU. It covered: Money the UK still has to pay the EU The rights of EU citizens who already live in the UK and UK citizens in the EU The Northern Ireland protocol is part of this agreement. It set out special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid the need for checks along the Irish border. This will be the situation if the UK and the EU don't reach a trade agreement by the end of 2020. It means that both sides would have to charge tariffs - or taxes - on goods crossing borders. If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under what's called WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, where each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering, and applies them equally to all its trading partners. The government currently refers to this as an ""Australian-style deal"".

Britain's oldest men mark 110th birthday,"Alf Smith celebrated his birthday at his home in Perthshire Britain's two oldest men, born on the same day, have been celebrating their 110th birthdays. Alf Smith, from St Madoes in Perthshire, and Robert Weighton, from Hull, were born on 29 March 1908. Robert, who now lives in Alton in Hampshire, said he was just ""one of the lucky ones"" to live so long. Alfred, who continued to work on his farm at Kinfauns near Perth into his 80s, said he benefited from having a job he enjoyed. The men have never met but exchanged birthday cards in recent years. Robert Weighton said living so long was largely a matter of luck It is not known which of the men was born first. They have now lived through two world wars and 29 general elections. Both have also spent a period of time in Canada. Alfred was born in Invergowrie, the fifth of six sons in his family. Before he was 20, he emigrated to Canada but returned to Scotland five years later. With his wife Isobel, he farmed at Kinfauns, and they had two children. Although Alfred retired at the age of 70, he continued to help on the farm well into his 80s. He remembers farm life before tractors replaced horses and farm hands. Asked what might explain his longevity, Alfred said: ""Porridge, of course! I like my porridge and I eat it every day. ""That is helpful and having a job you enjoy. ""I like to think I've lived a decent life. I do ask myself - why me? Why have I lived so long when others haven't?"" His daughter Irene puts it down to his work as a farmer. She said: ""He says he enjoyed what he did and he has had a good life. ""He has been within two or three miles of the river Tay all his life like his father and grandfather before him."" Robert was born in Hull and was one of seven children Robert was born in Hull. He worked as an engineer, spending time in Taiwan, Japan and Canada. He now lives in a flat in a care complex at Alton. ""I have not lived my life avoiding being run over by buses or getting cancer or anything else,"" he said. ""I've done nothing to deserve or achieve this age. I'm just one of the lucky ones.""

Queen's Maundy coins mark women's voteThe Queen carries out the Royal Maundy service at Windsor Castle without the Duke of Edinburgh.,"This video can not be played The Queen presents 184 people with Maundy money The Queen has marked Maundy Thursday by giving out commemorative coins to pensioners, as part of a traditional royal service at Windsor Castle. Ninety-two women and 92 men were presented with the coins, some marking 100 years since women got the right to vote, in recognition of their service to the church and community. The Duke of Edinburgh decided not to take part, Buckingham Palace said. Maundy Thursday is a Christian holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter. The event, dating back to the 13th Century, was held at St George's Chapel - wherePrince Harry and Meghan Markle will be married in May. At the service, the Queen carried a nosegay made up of daffodils, primroses, stocks, purple statice, freesias, rosemary, thyme and ivy leaves. The recipients, who were chosen by ministers and members of the clergy, received a red and a white purse. The red one contained a Â£5 coin marking four generations of royalty, and a 50p piece commemorating the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave some women the right to vote for the first time. The white purse has silver penny pieces which add up to the value of 92p - the Queen's age. Unlike last year, the Queen was not joined by the Duke of Edinburgh The colourful nosegay she held was also carried by schoolchildren Despite Prince Philip taking part last year and being listed in the order of service, he was not present at the ceremony.

Ex-spy's daughter 'conscious and talking',"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33 were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Yulia Skripal, the daughter of ex-spy Sergei Skripal, is improving rapidly and no longer in a critical condition, says the hospital treating her. She and her father were admitted nearly four weeks agoafter being exposed to a nerve agent in Salisbury. The BBC understands from separate sources that Ms Skripal is conscious and talking. However Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition, Salisbury District Hospital said. Doctors said Ms Skripal, ""has responded well to treatment but continues to receive expert clinical care 24 hours a day"". Were people properly protected in the incident aftermath? ""I want to take this opportunity to once again thank the staff of Salisbury District Hospital for delivering such high quality care to these patients over the last few weeks,"" said Dr Christine Blanshard, Medical Director for Salisbury District Hospital. ""I am very proud both of our front-line staff and all those who support them."" BBC correspondent Duncan Kennedy says a corner appears to have been turned for Yulia Skripal, who is now in a stable condition. However there is no news on what the long-term damage might be, he adds. Meanwhile the police have placed cordons round a children's play area at Montgomery Gardens near Mr Skripal's home. ""Officers will be searching it as a precautionary measure,"" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon. The Skripals were admitted to hospital on 4 March after being found collapsed on a bench at the Maltings shopping centre in Salisbury. Russian spy: What we know so far Nato slashes Russia staff after poisoning Spy's front door focus of poisoning probe Police have been treating the case as attempted murder. On Wednesday, police said the Skripals first came into contact with the nerve agent at the former Russian spy's home in Salisbury. Police stand outside the house believed to be the home of Sergei Skripal Forensic tests show the highest concentration was found on the front door. The nerve agent was found at other locations in the town but in lower concentrations, the Metropolitan Police said. A police officer who fell seriously ill after responding to the attack - Det Sgt Nick Bailey -was treated in hospital but was discharged on 22 March. Russian spy: What are Novichok agents? What the diplomat expulsions tell us What next for Russiaâs spy networks? DS Bailey, who is believed to have visited Mr Skripal's house after the incident has spoken of his ordeal, saying: ""Normal life for me will probably never be the same."" The British government has accused the Russian state of involvement in the attack - a claim Moscow has denied. Prime Minister Theresa May said the chemical used had been identified as being part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia known as Novichok. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external In response to the incident, Mrs May announced a series of sanctions including the expulsion of23 Russian diplomats. As a counter-measure the Kremlin said it would expelan equal number of British diplomatsfrom Russia and close down the country's British Council.

"The police, the public and the poison","Police stand outside the home of Sergei Skripal It is clear that Sergei Skripal's house was not regarded as crucial to the investigation, or a potential health risk, until several days after the incident. The BBC was told on Monday, 5 March, the day after the attack, thatformer Russia spy Mr Skripal,externaland his daughter Yulia, had been poisoned in Salisbury. This had not been made public and the police refused to discuss it. Russian spy: What we know so far Russian spy: What are Novichok agents? Skripal niece: 'I'd really like to know how they are' Even when questioned about false reports that drug-taking was the cause, Wiltshire Police press officers would only say they did not know where that had come from. At that point, Wiltshire Police had simply said it was dealing with a major incident after two people were exposed to an 'unknown substance in Salisbury'. Allow Twitter content?

A number of locations were said to have been cordoned off. As part of our attempts to check what we had been told we went to Mr Skripal's publicly listed address, arriving around 24 hours after the incident at the Maltings Shopping Centre - the area where the pair had collapsed. There was a police car on the drive, an officer sitting inside, but there was no cordon.  We were able to walk within a few metres of the door, but we didn't knock. We were aware there might be a health risk, and one of our team had received past training in chemical and biological threats. There is no suggestion the police had not assessed the risk at the house. But the response was markedly different there compared to the measures in place at Salisbury District Hospital, and the Maltings, where a team in full protective gear had already carried out some decontamination. Members of the emergency services in biohazard suits afix a tent over the bench where Sergei and Yulia Skripal were found At 18:00 GMT that day, the BBC broke the news that Mr Skripal was at the centre of the incident. Meanwhile police were reviewing CCTV images and realised the pair had visited the Zizzi restaurant and a nearby pub. These sites were sealed off that evening, after closing time. Sergei Skripal: Who is the former Russian colonel? When is a diplomat really just a spy? Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? But, only on Thursday, 8 March, four days after the poisoning, did police cordon off Mr Skripal's street, and begin a forensic and scientific examination, with full protection. There were other places which were left open to the public for days, including the cemetery, where the couple are thought to have visited Sergei's son's grave. Forensic police work at the grave site where Sergei Skripal's wife and son are buried The BBC understands police believe the nerve agent was left on the door handleat the house and that the father and daughter had it on their hands.  They drove into town, parking close to the Maltings shopping area. A car park ticket machine they may have touched was only covered around eight days after the incident. Public Health England released limited information that week, but only on Sunday, 11 March, after the BBC revealed that the nerve agent had been detected in the Zizzi restaurant,was detailed advice issued. People who had been at the restaurant and a pub, the Mill, were told to wash or bag their clothing. Other than the Skripals,the only person seriously affected was DS Nick Baileywho is believed to have visited the house. Even a doctor who treated Yulia Skripal that day and came into close contact with her told the BBC she has experienced no symptoms.  Dozens of others sought medical advice but have been assessed as in the clear. However the authorities have not given detailed information about what they know of the nerve agent's potency over time, and the form it had taken.The government's Porton Down facilityhas been studying the Novichok-class substance for several weeks. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The handling of this chilling incident is likely to be reviewed at least internally by the emergency services, and questions may be asked about whether the public was given enough information and protection in the early stages. But it is also clear that this is an extremely difficult investigation. The authorities not only have to piece together when and how someone might have targeted the Skripals. They also have to manage the massive decontamination operation of public spaces which were affected by the deliberate use of a chemical weapon in a British city.

Barclays pays $2bn to settle US fraud case,"This video can not be played Jes Staley wants 'to protect the integrity of the bank' Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn (Â£1.4bn) to settle a lawsuit brought by the US government over the sale of mortgage-backed securities. The US alleged that the bank had misled investors about the quality of loans backing the securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said the bank was ""pleased that we have been able to reach a fair and proportionate settlement"". The bank did not admit liability. US attorney for the eastern district of New York Richard Donoghue said: ""The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives have agreed to pay is an important step in recognising the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in residential mortgage-backed securities."" Barclays said the settlement resolves ""all actual and potential civil claims"" by the US Department of Justice related to the case, which involved the sale of securities between 2005 and 2007. Mr Staley added: ""It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible. ""The completion of our restructuring in 2017, and putting significant legacy matters like this one behind us, mean Barclays is well positioned to produce stronger earnings going forward, and to start returning a greater proportion of those earnings to our shareholders over time."" Two former Barclays executives also agreed to pay a total of $2m. Paul Menefee, who was Barclay's subprime securitisation head, and John Carroll, Barclays' head trader for subprime loan acquisitions, agreed to pay the money to dismiss all claims against them. Federal prosecutors said,externalthat the alleged scheme involved 36 residential mortgage-backed security deals covering more than $31bn of mortgage loans. More than half of the mortgages backing the securities defaulted, the suit alleged. Investors had included credit unions, pension plans, charitable and religious organisations, university endowments, and financial institutions. Barclays reviews lending on Brexit caution.

GKN beaten by Melrose in takeover fight,"GKN is a partner on the F-35 joint strike aircraft One of Britain's oldest engineering firms has been sold for Â£8.1bn to a controversial investment firm. GKN, which has had a hand in making everything from Minis to Spitfires, lost its battle to stay independent. Melrose Industries, which specialises in turning round troubled manufacturing businesses and selling them on, won the backing of 52% of GKN shareholders. Business Secretary Greg Clark said Melrose now had to honour its commitments to stay UK based. Labour called Melrose a ""short-termist asset-stripper"" and condemned the deal. Admitting defeat, GKN's management said it would now work with Melrose to ensure the success of the new company. The battle for GKN, which employs 58,000 staff worldwide, 6,000 of them in the UK, drew protests from government, unions and GKN customers. GKN's board had promised it would overhaul itself and sell off its car parts division, but it was not enough to stop investors agreeing to sell their shares to Melrose. Christopher Miller, chairman of Melrose, said: ""We are delighted and grateful to have received support from GKN shareholders for our plan to create a UK industrial powerhouse with a market capitalisation of over Â£10bn and a tremendous future."" News of the successful bid sent GKN's share price up over 6% to 450p. Melrose's offer is equivalent to 462p a share. GKN's businesses cover aerospace and automotive engineering. Its Driveline division makes systems for roughly half the world's passenger cars and light trucks. Its aerospace division is a major supplier to the US military and a key partner on defence programmes such as the F-35 joint strike aircraft in which the UK government has a stake. Melrose's strategy,externalit says, is to keep the company together ""to improve all of the businesses in GKN, only realising their value once they have reached full potential."" GKN Driveline supplies some of the world's biggest car manufacturers However, what happens afterwards has alarmed politicians and unions and some of GKN's customers. Mr Clark said: ""During the bid, Melrose made commitments which they are bound to honour including investment in research and development and maintaining itself as a UK business. ""Now that shareholders have made their decision the government has a statutory responsibility to consider whether the merger in its proposed final form gives rise to public interest concerns in the areas of media plurality, financial stability and national security. ""This assessment will be made by the appropriate authorities and the conclusion set out in due course."" Airbus has said new business with GKN after a Melrose takeover would be ""practically impossible"" Before Melrose won the bid Airbus, which is supplied by GKN, said it would be ""practically impossible"" to give new business to GKN if Melrose's offer was accepted because it damaged long-term investment prospects in the company, which could reduce R&D budgets and limit innovation. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the ADS trade organisation, which represents the aerospace and defence sectors, said: ""GKN is an important part of the UK industrial landscape and it is important that its owners continue to invest for the long-term and support high value jobs both directly and throughout its UK supply chain."" The Unite union said it would be holding Melrose's ""feet to the fire"" over concessions it had made in recent days and seeking ""concrete guarantees"" on job security, investment and future work in the UK. Melrose launched its bid in January, initially at Â£7bn. It increased that this month to Â£8.1bn, with up to another Â£1bn to support the pension fund. It argued that it could increase GKN's profitability which has been falling steadily over the last five years. In the run up to the bid, GKN had also suffered a crisis of leadership, with its chief executive-in-waiting, Kevin Cummings, forced to step down after problems in the company's US aerospace division. The new chief executive, Anne Stevens, a former Ford executive, devised a plan to merge GKN's Driveline with the US car components group Dana to create a new company. GKN would have got a 47% stake in it and $1.8bn (Â£1.28bn) in cash from Dana. But Melrose called the plans ""panicked and fraught with contradictions"".

Queen's Maundy coins mark women's vote,"This video can not be played The Queen presents 184 people with Maundy money The Queen has marked Maundy Thursday by giving out commemorative coins to pensioners, as part of a traditional royal service at Windsor Castle. Ninety-two women and 92 men were presented with the coins, some marking 100 years since women got the right to vote, in recognition of their service to the church and community. The Duke of Edinburgh decided not to take part, Buckingham Palace said. Maundy Thursday is a Christian holy day falling on the Thursday before Easter. The event, dating back to the 13th Century, was held at St George's Chapel - wherePrince Harry and Meghan Markle will be married in May. At the service, the Queen carried a nosegay made up of daffodils, primroses, stocks, purple statice, freesias, rosemary, thyme and ivy leaves. The recipients, who were chosen by ministers and members of the clergy, received a red and a white purse. The red one contained a Â£5 coin marking four generations of royalty, and a 50p piece commemorating the Representation of the People Act 1918, which gave some women the right to vote for the first time. The white purse has silver penny pieces which add up to the value of 92p - the Queen's age. Unlike last year, the Queen was not joined by the Duke of Edinburgh The colourful nosegay she held was also carried by schoolchildren Despite Prince Philip taking part last year and being listed in the order of service, he was not present at the ceremony. A palace spokeswoman said: ""The order of service was printed some weeks ago when it was hoped the duke would be able to take part. His Royal Highness has since decided not to attend.""

Royal Maundy is a religious service held on the day before Good Friday, which commemorates the night of the Last Supper as told in the Bible. The origins of the ceremony, which is part of Easter celebrations, come from the commandment Christ gave after washing his disciples' feet. Historically, it has involved handing out food and clothing and cleaning the poor. The pope traditionally bathes and kisses the feet of 12 people who are normally members of the Church.

PC 'tried to stop daughter's prosecution',"The woman was pulled over in the early hours of 28 October A police officer allegedly tried to prevent his daughter from being prosecuted for driving while talking to him on a mobile phone. The Avon and Somerset Police officer, known as ""PC B"", is said to have urged volunteer officers to drop the case after the incident last October. He is alleged to have told the special constables it was a ""mistake"" and to leave the matter to him. The officer faces a three-day gross misconduct hearing next week. The woman handed her mobile phone to two special constables who had pulled her over at about 01:00 GMT on 28 October, and PC B allegedly told them she had only been driving for a couple of months and could lose her licence. It is alleged he repeatedly told them they should leave the matter to him and he would talk to her at home, Local Democracy Reporter Jack Pitts writes. Documents released ahead of the hearing say he told the special constables it was ""just a silly mistake"", and that he continually questioned the account of one of them. The papers claim that PC B ""deliberately sought to place pressure on the special constables to take no action against his daughter"". ""In the alternative, it is alleged that regardless of PC B's intentions, he caused or permitted the special constables to feel pressured."" Driving whilst using a mobile phone can lead to a six point penalty and a Â£200 fine, and newly qualified drivers can lose their licence. The misconduct hearing will take place on 4 April.

Sarkozy to face corruption trial,"Former French President Nicolas Sarkozy is to face trial for corruption and influence peddling, prosecutors say. The case centres on an alleged attempt by Mr Sarkozy to get a judge to reveal information about an investigation into illegal funding of his 2007 campaign. The judge and Mr Sarkozy's lawyer have also been ordered to stand trial. They have all denied wrongdoing. Mr Sarkozy's team says he will appeal against the decision. He faces other legal problems over campaign spending. In a separate case, the ex-president is accused of receiving funding from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. In 2014, two years after being voted out of office, the former French president reportedly contacted Mr Azibert, then a senior magistrate at France's highest court, the Court of Cassation. Mr Sarkozy, 63, is accused of phoning him and offering to use his contacts to secure a prestigious role in Monaco for Mr Azibert, in exchange for the information on a financing case. Sarkozy's legal woes under investigation The call - in which Mr Sarkozy allegedly used the alias Paul Bismuth - was wiretapped by police. His challenge over the legality of the wiretaps was rejected. Mr Azibert is facing the same charges, as is one of the ex-president's lawyers, Thierry Herzog. The lawyer is accused of helping Mr Sarkozy contact Mr Azibert. In the funding scandal, Mr Sarkozy was accused of taking cash from L'Oreal heiress Liliane Bettencourt to help him win the 2007 election. He was eventually cleared. Last week Mr Sarkozy was placed under formal investigation over allegations that he received campaign funding from late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2007. He denies the claims, saying his Libyan accusers want revenge for his decision to send French warplanes during the 2011 uprising. Profile: Nicolas Sarkozy Mr Sarkozy also faces criminal proceedings over claims that he engaged in accounting fraud to exceed the limit for campaign expenditure in his failed bid for re-election in 2012. The case is known in France as the Bygmalion affair, after the name of the firm that allegedly provided false invoices to Mr Sarkozy's party rather than the campaign. Mr Sarkozy again denies any wrongdoing. Nicolas Sarkozy, a centre-right leader, trained as a lawyer but forged a career as a politician. He was mayor of the Paris suburb of Neuilly, and rose to be finance minister under President Jacques Chirac, before succeeding him as president in 2007. His term was overshadowed by the global economic crisis and resulting downturn. In 2008, he married Italian supermodel and singer Carla Bruni. The couple had a daughter, Giulia, a few months before the 2012 election. Nicolas Sarkozy married Carla Bruni after a whirlwind romance His re-election attempt was thwarted by socialist candidate FranÃ§ois Hollande, making him the first French president since 1981 not to win a second term. His 15-hour stay in police custody in 2014 - over the allegations relating to the wiretapped calls - was also unprecedented for an ex-president in France. Mr Sarkozy sought the presidency again in 2016, but the Republicans instead nominated ex-Prime Minister FranÃ§ois Fillon, who later lost toliberal Emmanuel Macron.

Breaking|Breaking newsGKN beaten by Melrose in takeover fightInvestors in the engineering giant support a takeover by turnaround specialist Melrose after a bitter battle.1ma minute agoBusiness,"GKN is a partner on the F-35 joint strike aircraft One of Britain's oldest engineering firms has been sold for Â£8.1bn to a controversial investment firm. GKN, which has had a hand in making everything from Minis to Spitfires, lost its battle to stay independent. Melrose Industries, which specialises in turning round troubled manufacturing businesses and selling them on, won the backing of 52% of GKN shareholders. Business Secretary Greg Clark said Melrose now had to honour its commitments to stay UK based. Labour called Melrose a ""short-termist asset-stripper"" and condemned the deal. Admitting defeat, GKN's management said it would now work with Melrose to ensure the success of the new company. The battle for GKN, which employs 58,000 staff worldwide, 6,000 of them in the UK, drew protests from government, unions and GKN customers. GKN's board had promised it would overhaul itself and sell off its car parts division, but it was not enough to stop investors agreeing to sell their shares to Melrose. Christopher Miller, chairman of Melrose, said: ""We are delighted and grateful to have received support from GKN shareholders for our plan to create a UK industrial powerhouse with a market capitalisation of over Â£10bn and a tremendous future."" News of the successful bid sent GKN's share price up over 6% to 450p. Melrose's offer is equivalent to 462p a share. GKN's businesses cover aerospace and automotive engineering. Its Driveline division makes systems for roughly half the world's passenger cars and light trucks. Its aerospace division is a major supplier to the US military and a key partner on defence programmes such as the F-35 joint strike aircraft in which the UK government has a stake. Melrose's strategy,externalit says, is to keep the company together ""to improve all of the businesses in GKN, only realising their value once they have reached full potential."" GKN Driveline supplies some of the world's biggest car manufacturers However, what happens afterwards has alarmed politicians and unions and some of GKN's customers. Mr Clark said: ""During the bid, Melrose made commitments which they are bound to honour including investment in research and development and maintaining itself as a UK business. ""Now that shareholders have made their decision the government has a statutory responsibility to consider whether the merger in its proposed final form gives rise to public interest concerns in the areas of media plurality, financial stability and national security. ""This assessment will be made by the appropriate authorities and the conclusion set out in due course."" Airbus has said new business with GKN after a Melrose takeover would be ""practically impossible"" Before Melrose won the bid Airbus, which is supplied by GKN, said it would be ""practically impossible"" to give new business to GKN if Melrose's offer was accepted because it damaged long-term investment prospects in the company, which could reduce R&D budgets and limit innovation. Paul Everitt, the chief executive of the ADS trade organisation, which represents the aerospace and defence sectors, said: ""GKN is an important part of the UK industrial landscape and it is important that its owners continue to invest for the long-term and support high value jobs both directly and throughout its UK supply chain."" The Unite union said it would be holding Melrose's ""feet to the fire"" over concessions it had made in recent days and seeking ""concrete guarantees"" on job security, investment and future work in the UK. Melrose launched its bid in January, initially at Â£7bn. It increased that this month to Â£8.1bn, with up to another Â£1bn to support the pension fund. It argued that it could increase GKN's profitability which has been falling steadily over the last five years. In the run up to the bid, GKN had also suffered a crisis of leadership, with its chief executive-in-waiting, Kevin Cummings, forced to step down after problems in the company's US aerospace division. The new chief executive, Anne Stevens, a former Ford executive, devised a plan to merge GKN's Driveline with the US car components group Dana to create a new company. GKN would have got a 47% stake in it and $1.8bn (Â£1.28bn) in cash from Dana. But Melrose called the plans ""panicked and fraught with contradictions"".

Ex-spy's daughter 'improving rapidly',"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33 were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Yulia Skripal, the daughter of ex-spy Sergei Skripal, is improving rapidly and no longer in a critical condition, says the hospital treating her. She and her father were admitted nearly four weeks agoafter being exposed to a nerve agent in Salisbury. The BBC understands from separate sources that Ms Skripal is conscious and talking. However Mr Skripal remains in a critical but stable condition, Salisbury District Hospital said. Doctors said Ms Skripal, ""has responded well to treatment but continues to receive expert clinical care 24 hours a day"". Were people properly protected in the incident aftermath? ""I want to take this opportunity to once again thank the staff of Salisbury District Hospital for delivering such high quality care to these patients over the last few weeks,"" said Dr Christine Blanshard, Medical Director for Salisbury District Hospital. ""I am very proud both of our front-line staff and all those who support them."" BBC correspondent Duncan Kennedy says a corner appears to have been turned for Yulia Skripal, who is now in a stable condition. However there is no news on what the long-term damage might be, he adds. Meanwhile the police have placed cordons round a children's play area at Montgomery Gardens near Mr Skripal's home. ""Officers will be searching it as a precautionary measure,"" said Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon.

Barclays pays $2bn to settle US fraud caseThe US had sued the bank for alleged fraud over the sale of mortgage-backed securities.6m7 minutes agoBusiness,"This video can not be played Jes Staley wants 'to protect the integrity of the bank' Barclays has agreed to pay $2bn (Â£1.4bn) to settle a lawsuit brought by the US government over the sale of mortgage-backed securities. The US alleged that the bank had misled investors about the quality of loans backing the securities in the run-up to the financial crisis. Barclays chief executive Jes Staley said the bank was ""pleased that we have been able to reach a fair and proportionate settlement"". The bank did not admit liability. US attorney for the eastern district of New York Richard Donoghue said: ""The substantial penalty Barclays and its executives have agreed to pay is an important step in recognising the harm that was caused to the national economy and to investors in residential mortgage-backed securities."" Barclays said the settlement resolves ""all actual and potential civil claims"" by the US Department of Justice related to the case, which involved the sale of securities between 2005 and 2007. Mr Staley added: ""It has been a priority for this management team from the start to resolve these historic issues in a timely and appropriate manner wherever possible. ""The completion of our restructuring in 2017, and putting significant legacy matters like this one behind us, mean Barclays is well positioned to produce stronger earnings going forward, and to start returning a greater proportion of those earnings to our shareholders over time."" Two former Barclays executives also agreed to pay a total of $2m. Paul Menefee, who was Barclay's subprime securitisation head, and John Carroll, Barclays' head trader for subprime loan acquisitions, agreed to pay the money to dismiss all claims against them. Federal prosecutors said,externalthat the alleged scheme involved 36 residential mortgage-backed security deals covering more than $31bn of mortgage loans. More than half of the mortgages backing the securities defaulted, the suit alleged. Investors had included credit unions, pension plans, charitable and religious organisations, university endowments, and financial institutions. Barclays reviews lending on Brexit caution.

Bargain Booze firm close to administration,"Conviviality, the owner of Bargain Booze, has announced plans to file for administration within two weeks. The firm also owns Wine Rack and supplies more than 25,000 restaurants, hotels and bars. Earlier this month it shocked investors with a profit warning and news of an unpaid Â£30m tax bill. It attempted to raise Â£125m to rescue the business, but this week said that effort had failed. Conviviality employs about 2,500 staff and their jobs are now in jeopardy. One of its most important customers is the JD Wetherspoon pub chain. Conviviality supplies all the wine and spirits to 900 Wetherspoon pubs - a contract worth tens of millions of pounds a year. Wetherspoon said that at the moment deliveries are continuing and it has contingency plans if those supplies are disrupted. Despite reassurance from Conviviality that it will continue to trade, the British Beer and Pub Association said the situation is ""causing concern"" for pubs as Conviviality is such a significant supplier. Earlier this month, Conviviality slashed its forecast for underlying earnings this year to Â£55m from Â£70m. Just days later,on 14 March, it revealed a Â£30m tax billthat had to be paid by the end of the month. Those revelations prompted the resignation of chief executive Diana Hunter, who had been in charge since 2013, the year Conviviality listed on the London Stock Exchange. Under her leadership the company expanded rapidly. Its core business had been selling popular alcohol brands at rock bottom prices, but in 2015 Ms Hunter took the firm into the wholesaling of drinks with the purchase of Matthew Clark. It also went upmarket with the purchase of wine specialist Bibendum. As recently as 29 January Conviviality management was buoyant.Announcing half-year pre-tax profits of Â£7.4m,externalchief executive Diana Hunter celebrated the company's ""strength"" and ""above market growth"". However, the first sign of troublecame a little over a month later, on 8 March,external. The company warned that profits would be 20% below market expectations.  It blamed an error in its forecasts and weaker profit margins. Then, on 14 March, it revealed a Â£30m,externaltax bill that had to be paid by the end of the month. It entered discussions with its lenders and looked at raising funds on the stock market. By 28 March the game was up.An effort to raise Â£125m from shareholders failed.,externalA day later Conviviality announced its intention to call in the administrators. From the first sign of trouble to the brink of failure took just 21 days. Conviviality created a potentially strong business model according to Phil Carroll, a research analyst with investment firm, Shore Capital. But, he said, management of the company's operations had ""fallen short"". In particular the wholesale business had struggled to ""get price increases to stick"" and profit margins had suffered, he said. Molly Johnson-Jones, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Numerous accounting errors and misjudgements suggest poor management oversight."" Conviviality had been trying to raise Â£125m to keep the business going, but on Wednesday it announced that those attempts had failed. In its latest update, the company said:,external""Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the Board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. ""The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice."" Conviviality said it was exploring ""a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business"". Brewers and food retailers might be among those interested in buying all, or part of Conviviality. In particular, the Matthew Clark wholesale business and Bibendum wine specialist could attract buyers, analysts say. Potential buyers might be impressed by some of the big firms supplied by Conviviality. They include: Stonegate which has 690 pubs including the Slug and Lettuce chain The brewer Wadworth, which owns 200 pubs Mitchells & Butler, owner of O'Neill's and All Bar One Conviviality is the latest in a series of retailers to run into trouble.

By Haroon Rashid, BBC Urdu editor, Islamabad Malala's return would have been unthinkable until a couple of years ago, but security is improving after years of Islamist violence. Her coming back sends a positive message. These days Pakistan's powerful army is keen to demonstrate that life is returning to normal. Malala knew the longer she stayed away, the more ammunition her critics would have to target her. Although the majority here support her, many in Pakistan's patriarchal society still question her credentials as a campaigner for girls' education. Conservative men who target her online hate her for following what they see as a Western agenda of female emancipation. For them, women getting an education is daunting and dangerous, especially in rural areas, where millions of girls drop out of school and end up doing household work. So Malala is up against a difficult male mindset. At just 11, Ms Yousafzai began writing an anonymous diary for BBC Urdu about her life under Taliban rule. Profile: Malala Yousafzai The girl who was shot for going to school The world's toughest places to study She later became a vocal advocate of female education amid militant suppression in Pakistan, and was deliberately attacked on a school bus at the age of 15. Malala's story brought international attention. The Pakistani Taliban said at the time that they had shot her because she was ""pro-West"" and ""promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas"". After initial surgery in Pakistan for her injuries in 2012, she was transferred to the UK for her recovery The teenager sustained life-threatening injuries in the attack, and had to have part of her skull removed to relieve swelling on her brain. After receiving emergency treatment at a military hospital in Pakistan, she was transported to the UK for further treatment and to recover in Birmingham, where her family continue to live. Since her recovery, Ms Yousafzai has continued to speak up for children's education and rights around the world. She set up the Malala Fund with her father Ziauddin, with the goal of ""working for a world where every girl can learn and lead without fear"". Allow Twitter content?

"Venezuelan police cells fire kills 68The blaze swept the facility in Valencia, Carabobo state, during a reported breakout attempt.23m24 minutes agoLatin America & Caribbean","This video can not be played Police used tear gas to disperse crowds desperate for news of loved ones Relatives of 68 people who died when a fire broke out at a police station in the Venezuelan city of Valencia have demanded answers as to what happened. The blaze reportedly started after prisoners set fire to mattresses in an attempt to break out on Wednesday. The United Nations has called on the Venezuelan authorities to carry out a speedy investigation and to provide reparations to victims' families. The fire is one of the deadliest incidents in Venezuela's prisons. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement that ""where applicable"" those responsible should be brought to justice,external. On Wednesday, anguished relatives had gathered in front of the police station demanding information about their loved ones. They were dispersed by police firing tear gas. Chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab said 66 men and two women, who had been visiting the cells overnight, were killed in the blaze. He also said that an investigation would be launched ""immediately"". August 2017:A riot in police holding cells leaves 37 dead in Amazonas state March 2017:14 bodies are found in a mass grave in a jail in Guarico state September 2015:A blaze in a prison in Tocuyito prison kills 17 January 2013:More than 60 inmates are killed in a prison riot in Barquisimeto The circumstances surrounding the fire have not been officially confirmed. The association Una Ventana a la Libertad (A Window on Freedom), which monitors jail conditions, said its reports showed a police officer had been shot in the leg by a detainee and that shortly afterwards mattresses in cells were set ablaze and the fire quickly spread. Mr Santander did confirm one police officer had been shot. Rescuers reportedly broke through walls to try to free those trapped by the blaze. Nearly all of those who died were inmates but at least two women who were visiting at the time were also killed, Mr Saab said. Some of the victims burned to death, others died of smoke inhalation. Angry relatives gathered outside the detention centre and clashed with police as they sought information about loved ones. Relatives complained they had been given no information Aida Parra, who said she had last seen her son the day before, told the Associated Press news agency: ""I don't know if my son is dead or alive. They haven't told me anything."" Dora Blanco told local media: ""I am a desperate mother. My son has been here a week. They have not given any information."" The government has set up an inquiry. Carabobo state governor Rafael Lacava expressed his condolences, adding:  ""A serious and profound investigation has been initiated to find the causes and those responsible for these regrettable events."" Facilities are notoriously overcrowded, with violence and deadly riots common. The country has struggled to accommodate its prisoners amid an ongoing economic crisis, leading to the use of temporary facilities such as the one in Valencia. By Daniel GarcÃ­a Marco, BBC Mundo, Caracas Many police stations in Venezuela are being used as de facto prisons. Their holding cells were built for 30 to 40 people but often hundreds are crammed inside awaiting trial or transfer to a proper jail. Detainees can sometimes spend years there. When I visited such a police station several months ago in Caracas, I saw dozens of men sharing a very small cell. Their relatives came twice a day to deliver them some food which the prisoners shared among themselves. Carlos Nieto of Una Ventana a la Libertad says that about 45,000 people are currently locked up in 500 police stations across the country. He says that a disaster like the one that happened in Valencia could ""happen anytime, anywhere and [the next one] could even be worse"". Inmates are supposed to be held for only 48 hours in police holding cells. Una Ventana a la Libertad says some police facilities are overfilled at five times their capacity. The organisation says that 65 people died last year in temporary cells due to violence, disease or malnutrition. Last month inmates at a different prison in Carabobo took a number of prisoners and guards hostage in another riot.

I feel like I've let everyone down in Australia.""

Smith and Warner have lost their lucrative contracts with the Indian Premier League, reported to be worth more than Â£1m each. Magellan, the naming rights sponsor of the Australian Test team, has pulled out of its deal two years early while sportswear company Asics has ended its partnerships with Smith, Bancroft and Warner.

Players' body the Australian Cricketers' Association says ""it is right"" to sanction the players for their parts in the scandal but questioned ""the severity and proportionality of the proposed sanctions"". The organisation, which says it is providing support to the three, cited several reasons why it believes the bans are not ""fair"". They include the sanctions being ""considerably higher"" than the punishments meted out for similar offences by the sport's world governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). The ICC banned Smith for one game and fined him his entire match fee, while Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points. Warner was not punished by the ICC.

"Boy, 3, killed in supermarket lorry crashThe Sainsbury's lorry driver has been arrested after the boy was struck on a pedestrian crossing.21m22 minutes agoDorset","The boy was crossing the road with his family when he was struck by the lorry A three-year-old boy has died after he was hit by an articulated lorry on a pedestrian crossing in Dorset. He was crossing the road on a balance bicycle with his family at about 08:40 BST when he was struck by the lorry in North Street in Wareham. The boy sustained serious injuries and was taken to Dorset County Hospital, where he died a short time later. The Sainsbury's lorry driver, a 43-year-old man from Basingstoke, is being held on suspicion of driving offences. Floral tributes have been left on a bench near the crossing Members of the public have been leaving flowers and messages on a bench near the pelican crossing. Inspector Matt Butler said police were trying to establish what colour the traffic signals were showing when the boy was hit. Asked how the boy's family was coping, he said: ""To be honest, I don't think they are. I don't think any family would cope. ""It really is a horrible, horrible incident. This family are facing the most horrid time of their lives."" He appealed for drivers in the area, particularly those with dashcam footage from the scene, to contact the police. Sainsbury's director Simon Roberts expressed his ""deepest sympathies"" to the boy's family Sainsbury's retail and operations director Simon Roberts visited the scene during the afternoon. He said: ""All our thoughts and deepest sympathies go out to, of course, the family on their loss. And our first priority is to fully support the police in their investigation."" Mike Coupe, Sainsbury's chief executive, said in a statement: ""This is an absolute tragedy and we will do everything we can to support the family.""

"Bargain Booze firm close to administrationConviviality, which owns Bargain Booze and Wine Rack, announces plans to file for administration.2h2 hours agoBusinessComments","Conviviality, the owner of Bargain Booze, has announced plans to file for administration within two weeks. The firm also owns Wine Rack and supplies more than 25,000 restaurants, hotels and bars. Earlier this month it shocked investors with a profit warning and news of an unpaid Â£30m tax bill. It attempted to raise Â£125m to rescue the business, but this week said that effort had failed. Conviviality employs about 2,500 staff and their jobs are now in jeopardy. One of its most important customers is the JD Wetherspoon pub chain. Conviviality supplies all the wine and spirits to 900 Wetherspoon pubs - a contract worth tens of millions of pounds a year. Wetherspoon said that at the moment deliveries are continuing and it has contingency plans if those supplies are disrupted. Despite reassurance from Conviviality that it will continue to trade, the British Beer and Pub Association said the situation is ""causing concern"" for pubs as Conviviality is such a significant supplier. Earlier this month, Conviviality slashed its forecast for underlying earnings this year to Â£55m from Â£70m. Just days later,on 14 March, it revealed a Â£30m tax billthat had to be paid by the end of the month. Those revelations prompted the resignation of chief executive Diana Hunter, who had been in charge since 2013, the year Conviviality listed on the London Stock Exchange. Under her leadership the company expanded rapidly. Its core business had been selling popular alcohol brands at rock bottom prices, but in 2015 Ms Hunter took the firm into the wholesaling of drinks with the purchase of Matthew Clark. It also went upmarket with the purchase of wine specialist Bibendum. As recently as 29 January Conviviality management was buoyant.Announcing half-year pre-tax profits of Â£7.4m,externalchief executive Diana Hunter celebrated the company's ""strength"" and ""above market growth"". However, the first sign of troublecame a little over a month later, on 8 March,external. The company warned that profits would be 20% below market expectations.  It blamed an error in its forecasts and weaker profit margins. Then, on 14 March, it revealed a Â£30m,externaltax bill that had to be paid by the end of the month. It entered discussions with its lenders and looked at raising funds on the stock market. By 28 March the game was up.An effort to raise Â£125m from shareholders failed.,externalA day later Conviviality announced its intention to call in the administrators. From the first sign of trouble to the brink of failure took just 21 days. Conviviality created a potentially strong business model according to Phil Carroll, a research analyst with investment firm, Shore Capital. But, he said, management of the company's operations had ""fallen short"". In particular the wholesale business had struggled to ""get price increases to stick"" and profit margins had suffered, he said. Molly Johnson-Jones, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Numerous accounting errors and misjudgements suggest poor management oversight."" Conviviality had been trying to raise Â£125m to keep the business going, but on Wednesday it announced that those attempts had failed. In its latest update, the company said:,external""Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the Board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. ""The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice."" Conviviality said it was exploring ""a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business"". Brewers and food retailers might be among those interested in buying all, or part of Conviviality. In particular, the Matthew Clark wholesale business and Bibendum wine specialist could attract buyers, analysts say. Potential buyers might be impressed by some of the big firms supplied by Conviviality. They include: Stonegate which has 690 pubs including the Slug and Lettuce chain The brewer Wadworth, which owns 200 pubs Mitchells & Butler, owner of O'Neill's and All Bar One Conviviality is the latest in a series of retailers to run into trouble. Last week, fashion chain New Looksaid it would close 60 stores and cut 1,000 jobs. At the end of February the UK arm ofToys R Us went into administration, and earlier this month it announced all of its stores would close.

NFL cheerleader 'fired for Instagram post'Bailey Davis is accusing the New Orleans Saints football team of gender discrimination.,"Cheerleader Bailey Davis was fired for posting an Instagram in a lingerie body suit Dancing for the New Orleans Saintsations cheerleading squad was a lifelong dream for Bailey Davis. Those dreams were crushed after three years on the job when she says she was fired for a ""distasteful"" Instagram post. Now, the former cheerleader has filed a complaint against the National Football League (NFL). Davis grew up in Ellisville, Mississippi. Her family travelled 150 miles (240km) to Louisiana to support the New Orleans Saints football team each season. Her mother worked as a choreographer for the Saintsations for 18 years and Davis grew up around the women with the goal of someday becoming one of them. After high school, Davis finally had her chance to dance in the Superdome, where the Saints play. She was invited to become a Saintsation after a year of junior college. Davis' mother was a Saintsation coach until she resigned this month following her daughters' firing The 22-year-old spent three seasons travelling with the 2010 Super Bowl champions until she was fired on 23 January. The photo that she said led to her dismissal showed Davis in a lingerie body suit, which her employer allegedly claimed violated Saints policy. ""This letter is your confirmation of the termination of your employment with the New Orleans Louisiana Saints effective today... due to failure to comply with Saintsations rules and regulations"", the letter, seen by the BBC, reads. The ""rules and regulations"" referred to in the letter are anti-fraternisation policies between dancers and players and semi-nude photos posted on social media. The NFL team's employee handbook says: ""Nude, semi-nude, or lingerie photography is strictly prohibited and terms for immediate dismissal"". The rule, however, does not apply to Saints football players and is only required for Saintsation cheerleaders. After she was let go, Davis hired a lawyer and filed a discrimination complaint against the NFL team with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Davis' lawyer, Sara Blackwell, told the BBC that she believes the policy unfairly targets women. Bailey Davis (R) ""The Saintsations should be treated as athletes, which is what they are,"" she said. ""This is a clear discrimination based on gender."" She added that players can post photos in their underwear on social media, so cheerleaders should be allowed to as well. Blackwell, who filed a complaint on Friday, said the next step will be to send a letter to the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to request a hearing. The strange demands of life as a cheerleader Davis is also challenging the Saints for their claim she broke anti-fraternisation rules, which she said was another reason for her dismissal. The former cheerleader said she was called into the team's human resources office and was told she had violated the policy by attending a party with Saints players, which is prohibited for members of the dance squad. This video can not be played NFL: Being a Philadelphia Eagles cheerleader is hard work Davis denied the allegation, but the rumours persisted. After she posted a lingerie photo, her coach texted her: ""Very poor judgement to post a picture like that especially considering our recent conversations about the rumours going around about you. This does not help your case. I'd expect you to know better."" 5 songs you didn't know were about God Magician Dynamo opens up about Crohn's Cruise line trades trip for Snapchat handle In addition to strict guidelines ensuring their social media is ""tasteful, respectful, and classy"", cheerleaders are also responsible for blocking players who follow or contact them. In January 2018, the Saints reminded the all-female dance squad that their social media pages must be in ""private mode"", according to an email obtained by the BBC. Davis said they were also told to remove their last names from their Instagram accounts to avoid being found online by football players. ""In an effort to protect you from player advances and activity that can be deemed suspicious it is in your best interest that as long as you are a Saintsation you do not follow any players or coaches at all,"" coach Ashely Deaton said in an email. She said cheerleaders could not like or comment on anything posted online about specific Saints players, though following team accounts was fine, according to the email. ""Any such activity will likely give them the impression that you are available to their advances,"" she wrote. Davis said that by framing the players as predators the Saints were doing a disservice to both cheerleaders and football players. ""It's completely discriminating because it's our job to make sure they behave themselves. The players have never harassed us,"" said Davis. ""The organisation is trying to make them seem like they are predators."" The New Orleans Saints declined to provide a comment to the BBC. Attorney Gregory Rouchell, who represents the NFL team,said in a statement to the Hattiesburg American newspaper,external: ""The New Orleans Saints is an equal opportunity employer, and it denies that Ms Davis was discriminated against because she is female. The Saints will defend these allegations in due course, and the Organisation is confident that its policies and workplace rules will withstand legal scrutiny."" If a Saints player is to walk into a bar or restaurant, cheerleaders are required to leave the establishment or risk losing their job, according to a copy of Davis' complaint. Davis' lawyer said this is one of many rules that unfairly controls the actions of dancers, who all happen to be women. ""Bailey is an advocate for women being treated equally. We're hoping this can help other women fight to break the glass ceiling,"" Blackwell said of her client. According to the complaint, other rules for cheerleaders in the Saints' handbook include: Dancers will make no public appearances or post photos on the internet wearing Saintsation cheerleader uniform Members shall not date or fraternise with any player, coach or management personnel Socialising in close proximity with players will result in immediate termination Social media accounts must not identify Saintsation dancers as members of the team Game day make-up and hair cuts must be approved by the team director It is unclear how many similar rules exist for cheerleaders working for other NFL teams. However, the Saints are not the first team to come under scrutiny for their treatment of cheerleaders. The Buffalo Bills were widely criticised for forcing cheerleaders to do a ""jiggle test"" to see if they were slim enough. Blackwell said the strict crackdown on social media accounts makes it difficult for cheerleaders to build their personal brand while dancing. ""The players, who already make a ton more money, can have public profiles where they show off their physique and wear Saints uniforms. They're allowed to promote themselves, but the dancers are not,"" she said.

'Government at fault too' over Worboys case,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) must also ""accept its role"" in the decision to free rapist John Worboys, according to the former Parole Board chairman. Nick Hardwick quitafter theHigh Court quashed the board's decisionto release Worboys nine years after he was jailed. Professor Hardwick said the MOJ had not given details of other allegations. A review of at least six other cases has now been ordered by the MOJ. It has also apologised for not providing the information ""it should have done"". Worboys, who is now known as John Radford, has served 10 years, including remand time, of an indeterminate prison sentence. In November, the Parole Board decided to approve his release with ""stringent"" licence conditions, arguing its decision was based on appropriate evidence. Analysis: Legal implications of the judgement Parole Board chairman's resignation letter The cabbie who preyed on young women However, following a legal challenge by two victims and the mayor of London, High Court judges overturned the decision on Wednesday, saying the board ""should have undertaken further inquiry into the circumstances of his offending"". Justice Secretary David Gauke then outlined a series of changes to the Parole Board system, saying the court's findings had highlighted ""serious failings"". Speakingto BBC Radio 4's Today programmeon Thursday, Prof Hardwick said the board had ""got it wrong"" by not considering other alleged offences - but that it had been ""the widely-held practice at the time"". ""I thought at the time it was correct that we couldn't go into the alleged offences (Worboys) hadn't been convicted of."" This video can not be played Worboys case: Justice ministry 'also failed' in parole case Prof Hardwick, who was forced to quit in the wake of the High Court ruling, refused to accept he had been ""scapegoated"", as claimed by lawyers representing Worboys' victims. But he added: ""I accept the Parole Board was at fault, I don't accept we were any more at fault than the MOJ. ""I don't think the right lessons will be learned if the only people accepting responsibility is us."" Analysis BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw Nick Hardwick has a long and distinguished record working in criminal justice and there is force in his argument that he would have been well placed to steer through the changes the Parole Board needs to make. And he's right to say the Ministry of Justice has questions to answer about the information it failed to supply to the parole panel which considered the Worboys case. But the Parole Board's own failings, which he has accepted, were serious. Common sense appeared to desert the panel when it granted Worboys' release - his sudden admission of responsibility after years of denial should have raised enough alarm bells on its own. And it's deeply concerning that, as its then chairman, Prof Hardwick didn't know the correct position as to whether alleged offending, as well as convictions, could be taken into account when assessing risk. It raises the possibility that other prisoners have been released who pose more of a threat than the Parole Board had realised. Prof Hardwick said Mr Gauke should not resign but, as the Parole Board ""accepts its role in this, so should others"". Prof Hardwick also said the High Court judgement had ""turned"" on the fact that other allegations were not considered, and though the judges had ""some doubts"" about the decision to free Worboys, the judges did not believe the Parole Board's conclusion to release the rapist had been ""irrational"". The dossier provided to the panel by the MOJ ""did not contain sufficient information about those other alleged offences and therefore they were not considered"", he added. This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke says there were serious failings in the case Mr Gauke apologised for the information not being included but said the Parole Board had been ""insufficiently inquisitive"". An MOJ spokesman said: ""The department's representatives at the hearing made clear that they had analysed the offences of which (Worboys) had been convicted and opposed release on the basis that he remained high risk. ""They did not feel the need to analyse any other offending in order to reach this firm conclusion."" Prof Hardwick also said an independent review had found the probation service rather than the Parole Board was to blame for notkeeping victims informed of the decision to release Worboys. This video can not be played Murdered woman's mother 'kept on edge' by Parole Board wait Marie McCourt, mother of Helen McCourt who was murdered in an unrelated case in 1988, told BBC Breakfast she too had been frustrated by a lack of communication from the Parole Board dealing with her daughter's killer. Worboys will remain in prison while a ""fresh determination"" is carried out by a new Parole Board panel. Mr Gauke has now also ordered a review of cases in which other prisoners have been released directly from high security prisons. The Parole Board said there were six Category A offenders released in the 12 months up to April 2017. David Gauke became the sixth justice secretary in six years - and the first solicitor to take the role - in Theresa May's January 2018 reshuffle. His appointment breaks a run of four consecutive non-legally qualified MPs to hold the position of the government's chief law officer. He was previously work and pensions secretary and chief secretary to the Treasury. The former City lawyer has been the MP for Hertfordshire South West since 2005.

"Term-time holiday ban blocks dance examsChildren are too often refused permission to take external exams in school hours, says exam board.11h11 hours agoUK","Rules designed to stop families in England taking term-time holidays are also preventing some children taking external dance, drama and music exams in school hours, says an exam body. The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) says schools too often refuse permission to attend its exams even if pupils will only be away for a couple of hours. Ministers say they support pupils taking arts exams in school hours. But RAD says the position is confusing and wants the guidance made clearer. Since 2013, official guidance on term-time leavehas said authorised absences should only be granted in ""exceptional circumstances"". The RAD says this has caused problems for its own ballet examinations and is also an issue for children taking dance, drama and music exams with some other boards. According to RAD exams director Andrew McBirnie, before 2013 ballet exams could be run ""during the school day and the student was able to leave a class at say 10 o'clock, do their exam and be back by lunchtime - and that seemed to be a perfectly legitimate activity that the student might be doing as part of their all-round education. ""Increasingly over the last few years... there have been more and more schools saying: 'No we can't allow this any more because of this issue with unauthorised absence.'"" In a recent letter to Ed Vaizey MP, England's education secretary Damian Hinds, said the government expected schools to be sympathetic to requests for leave to take these exams. ""As long as they are satisfied that time away from school will not have a negative effect on a child's education."" But the letter also says the Department for Education does not explicitly state what constitutes an exceptional circumstance. ""These decisions are best made by head teachers who will know their pupils' individual circumstances best."" In response, Mr Vaizey said: ""The supportive stance from Damian Hinds is hugely welcome - but greater clarity is still needed. ""I will continue to work with RAD on the issue and will write to the Minister for Education regarding new guidelines for schools"" Mr McBirnie welcomed Mr Vaizey's dialogue with Mr Hinds and hopes it will help persuade more heads to allow pupils to attend performing arts exams in school hours. However, he says the message is still mixed ""between what the guidelines say and the mood music"" from ministers. ""There is no definition or further guidelines about what ""exceptional circumstances"" means at all. So it totally comes down to the interpretation of that phrase which is very vague. ""What's exceptional for one head teacher might not be exceptional for another and to be honest leaving school for a dance exam is not exceptional, it's actually quite routine that children leave to take a dance or drama exam outside school and then come back."" Ideally, Mr McBirnie says he would like examples of activities where schools would be expected to authorise absence added to the guidance. The National Association of Head Teachers said authorising absences was ""difficult territory for schools because they are so severely held to account for attendance figures"". Deputy General Secretary, Nick Brook, agreed that ""in truth external arts exams are not exceptional circumstances, they are a well understood everyday element of school life. ""A list of approved activities risks creating unnecessary tension. ""What's important is that as long as the school is satisfied that time away will not have a negative effect on a child's education, absence to attend an external exam should be reason enough.""

By Haroon Rashid, BBC Urdu editor, Islamabad Malala's return would have been unthinkable until a couple of years ago, but security is improving after years of Islamist violence. Her coming back sends a positive message. These days Pakistan's powerful army is keen to demonstrate that life is returning to normal. Malala knew the longer she stayed away, the more ammunition her critics would have to target her. Although the majority here support her, many in Pakistan's patriarchal society still question her credentials as a campaigner for girls' education. Conservative men who target her online hate her for following what they see as a Western agenda of female emancipation. For them, women getting an education is daunting and dangerous, especially in rural areas, where millions of girls drop out of school and end up doing household work. So Malala is up against a difficult male mindset. At just 11, Ms Yousafzai began writing an anonymous diary for BBC Urdu about her life under Taliban rule. Profile: Malala Yousafzai The girl who was shot for going to school The world's toughest places to study She later became a vocal advocate of female education amid militant suppression in Pakistan, and was deliberately attacked on a school bus at the age of 15. Malala's story brought international attention. The Pakistani Taliban said at the time that they had shot her because she was ""pro-West"" and ""promoting Western culture in Pashtun areas"". After initial surgery in Pakistan for her injuries in 2012, she was transferred to the UK for her recovery The teenager sustained life-threatening injuries in the attack, and had to have part of her skull removed to relieve swelling on her brain. After receiving emergency treatment at a military hospital in Pakistan, she was transported to the UK for further treatment and to recover in Birmingham, where her family continue to live. Since her recovery, Ms Yousafzai has continued to speak up for children's education and rights around the world. She set up the Malala Fund with her father Ziauddin, with the goal of ""working for a world where every girl can learn and lead without fear"". Allow Twitter content?

In 2014 she became the youngest person to win the Nobel Peace Prize. She and Indian activist Kailash Satyarthi were jointly awarded it for their efforts for children's rights. She has continued campaigning while pursuing her studies, and is now studying at Oxford University. Despite security efforts in recent years, the Pakistani Taliban has remained active. They have been blamed for a number of deadly attacks on schools and colleges that have killed hundreds. Ms Yousafzai repeatedly expressed her wishes to return to Pakistan, describing her hometown of Swat as ""paradise on earth"" in an interview earlier this month. Who are the Taliban? Will Pakistan ever stamp out extremism? ""I have received a lot of support in my country,"" she told US talk-show host David Letterman in a Netflix special. ""There is this lust for change. People want to see change in their country. I am already doing work there but I want my feet to touch that land."" Pakistan is religiously conservative and late last year Ms Yousafzai was trolled online after a picture of her in Oxford wearing Western clothes - jeans and heeled boots - was shared on social media. In 2015 a Pakistani court jailed two men for life for involvement in the attack on Ms Yousafzai. Eight others were acquitted. The man named as the chief suspect is still on the run, the authorities say.

Venezuelan police cells fire kills 68,"This video can not be played Police used tear gas to disperse crowds desperate for news of loved ones Relatives of 68 people who died when a fire broke out at a police station in the Venezuelan city of Valencia have demanded answers as to what happened. The blaze reportedly started after prisoners set fire to mattresses in an attempt to break out on Wednesday. The United Nations has called on the Venezuelan authorities to carry out a speedy investigation and to provide reparations to victims' families. The fire is one of the deadliest incidents in Venezuela's prisons. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement that ""where applicable"" those responsible should be brought to justice,external. On Wednesday, anguished relatives had gathered in front of the police station demanding information about their loved ones. They were dispersed by police firing tear gas. Chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab said 66 men and two women, who had been visiting the cells overnight, were killed in the blaze. He also said that an investigation would be launched ""immediately"". August 2017:A riot in police holding cells leaves 37 dead in Amazonas state March 2017:14 bodies are found in a mass grave in a jail in Guarico state September 2015:A blaze in a prison in Tocuyito prison kills 17 January 2013:More than 60 inmates are killed in a prison riot in Barquisimeto The circumstances surrounding the fire have not been officially confirmed. The association Una Ventana a la Libertad (A Window on Freedom), which monitors jail conditions, said its reports showed a police officer had been shot in the leg by a detainee and that shortly afterwards mattresses in cells were set ablaze and the fire quickly spread. Mr Santander did confirm one police officer had been shot. Rescuers reportedly broke through walls to try to free those trapped by the blaze. Nearly all of those who died were inmates but at least two women who were visiting at the time were also killed, Mr Saab said. Some of the victims burned to death, others died of smoke inhalation. Angry relatives gathered outside the detention centre and clashed with police as they sought information about loved ones. Relatives complained they had been given no information Aida Parra, who said she had last seen her son the day before, told the Associated Press news agency: ""I don't know if my son is dead or alive. They haven't told me anything."" Dora Blanco told local media: ""I am a desperate mother. My son has been here a week. They have not given any information."" The government has set up an inquiry. Carabobo state governor Rafael Lacava expressed his condolences, adding:  ""A serious and profound investigation has been initiated to find the causes and those responsible for these regrettable events."" Facilities are notoriously overcrowded, with violence and deadly riots common. The country has struggled to accommodate its prisoners amid an ongoing economic crisis, leading to the use of temporary facilities such as the one in Valencia. By Daniel GarcÃ­a Marco, BBC Mundo, Caracas Many police stations in Venezuela are being used as de facto prisons. Their holding cells were built for 30 to 40 people but often hundreds are crammed inside awaiting trial or transfer to a proper jail. Detainees can sometimes spend years there. When I visited such a police station several months ago in Caracas, I saw dozens of men sharing a very small cell. Their relatives came twice a day to deliver them some food which the prisoners shared among themselves. Carlos Nieto of Una Ventana a la Libertad says that about 45,000 people are currently locked up in 500 police stations across the country. He says that a disaster like the one that happened in Valencia could ""happen anytime, anywhere and [the next one] could even be worse"". Inmates are supposed to be held for only 48 hours in police holding cells. Una Ventana a la Libertad says some police facilities are overfilled at five times their capacity. The organisation says that 65 people died last year in temporary cells due to violence, disease or malnutrition. Last month inmates at a different prison in Carabobo took a number of prisoners and guards hostage in another riot.

Players' body the Australian Cricketers' Association says ""it is right"" to sanction the players for their parts in the scandal but questioned ""the severity and proportionality of the proposed sanctions"". The organisation, which says it is providing support to the three, cited several reasons why it believes the bans are not ""fair"". They include the sanctions being ""considerably higher"" than the punishments meted out for similar offences by the sport's world governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). The ICC banned Smith for one game and fined him his entire match fee, while Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points. Warner was not punished by the ICC.

"Spy's front door focus of poisoning probeSergei and Yulia Skripal first came into contact with nerve agent from their front door, police believe.11h11 hours agoUK","Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33 were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok A Russian ex-spy and his daughter first came into contact with the nerve agent that poisoned them at their home, police have said. The highest concentration of the agent used against Sergei and Yulia Skripal was found on their front door. The pair were found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury on 4 March and remain in a critical condition. Police said inquiries would focus on their home address in Christie Miller Road but the risk to locals was low. Traces of the nerve agent had been found at some of the other sites in the city, but they were at lower concentrations. Russian spy: What we know so far Nato slashes Russia staff after poisoning Skripal niece: 'I'd really like to know how they are' MPs to probe Russian money laundering Security correspondent Gordon Corera said the highest concentration was found on the Skripals' door handle, and could have been administered through a ""gloopy substance which could have been smeared on to that door handle"". He added it would explain why the nerve agent may have been found on the Skripals' car - which has been taken by police - or the restaurant in which they had eaten which has been cordoned off by detectives. Specialist officers in protective suits secured the scene following the nerve gas attack Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident About 250 counter terrorism officers continue to work on the case, examining 5,000 hours of CCTV footage and 1,350 items that have been seized. Officers would continue working at the address over the next few weeks, and potentially months, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said. ""Those living in the Skripals' neighbourhood can expect to see officers carrying out searches as part of this, but I want to reassure them that the risk remains low and our searches are precautionary,"" he added. Forensic work at shops and at a cemetery in Salisbury is drawing to a close. The Maltings shopping centre, the Ashley Wood compound, and the London Road cemetery have been handed back to Wiltshire Police from the national counter terrorism investigation, Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills said. Mr Skripal's wife and son are buried in the cemetery, and the former spy and his daughter were discovered unconscious at the Maltings shopping centre. Prime Minister Theresa May has said the chemical used in the attack was part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia known as Novichok. The prime minister has said there was ""no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable,"" in the attack,and she has expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the UK. In addition, at least26 countries, including the US and European allies, are expelling more than 130 diplomats. This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russian media is reporting the score-settling The Russian government has denied any involvement in the attack and has vowed to retaliate against the ""provocative gesture"". Russia hasexpelled 23 British diplomats from Moscow in a tit-for-tat response. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the nerve agent attack had crystallised a ""global wave of revulsion"" against Russia. He added: ""Never before has there been a collective expulsion of Russian diplomats on the scale that we have seen over the last few days."" Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK.

NFL cheerleader 'fired for Instagram post'Bailey Davis is accusing the New Orleans Saints football team of gender discrimination.8h8 hours agoUS & Canada,"Cheerleader Bailey Davis was fired for posting an Instagram in a lingerie body suit Dancing for the New Orleans Saintsations cheerleading squad was a lifelong dream for Bailey Davis. Those dreams were crushed after three years on the job when she says she was fired for a ""distasteful"" Instagram post. Now, the former cheerleader has filed a complaint against the National Football League (NFL). Davis grew up in Ellisville, Mississippi. Her family travelled 150 miles (240km) to Louisiana to support the New Orleans Saints football team each season. Her mother worked as a choreographer for the Saintsations for 18 years and Davis grew up around the women with the goal of someday becoming one of them. After high school, Davis finally had her chance to dance in the Superdome, where the Saints play. She was invited to become a Saintsation after a year of junior college. Davis' mother was a Saintsation coach until she resigned this month following her daughters' firing The 22-year-old spent three seasons travelling with the 2010 Super Bowl champions until she was fired on 23 January. The photo that she said led to her dismissal showed Davis in a lingerie body suit, which her employer allegedly claimed violated Saints policy. ""This letter is your confirmation of the termination of your employment with the New Orleans Louisiana Saints effective today... due to failure to comply with Saintsations rules and regulations"", the letter, seen by the BBC, reads. The ""rules and regulations"" referred to in the letter are anti-fraternisation policies between dancers and players and semi-nude photos posted on social media. The NFL team's employee handbook says: ""Nude, semi-nude, or lingerie photography is strictly prohibited and terms for immediate dismissal"". The rule, however, does not apply to Saints football players and is only required for Saintsation cheerleaders. After she was let go, Davis hired a lawyer and filed a discrimination complaint against the NFL team with the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). Davis' lawyer, Sara Blackwell, told the BBC that she believes the policy unfairly targets women. Bailey Davis (R) ""The Saintsations should be treated as athletes, which is what they are,"" she said. ""This is a clear discrimination based on gender."" She added that players can post photos in their underwear on social media, so cheerleaders should be allowed to as well. Blackwell, who filed a complaint on Friday, said the next step will be to send a letter to the NFL commissioner Roger Goodell to request a hearing. The strange demands of life as a cheerleader Davis is also challenging the Saints for their claim she broke anti-fraternisation rules, which she said was another reason for her dismissal. The former cheerleader said she was called into the team's human resources office and was told she had violated the policy by attending a party with Saints players, which is prohibited for members of the dance squad. This video can not be played NFL: Being a Philadelphia Eagles cheerleader is hard work Davis denied the allegation, but the rumours persisted. After she posted a lingerie photo, her coach texted her: ""Very poor judgement to post a picture like that especially considering our recent conversations about the rumours going around about you. This does not help your case. I'd expect you to know better."" 5 songs you didn't know were about God Magician Dynamo opens up about Crohn's Cruise line trades trip for Snapchat handle In addition to strict guidelines ensuring their social media is ""tasteful, respectful, and classy"", cheerleaders are also responsible for blocking players who follow or contact them. In January 2018, the Saints reminded the all-female dance squad that their social media pages must be in ""private mode"", according to an email obtained by the BBC. Davis said they were also told to remove their last names from their Instagram accounts to avoid being found online by football players. ""In an effort to protect you from player advances and activity that can be deemed suspicious it is in your best interest that as long as you are a Saintsation you do not follow any players or coaches at all,"" coach Ashely Deaton said in an email. She said cheerleaders could not like or comment on anything posted online about specific Saints players, though following team accounts was fine, according to the email. ""Any such activity will likely give them the impression that you are available to their advances,"" she wrote. Davis said that by framing the players as predators the Saints were doing a disservice to both cheerleaders and football players. ""It's completely discriminating because it's our job to make sure they behave themselves. The players have never harassed us,"" said Davis. ""The organisation is trying to make them seem like they are predators."" The New Orleans Saints declined to provide a comment to the BBC. Attorney Gregory Rouchell, who represents the NFL team,said in a statement to the Hattiesburg American newspaper,external: ""The New Orleans Saints is an equal opportunity employer, and it denies that Ms Davis was discriminated against because she is female. The Saints will defend these allegations in due course, and the Organisation is confident that its policies and workplace rules will withstand legal scrutiny."" If a Saints player is to walk into a bar or restaurant, cheerleaders are required to leave the establishment or risk losing their job, according to a copy of Davis' complaint. Davis' lawyer said this is one of many rules that unfairly controls the actions of dancers, who all happen to be women. ""Bailey is an advocate for women being treated equally. We're hoping this can help other women fight to break the glass ceiling,"" Blackwell said of her client. According to the complaint, other rules for cheerleaders in the Saints' handbook include: Dancers will make no public appearances or post photos on the internet wearing Saintsation cheerleader uniform Members shall not date or fraternise with any player, coach or management personnel Socialising in close proximity with players will result in immediate termination Social media accounts must not identify Saintsation dancers as members of the team Game day make-up and hair cuts must be approved by the team director It is unclear how many similar rules exist for cheerleaders working for other NFL teams. However, the Saints are not the first team to come under scrutiny for their treatment of cheerleaders. The Buffalo Bills were widely criticised for forcing cheerleaders to do a ""jiggle test"" to see if they were slim enough. Blackwell said the strict crackdown on social media accounts makes it difficult for cheerleaders to build their personal brand while dancing.

Term-time holiday ban blocks dance exams,"Rules designed to stop families in England taking term-time holidays are also preventing some children taking external dance, drama and music exams in school hours, says an exam body. The Royal Academy of Dance (RAD) says schools too often refuse permission to attend its exams even if pupils will only be away for a couple of hours. Ministers say they support pupils taking arts exams in school hours. But RAD says the position is confusing and wants the guidance made clearer. Since 2013, official guidance on term-time leavehas said authorised absences should only be granted in ""exceptional circumstances"". The RAD says this has caused problems for its own ballet examinations and is also an issue for children taking dance, drama and music exams with some other boards. According to RAD exams director Andrew McBirnie, before 2013 ballet exams could be run ""during the school day and the student was able to leave a class at say 10 o'clock, do their exam and be back by lunchtime - and that seemed to be a perfectly legitimate activity that the student might be doing as part of their all-round education. ""Increasingly over the last few years... there have been more and more schools saying: 'No we can't allow this any more because of this issue with unauthorised absence.'"" In a recent letter to Ed Vaizey MP, England's education secretary Damian Hinds, said the government expected schools to be sympathetic to requests for leave to take these exams. ""As long as they are satisfied that time away from school will not have a negative effect on a child's education."" But the letter also says the Department for Education does not explicitly state what constitutes an exceptional circumstance. ""These decisions are best made by head teachers who will know their pupils' individual circumstances best."" In response, Mr Vaizey said: ""The supportive stance from Damian Hinds is hugely welcome - but greater clarity is still needed. ""I will continue to work with RAD on the issue and will write to the Minister for Education regarding new guidelines for schools"" Mr McBirnie welcomed Mr Vaizey's dialogue with Mr Hinds and hopes it will help persuade more heads to allow pupils to attend performing arts exams in school hours. However, he says the message is still mixed ""between what the guidelines say and the mood music"" from ministers. ""There is no definition or further guidelines about what ""exceptional circumstances"" means at all. So it totally comes down to the interpretation of that phrase which is very vague. ""What's exceptional for one head teacher might not be exceptional for another and to be honest leaving school for a dance exam is not exceptional, it's actually quite routine that children leave to take a dance or drama exam outside school and then come back."" Ideally, Mr McBirnie says he would like examples of activities where schools would be expected to authorise absence added to the guidance. The National Association of Head Teachers said authorising absences was ""difficult territory for schools because they are so severely held to account for attendance figures"". Deputy General Secretary, Nick Brook, agreed that ""in truth external arts exams are not exceptional circumstances, they are a well understood everyday element of school life. ""A list of approved activities risks creating unnecessary tension. ""What's important is that as long as the school is satisfied that time away will not have a negative effect on a child's education, absence to attend an external exam should be reason enough.""

Minister 'also at fault' over Worboys case,"John Worboys was jailed in 2009 for a string of sex attacks on women The Ministry of Justice (MOJ) must also ""accept its role"" in the decision to free rapist John Worboys, according to the former Parole Board chairman. Nick Hardwick quitafter theHigh Court quashed the board's decisionto release Worboys nine years after he was jailed. Professor Hardwick said the MOJ had not given details of other allegations. A review of at least six other cases has now been ordered by the MOJ. It has also apologised for not providing the information ""it should have done"". Worboys, who is now known as John Radford, has served 10 years, including remand time, of an indeterminate prison sentence.

It raises the possibility that other prisoners have been released who pose more of a threat than the Parole Board had realised. Prof Hardwick said Mr Gauke should not resign but, as the Parole Board ""accepts its role in this, so should others"".

I feel like I've let everyone down in Australia."" Smith admitted that the Aussie ""leadership group"" had devised a plan to tamper with the ball, and Cricket Australia's investigation found Warner instructed Bancroft how to carry it out.

It was a failure of my leadership. I will do everything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused. ""If any good can come of this, I hope I can be a force for change. I know I will regret this for the rest of my life. I am absolutely gutted. I hope in time I can earn back respect and forgiveness. ""To my knowledge this has never happened before. This is the first time I've seen this happen and I can assure you it will never happen again.""

Players' body the Australian Cricketers' Association says ""it is right"" to sanction the players for their parts in the scandal but questioned ""the severity and proportionality of the proposed sanctions"". The organisation, which says it is providing support to the three, cited several reasons why it believes the bans are not ""fair"". They include the sanctions being ""considerably higher"" than the punishments meted out for similar offences by the sport's world governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). The ICC banned Smith for one game and fined him his entire match fee, while Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points. Warner was not punished by the ICC.

Your guide to EU jargon,"The UK and the European Union are in talks about how they could live and work together after Brexit. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - here is what some of the key ones mean. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Britain's exit from the European Union. A period lasting from 31 January to 31 December 2020, when the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but still follows all its rules. It was agreed by the UK and the EU to allow both sides time to reach a deal on their future relationship. Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers such as: Taxes that must be paid when trading Limits on how much of certain goods can be imported Rules on things such as hygiene or labelling of food How the agreement between the EU and the UK would be enforced if there is a dispute. One controversial issue has been about what role, if any, the European Court of Justice should play. A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Rules on who can fish where, and how much of each species can be caught. A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements often include level playing field measures. EU laws which prevent a government in one country from supporting companies there - over competitors in another country. This support could be financial - for instance, allowing companies to borrow more cheaply, or charging them less in tax. The 2019 agreement which set out how the UK would leave the EU. It covered: Money the UK still has to pay the EU The rights of EU citizens who already live in the UK and UK citizens in the EU The Northern Ireland protocol is part of this agreement. It set out special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid the need for checks along the Irish border. This will be the situation if the UK and the EU don't reach a trade agreement by the end of 2020. It means that both sides would have to charge tariffs - or taxes - on goods crossing borders. If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under what's called WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, where each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering, and applies them equally to all its trading partners. The government currently refers to this as an ""Australian-style deal"".

Bargain Booze firm heads for administration,"Conviviality, the owner of Bargain Booze, has announced plans to file for administration within two weeks. The firm also owns Wine Rack and supplies more than 25,000 restaurants, hotels and bars. Earlier this month it shocked investors with a profit warning and news of an unpaid Â£30m tax bill. It attempted to raise Â£125m to rescue the business, but this week said that effort had failed. Conviviality employs about 2,500 staff and their jobs are now in jeopardy. One of its most important customers is the JD Wetherspoon pub chain. Conviviality supplies all the wine and spirits to 900 Wetherspoon pubs - a contract worth tens of millions of pounds a year. Wetherspoon said that at the moment deliveries are continuing and it has contingency plans if those supplies are disrupted. Despite reassurance from Conviviality that it will continue to trade, the British Beer and Pub Association said the situation is ""causing concern"" for pubs as Conviviality is such a significant supplier. Earlier this month, Conviviality slashed its forecast for underlying earnings this year to Â£55m from Â£70m. Just days later,on 14 March, it revealed a Â£30m tax billthat had to be paid by the end of the month. Those revelations prompted the resignation of chief executive Diana Hunter, who had been in charge since 2013, the year Conviviality listed on the London Stock Exchange. Under her leadership the company expanded rapidly. Its core business had been selling popular alcohol brands at rock bottom prices, but in 2015 Ms Hunter took the firm into the wholesaling of drinks with the purchase of Matthew Clark. It also went upmarket with the purchase of wine specialist Bibendum. As recently as 29 January Conviviality management was buoyant.Announcing half-year pre-tax profits of Â£7.4m,externalchief executive Diana Hunter celebrated the company's ""strength"" and ""above market growth"". However, the first sign of troublecame a little over a month later, on 8 March,external. The company warned that profits would be 20% below market expectations.  It blamed an error in its forecasts and weaker profit margins. Then, on 14 March, it revealed a Â£30m,externaltax bill that had to be paid by the end of the month. It entered discussions with its lenders and looked at raising funds on the stock market. By 28 March the game was up.An effort to raise Â£125m from shareholders failed.,externalA day later Conviviality announced its intention to call in the administrators. From the first sign of trouble to the brink of failure took just 21 days. Conviviality created a potentially strong business model according to Phil Carroll, a research analyst with investment firm, Shore Capital. But, he said, management of the company's operations had ""fallen short"". In particular the wholesale business had struggled to ""get price increases to stick"" and profit margins had suffered, he said. Molly Johnson-Jones, a retail analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Numerous accounting errors and misjudgements suggest poor management oversight."" Conviviality had been trying to raise Â£125m to keep the business going, but on Wednesday it announced that those attempts had failed. In its latest update, the company said:,external""Unless circumstances change, and in accordance with statutory requirements, the Board intend to appoint administrators within 10 business days. ""The secured creditors can, however, appoint administrators without the requirement for notice."" Conviviality said it was exploring ""a number of inbound enquiries regarding a potential sale of all or parts of the business"". Brewers and food retailers might be among those interested in buying all, or part of Conviviality. In particular, the Matthew Clark wholesale business and Bibendum wine specialist could attract buyers, analysts say. Potential buyers might be impressed by some of the big firms supplied by Conviviality. They include: Stonegate which has 690 pubs including the Slug and Lettuce chain The brewer Wadworth, which owns 200 pubs Mitchells & Butler, owner of O'Neill's and All Bar One Conviviality is the latest in a series of retailers to run into trouble. Last week, fashion chain New Looksaid it would close 60 stores and cut 1,000 jobs. At the end of February the UK arm ofToys R Us went into administration, and earlier this month it announced all of its stores would close.

Smith and batsmen David Warner and Cameron Bancroft have been banned byCricket Australiafor the incident in the third Test against South Africa. ""It was a failure of my leadership,"" said the 28-year-old at a news conference in Sydney. Bancroft and Warner have also apologised for their actions. Australia coach Darren Lehmann, who was cleared of any involvement in the incident, announced later on Thursday that he wouldstand down following the current Test series with South Africa. Smith added: ""I am deeply sorry, I love the game of cricket, I love kids wanting to play the great game of cricket that I love. ""Any time you think about making a questionable decision, think about affecting your parents. ""To see the way my old man has been, and my mum, it hurts.

Bancroft spoke to the media in Perth and said: ""It's something I will regret for the rest of my life. I feel like I've let everyone down in Australia."" The 25-year-old, who was playing his eighth Test, received a nine-month ban from international cricket after it was revealed he used sandpaper to damage the ball during the third Test against South Africa. He had initially claimed he used tape after the incident was caught on camera. ""I lied. I lied about the sandpaper,"" Bancroft said. ""I panicked in that situation and I'm very sorry. I feel like I've let everyone down in Australia."" Smith admitted that the Aussie ""leadership group"" had devised a plan to tamper with the ball, and Cricket Australia's investigation found Warner instructed Bancroft how to carry it out. He also denied it had happened before, followingsuggestionssimilar tactics were employed in the recent Ashes series against England. Both Smith and Warner have been given year-long suspensions from international cricket. Smith, 28, and Bancroft have also been banned from captaining Australia for at least the next two years, while Warner, 31, will not be considered for any team leadership positions in the future. All three players have been sent home from the tour.

I want to make clear that as captain of the Australian cricket team I take full responsibility. ""I made a serious error of judgement and I now understand the consequences. It was a failure of my leadership. I will do everything I can to make up for my mistake and the damage it has caused. ""If any good can come of this, I hope I can be a force for change. I know I will regret this for the rest of my life. I am absolutely gutted. I hope in time I can earn back respect and forgiveness. ""To my knowledge this has never happened before. This is the first time I've seen this happen and I can assure you it will never happen again."" David Warner on Twitter:""To cricket fans in Australia and all over the world: I am currently on my way to Sydney. Mistakes have been made which have damaged cricket. I apologise for my part and take responsibility for it. ""I understand the distress this has caused the sport and its fans. It's a stain on the game we all love and I have loved since I was a boy. ""I need to take a deep breath and spend time with my family, friends and trusted advisors. You will hear from me in a few days."" Cameron Bancroft speaking to the media in Perth:""I want to say that I'm very sorry. I'm very disappointed and I regret my actions. It is something I will regret for the rest of my life. ""I lied. I lied about the sandpaper. I panicked in that situation and I'm very sorry. I feel like I've let everyone down in Australia ""The thing that breaks my heart the most is that I've given up my spot in the team for free.

Many former players took to social media to give their thoughts: Former fast bowler Mitchell Johnson commented on the situation on Twitter BBC commentator and former England captain Michael Vaughan showed sympathy for the Australian players Smith's predecessor as captain, Michael Clarke, offered a one-word verdict The ball-tampering incident, and its subsequent media exposure, has already had financial implications on Cricket Australia and the players involved. Smith and Warner have lost their lucrative contracts with the Indian Premier League, reported to be worth more than Â£1m each. Magellan, the naming rights sponsor of the Australian Test team, has pulled out of its deal two years early while sportswear company Asics has ended its partnerships with Smith, Bancroft and Warner. Smith has also been dropped as the face of breakfast cerealWeet-Bix. Players' body the Australian Cricketers' Association says ""it is right"" to sanction the players for their parts in the scandal but questioned ""the severity and proportionality of the proposed sanctions"". The organisation, which says it is providing support to the three, cited several reasons why it believes the bans are not ""fair"". They include the sanctions being ""considerably higher"" than the punishments meted out for similar offences by the sport's world governing body, the International Cricket Council (ICC). The ICC banned Smith for one game and fined him his entire match fee, while Bancroft was fined 75% of his match fee and given three demerit points. Warner was not punished by the ICC.

Venezuelan cell fire kills nearly 70,"This video can not be played Police used tear gas to disperse crowds desperate for news of loved ones Relatives of 68 people who died when a fire broke out at a police station in the Venezuelan city of Valencia have demanded answers as to what happened. The blaze reportedly started after prisoners set fire to mattresses in an attempt to break out on Wednesday. The United Nations has called on the Venezuelan authorities to carry out a speedy investigation and to provide reparations to victims' families. The fire is one of the deadliest incidents in Venezuela's prisons. The office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights said in a statement that ""where applicable"" those responsible should be brought to justice,external. On Wednesday, anguished relatives had gathered in front of the police station demanding information about their loved ones. They were dispersed by police firing tear gas. Chief prosecutor Tarek William Saab said 66 men and two women, who had been visiting the cells overnight, were killed in the blaze. He also said that an investigation would be launched ""immediately"". August 2017:A riot in police holding cells leaves 37 dead in Amazonas state March 2017:14 bodies are found in a mass grave in a jail in Guarico state September 2015:A blaze in a prison in Tocuyito prison kills 17 January 2013:More than 60 inmates are killed in a prison riot in Barquisimeto The circumstances surrounding the fire have not been officially confirmed. The association Una Ventana a la Libertad (A Window on Freedom), which monitors jail conditions, said its reports showed a police officer had been shot in the leg by a detainee and that shortly afterwards mattresses in cells were set ablaze and the fire quickly spread. Mr Santander did confirm one police officer had been shot. Rescuers reportedly broke through walls to try to free those trapped by the blaze. Nearly all of those who died were inmates but at least two women who were visiting at the time were also killed, Mr Saab said. Some of the victims burned to death, others died of smoke inhalation. Angry relatives gathered outside the detention centre and clashed with police as they sought information about loved ones. Relatives complained they had been given no information Aida Parra, who said she had last seen her son the day before, told the Associated Press news agency: ""I don't know if my son is dead or alive. They haven't told me anything."" Dora Blanco told local media: ""I am a desperate mother. My son has been here a week. They have not given any information."" The government has set up an inquiry. Carabobo state governor Rafael Lacava expressed his condolences, adding:  ""A serious and profound investigation has been initiated to find the causes and those responsible for these regrettable events."" Facilities are notoriously overcrowded, with violence and deadly riots common. The country has struggled to accommodate its prisoners amid an ongoing economic crisis, leading to the use of temporary facilities such as the one in Valencia. By Daniel GarcÃ­a Marco, BBC Mundo, Caracas Many police stations in Venezuela are being used as de facto prisons. Their holding cells were built for 30 to 40 people but often hundreds are crammed inside awaiting trial or transfer to a proper jail. Detainees can sometimes spend years there. When I visited such a police station several months ago in Caracas, I saw dozens of men sharing a very small cell. Their relatives came twice a day to deliver them some food which the prisoners shared among themselves. Carlos Nieto of Una Ventana a la Libertad says that about 45,000 people are currently locked up in 500 police stations across the country. He says that a disaster like the one that happened in Valencia could ""happen anytime, anywhere and [the next one] could even be worse"". Inmates are supposed to be held for only 48 hours in police holding cells. Una Ventana a la Libertad says some police facilities are overfilled at five times their capacity. The organisation says that 65 people died last year in temporary cells due to violence, disease or malnutrition. Last month inmates at a different prison in Carabobo took a number of prisoners and guards hostage in another riot.

Spy's front door focus of poisoning probe,"Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33 were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok A Russian ex-spy and his daughter first came into contact with the nerve agent that poisoned them at their home, police have said. The highest concentration of the agent used against Sergei and Yulia Skripal was found on their front door. The pair were found collapsed on a bench in Salisbury on 4 March and remain in a critical condition. Police said inquiries would focus on their home address in Christie Miller Road but the risk to locals was low. Traces of the nerve agent had been found at some of the other sites in the city, but they were at lower concentrations. Russian spy: What we know so far Nato slashes Russia staff after poisoning Skripal niece: 'I'd really like to know how they are' MPs to probe Russian money laundering Security correspondent Gordon Corera said the highest concentration was found on the Skripals' door handle, and could have been administered through a ""gloopy substance which could have been smeared on to that door handle"". He added it would explain why the nerve agent may have been found on the Skripals' car - which has been taken by police - or the restaurant in which they had eaten which has been cordoned off by detectives. Specialist officers in protective suits secured the scene following the nerve gas attack Police are appealing for witnesses who saw Mr Skripal's car on the morning of the incident About 250 counter terrorism officers continue to work on the case, examining 5,000 hours of CCTV footage and 1,350 items that have been seized. Officers would continue working at the address over the next few weeks, and potentially months, Deputy Assistant Commissioner Dean Haydon said. ""Those living in the Skripals' neighbourhood can expect to see officers carrying out searches as part of this, but I want to reassure them that the risk remains low and our searches are precautionary,"" he added. Forensic work at shops and at a cemetery in Salisbury is drawing to a close. The Maltings shopping centre, the Ashley Wood compound, and the London Road cemetery have been handed back to Wiltshire Police from the national counter terrorism investigation, Deputy Chief Constable Paul Mills said. Mr Skripal's wife and son are buried in the cemetery, and the former spy and his daughter were discovered unconscious at the Maltings shopping centre. Prime Minister Theresa May has said the chemical used in the attack was part of a group of nerve agents developed by Russia known as Novichok. The prime minister has said there was ""no alternative conclusion other than that the Russian state was culpable,"" in the attack,and she has expelled 23 Russian diplomats from the UK. In addition, at least26 countries, including the US and European allies, are expelling more than 130 diplomats. This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russian media is reporting the score-settling The Russian government has denied any involvement in the attack and has vowed to retaliate against the ""provocative gesture"". Russia hasexpelled 23 British diplomats from Moscow in a tit-for-tat response. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the nerve agent attack had crystallised a ""global wave of revulsion"" against Russia. He added: ""Never before has there been a collective expulsion of Russian diplomats on the scale that we have seen over the last few days."" Col Skripal, 66, had been living in Salisbury after being released by Russia in 2010 Colonel Skripal is a retired Russian military intelligence officer who was convicted of passing the identities of Russian intelligence agents working undercover in Europe to the UK's Secret Intelligence Service, MI6. He was jailed for 13 years by Russia in 2006. In July 2010, he was one of four prisoners released by Moscow in exchange for 10 Russian spies arrested by the FBI. He was later flown to the UK.

Teenager arrested after hoax bomb threat,"An 18-year-old has been arrested after a number of schools and colleges across the UK received threatening emails. The National Crime Agency (NCA) said the incident was linked to a hoax bomb threat that closed hundreds of schools last week. The teenager was arrested in Abbots Langley, Hertfordshire, on Wednesday night on suspicion of making malicious communications. A NCA spokesman said the threats had ""caused considerable concern"". He added: ""We do not assess there to be an increased risk to the public."" Around 400 schools were closed last week after receiving the emails.

What do people think about Brexit?,"This video can not be played With a year until our departure, what do voters make of the Brexit progress so far? There's plenty on this blog, and on our TV and radio reporting, about the political progress of Brexit, or lack thereof - the moments where it's felt like the wheels were coming off, then wheels up, as the PM flew to Brussels in the dead of night when it was suddenly all back on. But it was the public's decision, even if it was close, and politicians across the spectrum are still dealing with the consequences of that momentous decision. With almost exactly a year to go what does the public make of what's being done in their name? The polls don't seem to have shifted decisively, although you might wonder how much credibility they have these days. Why is Brexit taking so long? So on Tuesday night, with the help of the organisation Britain Thinks, we gathered together a group of voters in Coventry - which voted just over 55% to Leave - to ask what they make of what's been going on. The group was carefully selected for different ages, backgrounds and balanced between Leave and Remain voters. Focus groups aren't scientific, but they do give a flavour of conversations that are happening around the country. As most MPs would admit, on all sides, there is a frustration that the process is still going on. Quite understandably most people are not paying attention to every tiny twist and turn. But even the Remain voters in the group wanted the government to get on with it - there was little appetite for the suggestion of re-running the argument, prolonging the agony. There was no particular love for Theresa May or Jeremy Corbyn - the group branded the prime minister ""very weak"" - Mr Corbyn was even branded ""weak as fish"". But it was striking how from the outset the group referred to Brexit as a catch-all for their wider concerns, particularly about the NHS and immigration, just as Vote Leave tied those two arguments together in the campaign, with all the controversy that flowed from that. But there was a definite sense in the room that Brexit had been a promise of something else, a promise that not much in the last 12 months has gone very far towards keeping. It's true that Brexit is fiendishly complicated, technical, and full of tension. None of the main political parties are sure-footed in how to respond. But in one big sense it is politically very simple. A narrow majority of the country expressed the desire for something different, and politicians are under pressure to show that something can change.

All you need to know,"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

Reality Check: Your Brexit questions answeredVideoVideoThe top five clichÃ©sYour guide to EU jargonWhy is Brexit taking sooo long?All you need to know,"With a year to go before the UK leaves the EU, there are plenty of questions about Brexit still unanswered. As negotiators continue to hammer out the details of the withdrawal agreement and start to outline the future relationship, many are wondering what will change and what will stay the same. Here are some of the questions posed by the BBC audience. Mrs T Conlin, Loddon, Norfolk The short answer is no. As I'm sure you know, there's no such thing as an EU passport and you are an EU citizen only because you have a passport from one of the 28 member states. In effect your UK passport gives you a number of rights and guarantees, including the ability to move freely between EU countries to work, live or study. But if, as expected, the UK leaves the EU on schedule on 29 March 2019, it will then become ""a third country"". At that point you'd no longer be a citizen of an EU country and consequently no longer an EU citizen. Things won't change much for a while because the UK and the EU have reached agreement in principle that there should be a transition period between 29 March 2019 and 31 December 2020 during which all EU law will continue to apply in the UK. That would mean that you'd enjoy exactly the same rights and guarantees as before. But a word of warning on the transition (or implementation period as the government prefers to call it): it is part of the overall withdrawal agreement and will come into effect only if the withdrawal agreement is ratified by both the EU and the UK before Brexit day. The uncertainty around citizens' rights has led to tens of thousands more UK citizens applying for citizenship in other EU countries in the 12 months after the Brexit vote than in the previous year,according to data obtained by the BBC last year. But not everyone has the right (through family links or residency) to do that. Martin Buchanâ via Twitter In theory we could leave tomorrow if Parliament simply repealed the European Communities Act, the legislation that took us in to the EU (or the EEC as it then was) in the first place. But that isn't going to happen. First of all it would probably put the UK in breach of both EU and international law. Secondly, the government doesn't want to leave straight away and neither do the vast majority of MPs. Why not? Because that would take us off the ""cliff edge"" that you may have heard about. Leaving without any withdrawal agreement in place, and no discussion of the future trade or security relationship, would be the hardest of hard Brexits. Don't forget, we've been in the EU for 45 years, and untangling that relationship is incredibly complicated. That's why many people describe what's going on at the moment as the most complex negotiation in modern history. A ""cliff edge"" Brexit - without any new structures to replace the old EU ones - could in the short term see no flights between the EU and the UK, lorries and people stuck at border crossings, imports and exports of food rotting at the border and huge delays in the movement of vital supplies such as medicines, not to mention the impact on restaurants, manufacturing, tourism and other sectors. Chaos, in other words. So is no deal really better than a bad deal? There are those who argue that no deal would be the worst deal of all. The rhetoric is all part of the give and take of negotiation, of course, and the government wants to make the process of withdrawal as smooth as possible. That is why it has also agreed in principle to a transition (or implementation) period for 21 months after Brexit to give more time to get all those new structures in place. Michael Jones, Swindon As soon as the UK leaves the EU, the 73 UK MEPs who were elected by UK voters will lose their seats. That means there will no longer be any UK representation in theEuropean Parliament,external, even during the transition period after Brexit, when the UK will still have to follow all EU rules and regulations. All MEPs are paid out of the EU budget, rather than from their national budgets. So in that sense there'll be no direct saving to the UK taxpayer when the UK MEPs leave - but obviously the UK pays its share of the EU budget. Once the transition period is over, at the end of 2020, the UK will pay only for specific things and the salaries of MEPs will not be one of them. Bearing all that in mind, here is a quick calculation. The current gross salary for an MEP is â¬8,611 per month. So, the total gross cost of all UK MEP salaries (at current exchange rates) is just over Â£6.6m per year. But MEPs also get substantial allowances for staff and travel and office costs, so the total saving will be considerably higher. It's also worth pointing out that all MEPs who stand down or lose their seats are entitled to a payment of one month's salary for each year they served, to a maximum of 24 months. If an MEP takes a mandate in another parliament or another public office, or if he or she retires, they are not entitled to this payment. Two current UK MEPs have already served for more than 24 years - David Martin (Labour) and James Nicholson (Ulster Unionist Party). Among those who will have served for nearly 20 years by the time the UK is due to leave the EU next year are arch-Brexiteers Nigel Farage (UKIP) and Daniel Hannan (Conservative). It is not clear at this stage who will meet these severance payments for departing UK MEPs: the UK government or the EU. This is yet another detail that has to be decided before 29 March 2019. And in terms of overall savings, remember the UK will be paying into EU pension pots, including the one for MEPs, for many years to come. Nigel Patrickâ via Twitter Yes, you will still be able to play the EuroMillions lottery and Brexit will not affect that. The bad news is that Brexit is highly unlikely to increase your chances of winning. EuroMillions might sound like it is run by the EU or by the countries that use the euro, but it has nothing to do with either. The game is based on an agreement between the official lottery operators of nine countries, one of which - Switzerland - is not a member of the EU. The eight EU countries are: Austria, Belgium, France, Republic of Ireland, Luxembourg, Portugal, Spain and the UK (for now). Elizabeth Those rights will certainly change, but they may not disappear entirely. Currently, any British student can study at a university in any EU member state, provided he or she fulfils the entry requirements of that institution. The rules also say that all EU nationals are entitled to use a host country's education system on the same terms as its own nationals. So a British student will pay the same tuition fees as the national of that country or no fee at all, if that's the case for the home students there. Six things to watch if Brexit puzzles you Brexit: All you need to know (By the way, the fact that students from England, Wales and Northern Ireland have to pay more than students from elsewhere in the EU to study in Scotland is down to devolved UK law, it's nothing to do with the EU.) But back to the question itself: the UK and the EU have agreed in principle that any UK citizen who moves to study in another EU country before Brexit (due to happen on 29 March 2019), as well as during the transition period after Brexit (due to run until the end of 2020), will retain the right to study on the same terms as that country's own nationals. Again that assumes that the withdrawal agreement is implemented and the transition goes ahead. And it's worth bearing in mind that as long as you start your course before the transition ends, you will still pay local rates even if your course continues after the transition is over. What about those who want to start studying in the EU after the transition - in 2021 and beyond?  Well, that is likely to depend on the policy that each individual country has on tuition fees for non-EU students. Germany, for example, abolished university fees in 2014, and all students - German, EU or non-EU - can study there for free or for a small fee that mainly covers administration costs. So you are likely to be able to study on exactly the same terms in Germany, unless Germany decides to change its own domestic law. But in some other countries the opportunity to take advantage of cheaper tuition fees will no longer be available. Ghene Snowdonâ via Twitter We could well lose free mobile roaming, but it is hard to give a definitive answer at this stage. If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March 2019 with a withdrawal agreement in place, then it won't happen immediately. All EU rules and regulations, including on free mobile roaming anywhere in the EU, will continue to apply until the end of the transition period, on 31 December 2020. It's also possible that the transition period could be extended, but that's fairly speculative at this stage. So what will happen to free mobile roaming once the transition period is over? Well at that point, EU laws will no longer apply to the UK and UK mobile network operators will be able to reintroduce roaming charges if they so wish. Some major operators say they currently have no plans to do so, but that can't be guaranteed and it's bound to be affected by the commercial decisions taken at the time by both EU and UK operators. It's also possible that the UK government could create its own laws regulating roaming fees after Brexit. But we don't know if it would, and even if it did any such law would probably have to take the form of an agreement with the EU. In other words, it would depend on a future UK-EU future trade deal that has yet to be negotiated. Stephane Caussin, London There has been no estimate published for the overall cost of replacing EU agencies and it would be difficult to come up with one. But it won't be cheap. There are dozens of EU agencies that the UK currently relies upon, regulating everything from aviation and maritime safety, through chemicals and pharmaceuticals, to food and drink. Some people might say we don't need them, it's all just excessive bureaucracy. But without regulations on airline safety your planes can't take off, and without regulations on pharmaceuticals you can't buy and sell medicines. So it does matter. Building new institutions from scratch, training staff and developing expertise, will take considerable time and money. For example, ADS - the lobby group for the aerospace industry - estimates that replacing the work the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) does in the UK would cost about Â£400m over 10 years. But one reason why it's hard to say how much money could be spent overall on new regulators is that the UK government doesn't want to duplicate the work of all EU agencies. It says it would like to continue to participate in some of them after Brexit and it is prepared to pay the EU for that. In fact, in herMansion House speech earlier this month,external, Prime Minister Theresa May said EASA was one the agencies the UK wanted to remain part of. Two others she mentioned were theEuropean Medicines Agency,externaland theEuropean Chemicals Agency,external. Full UK membership is not on the cards, so the UK wants to explore some form of associate membership. The trouble is that for many people in the EU that looks like another form of UK cherry-picking. It also raises questions about the role of the European Court of Justice in overseeing EU agencies. The UK hopes such doubts can be overcome, but it all remains to be negotiated. One of the arguments made by supporters of Brexit is that they want to be free to regulate some things in a different way - to meet the needs of an economy that is changing fast. But it will certainly cost plenty of money to set up a new system. Update 5 April 2018: this article has been updated to reflect the fact that leaving the EU straight away would probably put the UK in breach of EU and international law.

Your guide to EU jargonWhy is Brexit taking sooo long?All you need to know,"The UK and the European Union are in talks about how they could live and work together after Brexit. Politicians use many different terms when discussing Brexit - here is what some of the key ones mean. Please upgrade your browser Use the list below or select a button Britain's exit from the European Union. A period lasting from 31 January to 31 December 2020, when the UK is no longer a member of the EU, but still follows all its rules. It was agreed by the UK and the EU to allow both sides time to reach a deal on their future relationship. Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. A deal between countries to reduce, but not necessarily eliminate, trade barriers such as: Taxes that must be paid when trading Limits on how much of certain goods can be imported Rules on things such as hygiene or labelling of food How the agreement between the EU and the UK would be enforced if there is a dispute. One controversial issue has been about what role, if any, the European Court of Justice should play. A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders. Rules on who can fish where, and how much of each species can be caught. A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements often include level playing field measures. EU laws which prevent a government in one country from supporting companies there - over competitors in another country. This support could be financial - for instance, allowing companies to borrow more cheaply, or charging them less in tax. The 2019 agreement which set out how the UK would leave the EU. It covered: Money the UK still has to pay the EU The rights of EU citizens who already live in the UK and UK citizens in the EU The Northern Ireland protocol is part of this agreement. It set out special arrangements for Northern Ireland, to avoid the need for checks along the Irish border. This will be the situation if the UK and the EU don't reach a trade agreement by the end of 2020. It means that both sides would have to charge tariffs - or taxes - on goods crossing borders. If countries don't have free-trade agreements, they usually trade with each other under what's called WTO (World Trade Organization) rules, where each country sets tariffs - or taxes - on goods entering, and applies them equally to all its trading partners. The government currently refers to this as an ""Australian-style deal"".

Why is Brexit taking sooo long?All you need to know,"It's been more than two years since the UK voted to leave the EU and the negotiations, pronouncements and progress reports seem never-ending. So while there's just over six months until Brexit day, with a 21-month transition period after that, we ask why does it seem to be taking sooo long?  We voted in 2016 â why is it taking so long to leave? Well, none of the major players has ever left the European Union before... So there are some BIG problems to solve Such as how we donât end up worse-off economically The EU has a ""single market"" - goods from other EU countries aren't taxed at the border And people can also move around as if the EU was a single country Outside the EU, the UK might have to pay more to buy from and sell to EU countries This could also slow the flow of goods and parts, disrupting production for UK firms The EU says Britain canât cherry pick â keeping some benefits without membership But that could mean the UK is freer to make other trade deals around the world Any special deal the UK wants has to be approved by MPs first Then the deal has to be agreed by 27 national parliaments across Europe Thatâs a lot of people who need to agree with each otherâ¦ So, the date UK is meant to leave is 29 March 2019 But there are already plans for a 21-month transition period after that During which the UK could still be governed by some EU laws A trade deal between Canada and the EU took seven years to agree However, as the UKâs already fully aligned with the EU, it could be quicker But it is likely that we will all be talking about Brexit for a long time yet...
