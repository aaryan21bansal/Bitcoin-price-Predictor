Facebook bows to Singapore's 'fake news' law,"Facebook said it was following the law by adding the correction label Facebook has added a correction notice to a post that Singapore's government said contained false information. It is the first time Facebook has issued such a notice under the city-state's controversial ""fake news"" law. Singapore claimed the post, by fringe news site States Times Review (STR), contained ""scurrilous accusations"". The note issued by the social media giant said it ""is legally required to tell you that the Singapore government says this post has false information"". Facebook's addition was embedded at the bottom of the original post, which was not altered. It was only visible to social media users in Singapore. Singapore passes controversial fake news law Concern over Singapore's anti-fake news law Singapore: What you need to know In an emailed statement to the BBC, Facebook said it had applied a label to a post ""determined by the Singapore government to contain false information"", as required under the ""fake news"" law. The company - which has its Asia headquarters in the city-state - said it hoped assurances that the law would not impact on free expression ""will lead to a measured and transparent approach to implementation"". The States Times Review post contained accusations about the arrest of an alleged whistleblower and election-rigging. The governmentsaid no one had been arrested,external, and accused the STR of making ""scurrilous accusations against the elections department, the prime minister, and the election process in Singapore"". A post on the Singaporean government website said the STR post contained false statements Authorities ordered editor Alex Tan to correct the post but the Australian citizen refused, saying he would ""not comply with any order from a foreign government,external"". Authorities then called on Facebook to ""publish a correction notice"" in line with the ""fake news"" law passed earlier this year. The law, known as the Protection from Online Falsehoods and Manipulation bill, came into effect in October. It allows the government to order online platforms to remove and correct what it deems to be false statements that are ""against the public interest"". A person found guilty of doing this in Singapore could be fined heavily and face a prison sentence of up to five years. The law also bans the use of fake accounts or bots to spread fake news - this carries penalties of up to S$1m (Â£563,000, $733,700) and a jail term of up to 10 years. Critics say the law threatens freedom of expression. Amnesty International said it would ""give authorities unchecked powers to clamp down on online views of which it disapproves"". But Singapore's law minister said free speech ""should not be affected by this bill"", adding that it was aimed only at tackling ""falsehoods, bots, trolls and fake accounts"". The government has argued that the law safeguards against abuse of power by allowing judicial reviews of its orders. Singapore's government invoked the law for the first time on Monday to order opposition politician Brad Bowyer to correct a Facebook post questioning the independence of state investment funds. Mr Bowyer complied, adding a note to the post saying it ""contains false statements of fact"". On the same day, Mr Bowyer wrote a new post saying he was ""not against being asked to make clarifications or corrections especially if it is in the public interest"". But on Thursday, Mr Bowyerclarified his earlier statement,external, saying: ""Although I have no problems in following the law...that does not mean that I agree with the position they are taking or admit to any false statements on my part."" He also said that, under the law, he must post the correction notice ""regardless of whether I make an appeal"".

Brazil's leader accuses DiCaprio over Amazon fires,"Fires that burned in August caused global concern for the ""lungs of the planet"" Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has accused Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio of ""giving money to set the Amazon on fire"". The president gave no evidence but in the past has accused NGOs critical of his policies of starting fires that ravaged the rainforest this year. Several arrests have been made amid controversial and unproven allegations fires were started to obtain funding. DiCaprio, who has pledged $5m for the Amazon, denied Mr Bolsonaro's claim. The latest comments appear to arise from the arrest of four volunteer firefighters from northern ParÃ¡ state on allegations they started fires to generate NGO donations. Amazon fires: What's the latest in Brazil? 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute How do you fight extreme wildfires? Rights groups, NGOs and critics claimed the police operation against them was politically motivated and an attempt to harass environmental groups. Fires that burned in August this year caused global concern for the ""lungs of the planet"". His latest accusation came during brief remarks at the presidential residence on Friday. ""This Leonardo DiCaprio is a cool guy, right? Giving money to torch the Amazon."" He gave no evidence and did not elaborate, although the statement appeared to echo a live webcast he gave on Thursday. That revolved around the environmental organisation, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and allegations, denied by the WWF, that it had paid for images taken by the arrested firefighters, who have since been released. Mr Bolsonaro said: ""So what did the NGO do? What is the easiest thing? Set fire to the forest. Take pictures, make a video. [WWF] makes a campaign against Brazil, it contacts Leonardo DiCaprio, he donates $500,000. ""A part of that went to the people that were setting fires. Leonardo DiCaprio, you are contributing to the fire in the Amazon, that won't do,"" he said. The actor and environmental activist released a statement saying: ""Although they are certainly worth supporting, we have not funded the organisations that are currently under attack. ""The future of these irreplaceable ecosystems is at stake and I am proud to be part of the groups that protect them."" DiCaprio denied the accusations but said he supported the groups involved He praised ""the people of Brazil working to save their natural and cultural heritage"". WWF also said it had received no donations from the actor, whose Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation focuses on environmental projects. Allow Instagram content?

For several weeks in August, fires burned in parts of the Amazon at a rate not seen in years, sparking international concern over the condition of the ""lungs of the planet"".

Mr Bolsonaro deployed the army to the Amazon and the fires eased after August, although campaigners say the government should be doing more to stop them. Forest fires occur during the dry season between July and October.

Merkel ally's loss casts doubt on German coalition,"Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken are from the leftist contingent of the SPD The future of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition has been thrown into doubt after her deputy chancellor lost the leadership race of his party. Olaf Scholz, who is also finance minister, lost his bid to become leader of the centre-left SPD. The party is now expected to vote on whether to stay in the coalition with Ms Merkel's conservative CDU/CSU. Mr Scholz's joint challengers, Norbert Walter-Borjans and Saskia Esken, have been highly critical of the coalition. Elsewhere on Saturday, the far-right AfD, which is the biggest opposition party in the German parliament, elected Tino Chrupalla, a lawmaker from eastern Germany, to lead the party along with Joerg Meuthen. Mr Scholz and his running mate Klara Geywitz, who back staying in the coalition until 2021, received just 45.3% of the vote, while their challengers won 53%. Mr Walter-Borjans and Ms Esken, relative unknowns from the party's leftist contingent, have said they want to renegotiate the coalition deal with Ms Merkel's conservatives to focus more on social justice and investment. Is Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer Merkel 2.0? Merkel bids emotional farewell to party Mr Scholz said the SPD must now ""stand behind the new leadership"". This video can not be played How Angela Merkel rose to power to lead Germany Paul Ziemiak, general secretary of the CDU (whose Bavarian sister party is the CSU), said ""the decision today has changed nothing"" about the alliance. Poor election results and mixed views of Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who replaced Ms Merkel as CDU leader in 2018, have led to discontent within the party. Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer replaced Angela Merkel as CDU leader in December 2018 Some have said a snap election or a minority government could be on the cards. Mrs Merkel has said she will not run again in 2021 after 14 years at the helm of the country. Last week, Ms Kramp-Karrenbauer called for unity while threatening to stand down as CDU leader if the party failed to back her,which prompted a lengthy ovation at the annual congress. Mr Chrupalla is a former painter and decorator from Saxony. Tino Chrupalla will jointly lead the AfD He replaces one of the party's founders, 78-year-old Alexander Gauland, who gained international attention for a series of controversial remarks, including one comparing the Nazi era to a speck of bird droppings on German history. ""If we want more success we need to change,"" Mr Chrupalla said. ""We want to move toward the centre. This will work because the CDU keeps moving to the left.""

Whale found dead on bank of River Thames,"The mammal was found motionless on the river banks under Battersea Bridge A dead whale has washed up in the River Thames for the second time in two months. The mammal, believed to be a minke whale which can grow up to 33ft (10m) long, was found motionless on the river banks under Battersea Bridge late on Friday. The Port of London Authority (PLA) said it will ""endeavour to get the whale recovered safely"" over the weekend. A humpback whale wasfound dead in Greenhithe in October. Clio Georgiadis said her 11-year-old son spotted the whale on Friday evening Clio Georgiadis said she was left ""very emotional "" after finding the whale while walking her dog at about 21.30 GMT. ""We tried to see if there was any life in it but there was no breath coming out of it,"" Ms Georgiadis said. ""It was very sad to see."" A post-mortem examination will be held on the whale to establish a cause of death The PLA believe the mammal is a minke whale, which can weigh up to 10 tonnes. They are occasionally spotted in British waters, preferring cooler regions to tropical areas, and can also be found in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian and Arctic Oceans. The PLA confirmed that it had received reports of a large mammal in the River Thames on Friday afternoon. ""The first clear indication we knew it was a whale was sadly when it washed up dead,"" PLA spokesman Martin Garside said. Two marine experts from the British Divers Marine Life Rescue were dispatched to assist the PLA removing the whale from the water. The whale will be sent to the ZSL London Zoo for a post-mortem examination.

N Korea threatens Japan with 'real missile',"A state media image said to show Kim Jong-un inspecting the testing of a ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"" North Korea has branded Japan's PM Shinzo Abe an ""imbecile"" and ""political dwarf"", accusing him of mislabelling its latest weapons test. Mr Abe condemned the North for ""repeated launches of ballistic missiles"" after two projectiles were fired on Thursday. But the North insisted it was testing a ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"". On Saturday, state media said Japan ""may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future"". North Korea is banned from firing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words The country is under various sets of sanctions over its missile and nuclear programmes. Lifting the sanctions has been a key aim of the North in talks with the US - Japan's ally - but these have stalled since a summit between its leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump broke down in February. The North fired what observers in South Korea called two ""unidentified projectiles"" from its South Hamgyong province into the Sea of Japan on Thursday. A KCNA image of the ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"" said to have been tested Condemning the launch, Mr Abe said: ""North Korea's repeated launches of ballistic missiles are a serious defiance to not only our country but also the international community."" The North issued photographs said to be of Mr Kim inspecting the launch. North Korea's KCNA state media said on Saturday: ""It can be said that Abe is the only one idiot in the world and the most stupid man ever known in history as he fails to distinguish a missile from a multiple launch rocket system while seeing the photo-accompanied report."" It added: ""Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose. Abe is none other than a perfect imbecile and a political dwarf."" Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said neither side was necessarily right. The projectile is believed to have been a KN-25, a rocket many analysts consider to be a ""ballistic missile"" due to its large size, and because it follows an unpowered ballistic trajectory for part of its flight. ""The North Koreans are playing a semantics game, basically, and by the same token so is Abe,"" said the MIT specialist. ""When he said ballistic missile he's clearly trying to signify these tests are a violation of UN Security Council resolutions,"" he told the BBC. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Watch: What's it like to live in North Korea? ""North Korea is saying ... it's a multi-launch rocket system, which is different from a ballistic missile."" But the bigger story, the security expert added, is that North Korea could be preparing for longer-range ballistic missile launches. ""The bigger line... is that Abe may soon see a ballistic missile under his nose. It seems to suggest that they are gearing up to start testing longer-range systems,"" he said. Negotiations between North Korea and the US remain stalled since the collapse of February's summit in Hanoi. Mr Trump and Mr Kim did meet again in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Koreas in June and agreed to restart working-level talks. These began in October, but failed to make any progress. This video can not be played Mr Trump and Mr Kim met at the DMZ in June but the historic event led to little progress The North has demanded the US change its approach by the end of the year, and was lukewarm in response to a tweet by Mr Trump hinting at another meeting with Mr Kim. In May, Mr Abe said he was ready to meet Mr Kim ""without conditions"", raising hopes of renewed negotiations on the nuclear issue as well as on the lingering historical issue of the North's abduction of Japanese citizens. The Japanese were kidnapped by the North in the 1970s and 80s to help train its spies. Japan believes 17 citizens were abducted, only five of whom have since been repatriated. But Mr Abe's offer has not come to fruition. The North said this month that the Japanese leader would never set foot in Pyongyang after he condemned an earlier weapons test.

Climate change 'blueprint' for Wales launched,"The Welsh Government has already declared a ""climate emergency"" A five-year blueprint to tackle climate change in Wales has been launched by the Welsh Government. Prosperity for All: A Climate Conscious Wales,externalsets out plans to improve flood defences, secure water supplies, and other environmental improvements. Environment minister Lesley Griffiths said the plan is ""challenging"". But Welsh Conservative Andrew RT Davies said ""questions must be answered"" over if the plans are ""workable"" and ""economically viable"". The plans build on theclimate emergency declarationmade earlier this year and Wales' first climate change conference, the Welsh Government said. Ms Griffiths added: ""But we must all adapt and we must all commit to protect our nation for current and future generations. ""Success will mean Wales is a climate conscious nation, aware of the risks facing us, whilst being prepared and ready to adapt to the impacts before they occur."" Environment minister Lesley Griffiths said ""we must all adapt"" The proposals include: Building defences to guard against flooding and coastal erosion Protecting water supplies from drought Reducing the use of pesticides Growing more woodland Creating more open spaces The creation of 25,000 more energy efficient homes by 2021 Environment spokesman for the Welsh Conservatives in the assembly, Mr Davies said: ""The devil, as ever, is not only in the detail, but also in the practical application of any plan. ""Questions that must be answered include is it workable? Is it economically viable?"" He said the Welsh Labour government's record on the environment ""has been appalling"". Warming signal links global floods and fires Are we passing some key 'tipping points'? 'Clear and unequivocal' emergency, say scientists Plaid Cymru said the blueprint was ""more of the all-talk, no-action approach"" from Labour. ""Emissions have risen in Wales and tree planting targets cut, we don't need more plans, we need delivery,"" said Plaid's assembly environment spokesman, Llyr Gruffydd. The Brexit Party's Mark Reckless said he welcomed the ""continued cross-party approach and support"" for his party's proposals to ""increase tree planting outside the EU's anti-environmental agricultural policy"".

Two further injured people remain in hospital Usman Khan, 28, who carried out the attack, was a former prisoner convicted of terrorism offences He was out on licence and wearing a tag. He was shot dead by police after people restrained him Visiting the scene with London's mayor and the head of the Met Police, the PM says automatic early release from jail is not working Police have been searching properties in Staffordshire Friday's attack began during a conference at Fishmongers' Hall, near Monument, at 13:58 GMT Mary O'Connor, Claire Heald, Harriet Agerholm, Katie Wright and Thomas Mackintosh The London Bridge area has remained cordoned off throughout the day as forensic officers continue to carry out checks following Friday's events. Here is what has happened this afternoon and this evening:  We're going to bring our coverage of live events to an end now but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt has been described by his father as ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog."" A law and criminology graduate, Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for the University of Cambridge's prison rehabilitation programme. The project, Learning Together, gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together, to help reduce re-offending - something Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment to"", according to people who worked with him. A vigil was held in Cambridge, where Mr Merritt was from, on Saturday. His friends, family and those who worked with him have been paying tribute. You can read more about the tributes made to Mr Merritt here. Usman Khan is quoted further in one of Learning Together's newsletters in which he says the group ""has a special place in his heart"". He added: ""It is more than just an organisation, helping to provide learning of individual academic subjects. ""For me itâs main benefit is bringing people together, through the means of learning. Learning Together is about opening minds, unlocking doors, and giving voice to those who are shut down, hidden from the rest of us. ""It helps to include those who are generally excluded. This is what Learning Together means to me. ""I typed these reflections on the Chromebook I received and I am truly grateful to be able to express myself through it. ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" Usman Khan, the London Bridge
attacker, appeared as a âcase studyâ in a report by the education initiative
whose event he later attacked. The recently published report
focused on the work done by Learning Together providing education and help for
prisoners at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Khan was imprisoned there
before his release on license in December last year. Identified only as ""Usman"",
Khan was said â since leaving prison â to have given a speech at a fundraising
dinner, applied for a course, and been given a âsecureâ laptop that complied
with his licence conditions. The computer was said to have
been provided in conjunction with police and probation, allowing Khan to
continue the writing and studying he began while in jail. Khan contributed a poem to a
separate brochure, in which he expressed gratitude for the laptop, stating: âI
cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those
who continue to support this wonderful community.â BBC News Channel A leading criminal barrister has claimed the probation service ""has been destroyed"" in recent years. Mark Fenhalls QC, the former chair of the Criminal Bar Association, has said that those in the criminal justice system ""are unimpressed"" with politicians who talk about the rights and wrongs over the last few years. He told the BBC News Channel: ""The problem is what happens afterwards, in the prisons when they are not rehabilitated and when they are released if there is not a system in place to properly look after them and protect the rest of us."" Mr Fenhalls said the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan ""appears to have been released according to law and obeying his licencing conditions"". He added: ""Over the last ten or 15 years parliament continuously changes laws and ramps up sentences in every regard, but what it does not do is put money into the system to make sure that people who have have committed offences are rehabilitated."" BBC News Channel Labour's Yvette Cooper says there will need to be a ""serious and full"" investigation into how the incident at London Bridge happened, given that the attacker, Usman Khan, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, who was shot dead by police during Friday's attack, was released from prison on licence in December 2018. The former minister tells the BBC: ""I think there are also some immediate questions that will need to be asked, particularly because we know there may be other people in the same situation as this attacker and it's really important that the government is taking every action to keep people safe."" A key question, she adds, is about what the level of risk assessment and safety assessment is for anyone coming to the end of their sentence. Earlier, Ms Cooper clashed with Home Secretary Priti Patel over Usman Khan's prison release. You can read about thathere. People have been paying tribute to Jack Merritt, the University of Cambridge graduate who was named as one of the victims of the attack. Mr Merritt, who ran a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, had been helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. Audrey Ludwig, who knew Mr Merritt through work,tweeted,externalthat his ""deep commitment to prisoner education and rehabilitation was deeply impressive"". ""I send condolences to his family, colleagues and the prisoners' group."" Another friend said Mr Merritt was ""incredibly witty and intelligent, with more lust for life than many our age and a determination to make his mark in the world"". Allow Twitter content?

Usman Khan asked for specialist help to be deradicalised whilst in prison, but did not receive it, his solicitor has said. Vajahat Sharif, head of terrorism, national security and political crimes at Tuckers solicitors, told the BBC, Khan had recognised his underlying ideology was ""wrong and flawed"" and wanted to ""correct"" himself. But Mr Sharif claims that when Khan wrote to a ""credible"" specialist intervention provider for help, ""the powers that be were unable to
provide that assistance while he was in custody"". He says:âFrom my perspective, that seemed wrong, because while the
offender is in custody and is looking back at his offending behaviour and
recognising that itâs wrong, thatâs the ideal time to engage and correct his
thinking."" Rapper Dave has paid tribute to Jack Merritt - one of two people killed in the attack - describing him as ""the best guy"". Mr Merritt, a University of Cambridge graduate, was a course coordinator for a prisoners' rehabilitation programme called Learning Together. The Streatham-born rapper tweeted that the news of Mr Merritt's death was ""one of the most painful things"", saying Mr Merritt had ""dedicated his life to helping others"". He added that it was ""genuinely an honour to have met someone like you"" and he would ""never ever forget"" everything that Mr Merritt had ""done for us"". Dave won the Mercury Prize for his debut album in September, dedicating the award to his brother, Christopher Omoregie, who is serving a life sentence for murder. The rapper's album, Psychodrama, was inspired by the therapy Christopher is receiving in prison, in which offenders role-play events from their past to help with rehabilitation.

Jack Merritt, named today as having been killed in the attack, studied for a bachelor's degree in law at the
University of Manchester. Graduating in 2016, the 25-year-old went on to
study at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked in the criminology
department running Learning Together, the prison rehabilitation programme which terrorist Usman Khan had been involved with. Former programme participants, including Khan,
had been invited to take part in a conference to mark the programme's fifth
anniversary at Fishmongers' Hall. A
vigil was held in Cambridge on Saturday to mark the incident. As we mentioned earlier, Jack Merritt - who has been named as one of the victims of the attack - appeared on a BBC podcast in March talking about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. The University of Cambridge graduate was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme. He told the BBC's Law in Action: ""Our students in prison often have a very first-hand, very real but also very nuanced, idea of how the law works and also they have a very good sense of where there is a lack in information, where there is a lack in knowledge, and they really do know which areas of the law could do with clarification. ""And a lot of the time these are areas that they have seen people go through the prison system not understanding and they want to do research which will help people."" You can listen to himhere(he features at 18:05). People will see ""enhanced police patrols across London of both armed and unarmed officers"", Mr Basu says. He urges members of the public to continue with their plans as usual, and to be ""vigilant but be alert, not alarmed"". He offers his ""heartfelt thoughts
and condolences to all those families, both deceased and who still remain in
hospital, and everyone affected by this tragedy"". You can find Mr Basu's full statementhere,external. Turning to updates on the attacker, Mr Basu says police believe Khan was wearing the hoax explosive vest while attending the prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall. He said: ""We know this attacker was attending an event called Learning Together and some of those present confronted this attacker to try and stop him."" Responding to a question from a reporter, Mr Basu adds ""From start to finish this incident took very few minutes and yes, we believe he was wearing the vest at the time."" Mr Basu says he knows one of the victims has been named online and in the media -as Cambridge university graduate Jack Merritt- but that the Met is still awaiting formal identification from the coroner. This video can not be played Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response The head of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Mr Basu said the public has shared ""nearly 500 images and videos with the investigation team so far, and I am incredibly grateful"". He continued to appeal to anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall, where the attack began, on Friday to contact the police. The Met has said people can contact them in confidence on 0800 789 321. Usman Khan was subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"" on his release from prison, Mr Basu says, and ""to the best of my knowledge he was complying with those conditions"".  Earlier, University of Cambridge graduate Jack Merritt was named
as one of the victims of Friday's London Bridge attack. Mr Merrittâs father David described his son as âa beautiful
spirit who always took the side of the underdogâ. In a now-deleted Twitter post,reported by the Telegraph,,externalhe
wrote: âMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death
to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people
unnecessarily. âJack spoke so highly of all the people he worked with and he
loved his job.â Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, and earlier this year he spoke on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law.

London Bridge attack victim had 'lust for life',"Saskia Jones and Jack Merritt were stabbed to death in Friday's terror attack at London Bridge Tributes have been paid to two friends stabbed to death in Friday's terror attack at London Bridge. Jack Merritt, 25, andSaskia Jones, 23, had been at a conference celebrating the five-year anniversary of theLearning Together prison programmewhen knifeman, 28-year-oldUsman Khan, attacked them and three others. He was shot dead by police minutes after he fatally wounded the University of Cambridge graduates. ""Saskia was a funny, kind, positive influence at the centre of many people's lives,"" the family of Ms Jones said in a statement. ""She had a wonderful sense of mischievous fun and was generous to the point of always wanting to see the best in all people,"" they added. ""She was intent on living life to the full and had a wonderful thirst for knowledge, enabling her to be the best she could be. ""Saskia had a great passion for providing invaluable support to victims of criminal injustice, which led her to the point of recently applying for the police graduate recruitment programme, wishing to specialise in victim support."" London Bridge: What we know so far 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker Attack victim Saskia Jones 'was perfect soul' What is Learning Together? Ms Jones had completed a Masters degree in criminology in 2018. Prof Loraine Gelsthorpe, director of the University of Cambridge's institute of criminology, said Ms Jones had a ""determination to make an enduring and positive impact on society in everything she did"". ""Saskia's warm disposition and extraordinary intellectual creativity was combined with a strong belief that people who have committed criminal offences should have opportunities for rehabilitation,"" she added. Colleen Moore, a former tutor of Ms Jones at Anglia Ruskin University, paid tribute, telling the BBC: ""She was fearless, she was a warrior, she was going to change the world - maybe she will."" She added: ""She stood out above everyone else, partly because she wanted to. She was not afraid to say anything, there was no fooling herâ¦ she said things that she knew would be a bit risky but they were always right."" ""She was a lovely, lovely woman, she made me laugh. She called me out on things - a lot of people were scared of me, she wasn't."" Olivia Smith, a lecturer in criminology who marked Ms Jones' dissertation when she was at Anglia Ruskin, described her as ""one of a kind"" who ""would have been a force for good"". Dr Smith said: ""I'm so sorry that the world won't get to see what she could have achieved. ""Saskia's dissertation was so good that I cried with pride when I marked it."" A friend, Sebastian Lefeuvre, described the young woman's death as senseless. ""She was just the most perfect soul and she's gone,"" he said. Jack Merritt's family said he was a ""friend and colleague"" of Ms Jones. ""Our beautiful, talented boy, died doing what he loved, surrounded by people he loved and who loved him,"" a statement said. ""He lit up our lives and the lives of his many friends and colleagues, and we will miss him terribly. ""Jack lived his principles; he believed in redemption and rehabilitation, not revenge, and he always took the side of the underdog. ""Jack was an intelligent, thoughtful and empathetic person who was looking forward to building a future with his girlfriend, Leanne, and making a career helping people in the criminal justice system. ""We know Jack would not want this terrible, isolated incident to be used as a pretext by the government for introducing even more draconian sentences on prisoners, or for detaining people in prison for longer than necessary. ""Our thoughts go out to the relatives and friends of his friend and colleague who died with him in this incident, to the colleagues who were injured, and to his brilliant, supportive colleagues at the University of Cambridge Department of Criminology."" Mr Merritt had completed the same masters degree Ms Jones had, but a year earlier. He had previously gained a degree in law at the University of Manchester. One woman who called Mr Merritt her ""best mate"" described him in atribute posted on Twitter,externalas ""quite simply the best thing, completely golden"". ""I wanted so much for you. Your life had so much enjoyment in it, and you gave us all so much happiness,"" she wrote. The friend, who calls herself Holl on Twitter, said she went to the pub and ""kept expecting you to turn up, swanky coat, Dr Martens on"". ""I need you to be known for who you were, your beliefs and voice. I'm so angry Jack,"" she said. ""Your voice won't be lost, you will never be lost and I will never let you be forgotten."" She added Mr Merritt ""could have done anything"" but ""you chose to help others, you championed the underdog"". This video can not be played Listen to Jack Merritt speak on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at a prison to study law. Prof Gelsthorpe said: ""Jack's passion for social and criminal justice was infectious. He was deeply creative and courageously engaged with the world, advocating for a politics of love. He worked tirelessly in dark places to pull towards the light."" Legal commentator Joshua Rozenberg interviewed Mr Merritt for the BBC in February, when he was working with Learning Together at HMP Warren Hill in Suffolk.

What we know about the London Bridge attacker,"Police have named the London Bridge attacker as Usman Khan, who was previously part of a group that plotted to bomb the city's stock exchange. Khan, 28, was out on licence from prison whenhe killed two people and injured three others in the stabbing attack on Friday, before being shot dead by armed police. Since being released in December 2018 - his conditions requiring him to wear an electronic tag - Khan had been living in Stafford. He also took part in the government's ""Desistance and Disengagement Programme"", the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of those who have been involved in terrorism. In 2012, he was sentenced to indeterminate detention for ""public protection"" with a minimum jail term of eight years after pleading guilty to preparing terrorist acts. The sentence would have allowed him to be kept in prison beyond the minimum term, should the authorities have deemed it necessary. In a reference to Khan and two other defendants, the trial judge said: ""In my judgement, these offenders would remain, even after a lengthy term of imprisonment, of such a significant risk that the public could not be adequately protected by their being managed on licence in the community, subject to conditions, by reference to a preordained release date."" He added that the ""safety of the public in respect of these offenders can only adequately be protected if their release on licence is decided upon, at the earliest, at the conclusion of the minimum term which I fix today."" Within months of his conviction Khan had been upgraded to a ""high risk"" prisoner at HMP Whitemoor. A government source told BBC Look East that Khan became an increased security risk in 2012 ""after making threats to senior prison staff"". He was said by the source to have been a ""model prisoner"" afterwards. However, a prison source told the BBC Khan had ""played everyone"" and was involved in lots of security incidents during his imprisonment. In 2013the Court of Appeal quashed Khan's sentence, replacing it with a 16-year-fixed term of which half was to be served in prison. He was then released automatically at that point. Khan was moved to another maximum security prison, HMP Woodhill, prior to his release on license in 2018. London Bridge attacker had terror conviction London Bridge: What we know so far 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker London Bridge attacker had ties to Cardiff Born and raised in Stoke-on-Trent, Khan was originally jailed along with eight others, who were arrested in 2010. The nine, inspired by al-Qaeda, had been under surveillance by MI5. The men - who were from Stoke, Cardiff and London - were engaged in several plans, one of which involved a plot to place a pipe bomb in the London Stock Exchange. Those from Stoke were overheard discussing potential attacks in their city, including leaving explosive devices in pubs and clubs. Khan described members of the public as ""kuffar"" and ""dogs"". Usman Khan, circled, with his fellow defendants in a surveillance image released by police in 2012 At one point Khan was monitored in conversation about ""how to construct a pipe bomb"" from a recipe in an al-Qaeda magazine. The men had also been funding a proposed madrassa - a college for Islamic instruction - abroad, which was to be used for firearms training and would have been attended by Khan. The court of appeal judgement said: ""The groups were clearly considering a range of possibilities, including fundraising for the establishment of a military-training madrassa in Pakistan - where they would undertake training themselves and recruit others to do likewise - sending letter bombs through the post, attacking public houses used by British racist groups, attacking a high-profile target with an explosive device and a Mumbai-style attack."" It added that they had ""serious long-term plans"" to send Khan and other recruits for ""training and terrorist experience"". ""Should they return to the UK, they would do so trained and experienced in terrorism,"" the judgement continued. Another man from Stoke who was jailed alongside Khan - Mohibur Rahman - was laterconvicted of another terrorist plotfollowing his release from prison. Khan had spent years proselytising in Stoke on so-called ""dawah stalls"" linked to the proscribed terrorist organisation al-Muhajiroun, which was once led by the hate preacher Anjem Choudary. After Khan was jailed, theDaily Star quoted Choudary,externalsaying that the Stoke plotters ""were students of mine"" and ""I knew them for quite a while"". In 2008 Khan's address was one of five properties in Stoke raided by counter-terrorism police. None of those investigated was ultimately charged. This video can not be played Usman Khan speaking to the BBC in 2008: ""I ain't no terrorist"" Speaking at the time, Khan publicly complained about being under suspicion, saying: ""I've been born and bred in England, in Stoke-on-Trent in Cobridge."" He said ""all the community knows me"" and that ""I ain't no terrorist"". While incarcerated, Khan attended some counter terrorism programmes and first came into contact with the educational initiative Learning Together, whose event in London he later so brutally attacked. After leaving prison, Khan appeared as a ""case study"" in a report by the initiative focused on its work at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Identified only by his first name, Khan was said - since leaving prison - to have given a speech at a fundraising dinner and been provided with a ""secure"" laptop that complied with his licence conditions. Khan contributed a poem to a separate brochure in which he also expressed gratitude for the computer, stating: ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" The attacker, who was restricted in who he could meet and where he could go, was managed by a panel comprising public bodies - including the police and probation service - under the system of multi-agency public protection arrangements. The day of the attack was the first time Khan had been allowed to visit London since he left prison. The panel that permitted his attendance - in order to attend the Learning Together event - also decided he could travel there unescorted. But when Khan had attended an event elsewhere in the country in May he had been escorted, and - later in the year - Khan was refused permission to travel to Stoke to attend a social event. He was formally under investigation by MI5 at the time of the attack, classed as one of its 3,000 subjects of interest. He was not placed in the top tiers of those under scrutiny.

Hamilton star says bar 'refused black actors entry',"Giles played Aaron Burr in Hamilton for which he won the 2018 Olivier award for best actor in a musical Hamilton star Giles Terera claims a bar refused entry to a group of actors because they were black. He accuses Aint Nothin But... blues bar in central London of ""racial profiling"" and says a group of white customers were allowed in past them. The bar has denied the claims and say some of the actors didn't have ID ""so could not be served"". ""We have regular customers, and staff, who are black. It makes no difference to us what colour people are,"" it says. In a post on Twitter, Giles told his followers he's directing the group of actors in a play about American blues musicians and took them to the bar on Friday. ""We were racially profiled and refused entry as 10 white punters were allowed in past us unchecked,"" he wrote on Twitter. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Breaking|Breaking newsMalta businessman charged over journalist murderYorgen Fenech is charged with complicity in the 2017 murder of journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia.Europe,"Yorgen Fenech has been repeatedly questioned Maltese businessman Yorgen Fenech has been charged with complicity in the murder of investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia in 2017. He pleaded not guilty to that charge and four others others including membership of a criminal gang. Relatives of the assassinated blogger were present in the court in Valletta. The investigation into Caruana Galizia's death has rocked the island's government. Prime Minister Joseph Muscat is under pressure to resign. His chief aide, Keith Schembri,quit this week amid reports he was being questioned by police, while Tourism Minister Konrad Mizzi also resigned and Economy Minister Chris Cardona took the decision to suspend himself. The murder that could bring down Malta's government Malta leaders barred from blogger funeral Caruana Galizia: Malta's anti-corruption warrior Three people are awaiting trial for Caruana Galizia's murder in a car bombing but the police investigation is now focusing on who ordered the killing and why. He has been repeatedly questioned over the killing since trying to leave the island on his yacht on 20 November, and sought a pardon in return for providing information but his request was rejected. Maltese media allege he was familiar with Melvin Theuma, a taxi driver with links to criminal enterprises who has been described in local media as a potential ""middleman"" in the murder. Caruana Galizia reported on allegations relating to the Panama Papers before her death Mr Fenech is a well-known figure in Malta who has served as head of the Tumas business group and a director of energy company Electrogas but recently resigned from both positions. He was identified last year as being the owner of a mysterious Dubai-registered company, 17 Black. The company was listed in the Panama Papers - confidential documents leaked from a Panamanian law firm in 2016 which revealed how the wealthy and powerful use tax havens to get around the law. Caruana Galizia had written about 17 Black eight months before her death, alleging it had links to both Keith Schembri and Konrad Mizzi. By Damian Grammaticas, BBC Europe correspondent, Valletta Such has been the sensitivity of this case that Malta's main courthouse was opened specially, late in the evening for this hearing. Yorgen Fenech, one of Malta's richest men, was brought in under police guard. The family of the murdered journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia, her parents, her sister, her husband and three sons were all in court. They heard Mr Fenech deny charges of complicity in Ms Caruana Galizia's murder, of membership of a criminal gang, and conspiracy in planting the car bomb that killed her. Outside court Ms Caruana Galizia's family said it was now time for Mr Muscat to resign as the allegations of shady dealing stretch to those around him. So far, though, Mr Muscat has refused to go. Investigations into Caruana Galizia's murder intensified when Mr Theuma was pardoned on Monday. The prime minister told parliament he was being given immunity in return for information about the killing. Maltese reports suggested he had audio recordings linked to the case. This video can not be played Galizia's son, Paul, in 2018 called for a public inquiry over his mother's death On Tuesday, Konrad Mizzi resigned and Chris Cardona took the decision to suspend himself after being questioned by police. They deny involvement. Mr Schembri, who had previously been named in the Panama Papers, quit. Caruana Galizia alleged that Mr Schembri and Mr Mizzi had benefited from secretive ""shell companies"". Both deny wrongdoing. Three men - brothers Alfred and George Degiorgio and their friend Vincent Muscat, all in their 50s - have been charged with triggering the bomb which killed Caruana Galizia near her home in October 2017. They were arrested in December 2017 and pleaded not guilty in pre-trial proceedings. Caruana Galizia (pictured in 1989) was survived by her husband and children Vincent Muscat later told police the bomb had been placed in Caruana Galizia's car while it was parked outside the walled compound where she lived.

"Clutha pilot 'trusted implicitly' by his crewAn inquiry into the helicopter crash was ""very disappointing"", say the families of two PCs killed in the tragedy.Glasgow & West Scotland","PC Kirsty Nelis, Capt David Traill and PC Tony Collins were killed in the Clutha helicopter crash Two police officers killed in the Clutha helicopter crash ""trusted implicitly"" the pilot blamed for their deaths, according to their families. PCs Tony Collins and Kirsty Nelis were on the aircraft when it crashed into the Glasgow pub on 29 November 2013. A sheriff ruled that the crash happened becausepilot David Traill ""took a chance"" and ignored fuel warnings. Mark Nelis, the widower of PC Nelis, said the ruling had not changed his opinion of Captain Traill. He said the sheriff's findings were ""very disappointing"" and he called for a fresh independent report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). The tragedy claimed the lives of Captain Traill, 51, PC Collins, 43, PC Nelis, 36, and seven customers who were in the Clutha Vaults pub. Clutha crash pilot's reputation 'sullied' by inquiry Clutha crash inquiry: The key questions Clutha: What we know about the final flight Following a fatal accident inquiry earlier this year, Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull found that Capt Traill ignored five fuel warnings he received during the flight. He said it was a ""conscious decision"" that had ""fatal consequences"" for the 10 people who died. However, in a statement following the sixth anniversary of the crash, Mr Nelis and PC Collin's widow, Lucy, paid tribute to Capt Trail. Ms Collins said her husband, a police observer, trusted the pilot and regarded him as a ""diligent and skilled professional"". The conclusion of the FAI ""has not changed mine or my family's confidence and faith in him"", Mr Nelis added. Ten people were killed in the tragedy on 29 November 2013 He said he found the conclusion of the sheriff ""surprising"" afterevidence was heard about problem fuel readings on the helicopter prior to the crash. Mr Nelis went on to say that the AAIB should provide a ""fresh independent report"" and release all forms of their report as it developed. ""The first draft report issued by the AAIB was sent to interested parties, including the helicopter owners and manufacturers, prior to its publication,"" he said. ""The report was finally released over four months late and had been amended on a number of key points. We have not been made aware of why it was changed or what contributions were made to it. ""We, as a family, have been left with a sense of frustration by the outcome of this inquiry, in particular with the AAIB report and with the Sheriff Principal's determination and criticism of the pilot."" The AAIB said it stood by itsfinal report,external. Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44, all Clutha customers, also died when the helicopter hit the pub. Another 31 people were injured. (Top: L to R) David Traill, PC Kirsty Nelis, PC Tony Collins, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee (Bottom: L to R) Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, John McGarrigle, Joe Cusker Ms Collins said she did not want to take part in the FAI as she would have found it ""extremely distressing"" but she wanted to highlight her husband's trust in his pilot. ""He trusted Dave implicitly as the hugely experienced and skilled pilot he was,"" she said. ""I feel this important information that Tony would have wanted me to share."" Earlier this month Capt Trail's fiancee, Dr Lucy Thomas, describedthe sheriff's findings as ""distressing and incomprehensible"". She said the manufacturer's maintenance manual incorrectly said there was a three to four-minute flameout time before the helicopter would lose both engines, but in reality he only had 32 seconds to make decisions and respond to the issue. ""That 32 seconds ended in tragedy and the loss of his and nine other valuable lives,"" she added. Dr Thomas said the determination did ""no justice to the memories"" of the nine other people killed in the crash or to the ""memory and reputation of Dave Traill"". ""It insults the intelligence of those who know of the evidence presented at the inquiry and are aware of the content of the initial AAIB report,"" she said. This video can not be played New footage from the Crown Office shows the aftermath of the helicopter crash They are not the first families to raise concerns about the findings of the FAI. Speaking shortly after the FAI determination was published, Ian O'Prey, who lost his son Mark in the tragedy, said he was ""really angry"" and that Capt Trail had been made a ""fall guy"". The Clutha's owner, Alan Crossan, also expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the report and how ""brutal"" it had been towards Capt Traill. Inhis findings,external, Mr Turnbull said there was ""no doubt"" that the crash had happened because the helicopter's engines ""flamed out"" due to a lack of fuel. The fuel supply tanks had been depleted because Capt Traill had failed to ensure that at least one of the aircraft's fuel transfer pump switches was on. ""The central question for the inquiry is why did that happen?"" Sheriff Turnbull said. ""The answer is a simple one. Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received."" A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office for Scotland said the court paid ""careful regard"" to all the material placed before the Fatal Accident Inquiry and that itsfindings were available to read in full,externalon the Scottish Courts website.

Rail fares to rise by 2.7% in January,"Millions of commuters will have to pay an average of 2.7% more for rail tickets from 2 January. The rise, announced by industry body the Rail Delivery Group, is lower than the 3.1% increase at the start of 2019. Train companies say this is the third year in a row that average fares have been held below the benchmark inflation measure on which rises are based. But many commuters will still face an increase of more than Â£100 in the annual cost of getting to work. Independent watchdog Transport Focus said a majority of rail users did not feel they were getting value for money. The news comes as commuters on South Western Railway services are steeling themselves fora 27-day rail strike next month. Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union members will walk out in a long-running dispute over guards on trains. About 40% of annual rail price rises in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated, which means that they are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for the previous July. This year, that figure was 2.8%. But RPI inflation is generally higher than the most widely watched measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index. And passenger groups have repeatedly called for the system to be changed, since RPI inflation was abandoned by the National Audit Office as a national statistic in 2013. Train company apologises for rise in delay claims More violent crime reported on British railways Rail Delivery Group chief executive Paul Plummer said the extra money was allowing the train companies to invest in improvements to the network, including 1,000 extra services a week in 2020. He added: ""The industry will continue to push for changes to fare regulations to enable a better range of affordable, mix-and-match fares and reduced overcrowding on some of the busiest routes."" Mr Plummer said that 98p in every pound from fares went towards the cost of running the railway. A spokesperson for Transport Focus said: ""We speak to thousands of passengers each year and we know that less than half feel they get value for money. ""After a year of patchy performance, passengers just want a consistent day-to-day service they can rely on and a better chance of getting a seat."" Transport Focus called on passengers to ""make their voice heard"" and claim compensation every time they suffered a delay or cancellation. Payouts vary depending on the type of ticket, the length of delay and the operator. Some firms begin paying compensation if a train is delayed by 15 minutes. Passengers normally need to claim the compensation as payouts are not automatic with most operators.

Hague knife attack victims were aged 13-15,"This video can not be played Forensics experts check the scene at Grote Marktstraat. The three victims of a stabbing attack on a shopping street in the Dutch city of The Hague on Friday were two girls aged 15 and a boy of 13. None of the victims knew each other and police are still hunting a male suspect, with no clue as yet to motive. The victims have now been released from hospital. Images and videos on social media showed dozens of Black Friday shoppers running away from the scene after the attacker struck at 19:45 (18:45 GMT). The victims have not been named but were described as a 13-year-old boy from The Hague, a 15-year-old girl from Alphen aan den Rijn and another 15-year-old girl from Leiderdorp. The incident happened at the Hudson's Bay store in the city's Grote Marktstraat, or main market square. Police have urged the public to contact them if they witnessed the attack. Officials have also asked anyone with images or footage of the attack to send it to the police. An initial description of the suspect suggested police were looking for a man aged between 45 to 50 wearing a grey tracksuit. In a later update, Hague police said that description was wrong but have given few further details about the incident. They said in a statement: ""We are using all the means at our disposal - both visible and invisible - to find the suspect of this incident as quickly as possible. ""The motive of the suspect is as yet unclear.""

Parties row over early release of bridge attacker,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel visited the scene at London Bridge A row has erupted between the home secretary and a former government minister over the early release of the London Bridge attacker, Usman Khan. Khan, who was released from prison on licence in December 2018, was shot dead by police during Friday's attack. Labour's Yvette Cooper said the government were ""warned about the risks"" of ending Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). But Priti Patel blamed legislation brought in by Labour in 2008. The IPP regime, which was brought in bythe then Home Secretary David Blunkettto protect the public from dangerous prisoners, was scrapped by the coalition government in 2012. In a series of tweets,external, Ms Cooper, shadow home secretary from 2011-2015, said the government was ""warned"" about the risks of ending IPPs citing a ""lack of resources for probation, monitoring and rehabilitation"". The home secretary responded to Ms Cooper on Twitter, saying the law was changed ""to end Labour's automatic release policy"". Ms Patel added that Khan was convicted before the Labour legislation was changed by the Tories in 2012. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The row comes after Ms Patel joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson at London Bridge where two people were killed by Khan on Friday. Khan, 28, was convicted of a terrorism offence in 2012. He was released from prison in December last year, after agreeing to wear an electronic tag. Visiting the site of Friday's stabbings, the PM vowed to ""toughen up sentences"". Mr Johnson said: ""I've said for a long time now, that I think the practice of automatic, early release where we cut a sentence in half and let really serious and violent offenders out early, simply isn't working. ""And I think you've had some very good evidence of how that isn't working, I'm afraid, with this case,"" he added. Two people were killed in the attack and another three were taken to hospital for stab injuries Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there were questions to be answered. ""I think there is also a question about what the Probation Office were doing - were they involved at all? ""Whether the Parole Board should have been involved in deciding whether or not he should have been allowed to be released from prison in the first place, and also what happened in prison?""

Automatic early jail release 'not working' - PM,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel visited the scene at London Bridge A row has erupted between the home secretary and a former government minister over the early release of the London Bridge attacker, Usman Khan. Khan, who was released from prison on licence in December 2018, was shot dead by police during Friday's attack. Labour's Yvette Cooper said the government were ""warned about the risks"" of ending Imprisonment for Public Protection (IPP). But Priti Patel blamed legislation brought in by Labour in 2008. The IPP regime, which was brought in bythe then Home Secretary David Blunkettto protect the public from dangerous prisoners, was scrapped by the coalition government in 2012. In a series of tweets,external, Ms Cooper, shadow home secretary from 2011-2015, said the government was ""warned"" about the risks of ending IPPs citing a ""lack of resources for probation, monitoring and rehabilitation"". The home secretary responded to Ms Cooper on Twitter, saying the law was changed ""to end Labour's automatic release policy"". Ms Patel added that Khan was convicted before the Labour legislation was changed by the Tories in 2012. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The row comes after Ms Patel joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson at London Bridge where two people were killed by Khan on Friday. Khan, 28, was convicted of a terrorism offence in 2012. He was released from prison in December last year, after agreeing to wear an electronic tag. Visiting the site of Friday's stabbings, the PM vowed to ""toughen up sentences"". Mr Johnson said: ""I've said for a long time now, that I think the practice of automatic, early release where we cut a sentence in half and let really serious and violent offenders out early, simply isn't working. ""And I think you've had some very good evidence of how that isn't working, I'm afraid, with this case,"" he added. Two people were killed in the attack and another three were taken to hospital for stab injuries Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there were questions to be answered. ""I think there is also a question about what the Probation Office were doing - were they involved at all? ""Whether the Parole Board should have been involved in deciding whether or not he should have been allowed to be released from prison in the first place, and also what happened in prison?"" The Parole Board said it had no involvement in the 28-year-old's release, saying Khan ""appears to have been released automatically on licence (as required by law)"".

PM to appear on Marr amid BBC interview row,"Boris Johnson has so far refused to commit to an interview with Andrew Neil, who interviewed him during the Tory leadership election Boris Johnson will be interviewed on Sunday's Andrew Marr Show as it is ""in the public interest"" following the London Bridge attack, the BBC says. It had been reported,externalthat the BBC would not allow the PM to appear on Sunday's programme unless he also agreed to be interviewed by Andrew Neil. Mr Johnson has so far refused to commit to a one-to-one with Mr Neil - who has already grilled other party leaders. Labour called the BBC's move to allow the PM on the Marr show ""shameful"". The BBC said in a statement that as the national public service broadcaster its first priority ""must be its audience"". ""In the wake of a major terrorist incident, we believe it is now in the public interest that the prime minister should be interviewed on our flagship Sunday political programme. ""All parties' election policy proposals must - and will - face detailed scrutiny from us and we continue to urge Boris Johnson to take part in the prime-time Andrew Neil interview as other leaders have done."" PM refuses to confirm Andrew Neil interview Row over Johnson debate 'empty chair' Labour leader Jeremy CorbynandSNP leader Nicola Sturgeontook part in 30-minute interviews with Mr Neil earlier this week. The BBC's interview with Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson is set to air on 4 December. Another, with Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, will be shown on 5 December.

On Friday, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Mr Johnson was ""running scared"" from being grilled by Mr Neil, adding that it was a ""matter of honour"" that he subjected himself to the fullest possible questioning.

"'Turn off your engine, get out and run'","Witnesses described armed police arriving at the scene and shooting a man ""A police officer came up to me and said 'turn off your engine, get out and run'."" Mustafa Salih was behind the wheel of a bus heading towards London Bridge when he was ordered to join the crowds fleeing a sudden violent attack at one of the city's most well-known locations. That was the moment he realised the bridge had been targeted for the second time in three years. Mr Salih joined scores running from the scene wheretwo people had been stabbed to death and the suspected attacker shot dead by police. Just before 14:00 GMT bars and restaurants on the south side of the bridge had been filling up with tourists and office workers. In an instant that all changed - and London Bridge was in lockdown yet again. Mr Salih, 62, was travelling from Borough High Street when he saw a stream of people, including some in tears, running towards him. ""A police officer came up to me and said 'turn off your engine, get out and run',"" he said. ""I looked up and I could see a crowd of people coming towards me. One woman was crying. It was all very scary as we did not know what was happening."" This video can not be played Video shows the moment before a man was apparently shot by police on London Bridge Nurse Jackie Bensfield, 32, described how she asked to be let off a bus on the bridge after she heard gunshots. Ms Bensfield, who was on her way home from work, said she got off the bus and ""ran like hell"" to escape the shots. Another witness, Connor Allen, who was in his van on the bridge at the time, said: ""Everyone just started running, you heard these pops and that was it. ""We just got out [of] the van and started running."" London Bridge: What we know so far 'Heroes' praised for confronting attacker Follow the latest updates Shop worker Juan Rios, 35, realised something was wrong when he ""heard people running and screaming"" and a noise that sounded ""like popcorn"". ""Then I heard this distant sound coming from the market direction,"" he said. ""There was one American couple who were separated from their daughter, they were obviously really scared. Afterwards the police came and told us to evacuate."" Juan Rios described hearing a sound like ""popcorn"" coming from the direction of Borough Market The bridge remains cordoned off, while nearby Borough Market has also been blocked off by officers and no-one is being allowed through towards the crime scene. Businesses have been evacuated of shoppers but there is a constant flow of police officers heading into - and out of - the cordon. London Bridge station was closed and restaurants and bars which had been filling up earlier - and would normally be a hive of activity on a Friday night - were empty. Workers are being allowed to leave down Borough High Street, but no-one is being allowed through towards the scene of the incident. Residents have been told to find elsewhere to stay as the police cordon remains in place around the London Bridge area. Meanwhile, the November night sky is lit up by blue flashing lights, and a helicopter continues to hover overhead. Shop worker David Lockwood was among those caught up in the incident. ""Most people were very calm, we have practised this after the last attack here two Junes ago,"" he said. ""It's a shame we have to practise this kind of stuff, but I'm glad we do when things like this happen."" London Bridge attack: Witness describes scene.

LiveUpdates as London Bridge attack victim named,"One of the victims of Friday's attack is named as Jack Merritt, a Cambridge graduate The condition of one of the victims in hospital has improved from critical to stable A woman was also killed. Two further injured people remain in hospital Usman Khan, 28, who carried out the attack, was a former prisoner convicted of terrorism offences He was out on licence and wearing a tag. He was shot dead by police after people restrained him Visiting the scene with London's mayor and the head of the Met Police, the PM says automatic early release from jail is not working Police have been searching properties in Staffordshire Friday's attack began during a conference at Fishmongers' Hall, near Monument, at 13:58 GMT Mary O'Connor, Claire Heald, Harriet Agerholm, Katie Wright and Thomas Mackintosh The London Bridge area has remained cordoned off throughout the day as forensic officers continue to carry out checks following Friday's events. Here is what has happened this afternoon and this evening:  We're going to bring our coverage of live events to an end now but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt has been described by his father as ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog."" A law and criminology graduate, Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for the University of Cambridge's prison rehabilitation programme. The project, Learning Together, gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together, to help reduce re-offending - something Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment to"", according to people who worked with him. A vigil was held in Cambridge, where Mr Merritt was from, on Saturday. His friends, family and those who worked with him have been paying tribute. You can read more about the tributes made to Mr Merritt here. Usman Khan is quoted further in one of Learning Together's newsletters in which he says the group ""has a special place in his heart"". He added: ""It is more than just an organisation, helping to provide learning of individual academic subjects. ""For me itâs main benefit is bringing people together, through the means of learning. Learning Together is about opening minds, unlocking doors, and giving voice to those who are shut down, hidden from the rest of us. ""It helps to include those who are generally excluded. This is what Learning Together means to me. ""I typed these reflections on the Chromebook I received and I am truly grateful to be able to express myself through it. ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" Usman Khan, the London Bridge
attacker, appeared as a âcase studyâ in a report by the education initiative
whose event he later attacked. The recently published report
focused on the work done by Learning Together providing education and help for
prisoners at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Khan was imprisoned there
before his release on license in December last year. Identified only as ""Usman"",
Khan was said â since leaving prison â to have given a speech at a fundraising
dinner, applied for a course, and been given a âsecureâ laptop that complied
with his licence conditions. The computer was said to have
been provided in conjunction with police and probation, allowing Khan to
continue the writing and studying he began while in jail. Khan contributed a poem to a
separate brochure, in which he expressed gratitude for the laptop, stating: âI
cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those
who continue to support this wonderful community.â BBC News Channel A leading criminal barrister has claimed the probation service ""has been destroyed"" in recent years. Mark Fenhalls QC, the former chair of the Criminal Bar Association, has said that those in the criminal justice system ""are unimpressed"" with politicians who talk about the rights and wrongs over the last few years. He told the BBC News Channel: ""The problem is what happens afterwards, in the prisons when they are not rehabilitated and when they are released if there is not a system in place to properly look after them and protect the rest of us."" Mr Fenhalls said the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan ""appears to have been released according to law and obeying his licencing conditions"". He added: ""Over the last ten or 15 years parliament continuously changes laws and ramps up sentences in every regard, but what it does not do is put money into the system to make sure that people who have have committed offences are rehabilitated."" BBC News Channel Labour's Yvette Cooper says there will need to be a ""serious and full"" investigation into how the incident at London Bridge happened, given that the attacker, Usman Khan, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, who was shot dead by police during Friday's attack, was released from prison on licence in December 2018. The former minister tells the BBC: ""I think there are also some immediate questions that will need to be asked, particularly because we know there may be other people in the same situation as this attacker and it's really important that the government is taking every action to keep people safe."" A key question, she adds, is about what the level of risk assessment and safety assessment is for anyone coming to the end of their sentence. Earlier, Ms Cooper clashed with Home Secretary Priti Patel over Usman Khan's prison release. You can read about thathere. People have been paying tribute to Jack Merritt, the University of Cambridge graduate who was named as one of the victims of the attack. Mr Merritt, who ran a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, had been helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. Audrey Ludwig, who knew Mr Merritt through work,tweeted,externalthat his ""deep commitment to prisoner education and rehabilitation was deeply impressive"". ""I send condolences to his family, colleagues and the prisoners' group."" Another friend said Mr Merritt was ""incredibly witty and intelligent, with more lust for life than many our age and a determination to make his mark in the world"". Allow Twitter content?

Usman Khan asked for specialist help to be deradicalised whilst in prison, but did not receive it, his solicitor has said. Vajahat Sharif, head of terrorism, national security and political crimes at Tuckers solicitors, told the BBC, Khan had recognised his underlying ideology was ""wrong and flawed"" and wanted to ""correct"" himself. But Mr Sharif claims that when Khan wrote to a ""credible"" specialist intervention provider for help, ""the powers that be were unable to
provide that assistance while he was in custody"". He says:âFrom my perspective, that seemed wrong, because while the
offender is in custody and is looking back at his offending behaviour and
recognising that itâs wrong, thatâs the ideal time to engage and correct his
thinking."" Rapper Dave has paid tribute to Jack Merritt - one of two people killed in the attack - describing him as ""the best guy"". Mr Merritt, a University of Cambridge graduate, was a course coordinator for a prisoners' rehabilitation programme called Learning Together. The Streatham-born rapper tweeted that the news of Mr Merritt's death was ""one of the most painful things"", saying Mr Merritt had ""dedicated his life to helping others"". He added that it was ""genuinely an honour to have met someone like you"" and he would ""never ever forget"" everything that Mr Merritt had ""done for us"". Dave won the Mercury Prize for his debut album in September, dedicating the award to his brother, Christopher Omoregie, who is serving a life sentence for murder. The rapper's album, Psychodrama, was inspired by the therapy Christopher is receiving in prison, in which offenders role-play events from their past to help with rehabilitation.

Jack Merritt, named today as having been killed in the attack, studied for a bachelor's degree in law at the
University of Manchester. Graduating in 2016, the 25-year-old went on to
study at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked in the criminology
department running Learning Together, the prison rehabilitation programme which terrorist Usman Khan had been involved with. Former programme participants, including Khan,
had been invited to take part in a conference to mark the programme's fifth
anniversary at Fishmongers' Hall. A
vigil was held in Cambridge on Saturday to mark the incident. As we mentioned earlier, Jack Merritt - who has been named as one of the victims of the attack - appeared on a BBC podcast in March talking about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. The University of Cambridge graduate was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme. He told the BBC's Law in Action: ""Our students in prison often have a very first-hand, very real but also very nuanced, idea of how the law works and also they have a very good sense of where there is a lack in information, where there is a lack in knowledge, and they really do know which areas of the law could do with clarification. ""And a lot of the time these are areas that they have seen people go through the prison system not understanding and they want to do research which will help people."" You can listen to himhere(he features at 18:05). People will see ""enhanced police patrols across London of both armed and unarmed officers"", Mr Basu says. He urges members of the public to continue with their plans as usual, and to be ""vigilant but be alert, not alarmed"". He offers his ""heartfelt thoughts
and condolences to all those families, both deceased and who still remain in
hospital, and everyone affected by this tragedy"". You can find Mr Basu's full statementhere,external. Turning to updates on the attacker, Mr Basu says police believe Khan was wearing the hoax explosive vest while attending the prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall. He said: ""We know this attacker was attending an event called Learning Together and some of those present confronted this attacker to try and stop him."" Responding to a question from a reporter, Mr Basu adds ""From start to finish this incident took very few minutes and yes, we believe he was wearing the vest at the time."" Mr Basu says he knows one of the victims has been named online and in the media -as Cambridge university graduate Jack Merritt- but that the Met is still awaiting formal identification from the coroner. This video can not be played Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response The head of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Mr Basu said the public has shared ""nearly 500 images and videos with the investigation team so far, and I am incredibly grateful"". He continued to appeal to anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall, where the attack began, on Friday to contact the police. The Met has said people can contact them in confidence on 0800 789 321. Usman Khan was subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"" on his release from prison, Mr Basu says, and ""to the best of my knowledge he was complying with those conditions"".  Earlier, University of Cambridge graduate Jack Merritt was named
as one of the victims of Friday's London Bridge attack. Mr Merrittâs father David described his son as âa beautiful
spirit who always took the side of the underdogâ. In a now-deleted Twitter post,reported by the Telegraph,,externalhe
wrote: âMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death
to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people
unnecessarily. âJack spoke so highly of all the people he worked with and he
loved his job.â Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, and earlier this year he spoke on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law.

Automatic early release 'not working' - PM,"Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel visited the scene at London Bridge A row has erupted between the home secretary and a former government minister over the early release of the London Bridge attacker, Usman Khan.

In a series of tweets,external, Ms Cooper, shadow home secretary from 2011-2015, said the government was ""warned"" about the risks of ending IPPs citing a ""lack of resources for probation, monitoring and rehabilitation"". The home secretary responded to Ms Cooper on Twitter, saying the law was changed ""to end Labour's automatic release policy"".

The row comes after Ms Patel joined Prime Minister Boris Johnson at London Bridge where two people were killed by Khan on Friday. Khan, 28, was convicted of a terrorism offence in 2012. He was released from prison in December last year, after agreeing to wear an electronic tag. Visiting the site of Friday's stabbings, the PM vowed to ""toughen up sentences"". Mr Johnson said: ""I've said for a long time now, that I think the practice of automatic, early release where we cut a sentence in half and let really serious and violent offenders out early, simply isn't working. ""And I think you've had some very good evidence of how that isn't working, I'm afraid, with this case,"" he added. Two people were killed in the attack and another three were taken to hospital for stab injuries Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said there were questions to be answered. ""I think there is also a question about what the Probation Office were doing - were they involved at all? ""Whether the Parole Board should have been involved in deciding whether or not he should have been allowed to be released from prison in the first place, and also what happened in prison?"" The Parole Board said it had no involvement in the 28-year-old's release, saying Khan ""appears to have been released automatically on licence (as required by law)"". Ms Patel backed up the Parole Board's comments, with a tweet claiming they ""could not be involved"" in the decision to release Khan because of Labour's change to the law in 2008.

In 2012,Khan was sentenced to indeterminate detention for ""public protection"" with a minimum jail term of eight yearsafter being convicted for his part in a plot to bomb the London Stock Exchange. This sentence would have allowed him to be kept in prison beyond the minimum term. 'Heroes' praised for confronting bridge attacker What we know about the London Bridge attacker But in 2013, the Court of Appeal quashed the sentence, replacing it with a 16-year-fixed term of which Khan should serve half in prison. He was released on licence in December 2018. Khan was living in Stafford and wearing a GPS police tag when he launched his attack on Friday, in which a man and a woman were killed and three others were injured. A house in Stafford linked to Usman Khan has been searched by officers As part of his release conditions, Khan was obliged to take part in the government's desistance and disengagement programme - the purpose of which is the rehabilitation of people who have been involved in terrorism. Friday's attack started inside Fishmongers' Hall where the 28-year-old was attending a rehabilitation event for convicted prisoners run by the University of Cambridge. Former chief crown prosecutor Nazir Afzal said he repeatedly warned Mr Johnson of the risk posed by convicted terrorists being released from prison while still radicalised. Mr Afzal said: ""He asked me what keeps me awake at night and I told him it was this issue. ""When he wanted to know what to do about it, I told him it was more resources for one-to-one de-radicalisation. ""Back then, he hadn't found the 'money tree' so he frustratingly said there was no money."" The Prime Minister said: ""A great deal of working is being done to make sure the public is protected.""

Clutha pilot 'trusted implicitly' by his crew,"PC Kirsty Nelis, Capt David Traill and PC Tony Collins were killed in the Clutha helicopter crash Two police officers killed in the Clutha helicopter crash ""trusted implicitly"" the pilot blamed for their deaths, according to their families. PCs Tony Collins and Kirsty Nelis were on the aircraft when it crashed into the Glasgow pub on 29 November 2013. A sheriff ruled that the crash happened becausepilot David Traill ""took a chance"" and ignored fuel warnings. Mark Nelis, the widower of PC Nelis, said the ruling had not changed his opinion of Captain Traill. He said the sheriff's findings were ""very disappointing"" and he called for a fresh independent report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). The tragedy claimed the lives of Captain Traill, 51, PC Collins, 43, PC Nelis, 36, and seven customers who were in the Clutha Vaults pub. Clutha crash pilot's reputation 'sullied' by inquiry Clutha crash inquiry: The key questions Clutha: What we know about the final flight Following a fatal accident inquiry earlier this year, Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull found that Capt Traill ignored five fuel warnings he received during the flight. He said it was a ""conscious decision"" that had ""fatal consequences"" for the 10 people who died. However, in a statement following the sixth anniversary of the crash, Mr Nelis and PC Collin's widow, Lucy, paid tribute to Capt Trail. Ms Collins said her husband, a police observer, trusted the pilot and regarded him as a ""diligent and skilled professional"". The conclusion of the FAI ""has not changed mine or my family's confidence and faith in him"", Mr Nelis added. Ten people were killed in the tragedy on 29 November 2013 He said he found the conclusion of the sheriff ""surprising"" afterevidence was heard about problem fuel readings on the helicopter prior to the crash. Mr Nelis went on to say that the AAIB should provide a ""fresh independent report"" and release all forms of their report as it developed. ""The first draft report issued by the AAIB was sent to interested parties, including the helicopter owners and manufacturers, prior to its publication,"" he said. ""The report was finally released over four months late and had been amended on a number of key points. We have not been made aware of why it was changed or what contributions were made to it. ""We, as a family, have been left with a sense of frustration by the outcome of this inquiry, in particular with the AAIB report and with the Sheriff Principal's determination and criticism of the pilot."" The AAIB said it stood by itsfinal report,external. Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44, all Clutha customers, also died when the helicopter hit the pub. Another 31 people were injured. (Top: L to R) David Traill, PC Kirsty Nelis, PC Tony Collins, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee (Bottom: L to R) Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, John McGarrigle, Joe Cusker Ms Collins said she did not want to take part in the FAI as she would have found it ""extremely distressing"" but she wanted to highlight her husband's trust in his pilot. ""He trusted Dave implicitly as the hugely experienced and skilled pilot he was,"" she said. ""I feel this important information that Tony would have wanted me to share."" Earlier this month Capt Trail's fiancee, Dr Lucy Thomas, describedthe sheriff's findings as ""distressing and incomprehensible"". She said the manufacturer's maintenance manual incorrectly said there was a three to four-minute flameout time before the helicopter would lose both engines, but in reality he only had 32 seconds to make decisions and respond to the issue. ""That 32 seconds ended in tragedy and the loss of his and nine other valuable lives,"" she added. Dr Thomas said the determination did ""no justice to the memories"" of the nine other people killed in the crash or to the ""memory and reputation of Dave Traill"". ""It insults the intelligence of those who know of the evidence presented at the inquiry and are aware of the content of the initial AAIB report,"" she said. This video can not be played New footage from the Crown Office shows the aftermath of the helicopter crash They are not the first families to raise concerns about the findings of the FAI. Speaking shortly after the FAI determination was published, Ian O'Prey, who lost his son Mark in the tragedy, said he was ""really angry"" and that Capt Trail had been made a ""fall guy"". The Clutha's owner, Alan Crossan, also expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the report and how ""brutal"" it had been towards Capt Traill. Inhis findings,external, Mr Turnbull said there was ""no doubt"" that the crash had happened because the helicopter's engines ""flamed out"" due to a lack of fuel. The fuel supply tanks had been depleted because Capt Traill had failed to ensure that at least one of the aircraft's fuel transfer pump switches was on. ""The central question for the inquiry is why did that happen?"" Sheriff Turnbull said. ""The answer is a simple one. Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received."" A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office for Scotland said the court paid ""careful regard"" to all the material placed before the Fatal Accident Inquiry and that itsfindings were available to read in full,externalon the Scottish Courts website.

LiveInvestigations continue after London Bridge attack,"One of the victims of Friday's attack is named as Jack Merritt, a Cambridge graduate The condition of one of the victims in hospital has improved from critical to stable A woman was also killed. Two further injured people remain in hospital Usman Khan, 28, who carried out the attack, was a former prisoner convicted of terrorism offences He was out on licence and wearing a tag. He was shot dead by police after people restrained him Visiting the scene with London's mayor and the head of the Met Police, the PM says automatic early release from jail is not working Police have been searching properties in Staffordshire Friday's attack began during a conference at Fishmongers' Hall, near Monument, at 13:58 GMT Mary O'Connor, Claire Heald, Harriet Agerholm, Katie Wright and Thomas Mackintosh The London Bridge area has remained cordoned off throughout the day as forensic officers continue to carry out checks following Friday's events. Here is what has happened this afternoon and this evening:  We're going to bring our coverage of live events to an end now but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt has been described by his father as ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog."" A law and criminology graduate, Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for the University of Cambridge's prison rehabilitation programme. The project, Learning Together, gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together, to help reduce re-offending - something Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment to"", according to people who worked with him. A vigil was held in Cambridge, where Mr Merritt was from, on Saturday. His friends, family and those who worked with him have been paying tribute. You can read more about the tributes made to Mr Merritt here. Usman Khan is quoted further in one of Learning Together's newsletters in which he says the group ""has a special place in his heart"". He added: ""It is more than just an organisation, helping to provide learning of individual academic subjects. ""For me itâs main benefit is bringing people together, through the means of learning. Learning Together is about opening minds, unlocking doors, and giving voice to those who are shut down, hidden from the rest of us. ""It helps to include those who are generally excluded. This is what Learning Together means to me. ""I typed these reflections on the Chromebook I received and I am truly grateful to be able to express myself through it. ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" Usman Khan, the London Bridge
attacker, appeared as a âcase studyâ in a report by the education initiative
whose event he later attacked. The recently published report
focused on the work done by Learning Together providing education and help for
prisoners at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Khan was imprisoned there
before his release on license in December last year. Identified only as ""Usman"",
Khan was said â since leaving prison â to have given a speech at a fundraising
dinner, applied for a course, and been given a âsecureâ laptop that complied
with his licence conditions. The computer was said to have
been provided in conjunction with police and probation, allowing Khan to
continue the writing and studying he began while in jail. Khan contributed a poem to a
separate brochure, in which he expressed gratitude for the laptop, stating: âI
cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those
who continue to support this wonderful community.â BBC News Channel A leading criminal barrister has claimed the probation service ""has been destroyed"" in recent years. Mark Fenhalls QC, the former chair of the Criminal Bar Association, has said that those in the criminal justice system ""are unimpressed"" with politicians who talk about the rights and wrongs over the last few years. He told the BBC News Channel: ""The problem is what happens afterwards, in the prisons when they are not rehabilitated and when they are released if there is not a system in place to properly look after them and protect the rest of us."" Mr Fenhalls said the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan ""appears to have been released according to law and obeying his licencing conditions"". He added: ""Over the last ten or 15 years parliament continuously changes laws and ramps up sentences in every regard, but what it does not do is put money into the system to make sure that people who have have committed offences are rehabilitated."" BBC News Channel Labour's Yvette Cooper says there will need to be a ""serious and full"" investigation into how the incident at London Bridge happened, given that the attacker, Usman Khan, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, who was shot dead by police during Friday's attack, was released from prison on licence in December 2018. The former minister tells the BBC: ""I think there are also some immediate questions that will need to be asked, particularly because we know there may be other people in the same situation as this attacker and it's really important that the government is taking every action to keep people safe."" A key question, she adds, is about what the level of risk assessment and safety assessment is for anyone coming to the end of their sentence. Earlier, Ms Cooper clashed with Home Secretary Priti Patel over Usman Khan's prison release. You can read about thathere. People have been paying tribute to Jack Merritt, the University of Cambridge graduate who was named as one of the victims of the attack. Mr Merritt, who ran a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, had been helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. Audrey Ludwig, who knew Mr Merritt through work,tweeted,externalthat his ""deep commitment to prisoner education and rehabilitation was deeply impressive"". ""I send condolences to his family, colleagues and the prisoners' group."" Another friend said Mr Merritt was ""incredibly witty and intelligent, with more lust for life than many our age and a determination to make his mark in the world"". Allow Twitter content?

Usman Khan asked for specialist help to be deradicalised whilst in prison, but did not receive it, his solicitor has said. Vajahat Sharif, head of terrorism, national security and political crimes at Tuckers solicitors, told the BBC, Khan had recognised his underlying ideology was ""wrong and flawed"" and wanted to ""correct"" himself. But Mr Sharif claims that when Khan wrote to a ""credible"" specialist intervention provider for help, ""the powers that be were unable to
provide that assistance while he was in custody"". He says:âFrom my perspective, that seemed wrong, because while the
offender is in custody and is looking back at his offending behaviour and
recognising that itâs wrong, thatâs the ideal time to engage and correct his
thinking."" Rapper Dave has paid tribute to Jack Merritt - one of two people killed in the attack - describing him as ""the best guy"". Mr Merritt, a University of Cambridge graduate, was a course coordinator for a prisoners' rehabilitation programme called Learning Together. The Streatham-born rapper tweeted that the news of Mr Merritt's death was ""one of the most painful things"", saying Mr Merritt had ""dedicated his life to helping others"". He added that it was ""genuinely an honour to have met someone like you"" and he would ""never ever forget"" everything that Mr Merritt had ""done for us"". Dave won the Mercury Prize for his debut album in September, dedicating the award to his brother, Christopher Omoregie, who is serving a life sentence for murder. The rapper's album, Psychodrama, was inspired by the therapy Christopher is receiving in prison, in which offenders role-play events from their past to help with rehabilitation.

Jack Merritt, named today as having been killed in the attack, studied for a bachelor's degree in law at the
University of Manchester. Graduating in 2016, the 25-year-old went on to
study at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked in the criminology
department running Learning Together, the prison rehabilitation programme which terrorist Usman Khan had been involved with. Former programme participants, including Khan,
had been invited to take part in a conference to mark the programme's fifth
anniversary at Fishmongers' Hall. A
vigil was held in Cambridge on Saturday to mark the incident. As we mentioned earlier, Jack Merritt - who has been named as one of the victims of the attack - appeared on a BBC podcast in March talking about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. The University of Cambridge graduate was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme. He told the BBC's Law in Action: ""Our students in prison often have a very first-hand, very real but also very nuanced, idea of how the law works and also they have a very good sense of where there is a lack in information, where there is a lack in knowledge, and they really do know which areas of the law could do with clarification. ""And a lot of the time these are areas that they have seen people go through the prison system not understanding and they want to do research which will help people."" You can listen to himhere(he features at 18:05). People will see ""enhanced police patrols across London of both armed and unarmed officers"", Mr Basu says. He urges members of the public to continue with their plans as usual, and to be ""vigilant but be alert, not alarmed"". He offers his ""heartfelt thoughts
and condolences to all those families, both deceased and who still remain in
hospital, and everyone affected by this tragedy"". You can find Mr Basu's full statementhere,external. Turning to updates on the attacker, Mr Basu says police believe Khan was wearing the hoax explosive vest while attending the prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall. He said: ""We know this attacker was attending an event called Learning Together and some of those present confronted this attacker to try and stop him."" Responding to a question from a reporter, Mr Basu adds ""From start to finish this incident took very few minutes and yes, we believe he was wearing the vest at the time."" Mr Basu says he knows one of the victims has been named online and in the media -as Cambridge university graduate Jack Merritt- but that the Met is still awaiting formal identification from the coroner. This video can not be played Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response The head of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Mr Basu said the public has shared ""nearly 500 images and videos with the investigation team so far, and I am incredibly grateful"". He continued to appeal to anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall, where the attack began, on Friday to contact the police. The Met has said people can contact them in confidence on 0800 789 321. Usman Khan was subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"" on his release from prison, Mr Basu says, and ""to the best of my knowledge he was complying with those conditions"".  Earlier, University of Cambridge graduate Jack Merritt was named
as one of the victims of Friday's London Bridge attack. Mr Merrittâs father David described his son as âa beautiful
spirit who always took the side of the underdogâ. In a now-deleted Twitter post,reported by the Telegraph,,externalhe
wrote: âMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death
to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people
unnecessarily. âJack spoke so highly of all the people he worked with and he
loved his job.â Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, and earlier this year he spoke on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law.

Apple to take 'deeper look' at disputed borders,"Apple Maps does not show a border between Crimea and Russia, to the east Apple says it is taking ""a deeper look"" at how it handles disputed borders. Ukraine criticised the tech giant for showing Crimea as part of Russia's territory on its Maps and Weather apps. An Apple spokeswoman says the company follows international and domestic laws and the change, which is only for users in Russia, had been made because of new legislation there. Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in 2014 was condemned by much of the international community. In a statement, Apple stressed ""we have not made any changes to Apple Maps regarding Crimea outside of Russia. ""We review international law as well as relevant US and other domestic laws before making a determination in labelling on our Maps and make changes if required by law."" Apple added it as a result of its review of how disputed borders are handled, it might make more changes in the future. ""Our intention is to make sure our customers can enjoy using Maps and other Apple services, everywhere in the world."" The changes to Apple's Crimea map for users in Russia were announced earlier in the week by the State Duma, Russian parliament's lower house, in a statement, which described the former boundaries as an ""inaccuracy"". ""Crimea and Sevastopol now appear on Apple devices as Russian territory,"" the statement read. Russia treats the naval port city of Sevastopol as a separate region. Apple has been in talks with Russia for several months and had hoped to keep Crimea as an undefined territory, part of neither Russia nor Ukraine. Google, which produces its own popular map app, also shows Crimea as belonging to Russia when viewed from the country. That change happened in March. Apple's move brought sharp condemnation from Ukraine. Ukrainian foreign minister Vadym Prystaiko tweeted,external: ""Apple, please stick to hi-tech and entertainment. Global politics is not your strong side."" Ukraine'sUS embassy was equally critical on Twitter.,external ""We guess Ukrainians not giving any thanks to @Apple this #Thanksgiving. So let's all remind Apple that #CrimeaIsUkraine and it is under Russian occupation - not its sovereignty,"" it tweeted. Russian ex-world chess champion Garry Kasparov added his voice, calling the decision ""unacceptable appeasement"". He added: ""Software is soft power.

"N Korea threatens Japan with 'real missile'North Korea calls Japan's leader an ""imbecile"" and ""political dwarf"" in a row over its latest test.","A state media image said to show Kim Jong-un inspecting the testing of a ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"" North Korea has branded Japan's PM Shinzo Abe an ""imbecile"" and ""political dwarf"", accusing him of mislabelling its latest weapons test. Mr Abe condemned the North for ""repeated launches of ballistic missiles"" after two projectiles were fired on Thursday. But the North insisted it was testing a ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"". On Saturday, state media said Japan ""may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future"". North Korea is banned from firing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words The country is under various sets of sanctions over its missile and nuclear programmes. Lifting the sanctions has been a key aim of the North in talks with the US - Japan's ally - but these have stalled since a summit between its leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump broke down in February. The North fired what observers in South Korea called two ""unidentified projectiles"" from its South Hamgyong province into the Sea of Japan on Thursday. A KCNA image of the ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"" said to have been tested Condemning the launch, Mr Abe said: ""North Korea's repeated launches of ballistic missiles are a serious defiance to not only our country but also the international community."" The North issued photographs said to be of Mr Kim inspecting the launch. North Korea's KCNA state media said on Saturday: ""It can be said that Abe is the only one idiot in the world and the most stupid man ever known in history as he fails to distinguish a missile from a multiple launch rocket system while seeing the photo-accompanied report."" It added: ""Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose. Abe is none other than a perfect imbecile and a political dwarf."" Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said neither side was necessarily right. The projectile is believed to have been a KN-25, a rocket many analysts consider to be a ""ballistic missile"" due to its large size, and because it follows an unpowered ballistic trajectory for part of its flight. ""The North Koreans are playing a semantics game, basically, and by the same token so is Abe,"" said the MIT specialist. ""When he said ballistic missile he's clearly trying to signify these tests are a violation of UN Security Council resolutions,"" he told the BBC. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Watch: What's it like to live in North Korea? ""North Korea is saying ... it's a multi-launch rocket system, which is different from a ballistic missile."" But the bigger story, the security expert added, is that North Korea could be preparing for longer-range ballistic missile launches. ""The bigger line... is that Abe may soon see a ballistic missile under his nose. It seems to suggest that they are gearing up to start testing longer-range systems,"" he said. Negotiations between North Korea and the US remain stalled since the collapse of February's summit in Hanoi. Mr Trump and Mr Kim did meet again in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Koreas in June and agreed to restart working-level talks. These began in October, but failed to make any progress. This video can not be played Mr Trump and Mr Kim met at the DMZ in June but the historic event led to little progress The North has demanded the US change its approach by the end of the year, and was lukewarm in response to a tweet by Mr Trump hinting at another meeting with Mr Kim. In May, Mr Abe said he was ready to meet Mr Kim ""without conditions"", raising hopes of renewed negotiations on the nuclear issue as well as on the lingering historical issue of the North's abduction of Japanese citizens. The Japanese were kidnapped by the North in the 1970s and 80s to help train its spies. Japan believes 17 citizens were abducted, only five of whom have since been repatriated. But Mr Abe's offer has not come to fruition. The North said this month that the Japanese leader would never set foot in Pyongyang after he condemned an earlier weapons test.

Five things from BBC election debate,"This video can not be played Key moments from the seven-way BBC election debate The latest election debate saw figures from seven political parties square off for the first time on television this election campaign. Here are some of the key moments. Tempers frayed over the future of the health service, which has been a big theme during the election campaign. Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey reprisedher party's claimthat the NHS is under threat from a post-Brexit trade deal with the US, saying initial trade discussions showed services would be ""on the table"". The SNP's Nicola Sturgeon backed her, as did the Green Party's Caroline Lucas. But Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said the NHS was ""not for sale,"" and accused Labour of peddling a ""conspiracy theory"". The Brexit Party's Richard Tice then took things up a notch, branding Labour's claim ""ludicrous,"" and accusing the party of ""scaremongering"". He got a short round of applause when he railed against drugs waste in the NHS. Ms Long-Bailey then was asked to defend a claim in a Labour email to supporters that patients could face a five-figure bill for cancer treatment in future.  As she was answering the question, Mr Tice spoke over her, saying: ""No one's going to privatise the NHS [...] it's rubbish."" LAURA KUENSSBERG:Five against two FULL PROGRAMME:Catch-up on iPlayer VIDEO:Watch the best bits AS IT HAPPENED:The debate live REALITY CHECK:The claims from the debate In thefirst televised debateof the campaign, between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn, both were subjected to calling out and laughter from the audience, particularly over the issues of trust and their position on Brexit. In last week'sBBC Question Time debate, there were also some difficult audience questions. This time around, the audience was noticeably quieter. As might be expected, the mood at the start of the debate was fairly sombre, as politicians and the public reacted to the London Bridge attacks earlier in the day. But things didn't get much louder from then, with the various interventions garnering little scorn or applause. This video can not be played Mixed answers on whether representatives would use nuclear weapons It's a classic election-time question: would the politicians, or their party leaders, retaliate in kind if the UK were under nuclear attack? Caroline Lucas, Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, and the SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon all ruled it out. The Brexit Party's Richard Tice said he would do so, after ""careful consideration"". Rishi Sunak, Jo Swinson and Rebecca Long-Bailey also said they would, if circumstances required. Several of the politicians backed up their policy positions with anecdotes about their loved ones. Adam Price worried that his 84-year-old father could wake up on 13 December to the 11th Conservative government of his lifetime ,despite never having voted for the party. Jo Swinson praised her father for teaching her ""always to ask questions, to challenge the way things are"". And Rishi Sunak praised his seven-year-old daughter, a ""climate-change champion"" who ""turns off all the lights"" and ""makes sure that the tap is off when she's brushing her teeth"". The biggest reaction came from the audience when the seven politicians were asked what they would say to US President Donald Trump if they had 30 seconds in his presence. Ms Sturgeon was brief: ""Please stand down."" Ms Lucas, perhaps unsurprisingly, focused on climate change, saying she would tell the leader to ""get your act together"" and rejoin theParis agreementto cut emissions. The prize for politeness went to Mr Sunak, who would merely wish Mr Trump a ""happy Thanksgiving"" (which was on Thursday). But Mr Price got the best reaction, with a rare bit of laughter from the audience, answering: ""Resign and take Boris with you.""

"Politicians respond to London attack in BBC debateSeven figures from major political parties also discuss Brexit, immigration, nuclear weapons and the NHS.Election 2019","This video can not be played Key moments from the seven-way BBC election debate Politicians have shared their plans to tackle security issues in the UK after the terror attack on London Bridge. Seven senior figures from the major political parties took part in a BBC debate ahead of the December general election. The early focus was on the incident in the capital,which saw two people killed and the attacker shot dead. The politicians moved on to more robust discussions on topics including Brexit, the NHS and immigration. In a subdued start to the programme, the Conservatives' Chief Secretary to the TreasuryRishi Sunak, Labour's shadow business secretaryRebecca Long Bailey,Liberal Democrat leaderJo Swinson,SNP leader and Scottish First MinisterNicola Sturgeon,Plaid Cymru leaderAdam Price,former Green Party co-leaderCaroline Lucasand Brexit Party chairmanRichard Ticeall laid out their plans for security after a question from a retired police chief inspector. LAURA KUENSSBERG:Five against two REALITY CHECK:The claims from the debate FULL PROGRAMME:Catch-up on iPlayer VIDEO:Watch the best bits FIVE MOMENTS:The key takeaways AS IT HAPPENED:The debate live All seven paid tribute to the emergency services and the public for their response. Mr Sunak said it was the ""first duty of every government"" to keep the public safe. He promised the Conservatives would ""continue to do that"" by investing in police and giving them the powers they need to tackle threats to the UK. Labour's Ms Long-Bailey agreed there needed to be more investment in police. But she said Tory cuts had reduced personnel by 20,000 - the number by which Boris Johnson has pledged to increase forces if he continues as prime minister. ""It is right to recognise the direct impact [of those cuts] and invest more in community policing - the eyes and ears of our communities,"" Ms Long-Bailey added. CONFUSED?Our simple election guide,external POLICY GUIDE:Who should I vote for?,external POSTCODE SEARCH:Find your local candidates,external POLLS:How are the parties doing?,external A TO Z:Our tool to explain election words,external The Lib Dems' Ms Swinson also promised 20,000 more police officers, and backed the need for community policing. She then praised police work in Scotland - namely the violence reduction unit in Glasgow, which has been credited withmore than halving incidents of knife crime. The Brexit Party's Mr Tice added to the calls for more police on the streets of the UK, but said ""people must remain vigilant"" in light of attacks. For the Green Party, Ms Lucas accepted no amount of police could prevent such incidents, but added: ""More police would help."" She also said political leaders ""all have a responsibility... to show compassion and love"" in light of attacks such as the one in London Bridge. This video can not be played Labour's Rebecca Long-Bailey and Conservative Rishi Sunak argue over their spending promises Ms Sturgeon said the SNP would ""make sure we support our security services"". But she said Brexit would stop the UK from ""keeping access to the best intelligence"". And Plaid's Mr Price said there had to be ""a multiplicity of answers as no one answer will keep us safe"". He said resources were ""always part of the answer"", and called for a rise in numbers in Wales, but he also suggested ""a more preventative approach"" to stop the ""normalisation"" of knife crime. When it came to Brexit, the debate became more heated. Mr Sunak stuck by the Tories' message that to vote for them to ""get Brexit done"". He said the party ""have got a deal and it's ready to go"", and with a majority in Parliament, it could pass it to stop the ""dither"" of other parties. Analysis by Jonathan Blake, political correspondent After events in London, the atmosphere in Cardiff was more sombre than it might have been but the debate still delivered some lively exchanges. The relatively unknown Rishi Sunak stuck to the script of the Conservatives' main campaign messages and escaped largely unscathed. He was confident, if cautious, and will have boosted his profile. Labour, lagging in the polls, needed to up the ante and an assured performance from Rebecca Long-Bailey helped hammer home the party's policies and keep the NHS row rumbling on. Clashes between SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon and the Brexit Party's Richard Tice provided some fiery moments, which won't have done either any harm. Jo Swinson defended the Lib Dems' stop-Brexit policy but admitted winning the election would be a ""seismic"" event, all but giving up on her early campaign pitch to be the next prime minister. For Plaid Cymru's Adam Price the debate was about attacking Labour's record in government in Wales, and the Green Party's Caroline Lucas made the most of the prominence of climate change as an election campaign issue. None of those on stage will be going home with their head in their hands in despair, but neither are they likely to be punching the air in victory. But he was challenged by Remain-backing politicians over Boris Johnson's pledge to do a trade deal with the EU by the end of 2020, and his threat to leave without a deal if the deadline isn't reached. Ms Swinson, who says the Lib Dems will cancel Brexit if they win the election, said: ""It is like we're in episode one of a 10 season box set, and if you don't like what you've seen up to now you don't have to watch the rest."" Ms Sturgeon said the slogan to ""get Brexit done"" was ""the biggest con of this election"", backed by the Greens' Ms Lucas, who said Mr Johnson's deal was ""just the start of years more wrangling"". Mr Sunak failed to rule out a no-deal Brexit when pressed by the other candidates. However, the Brexit Party's Mr Tice said it was time to get a deal done regardless, adding: ""Just imagine, with Brexit done properly we have an amazing future - and that's why I am here."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon and Richard Tice clash On spending plans, Labour's Ms Long-Bailey claimed her party had ""the most detailed manifesto"" while the Tories had ""fabricated lies"" about their own spending. But Mr Sunak accused his rivals of being ""reckless"", claiming the Conservative manifesto was ""fully costed"". Ms Swinson replied: ""If you're listening to that and you think in your heart of hearts you just know that's not true, then you need to look for parties who are going to set out where they will get the money from."" The ongoing row over whether the NHS would be on the table in trade talks with the US post-Brexitagain reared its head, with the SNP's Ms Sturgeon calling for the Tories to support a law blocking its inclusion. But Mr Tice accused parties of ""scaremongering"" and said Labour - who first raised the concern - of not knowing the difference between buying and selling. In another clash, the Tories and the Brexit Party backed plans for an ""Australian-style"" points based system for immigration, with Mr Tice blaming immigration levels for suppressing wages in the UK. But Ms Lucas said she was ""proud to stand up"" for the EU's existing free movement rules. Mr Price said it would not be possible to apply EU rules ""exactly"" to the rest of the world, but people should be welcome to come to the UK. The final question to each politician was what message they wanted to give Donald Trump, who is due to come to the UK next week for a Nato summit. Mr Sunak simply wished him a ""happy Thanksgiving"", while Ms Sturgeon said: ""Please step down"". This video can not be played Adam Price attacks Jeremy Corbyn's stance on Brexit But while others brought up Brexit and climate change, Mr Price responded: ""Resign and take Boris with you.""

FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Watford Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores seems to suggest that the game changed on a moment where one of his substitutes injured themselves in the warm-up. Gerard Deulofeu came off after 67 minutes to be replaced by Andre Gray. Who was supposed to come on, the Watford boss didn't say. But he's not very chuffed. He said: ""It's changed the situation a lot. We had to put on another player, we had players tired, we lost a little bit the control of the opponent. Elements are working against us. ""At half time we had the feel that we were in a match we wanted. But they went up another level and we didn't do the same."" Asked whether he will be backed by the club, he added: ""Yeah I believe I will, but it doesn't only depend on me. I cannot control it. When we lose we can say sorry to the fans, the owners and players, but we have the same feeling, we want to fight."" As for the incident in the build-up to Southampton's equaliser, he said it was a handball.  FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford No, is the answer to that previous question. Quique has arrived in front of the camera. A lot of sighing and head shaking from the Watford boss. Understandably, he's hurting. The Spanish boss says he is devastated by the result but is not thinking about getting the sack. Full quotes to come... FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Wondering where Quique Sanchez Flores is? So are we. He's not been hauled into a meeting with the Watford hierarchy has he??? FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told Match of the Day:""The first half was a completely different performance to last weekend and it was unbelievable it could happen. At half-time, we were very critical and in the second half it was a good reaction. After 10 minutes we made two subs and they had a big impact in the game and it was a big big win for us. ""We have not had one good start so far this season and it doesn't matter what we say or how we we prepare, the moment the game starts it is in our minds. Now we have to push it away and our crowd deserve it. Let's do it again on Wednesday."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford An excellent reminder from Ralph there, not that Saints fans will need reminding... their side have another MAHOOSIVE home match on Wednesday. Fellow relegation scrappers Norwich are coming to town... Depending on results tomorrow and Wednesday Southamptoncouldmove out of the bottom three with a win. #bbcfootball or text us on 81111 (UK only) Maybe Ralph does have the X factor? Ings superlative once more! Randall Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl:""There is a tonne of weight falling off the shoulders, there were tonnes of weight here today, you could feel it from the first moment. We couldn't move. It was completely different to last weekend. ""The subs had a good impact and gave us fresh energy. Then it was a completely different second half, an unbelievable turnaround for the table. Sofiane Boufal on one side and Moussa Djenepo on the other gave us good quality. On the suggestion there was a handball in the build-up to the equaliser:""We are all very happy about the VAR because it makes a good job. We want less discussion, but it is not always going to be right. It is not possible to see everything. Sometimes you are lucky with VAR, sometimes not. On the importance of beating Watford:""It is not important to analyse this game in the context of the while season, but the pressure we had in the run-up to this game was clear. It was so difficult in the first half but I'm so happy it gives us three points and lift ahead of the Norwich game here on Wednesday."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Watford Watford midfielder Etienne Capoue on Sky Sports:""We are very frustrated, we did a good first half performance but we couldn't hold it for another 45 minutes, but the spirit is good and we have another game on Wednesday so we have to get three points very soon. ""It's not about VAR decisions, it's down to us. We suffered in the second half but we shouldn't and we conceded two goals. ""It's a big week, big weeks, December and January are very tough. Everyone is on the same page and we really want to stay in the Premier League and we have the players to do it. Quique does the job very well, it's just down to us, we are the main protagonists on the pitch."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton midfielder James Ward Prowse told Match of the Day:""It's a nice feeling it is something I work on a lot, so to see it come of on a matchday and contribute to us picking up three points is pleasing. ""It has been an up and down season and we are not where we want to be but this period after the international break is a good opportunity for us to pick up points. We knew the enormity of he game and that we had to win to push forward, so it is a real positive step for us. ""We showed the belief in what we are doing and we all had a belief that this game was winnable."" And here is why it is such a massive result for Saints... FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton striker Danny Ings told Sky Sport:""It's a massive result. It has been a very tough week for everyone at the club, To go 1-0 down and then to comeback and win shows the character of the lads. The atmosphere was great in the end and we deserved the points."" On his goal:""I could sense something coming and just making that run to the near post and managing to put it in was a great moment for me."" On a potential penalty claim:""I felt like I had read the keeper and I knew he was going to chop back. I cant really remember it and all that matters is we got the win."" On first home win:""It's massive and it is so underrated how much the fans mean to you at home games. We have to make other teams not want to be here."" Allow Twitter content?

What happened when Walliams met Williams at the RSC âââââ,"There are certain tried-and-tested antidotes to the winter blues. Like looking up puppies on the internet. Or flicking through brochures of sun-drenched Caribbean holidays. And, when desperate, the fall-back option of browsing LinkedIn for profiles of old school friends with dreadful jobs. These are all free options. If you're up for spending a bit of money (Â£16-Â£67.50) to lift your spirits, then you might consider buying a ticket to see the musical The Boy in the Dress at the Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon. It is a show that embraces the concept of feel-good entertainment like a banker receiving a bonus, which is to say, shamelessly. Anyone after intellectual nourishment will leave feeling distinctly peckish, but those seeking a warm bath of comfort and joy will wallow in this page-to-stage musical reimagining of David Walliams' best-selling children's book The Boy in the Dress. L-R: David Walliams with Guy Chambers, Robbie Williams and director Gregory Doran at the musical's press night There is a decidedly showbizzy vibe to the production, from Aletta Collins' exuberant choreography to the deluxe stage design by Robert Jones. Hardly surprising, given the music and lyrics are by Robbie Williams and Guy Chambers, the songwriting duo behind late 90s pop hits Angels, Let Me Entertain You and Millennium. Williams said he and Chambers were given just two weeks to write the 17 catchy numbers that are the show's heart and soul, compared to the three years they took to write his latest album. All I can say is the album must be an absolute banger, because the tunes they knocked out in a fortnight for The Boy in the Dress are terrific - particularly if you're a fan of their early work, the hooks from which appear throughout. The story is a familiar tale of the misfit kid. Dennis is a 12 year-old football-loving schoolboy with inner feelings he doesn't understand. An existential angst not helped by his mother walking out on his father, and the locals bursting into a song about beingOrdinary(""We said we're Labour, but we're voting Tory.""), because, as they say, ""What's the point of being different?"" Dennis goes to his bedroom to sing If I Don't Cry and asks his big brother John for a hug, which goes down like a crate of non-alcoholic beer on a stag night. John turns away in disgust and explains that mothers do hugs, brothers do wedgies. Toby Mocrei as Dennis And so, the light-hearted tone is set for two hours of gentle jokes and easy listening. John has a weakness for Magnum ice creams, Dennis likes magazines with pictures of ladies in dresses, while their dad (Rufus Hound) prefers magazines with pictures of ladies without dresses. As Dennis moves ever more confidently towards his desire to try a frock on for size, his role as star striker for the school's football team is put in jeopardy by a heavy cold (this is about as dramatic as the story gets). But this is theatre, so the game must go on with some posh boys providing the oppo (cue, topical joke). The match is played out before our eyes in a superbly executed scene seamlessly mixing puppetry, choreography and the imaginative direction of Gregory Doran. Two hours of gentle jokes and easy listening - with some puppets thrown in An effective staging device of having the football fixed to the end of a pole manoeuvred by a cast member is used throughout. Except for one moment when a loose football is placed for a crucial penalty, which, for the next sequence to work, has to be scored. All the goalie need do is dive out of the way so the ball can roll in. What could possibly go wrong? Well, on the night I went, the ball ricocheted off the keeper's legs and ended up in row G of the auditorium and not the back of the net. This led to an incongruous scene with the attacking team celebrating wildly having missed, while the ball is lobbed back into play from the stalls. Stick to the stick would be my note. It works. Jackson Laing is one of four actors who play Dennis for different performances As does this show, even though there are times where it is a little rushed, and others that are a tad too pantomime hammy. At least for me. I doubt any of the younger members of the audience would concur, and it is at them the production is aimed. Those to whom I spoke afterwards loved every second: a chorus of approval that was palpable throughout, with rousing applause at the end of several of the big numbers including a glitter ball delight called Disco Symphony. The Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC) pulled off a remarkable feat with Tim Minchin's musical reinvention of Roald Dahl's Matilda a decade ago. It has been a huge commercial success for the company, enabling it to invest in education and outreach projects. The RSC is hoping The Boy in the Dress will follow suit and transfer for a long and lucrative West End run. Maybe it will, but the competition is a lot stiffer than when Matilda made the transition. The blockbuster juggernaut Hamilton wasn't about then, nor were Everybody's Talking About Jamie and Dear Evan Hansen - two musicals covering a similar ground of odd-one-out schoolboys. Those three have a very contemporary flavour, while The Boy in the Dress already feels more dated (the book was published in 2008). The issues it tackles are timeless and universal, but the central dramatic device of a boy wearing a dress doesn't seem particularly shocking in 2019. And supposed flashes of epiphany such as the radical idea of starting a girls' football team either need to be cut altogether or rewritten to reflect that women's football is now a major sport. But then we know The Boy in the Dress isn't frightened to be who he is and go toe-to-toe with the big guys. I hope it succeeds. There's plenty of room in this world for another joyful, uplifting musical - especially one that so unapologetically wears its heart on its sequined sleeve.

Police investigate woman's death in street,"Police sealed off the pavement beside a bank and block of flats A woman's death on a Glasgow street is being investigated by police. Officers and paramedics responded to a report of a woman ""injured"" in the Govan areas about 04:20 on Saturday. Police Scotland confirmed the 45-year-old was pronounced dead at the scene. The death is being treated as ""unexplained"" but a spokeswoman said there did not appear to be any suspicious circumstances. A post mortem examination will be held in due course. An area in front of flats, close to the TSB bank on Govan Road, was taped off with several officers and police vehicles at the scene.

And then we'll be back right here at 12:30 GMT tomorrow for four Premier League matches, including Arsenal's first game without Unai Emery in charge. FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Watford Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores seems to suggest that the game changed on a moment where one of his substitutes injured themselves in the warm-up. Gerard Deulofeu came off after 67 minutes to be replaced by Andre Gray. Who was supposed to come on, the Watford boss didn't say. But he's not very chuffed. He said: ""It's changed the situation a lot. We had to put on another player, we had players tired, we lost a little bit the control of the opponent. Elements are working against us. ""At half time we had the feel that we were in a match we wanted. But they went up another level and we didn't do the same."" Asked whether he will be backed by the club, he added: ""Yeah I believe I will, but it doesn't only depend on me. I cannot control it. When we lose we can say sorry to the fans, the owners and players, but we have the same feeling, we want to fight."" As for the incident in the build-up to Southampton's equaliser, he said it was a handball.  FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford No, is the answer to that previous question. Quique has arrived in front of the camera. A lot of sighing and head shaking from the Watford boss. Understandably, he's hurting. The Spanish boss says he is devastated by the result but is not thinking about getting the sack. Full quotes to come... FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Wondering where Quique Sanchez Flores is? So are we. He's not been hauled into a meeting with the Watford hierarchy has he??? FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told Match of the Day:""The first half was a completely different performance to last weekend and it was unbelievable it could happen. At half-time, we were very critical and in the second half it was a good reaction. After 10 minutes we made two subs and they had a big impact in the game and it was a big big win for us. ""We have not had one good start so far this season and it doesn't matter what we say or how we we prepare, the moment the game starts it is in our minds. Now we have to push it away and our crowd deserve it. Let's do it again on Wednesday."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford An excellent reminder from Ralph there, not that Saints fans will need reminding... their side have another MAHOOSIVE home match on Wednesday. Fellow relegation scrappers Norwich are coming to town... Depending on results tomorrow and Wednesday Southamptoncouldmove out of the bottom three with a win. #bbcfootball or text us on 81111 (UK only) Maybe Ralph does have the X factor? Ings superlative once more! Randall Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl:""There is a tonne of weight falling off the shoulders, there were tonnes of weight here today, you could feel it from the first moment. We couldn't move. It was completely different to last weekend. ""The subs had a good impact and gave us fresh energy. Then it was a completely different second half, an unbelievable turnaround for the table. Sofiane Boufal on one side and Moussa Djenepo on the other gave us good quality. On the suggestion there was a handball in the build-up to the equaliser:""We are all very happy about the VAR because it makes a good job. We want less discussion, but it is not always going to be right. It is not possible to see everything. Sometimes you are lucky with VAR, sometimes not. On the importance of beating Watford:""It is not important to analyse this game in the context of the while season, but the pressure we had in the run-up to this game was clear. It was so difficult in the first half but I'm so happy it gives us three points and lift ahead of the Norwich game here on Wednesday."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Watford Watford midfielder Etienne Capoue on Sky Sports:""We are very frustrated, we did a good first half performance but we couldn't hold it for another 45 minutes, but the spirit is good and we have another game on Wednesday so we have to get three points very soon. ""It's not about VAR decisions, it's down to us. We suffered in the second half but we shouldn't and we conceded two goals. ""It's a big week, big weeks, December and January are very tough. Everyone is on the same page and we really want to stay in the Premier League and we have the players to do it. Quique does the job very well, it's just down to us, we are the main protagonists on the pitch."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton midfielder James Ward Prowse told Match of the Day:""It's a nice feeling it is something I work on a lot, so to see it come of on a matchday and contribute to us picking up three points is pleasing. ""It has been an up and down season and we are not where we want to be but this period after the international break is a good opportunity for us to pick up points. We knew the enormity of he game and that we had to win to push forward, so it is a real positive step for us. ""We showed the belief in what we are doing and we all had a belief that this game was winnable."" And here is why it is such a massive result for Saints... FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton striker Danny Ings told Sky Sport:""It's a massive result. It has been a very tough week for everyone at the club, To go 1-0 down and then to comeback and win shows the character of the lads. The atmosphere was great in the end and we deserved the points."" On his goal:""I could sense something coming and just making that run to the near post and managing to put it in was a great moment for me."" On a potential penalty claim:""I felt like I had read the keeper and I knew he was going to chop back. I cant really remember it and all that matters is we got the win."" On first home win:""It's massive and it is so underrated how much the fans mean to you at home games. We have to make other teams not want to be here."" Allow Twitter content?

"N Korea threatens Japan with 'real missile'North Korea calls Japan's leader an ""imbecile"" and ""political dwarf"" in a row over its latest test.Asia","A state media image said to show Kim Jong-un inspecting the testing of a ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"" North Korea has branded Japan's PM Shinzo Abe an ""imbecile"" and ""political dwarf"", accusing him of mislabelling its latest weapons test. Mr Abe condemned the North for ""repeated launches of ballistic missiles"" after two projectiles were fired on Thursday. But the North insisted it was testing a ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"". On Saturday, state media said Japan ""may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future"". North Korea is banned from firing ballistic missiles under UN Security Council resolutions. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme North Korea crisis in 300 words The country is under various sets of sanctions over its missile and nuclear programmes. Lifting the sanctions has been a key aim of the North in talks with the US - Japan's ally - but these have stalled since a summit between its leader Kim Jong-un and President Donald Trump broke down in February. The North fired what observers in South Korea called two ""unidentified projectiles"" from its South Hamgyong province into the Sea of Japan on Thursday. A KCNA image of the ""super-large multiple-rocket launcher"" said to have been tested Condemning the launch, Mr Abe said: ""North Korea's repeated launches of ballistic missiles are a serious defiance to not only our country but also the international community."" The North issued photographs said to be of Mr Kim inspecting the launch. North Korea's KCNA state media said on Saturday: ""It can be said that Abe is the only one idiot in the world and the most stupid man ever known in history as he fails to distinguish a missile from a multiple launch rocket system while seeing the photo-accompanied report."" It added: ""Abe may see what a real ballistic missile is in the not distant future and under his nose. Abe is none other than a perfect imbecile and a political dwarf."" Vipin Narang, associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), said neither side was necessarily right. The projectile is believed to have been a KN-25, a rocket many analysts consider to be a ""ballistic missile"" due to its large size, and because it follows an unpowered ballistic trajectory for part of its flight. ""The North Koreans are playing a semantics game, basically, and by the same token so is Abe,"" said the MIT specialist. ""When he said ballistic missile he's clearly trying to signify these tests are a violation of UN Security Council resolutions,"" he told the BBC. North Korea's sidelined human rights crisis Watch: What's it like to live in North Korea? ""North Korea is saying ... it's a multi-launch rocket system, which is different from a ballistic missile."" But the bigger story, the security expert added, is that North Korea could be preparing for longer-range ballistic missile launches. ""The bigger line... is that Abe may soon see a ballistic missile under his nose. It seems to suggest that they are gearing up to start testing longer-range systems,"" he said. Negotiations between North Korea and the US remain stalled since the collapse of February's summit in Hanoi. Mr Trump and Mr Kim did meet again in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the Koreas in June and agreed to restart working-level talks. These began in October, but failed to make any progress. This video can not be played Mr Trump and Mr Kim met at the DMZ in June but the historic event led to little progress The North has demanded the US change its approach by the end of the year, and was lukewarm in response to a tweet by Mr Trump hinting at another meeting with Mr Kim. In May, Mr Abe said he was ready to meet Mr Kim ""without conditions"", raising hopes of renewed negotiations on the nuclear issue as well as on the lingering historical issue of the North's abduction of Japanese citizens. The Japanese were kidnapped by the North in the 1970s and 80s to help train its spies. Japan believes 17 citizens were abducted, only five of whom have since been repatriated. But Mr Abe's offer has not come to fruition. The North said this month that the Japanese leader would never set foot in Pyongyang after he condemned an earlier weapons test.

Essex lorry deaths bodies back in VietnamAll 39 are returned to their families five weeks after they were found in a refrigerated lorry.Essex,"Pham Thi Tra My was identified as one of the victims The bodies of all 39 people found in the back of a refrigerated lorry in Essex have been returned to Vietnam. Among the victims were eight women and 31 men and boys, including two teenager aged 15. The bodies were discovered on 23 October in a trailer in Grays. Investigations are ongoing in the UK and Vietnam. A lorry driver accused of 39 counts of manslaughter hasadmitted plotting to assist illegal immigration. The first bodies were flown to Hanoi's Noi Bai Airport on 27 November. Ambulances took them to their family villages. Ambulances took the victims' bodies to their homes Some families told the BBC repatriating their loved ones could leave them further in debt after it emerged it would would cost each family more than 66 million Vietnamese dong (about Â£2,200),according to the vice minister of foreign affairs. Pham Ngoc Tuan, brother of one of the victims, told the BBC's Nga Pham: ""We already had to borrow so much money, we had to mortgage what we had. I don't even know if we can borrow any more."" More than Â£84,000 has been raised by various organisers to help support the families. The bodies were discovered in a refrigerated trailer Senior coroner for Essex, Caroline Beasley-Murray, said: ""I am glad that all the victims of this appalling tragedy have now been repatriated and our thoughts remain with the bereaved families at this dreadful time for them. ""It is important that not just the living but also the dead are treated with respect."" Lorry driver Maurice Robinson admitted conspiring with others to assist illegal immigration and acquiring criminal property- namely cash - all between 1 May 2018 and 24 October 2019. Maurice Robinson is charged with 39 counts of manslaughter Mr Robinson was not asked to plead to 39 charges of manslaughter and was remanded into custody pending another hearing on 13 December.

Saint statue restored after missing hand mystery,"During the restoration process the university's museums team established the statue was the work of revered sculptor Sir John Steell A statue of Scotland's patron saint has been fully restored after his left hand mysteriously disappeared. The stone sculpture of St Andrew, a copy of the one in St Peter's Basilica in Rome, was gifted to St Andrews University in the 1960s. But after a failed appeal tofind its missing handthe statue underwent a conservation and repair programme. Experts then discovered it was the work of revered sculptor Sir John Steell who was honoured by Queen Victoria. Dr Katie Stevenson, the university's vice-principal, responsible for collections, music and digital content, said: ""The restoration and conservation of such a historically-important sculpture will allow generations to enjoy it for years to come. ""We were delighted that during the restoration our team were able to confirm the added discovery that the statue of St Andrew is an original piece by Sir John Steell, which makes it even more significant not only to the university but to our understanding of the development of Scottish art in the nineteenth century."" The statue was moved from Edinburgh to St Andrews in the 1960s Dr Stevenson said the statue was previously in the foyer of the North British & Mercantile Insurance Company building in Edinburgh and as staff came in to work they touched the fingers to bring them luck. For almost four decades it was in the Botanic Garden car park in St Andrews but its new home is in the gardens of the Wardlaw Museum on The Scores. Until recently it was credited to Musselburgh-born sculptor Alexander Handyside Ritchie. But during the restoration the team identified it was the creation of Steell, who worked with his father from a studio in Edinburgh. His first major piece came in 1827 when the North British Insurance Company commissioned a huge timber statue of St Andrew to be placed outside its office in Edinburgh's New Town. It was based on the statue of St Andrew in Rome by Francois Duquesnoy. The sculpture's new home is outside the Wardlaw Museum, which is undergoing a refurbishment Two years later Steell travelled to to the Italian capital to study sculpture before creating his stone tribute to the saint. In 1838 his reputation led to him being appointed Sculptor in Ordinary by Queen Victoria. Steell's work was sent as far afield as Jamaica and India and his commissions include the statue of Robert Burns in Central Park, New York. Dr Katie Eagleton, St Andrews university museums director, said: ""Steell is credited with introducing large-scale marble carving into Scotland.

Hague knife attack victims were aged 13-15Dutch police are still hunting the suspect in Friday's attack and say the motive remains unclear.Europe,"This video can not be played Forensics experts check the scene at Grote Marktstraat. The three victims of a stabbing attack on a shopping street in the Dutch city of The Hague on Friday were two girls aged 15 and a boy of 13. None of the victims knew each other and police are still hunting a male suspect, with no clue as yet to motive. The victims have now been released from hospital. Images and videos on social media showed dozens of Black Friday shoppers running away from the scene after the attacker struck at 19:45 (18:45 GMT). The victims have not been named but were described as a 13-year-old boy from The Hague, a 15-year-old girl from Alphen aan den Rijn and another 15-year-old girl from Leiderdorp. The incident happened at the Hudson's Bay store in the city's Grote Marktstraat, or main market square. Police have urged the public to contact them if they witnessed the attack. Officials have also asked anyone with images or footage of the attack to send it to the police. An initial description of the suspect suggested police were looking for a man aged between 45 to 50 wearing a grey tracksuit. In a later update, Hague police said that description was wrong but have given few further details about the incident. They said in a statement: ""We are using all the means at our disposal - both visible and invisible - to find the suspect of this incident as quickly as possible. ""The motive of the suspect is as yet unclear."" The city's Deputy Mayor Boudewijn Revis told de Volkskrant: ""On a night when a lot of people do their shopping in one of our busiest shopping streets, something so terrible happens.""

And then we'll be back right here at 12:30 GMT tomorrow for four Premier League matches, including Arsenal's first game without Unai Emery in charge. FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Watford Watford boss Quique Sanchez Flores seems to suggest that the game changed on a moment where one of his substitutes injured themselves in the warm-up. Gerard Deulofeu came off after 67 minutes to be replaced by Andre Gray. Who was supposed to come on, the Watford boss didn't say. But he's not very chuffed. He said: ""It's changed the situation a lot. We had to put on another player, we had players tired, we lost a little bit the control of the opponent. Elements are working against us. ""At half time we had the feel that we were in a match we wanted. But they went up another level and we didn't do the same."" Asked whether he will be backed by the club, he added: ""Yeah I believe I will, but it doesn't only depend on me. I cannot control it. When we lose we can say sorry to the fans, the owners and players, but we have the same feeling, we want to fight."" As for the incident in the build-up to Southampton's equaliser, he said it was a handball.  FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford No, is the answer to that previous question. Quique has arrived in front of the camera. A lot of sighing and head shaking from the Watford boss. Understandably, he's hurting. The Spanish boss says he is devastated by the result but is not thinking about getting the sack. Full quotes to come... FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Wondering where Quique Sanchez Flores is? So are we. He's not been hauled into a meeting with the Watford hierarchy has he??? FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl told Match of the Day:""The first half was a completely different performance to last weekend and it was unbelievable it could happen. At half-time, we were very critical and in the second half it was a good reaction. After 10 minutes we made two subs and they had a big impact in the game and it was a big big win for us. ""We have not had one good start so far this season and it doesn't matter what we say or how we we prepare, the moment the game starts it is in our minds. Now we have to push it away and our crowd deserve it. Let's do it again on Wednesday."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford An excellent reminder from Ralph there, not that Saints fans will need reminding... their side have another MAHOOSIVE home match on Wednesday. Fellow relegation scrappers Norwich are coming to town... Depending on results tomorrow and Wednesday Southamptoncouldmove out of the bottom three with a win. #bbcfootball or text us on 81111 (UK only) Maybe Ralph does have the X factor? Ings superlative once more! Randall Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton manager Ralph Hasenhuttl:""There is a tonne of weight falling off the shoulders, there were tonnes of weight here today, you could feel it from the first moment. We couldn't move. It was completely different to last weekend. ""The subs had a good impact and gave us fresh energy. Then it was a completely different second half, an unbelievable turnaround for the table. Sofiane Boufal on one side and Moussa Djenepo on the other gave us good quality. On the suggestion there was a handball in the build-up to the equaliser:""We are all very happy about the VAR because it makes a good job. We want less discussion, but it is not always going to be right. It is not possible to see everything. Sometimes you are lucky with VAR, sometimes not. On the importance of beating Watford:""It is not important to analyse this game in the context of the while season, but the pressure we had in the run-up to this game was clear. It was so difficult in the first half but I'm so happy it gives us three points and lift ahead of the Norwich game here on Wednesday."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Watford Watford midfielder Etienne Capoue on Sky Sports:""We are very frustrated, we did a good first half performance but we couldn't hold it for another 45 minutes, but the spirit is good and we have another game on Wednesday so we have to get three points very soon. ""It's not about VAR decisions, it's down to us. We suffered in the second half but we shouldn't and we conceded two goals. ""It's a big week, big weeks, December and January are very tough. Everyone is on the same page and we really want to stay in the Premier League and we have the players to do it. Quique does the job very well, it's just down to us, we are the main protagonists on the pitch."" FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton midfielder James Ward Prowse told Match of the Day:""It's a nice feeling it is something I work on a lot, so to see it come of on a matchday and contribute to us picking up three points is pleasing. ""It has been an up and down season and we are not where we want to be but this period after the international break is a good opportunity for us to pick up points. We knew the enormity of he game and that we had to win to push forward, so it is a real positive step for us. ""We showed the belief in what we are doing and we all had a belief that this game was winnable."" And here is why it is such a massive result for Saints... FT: Southampton 2-1 Watford Southampton Southampton striker Danny Ings told Sky Sport:""It's a massive result. It has been a very tough week for everyone at the club, To go 1-0 down and then to comeback and win shows the character of the lads. The atmosphere was great in the end and we deserved the points."" On his goal:""I could sense something coming and just making that run to the near post and managing to put it in was a great moment for me."" On a potential penalty claim:""I felt like I had read the keeper and I knew he was going to chop back. I cant really remember it and all that matters is we got the win."" On first home win:""It's massive and it is so underrated how much the fans mean to you at home games. We have to make other teams not want to be here."" Allow Twitter content?

"Rail fares to rise by 2.7% in JanuaryThe rise is below the benchmark inflation rate, but still means big increases for many commuters.","Millions of commuters will have to pay an average of 2.7% more for rail tickets from 2 January. The rise, announced by industry body the Rail Delivery Group, is lower than the 3.1% increase at the start of 2019. Train companies say this is the third year in a row that average fares have been held below the benchmark inflation measure on which rises are based. But many commuters will still face an increase of more than Â£100 in the annual cost of getting to work. Independent watchdog Transport Focus said a majority of rail users did not feel they were getting value for money. The news comes as commuters on South Western Railway services are steeling themselves fora 27-day rail strike next month. Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union members will walk out in a long-running dispute over guards on trains. About 40% of annual rail price rises in England, Scotland and Wales are regulated, which means that they are pegged to the Retail Prices Index (RPI) inflation measure for the previous July. This year, that figure was 2.8%. But RPI inflation is generally higher than the most widely watched measure of inflation, the Consumer Prices Index. And passenger groups have repeatedly called for the system to be changed, since RPI inflation was abandoned by the National Audit Office as a national statistic in 2013. Train company apologises for rise in delay claims More violent crime reported on British railways Rail Delivery Group chief executive Paul Plummer said the extra money was allowing the train companies to invest in improvements to the network, including 1,000 extra services a week in 2020. He added: ""The industry will continue to push for changes to fare regulations to enable a better range of affordable, mix-and-match fares and reduced overcrowding on some of the busiest routes."" Mr Plummer said that 98p in every pound from fares went towards the cost of running the railway. A spokesperson for Transport Focus said: ""We speak to thousands of passengers each year and we know that less than half feel they get value for money. ""After a year of patchy performance, passengers just want a consistent day-to-day service they can rely on and a better chance of getting a seat."" Transport Focus called on passengers to ""make their voice heard"" and claim compensation every time they suffered a delay or cancellation.

"Brazil's leader accuses DiCaprio over Amazon firesThe Hollywood actor dismisses Jair Bolsonaro's claim he ""gave money to set the Amazon on fire"".","Fires that burned in August caused global concern for the ""lungs of the planet"" Brazil's President Jair Bolsonaro has accused Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio of ""giving money to set the Amazon on fire"". The president gave no evidence but in the past has accused NGOs critical of his policies of starting fires that ravaged the rainforest this year. Several arrests have been made amid controversial and unproven allegations fires were started to obtain funding. DiCaprio, who has pledged $5m for the Amazon, denied Mr Bolsonaro's claim. The latest comments appear to arise from the arrest of four volunteer firefighters from northern ParÃ¡ state on allegations they started fires to generate NGO donations. Amazon fires: What's the latest in Brazil? 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute How do you fight extreme wildfires? Rights groups, NGOs and critics claimed the police operation against them was politically motivated and an attempt to harass environmental groups. Fires that burned in August this year caused global concern for the ""lungs of the planet"". His latest accusation came during brief remarks at the presidential residence on Friday. ""This Leonardo DiCaprio is a cool guy, right? Giving money to torch the Amazon."" He gave no evidence and did not elaborate, although the statement appeared to echo a live webcast he gave on Thursday. That revolved around the environmental organisation, the World Wildlife Fund (WWF), and allegations, denied by the WWF, that it had paid for images taken by the arrested firefighters, who have since been released. Mr Bolsonaro said: ""So what did the NGO do? What is the easiest thing? Set fire to the forest. Take pictures, make a video. [WWF] makes a campaign against Brazil, it contacts Leonardo DiCaprio, he donates $500,000. ""A part of that went to the people that were setting fires. Leonardo DiCaprio, you are contributing to the fire in the Amazon, that won't do,"" he said. The actor and environmental activist released a statement saying: ""Although they are certainly worth supporting, we have not funded the organisations that are currently under attack. ""The future of these irreplaceable ecosystems is at stake and I am proud to be part of the groups that protect them."" DiCaprio denied the accusations but said he supported the groups involved He praised ""the people of Brazil working to save their natural and cultural heritage"". WWF also said it had received no donations from the actor, whose Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation focuses on environmental projects. Allow Instagram content?

Mr Bolsonaro's accusation was derided by opponents. Senator Randolfe Rodrigues tweeted: ""How desperate. Our negligent and incompetent president, who is responsible for unprecedented environmental dismantling, blames DiCaprio but not his own administration which is incapable of taking a single step without destroying something."" For several weeks in August, fires burned in parts of the Amazon at a rate not seen in years, sparking international concern over the condition of the ""lungs of the planet"". Amazon fires intensify Andes glacier melt The Amazon is the largest rainforest in the world and a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. This video can not be played How is the rainforest helping limit global warming? In August there were thousands of individual fires, almost three times as many - 30,901 -  as in the same month last year. Mr Bolsonaro deployed the army to the Amazon and the fires eased after August, although campaigners say the government should be doing more to stop them. Forest fires occur during the dry season between July and October. They can be caused by naturally occurring events, like lightning strikes, but this year most are thought to have been started by farmers and loggers clearing land for crops or grazing.

Smoke alarms fail in a third of house fires,"Industry figures suggest that one in 10 households do not have a working smoke alarm, while 22% never test theirs Lifesaving battery-powered smoke alarms failed in more than a third of house fires in England last year, new analysis shows. Firefighters attended more than 7,500 fires in homes with battery-powered alarms in 2018, but 38% failed to alert residents of the danger. Incorrect positioning caused 45% of the failures, while missing or faulty batteries caused 20%. The failure rate has barely changed since 2010,Home Office figures show.,external The Local Government Association (LGA), which analysed the figures, has urged households to test their alarms in the run-up to Christmas. Of 29,586 house fires attended in England between 1 April 2018 and 31 March 2019, 22,475 homes were fitted with a smoke alarm. Battery-powered smoke alarms were found in 7,692 of the homes - but, of these, 2,899 (38%) failed to sound. Mains-powered smoke alarms, by comparison, were less likely to fail, with failures reported in 21% of fires. Industry figures,externalsuggest that one in 10 households do not have a working smoke alarm, while 22% never test theirs. Last year, a property manager wasjailed after after two young boys died in a fire in a rented house with no smoke alarms. Logan Taylor, 3, and his two-year-old brother Jake were both asleep when the fire broke out Three-year-old Logan Taylor and his brother Jake, two, died in the blaze in Fartown, Huddersfield in February 2016. Kamal Bains, of Stableford Gardens, Huddersfield, whose property firm managed the house, admitted health and safety breaches. During sentencing the judge told Bains: ""Your failure to fit smoke alarms was a significant cause of the children's deaths."" The LGA has advised householders to fit more than one smoke detector in their homes, with at least one fitted on the ceiling of every floor. Ian Stephens, chairman of the LGA's Fire Services Management Committee, said smoke alarms are ""proven life-savers"" and urged people to check theirs in the run-up to Christmas. ""With the increased potential fire risk from Christmas trees, decorations, candles and lighting, and people spending more time using heaters, open fires and cooking hot food during the colder winter months, anyone without a smoke alarm should buy and fit one as soon as possible,"" he said. ""They should also check the alarms of less able family members and those on their own - it may save their life."" Test your smoke alarm when the clocks are changed Vacuum it gently using the soft brush attachment to remove dust from the sensors Change the battery at least once a year (unless it's a ten-year alarm) Get a new alarm every 10 years Source:UK Fire Service,external Boys fire deaths 'preventable' Smoke alarm rule to apply to all homes LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Late England wickets put NZ on top,"Dom Sibley averages 12.67 after three innings in Test cricket Second Test, Seddon Park, Hamilton (day two of five): New Zealand 375:Latham 105, Mitchell 73; Broad 4-73 England 39-2 England trail by 336 runs Scorecard England lost two wickets late on day two to leave New Zealand on top in the second Test in Hamilton. New Zealand posted 375 thanks to Tom Latham's 105, debutant Daryl Mitchell's 73 and 55 from BJ Watling, while Stuart Broad took 4-73. Dom Sibley and Joe Denly both made four as England reached 39-2 - trailing by 336 - in the 18 overs possible before the close. New Zealand lead 1-0 in the two-Test series. England spinner Leach taken to hospital TMS podcast: Hamilton Day 2 - Bad start for England Sibley, in his second Test, was hit on the helmet by a Tim Southee bouncer before he was trapped lbw playing across the line to a delivery that would have cannoned into leg stump. Matt Henry dismissed Denly as he induced a thick outside edge, with wicketkeeper Watling taking a good, low catch diving to his right. Rory Burns, dropped on 10 and 19, will resume on 24 and captain Joe Root six not out. Play will start half an hour early at 21:30 GMT for the remainder of the Test, to make up for time lost to rain on Friday. Having won the toss, Root will be hugely disappointed that England were not able to bowl New Zealand out for less. While the bowling was fairly tidy and they restricted the run-rate well for the majority of day two - the Kiwis only added 86 to their overnight 173-3 in the first 44 overs - the tourists went long periods when they rarely threatened. They started excellently as Latham was bowled by Broad leaving the ninth ball of the day. Sam Curran then had Henry Nicholls caught at fine leg hooking seven overs later as England got the early wickets they needed. However, the tourists, who spent 201 overs in the field in the first Test, then went 53 overs - including 36 with the second new ball - without taking a wicket before Broad had Watling caught at gully on the stroke of tea courtesy of a lifter. Broad, who was given two warnings for running on the pitch, had the superb Mitchell caught at fine leg before Southee gloved an excellent Chris Woakes delivery behind. Jofra Archer and Curran finished the innings off as England took the final five wickets for 60 runs. There were times when it looked like England needed a spin option to offer variation, with the decision to leave out a frontline spinner yet to be fully vindicated as the pitch and conditions offered their five-man seam attack little. One positive for England was the fitness of Ben Stokes. The all-rounder struggled with hisleft knee in his two overson day one, but he bowled 11 overs with much more freedom on Saturday. BJ Watling and Daryl Mitchell play their domestic cricket at Seddon Park for Northern Districts After New Zealand's shaky start to the day, Watling and Test debutant Mitchell shared 124 for the sixth wicket. The partnership was built on patience and was again a lesson for an England side looking to adapt the way they bat in Test cricket. All-rounder Mitchell was initially cautious before growing into his maiden Test innings. He played the short ball particularly well during his four-hour stay at the crease. Having grown up in Perth in Australia, 28-year-old Mitchell will be used to handling short-pitched bowling and he played numerous crunching pulls. England kept on feeding the shot despite a lack of pace in their attack and Mitchell's obvious ability off the back foot. The tactic eventually worked, but ultimately it was a poor shot from Mitchell rather than a good piece of bowling that proved his undoing. Fresh off the back of his 205 in the first Test, Watling was again a thorn in England's side. The wicketkeeper played each delivery on its merit, left the short ball well and scored frequently behind square on the off side. It was almost a surprise when he fell, although, in mopping up the tail in quick time, England's bowlers exposed their top order to Southee and Henry. England bowler Stuart Broad on BBC Test Match Special:""We're pretty happy - 375, in England if you win the toss and bowl, you'd be disappointed, but in this part of the world you have to manage your expectations. ""Our opportunity is there in this game. If you're a batsman, you'd fancy your chances tomorrow, getting through that first hour and going on. ""That's our way to win this Test - bat once and go past them. The next three days will be the best time to bat on this pitch and we need to make the most of that."" New Zealand all-rounder Daryl Mitchell:""To be able to put on the black cap was pretty special. You are not human if you are not nervous. It was nice to get some runs. ""Being sent in on this pitch, if you said we would make 370 we would probably have taken it. Getting two poles tonight is a massive bonus. Hopefully we can build some pressure in the morning, maybe get a couple of quick ones and really put some heat on them."" Ex-England batsman Mark Ramprakash:""New Zealand will be very happy. Their bowlers exerted the pressure and asked the England batsmen questions. ""The batsmen are having to cope with the physicality of being tired and lots of overs in the field, and then the mentality to come with their game plan."" England and Middlesex bowler Steven Finn:""The bowlers stuck to their task pretty well. They copped a little bit of criticism in the last Test for chasing the game. ""They were patient and when they needed to change their plans, they did. They may rue a couple of missed opportunities yesterday.""

Three injured in Hague stabbing attack,"This video can not be played Forensics experts check the scene at Grote Marktstraat. The three victims of a stabbing attack on a shopping street in the Dutch city of The Hague on Friday were two girls aged 15 and a boy of 13. None of the victims knew each other and police are still hunting a male suspect, with no clue as yet to motive. The victims have now been released from hospital. Images and videos on social media showed dozens of Black Friday shoppers running away from the scene after the attacker struck at 19:45 (18:45 GMT). The victims have not been named but were described as a 13-year-old boy from The Hague, a 15-year-old girl from Alphen aan den Rijn and another 15-year-old girl from Leiderdorp. The incident happened at the Hudson's Bay store in the city's Grote Marktstraat, or main market square. Police have urged the public to contact them if they witnessed the attack. Officials have also asked anyone with images or footage of the attack to send it to the police. An initial description of the suspect suggested police were looking for a man aged between 45 to 50 wearing a grey tracksuit. In a later update, Hague police said that description was wrong but have given few further details about the incident. They said in a statement: ""We are using all the means at our disposal - both visible and invisible - to find the suspect of this incident as quickly as possible. ""The motive of the suspect is as yet unclear.""

Black Friday protests in France target Amazon,"Activists formed a human chain outside an Amazon depot Activists across France have staged Black Friday protests against Amazon, decrying consumerism and its impact on the environment. Dozens of protesters gathered outside the company's French headquarters in Clichy, north of Paris. Protesters also tried to blockade a shopping centre in Paris and a logistics centre near the eastern city of Lyon. In video from Lyon riot police can be seen dragging activists away. The protests aimed to disrupt Black Friday, a discount shopping day that activists have blamed for environmental damage. In response, Amazon told the BBC it respected the right to protest but disagreed with ""the actions of these individuals"". Amazon hit by Black Friday walkouts and protests 'I feel guilty about how much I return' Amazon boss promises climate-change action Firms make green energy vows as call for action grow Similar protests against Amazon erupted in other European countries, including Germany, where workers from six distribution centres staged a walkout over pay and conditions. The union Verdi, which called the strike, said its members' hard work could not be bought for ""knock-down prices"". Union members at this distribution centre in Werne, Germany went on strike Some French lawmakers want to ban Black Friday because of its environmental impact, and Environment Minister Elisabeth Borne has warned against the ""consumption frenzy"" linked to the event. The shopping day began in the US on the Friday after Thanksgiving but in recent years spread to other countries. Environmentalists have accused Amazon of accelerating climate change through its rapid delivery services, which they say contribute to greenhouse gases emissions. This video can not be played Some of the activists in Clichy scaled a fence overnight Amazon ships around 10 billion packages per year,according to Reuters news agency,external. To mitigate its impact on the climate,the US e-commerce company pledged to go net carbon neutral by 2040by investing in electric delivery vans, among other initiatives. Manon Aubry, a left-wing member of the European parliament, said the protest was intended to ""denounce the social, environmental and fiscal damage from Amazon"". Video from a protest in Lyon showed police in riot helmets dragging away activists Coline Vanhenacker, a spokeswoman for environmental group Friends of the Earth, said Amazon represented ""overproduction, overconsumption and overwaste"". ""Today 25% of French greenhouse gas emissions are linked to textiles and electronics products and Amazon is the leading distributor so we have to put a stop to it,"" she said. The demonstrations, dubbed ""Block Friday"", are aiming to disrupt Amazon's business operations in France and other countries. One of the groups involved in organising the protests, anti-globalisation movement Attac, said it would ""take action across France to disrupt Amazon's business"". Activists hold a banner that reads ""Stop Amazon and its world"" in Nantes France's first protest was held on Thursday, when dozens of activists formed a human chain, lay on hay bales and dumped old fridges and microwaves outside the Amazon depot in Bretigny-sur-Orge. At the protest, about 40km (24 miles) south of Paris, some activists held banners which read: ""Amazon: for the climate, for employment, stop expanding, stop over-production"". More demonstrations took place on Friday, with environmental groups threatening to turn 29 November into a ""Black Day for Amazon"". Demonstrators aimed to disrupt Amazon's business operations across France on Black Friday As of Friday morning, dozens of activists from various groups had gathered outside Amazon France's facilities, including its headquarters in Clichy. They held up a sign saying: ""No to Amazon and its world."" In Lyon, a sit-down protest outside an Amazon distribution centre degenerated into skirmishes between activists and riot police carrying batons and shields. One of the groups involved, Lyon Climat, accused the police of being heavy-handed. Footage posted to social media showed police hauling some activists along the floor. In Paris, around 40 young protesters attempted to block the doorway of a large shopping centre in La DÃ©fense business district of the city. They linked arms to stop people entering the shopping centre and chanted: ""Work, consume and shut up, that is the message given to our youth."" Greenhouse gas concentrations again break records China coal surge threatens Paris climate targets Climate signal links global floods and fires In a statement, Amazon said it respected ""everyone's right to voice their opinions"" but disagrees with the means used by some protesters. It accused Attac of spreading ""false allegations"" and ""pointing the finger at Amazon for political ends"". Amazon said it would continue to serve its customers despite the protests ""Amazon directly employs 9,300 people in France, provides business opportunities for thousands of companies and SMEs in France, and has made ambitious commitments in our 'Climate Pledge' plan to become a net zero carbon company ten years ahead of the Paris Climate Agreement,"" the company told the BBC. ""Any suggestion to the contrary is simply wrong."" Recent polling data carried by the Huffington Post,externaldoes suggest the popularity of Black Friday may be waning in France. A third of people surveyed by YouGov France said they were not planning to take part in this year's sales. A majority of respondents - 57% - said they believed the promotions were false. Some MPs want to, citing concerns over the effects of consumerism on the planet. An ""anti-waste"" bill was amended to include a proposal to prohibit Black Friday by a French legislative committee on Monday. This video can not be played How to reduce your carbon footprint when you fly France's former Environment Minister Delphine Batho tabled the amendment, which will be debated next month in the National Assembly, the lower house of parliament. ""Black Friday celebrates a model of consumption that is anti-ecological and anti-social,"" said MP Mattieu Orphelin, a former member of President Emmanuel Macron's LREM party. A trade union in France has opposed the proposal. So too have conservative MPs, including Republican lawmaker Eric Woerth, who called the debate over the amendment a ""useless row"".

Coldplay beat Robbie Williams to number one,"Chris Martin of Coldplay (left) and Robbie Williams point out their chart positions Coldplay have fended off competition from Robbie Williams to score their eighth consecutive UK number one album. Their new LP, Everyday Life, beat the former Take That singer's new festive collection The Christmas Present. Coldplay scored 81,000 chart sales this week, while Williams sold 67,000. That gives the band the third fastest-selling album of the year, behind Ed Sheeran's No. 6 Collaborations Project and Lewis Capaldi's Divinely Uninspired To A Hellish Extent. All eight of Coldplay's albums - from their 2000 debut Parachutes to now - have topped the album charts. Last week, the UK four-piece told the BBC's Colin Paterson they have put their plans to tour the record on hold, due to concerns over the environmental impact of big concerts. Instead of spending months on the road, they played two gigs in Jordan, which were broadcast for free to a global audienceon YouTube.,external Coldplay pause touring over environmental concerns Rod Stewart's orchestral new album, You're In My Heart, rounds off an all-new top three. On the singles chart, Dance Monkey by Australian singer Tones and I spends a ninth week at the top, meaning she now boasts the longest-running number one track of 2019, overtaking Ed Sheeran and Justin Bieber's I Don't Care.

Tones and I also has the third longest-running number one track ever by a female artist in the UK - just behind Rihanna's Umbrella and Whitney Houston's I Will Always Love You, which are both on 10 weeks. Robbie Williams does claim a curious new chart feat by achieving the fastest-selling cassette release in almost two decades, shifting nearly 10,000 copies on tape in the last seven days. The last album to sell more cassettes in a single week was Now 52 - featuring such tracks as Just a Little by Liberty X and George Michael's Freeek! back in 2002. The 45-year-old's seasonally-themed record features guest appearances from the aforementioned Stewart, Jamie Cullum, Helene Fischer, Bryan Adams and boxer Tyson Fury. Williams remains one of the bookies' favourites to snag this year's UK Christmas number one single, up against the likes of Lewis Capaldi, Stormzy, Little Mix, James Blunt and whoever wins The X Factor. Michael Ball and Alfie Boe - who are back together for a third album - are an outside bet for this year's Christmas number one.

LiveLiveInvestigations continue after London Bridge attack2 minutes ago2 minutes ago Recap: What happened at London Bridge yesterday?Recap: What happened at London Bridge yesterday?9 hours ago What happened at London Bridge today?What happened at London Bridge today?Live Investigations continue after London Bridge attack  2 minutes ago,"One of the victims of Friday's attack is named as Jack Merritt, a Cambridge graduate The condition of one of the victims in hospital has improved from critical to stable A woman was also killed. Two further injured people remain in hospital Usman Khan, 28, who carried out the attack, was a former prisoner convicted of terrorism offences He was out on licence and wearing a tag. He was shot dead by police after people restrained him Visiting the scene with London's mayor and the head of the Met Police, the PM says automatic early release from jail is not working Police have been searching properties in Staffordshire Friday's attack began during a conference at Fishmongers' Hall, near Monument, at 13:58 GMT Mary O'Connor, Claire Heald, Harriet Agerholm, Katie Wright and Thomas Mackintosh The London Bridge area has remained cordoned off throughout the day as forensic officers continue to carry out checks following Friday's events. Here is what has happened this afternoon and this evening:  We're going to bring our coverage of live events to an end now but ournews storywill continue to be updated with the latest developments. London Bridge attack victim Jack Merritt has been described by his father as ""a beautiful spirit who always took the side of the underdog."" A law and criminology graduate, Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for the University of Cambridge's prison rehabilitation programme. The project, Learning Together, gives students and inmates the opportunity to study together, to help reduce re-offending - something Mr Merritt had a ""deep commitment to"", according to people who worked with him. A vigil was held in Cambridge, where Mr Merritt was from, on Saturday. His friends, family and those who worked with him have been paying tribute. You can read more about the tributes made to Mr Merritt here. Usman Khan is quoted further in one of Learning Together's newsletters in which he says the group ""has a special place in his heart"". He added: ""It is more than just an organisation, helping to provide learning of individual academic subjects. ""For me itâs main benefit is bringing people together, through the means of learning. Learning Together is about opening minds, unlocking doors, and giving voice to those who are shut down, hidden from the rest of us. ""It helps to include those who are generally excluded. This is what Learning Together means to me. ""I typed these reflections on the Chromebook I received and I am truly grateful to be able to express myself through it. ""I cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those who continue to support this wonderful community."" Usman Khan, the London Bridge
attacker, appeared as a âcase studyâ in a report by the education initiative
whose event he later attacked. The recently published report
focused on the work done by Learning Together providing education and help for
prisoners at HMP Whitemoor in Cambridgeshire. Khan was imprisoned there
before his release on license in December last year. Identified only as ""Usman"",
Khan was said â since leaving prison â to have given a speech at a fundraising
dinner, applied for a course, and been given a âsecureâ laptop that complied
with his licence conditions. The computer was said to have
been provided in conjunction with police and probation, allowing Khan to
continue the writing and studying he began while in jail. Khan contributed a poem to a
separate brochure, in which he expressed gratitude for the laptop, stating: âI
cannot send enough thanks to the entire Learning Together team and all those
who continue to support this wonderful community.â BBC News Channel A leading criminal barrister has claimed the probation service ""has been destroyed"" in recent years. Mark Fenhalls QC, the former chair of the Criminal Bar Association, has said that those in the criminal justice system ""are unimpressed"" with politicians who talk about the rights and wrongs over the last few years. He told the BBC News Channel: ""The problem is what happens afterwards, in the prisons when they are not rehabilitated and when they are released if there is not a system in place to properly look after them and protect the rest of us."" Mr Fenhalls said the London Bridge attacker Usman Khan ""appears to have been released according to law and obeying his licencing conditions"". He added: ""Over the last ten or 15 years parliament continuously changes laws and ramps up sentences in every regard, but what it does not do is put money into the system to make sure that people who have have committed offences are rehabilitated."" BBC News Channel Labour's Yvette Cooper says there will need to be a ""serious and full"" investigation into how the incident at London Bridge happened, given that the attacker, Usman Khan, had previously been jailed for terrorism offences. Khan, who was shot dead by police during Friday's attack, was released from prison on licence in December 2018. The former minister tells the BBC: ""I think there are also some immediate questions that will need to be asked, particularly because we know there may be other people in the same situation as this attacker and it's really important that the government is taking every action to keep people safe."" A key question, she adds, is about what the level of risk assessment and safety assessment is for anyone coming to the end of their sentence. Earlier, Ms Cooper clashed with Home Secretary Priti Patel over Usman Khan's prison release. You can read about thathere. People have been paying tribute to Jack Merritt, the University of Cambridge graduate who was named as one of the victims of the attack. Mr Merritt, who ran a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, had been helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. Audrey Ludwig, who knew Mr Merritt through work,tweeted,externalthat his ""deep commitment to prisoner education and rehabilitation was deeply impressive"". ""I send condolences to his family, colleagues and the prisoners' group."" Another friend said Mr Merritt was ""incredibly witty and intelligent, with more lust for life than many our age and a determination to make his mark in the world"". Allow Twitter content?

Usman Khan asked for specialist help to be deradicalised whilst in prison, but did not receive it, his solicitor has said. Vajahat Sharif, head of terrorism, national security and political crimes at Tuckers solicitors, told the BBC, Khan had recognised his underlying ideology was ""wrong and flawed"" and wanted to ""correct"" himself. But Mr Sharif claims that when Khan wrote to a ""credible"" specialist intervention provider for help, ""the powers that be were unable to
provide that assistance while he was in custody"". He says:âFrom my perspective, that seemed wrong, because while the
offender is in custody and is looking back at his offending behaviour and
recognising that itâs wrong, thatâs the ideal time to engage and correct his
thinking."" Rapper Dave has paid tribute to Jack Merritt - one of two people killed in the attack - describing him as ""the best guy"". Mr Merritt, a University of Cambridge graduate, was a course coordinator for a prisoners' rehabilitation programme called Learning Together. The Streatham-born rapper tweeted that the news of Mr Merritt's death was ""one of the most painful things"", saying Mr Merritt had ""dedicated his life to helping others"". He added that it was ""genuinely an honour to have met someone like you"" and he would ""never ever forget"" everything that Mr Merritt had ""done for us"". Dave won the Mercury Prize for his debut album in September, dedicating the award to his brother, Christopher Omoregie, who is serving a life sentence for murder. The rapper's album, Psychodrama, was inspired by the therapy Christopher is receiving in prison, in which offenders role-play events from their past to help with rehabilitation.

Jack Merritt, named today as having been killed in the attack, studied for a bachelor's degree in law at the
University of Manchester. Graduating in 2016, the 25-year-old went on to
study at the University of Cambridge. There, he worked in the criminology
department running Learning Together, the prison rehabilitation programme which terrorist Usman Khan had been involved with. Former programme participants, including Khan,
had been invited to take part in a conference to mark the programme's fifth
anniversary at Fishmongers' Hall. A
vigil was held in Cambridge on Saturday to mark the incident. As we mentioned earlier, Jack Merritt - who has been named as one of the victims of the attack - appeared on a BBC podcast in March talking about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law. The University of Cambridge graduate was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme. He told the BBC's Law in Action: ""Our students in prison often have a very first-hand, very real but also very nuanced, idea of how the law works and also they have a very good sense of where there is a lack in information, where there is a lack in knowledge, and they really do know which areas of the law could do with clarification. ""And a lot of the time these are areas that they have seen people go through the prison system not understanding and they want to do research which will help people."" You can listen to himhere(he features at 18:05). People will see ""enhanced police patrols across London of both armed and unarmed officers"", Mr Basu says. He urges members of the public to continue with their plans as usual, and to be ""vigilant but be alert, not alarmed"". He offers his ""heartfelt thoughts
and condolences to all those families, both deceased and who still remain in
hospital, and everyone affected by this tragedy"". You can find Mr Basu's full statementhere,external. Turning to updates on the attacker, Mr Basu says police believe Khan was wearing the hoax explosive vest while attending the prisoner rehabilitation conference at Fishmongers' Hall. He said: ""We know this attacker was attending an event called Learning Together and some of those present confronted this attacker to try and stop him."" Responding to a question from a reporter, Mr Basu adds ""From start to finish this incident took very few minutes and yes, we believe he was wearing the vest at the time."" Mr Basu says he knows one of the victims has been named online and in the media -as Cambridge university graduate Jack Merritt- but that the Met is still awaiting formal identification from the coroner. This video can not be played Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response The head of the Metropolitan Police, Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Met Commissioner Cressida Dick praises public response to London terror attack. Mr Basu said the public has shared ""nearly 500 images and videos with the investigation team so far, and I am incredibly grateful"". He continued to appeal to anyone who was at Fishmongers' Hall, where the attack began, on Friday to contact the police. The Met has said people can contact them in confidence on 0800 789 321. Usman Khan was subject to an ""extensive list of licence conditions"" on his release from prison, Mr Basu says, and ""to the best of my knowledge he was complying with those conditions"".  Earlier, University of Cambridge graduate Jack Merritt was named
as one of the victims of Friday's London Bridge attack. Mr Merrittâs father David described his son as âa beautiful
spirit who always took the side of the underdogâ. In a now-deleted Twitter post,reported by the Telegraph,,externalhe
wrote: âMy son, Jack, who was killed in this attack, would not wish his death
to be used as the pretext for more draconian sentences or for detaining people
unnecessarily. âJack spoke so highly of all the people he worked with and he
loved his job.â Mr Merritt was a course coordinator for Learning Together, a prisoners' rehabilitation programme, and earlier this year he spoke on a BBC podcast about his work helping inmates at Warren Hill prison in Suffolk to study law.

"Clutha pilot ""trusted implicitly"" by his crew","PC Kirsty Nelis, Capt David Traill and PC Tony Collins were killed in the Clutha helicopter crash Two police officers killed in the Clutha helicopter crash ""trusted implicitly"" the pilot blamed for their deaths, according to their families. PCs Tony Collins and Kirsty Nelis were on the aircraft when it crashed into the Glasgow pub on 29 November 2013. A sheriff ruled that the crash happened becausepilot David Traill ""took a chance"" and ignored fuel warnings. Mark Nelis, the widower of PC Nelis, said the ruling had not changed his opinion of Captain Traill. He said the sheriff's findings were ""very disappointing"" and he called for a fresh independent report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB). The tragedy claimed the lives of Captain Traill, 51, PC Collins, 43, PC Nelis, 36, and seven customers who were in the Clutha Vaults pub. Clutha crash pilot's reputation 'sullied' by inquiry Clutha crash inquiry: The key questions Clutha: What we know about the final flight Following a fatal accident inquiry earlier this year, Sheriff Principal Craig Turnbull found that Capt Traill ignored five fuel warnings he received during the flight. He said it was a ""conscious decision"" that had ""fatal consequences"" for the 10 people who died. However, in a statement following the sixth anniversary of the crash, Mr Nelis and PC Collin's widow, Lucy, paid tribute to Capt Trail. Ms Collins said her husband, a police observer, trusted the pilot and regarded him as a ""diligent and skilled professional"". The conclusion of the FAI ""has not changed mine or my family's confidence and faith in him"", Mr Nelis added. Ten people were killed in the tragedy on 29 November 2013 He said he found the conclusion of the sheriff ""surprising"" afterevidence was heard about problem fuel readings on the helicopter prior to the crash. Mr Nelis went on to say that the AAIB should provide a ""fresh independent report"" and release all forms of their report as it developed. ""The first draft report issued by the AAIB was sent to interested parties, including the helicopter owners and manufacturers, prior to its publication,"" he said. ""The report was finally released over four months late and had been amended on a number of key points. We have not been made aware of why it was changed or what contributions were made to it. ""We, as a family, have been left with a sense of frustration by the outcome of this inquiry, in particular with the AAIB report and with the Sheriff Principal's determination and criticism of the pilot."" The AAIB said it stood by itsfinal report,external. Gary Arthur, 48; Joe Cusker, 59; Colin Gibson, 33; Robert Jenkins, 61; John McGarrigle, 58; Samuel McGhee, 56; and Mark O'Prey, 44, all Clutha customers, also died when the helicopter hit the pub. Another 31 people were injured. (Top: L to R) David Traill, PC Kirsty Nelis, PC Tony Collins, Gary Arthur, Samuel McGhee (Bottom: L to R) Colin Gibson, Robert Jenkins, Mark O'Prey, John McGarrigle, Joe Cusker Ms Collins said she did not want to take part in the FAI as she would have found it ""extremely distressing"" but she wanted to highlight her husband's trust in his pilot. ""He trusted Dave implicitly as the hugely experienced and skilled pilot he was,"" she said. ""I feel this important information that Tony would have wanted me to share."" Earlier this month Capt Trail's fiancee, Dr Lucy Thomas, describedthe sheriff's findings as ""distressing and incomprehensible"". She said the manufacturer's maintenance manual incorrectly said there was a three to four-minute flameout time before the helicopter would lose both engines, but in reality he only had 32 seconds to make decisions and respond to the issue. ""That 32 seconds ended in tragedy and the loss of his and nine other valuable lives,"" she added. Dr Thomas said the determination did ""no justice to the memories"" of the nine other people killed in the crash or to the ""memory and reputation of Dave Traill"". ""It insults the intelligence of those who know of the evidence presented at the inquiry and are aware of the content of the initial AAIB report,"" she said. This video can not be played New footage from the Crown Office shows the aftermath of the helicopter crash They are not the first families to raise concerns about the findings of the FAI. Speaking shortly after the FAI determination was published, Ian O'Prey, who lost his son Mark in the tragedy, said he was ""really angry"" and that Capt Trail had been made a ""fall guy"". The Clutha's owner, Alan Crossan, also expressed ""shock and disappointment"" at the report and how ""brutal"" it had been towards Capt Traill. Inhis findings,external, Mr Turnbull said there was ""no doubt"" that the crash had happened because the helicopter's engines ""flamed out"" due to a lack of fuel. The fuel supply tanks had been depleted because Capt Traill had failed to ensure that at least one of the aircraft's fuel transfer pump switches was on. ""The central question for the inquiry is why did that happen?"" Sheriff Turnbull said. ""The answer is a simple one. Capt Traill ignored the low fuel warnings he received."" A spokeswoman for the Judicial Office for Scotland said the court paid ""careful regard"" to all the material placed before the Fatal Accident Inquiry and that itsfindings were available to read in full,externalon the Scottish Courts website.
