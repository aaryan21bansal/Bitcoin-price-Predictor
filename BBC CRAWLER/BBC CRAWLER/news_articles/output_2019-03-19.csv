May to ask EU for Brexit date delay,"Prime Minister Theresa May is writing to the EU to formally ask for Brexit to be postponed. One ministerial source told the BBC the longer delay could be up to two years, amid reports of a cabinet row, but No 10 said no decision had been made. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU would not grant a delay without a ""concrete plan"" from the UK about what they would do with it. Under current law the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal in nine days. MPs rejected the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the EU for a second time last week by 149 votes. They also voted in favour of ruling out leaving the EU without a deal, andin favour of extending the Brexit process. The prime minister had hoped to have another try at getting MPs to back the deal this week - but Speaker John Bercow effectively torpedoed that with hissurprise interventionon Monday. Kuenssberg: Cabinet split on Brexit delay Brexitcast: The last days of Rome Merkel to fight for 'orderly Brexit' Brexit: A really simple guide She still hopes to ultimately get it in front of MPs for a third go, but says even if that happens and they vote in favour of it, the UK will need a short extension to get the necessary legislation through Parliament. A cabinet source told the BBC she therefore plans to ask the EU to agree to postpone the UK's departure until 30 June, but with an option of a longer delay as well. Mrs May has warned Brexiteer Tories that a longer extension will be needed if her deal does not get through Parliament. This video can not be played Will the UK leave the EU on time? One ministerial sourcetold the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg,externalthere was ""no agreement"" around the cabinet table when a delay was discussed. Another cabinet source said they were frustrated that the PM had not been clear about which delay option she would be arguing for. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom is said to have criticised colleagues, saying they now amounted to a ""Remain cabinet"", not a ""Brexit cabinet"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said ministers all wanted the ""shortest possible delay"" but cabinet members ""have different approaches to how we should do this"". Any delay will have to be agreed by all 27 EU member states and Mrs May is heading to Brussels on Thursday to discuss the options with fellow leaders. The PM is writing to the EU to ask for Brexit to be postponed Mrs May will travel to an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the delay options All 27 EU members have to agree to any extension proposed If an extension is agreed, Mrs May will probably try to get her deal - that was previously heavily defeated - through Parliament MPs and peers will also get a vote on any delay Talks have been continuing with the DUP and Tory Brexiteers who voted against the deal The government could seek to hold a third ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement next week But the speaker has said he will not let MPs vote again if the question is exactly the same The UK leaves the EU on 29 March with or without a deal, unless a delay is agreed Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who campaigned to remain in the EU, told BBC Newsnight that the question of whether to have another referendum was ""for a later time"". Although leaving without a deal was still the default position, Mr Blair said a no-deal Brexit ""won't happen"", adding that the challenge now was making any extension to Article 50 count. Mr Blair called for a delay of between nine months and a year to ""allow Parliament to reach a conclusive opinion on the central Brexit question - soft or hard?"" On Monday, the Speaker said he would not allow a third ""meaningful vote"" in the coming days on ""substantially the same"" motion as MPs rejected last week. What Bercow ruling means for Brexit Who is the Speaker and why does he shout order? Brexit: What could happen next? How could Article 50 be extended? Mr Bercow declined to discuss the reasons for his decision when questioned by the BBC, as he made his way in to Parliament the following day. This video can not be played Commons Speaker John Bercow is questioned on Brexit vote decision Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay suggested a third vote on the Brexit deal could take place next week - after Mrs May has sought a delay. On Mr Bercow's ruling, he said it was important to ""respect the referee"" and abide by his decisions - but, he added, the Speaker himself had said in the past that if Parliament was guided only by precedent then ""nothing ever would change"". Mr Barclay suggested that MPs would ""find a way"" to get another vote, if the government manages to persuade enough of them, including the 10 Democratic Unionists, to change their mind and back the deal. At a news conference in Brussels, Mr Barnier said it was up to the 27 EU leaders to decide whether to grant a delay, based on what was in the ""best interest"" of the bloc. But for a longer delay ""there needs to be a new event"" or a ""new political process"" - so that ""we are not back in the same situation as today"". ""Extending the uncertainty without a clear plan would add to the economic cost for our business but will also incur a political cost for the EU,"" said Mr Barnier. ""It is for the British government and Parliament to decide very quickly what the UK wants to do next."" Mr Barnier also warned that UK MPs voting against ""no deal"" would not prevent it from happening, saying that ""everyone should now finalise all preparations for a no-deal scenario"". BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the EU had ""little trust"" in the prime minister, with some leaders wanting to see proof from Parliament that MPs would support a longer delay before the EU signed up to it. She said there was ""irritation"" that those at Westminster appeared to be ""inward-looking"" and were not taking into account the cost of a delay to the EU. And she said the EU's final decision on a delay may not be given this week, with talk of an emergency summit on 28 March. Angela Merkel: I will fight to the last hour of the deadline Earlier,German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would struggleuntil the last possible moment to achieve ""an orderly Brexit"", saying the interests of Germany, Britain and the EU were at stake. Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar and European Council president Donald Tusk released a joint statement after their meeting in Dublin. ""They agreed that we must now see what proposals emerge from London in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday,"" it said. The Labour leader has been holding talks with other opposition parties Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Speaker's intervention showed Mr Bercow was ""ensuring Parliament is taken seriously"". He said he had spoken to Conservative and Labour MPs about a so-called Norway-Plus style of future relationship with the EU - a closer one than Mrs May's deal would bring about - calling it an ""interesting idea"" which had not got his ""complete support"". When asked about another referendum, he said: ""The issue has to be put to the people after Parliament has made some kind of decision."" He said a public vote had to be on a range of options, saying: ""It cannot just be on Theresa May's deal or Remain - there has to be some choice for the people."" Mr Corbyn also held ""constructive"" talks with the Westminster leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party about the potential to unite around a closer future relationship with the EU, a Labour spokesman said. Reality Check: What is the Norway model? What happened with Brexit last week? But Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, suggested the Labour leader had not really engaged during the meeting with the case for giving the public the final say on Brexit. ""We were there to talk about a People's Vote and the only thing I felt he was comfortable talking about was Labour's version of Brexit,"" she said.

First funerals for NZ shooting victims,"The burials have been delayed because of the identification process A father and son from Syria have been buried in New Zealand, the first funerals for the 50 victims of last week's mosque shootings. Khaled Mustafa, 44, and Hamza, 16, came as refugees to New Zealand last year. Six burials took place on Wednesday. Police hope they will soon be able to release the bodies of all those killed in the two Christchurch mosques. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Islamic tradition calls for bodies to be buried as soon as possible, but the funerals have been delayed by the scale of the identification process. NZ PM vows never to say gunman's name Christchurch and the new threat of far-right violence Students perform Haka for attack victims Zaid Mustafa attended the funeral of his father and brother in a wheelchair Hundreds of mourners gathered at a cemetery near the Linwood Islamic Centre in Christchurch on Wednesday, one of two places of worship targeted in last Friday's attacks. The two victims buried were killed at the Al-Noor mosque. Khaled leaves behind a wife and a younger teenage son, who was injured in the attack. Zaid Mustafa attended the funeral in a wheelchair. ""I shouldn't be standing in front of you. I should be lying beside you,"" Zaid Mustafa said, according to bystanders cited by AFP. Fifty people lost their lives in the shootings at two mosques in the city. The child, the father, the aspiring footballer 'This mosque was precious to us': A city in shock 'I lost a best friend' Police on Wednesday named six of the victims of the shootings and said all post-mortem examinations were complete. Yet some families expressed frustration with the delayed identification process. Police Commissioner Mike Bush said authorities had to prove the cause of death so that the courts could treat it as murder. ""You cannot convict for murder without that cause of death,"" he said. ""So this is a very comprehensive process that must be completed to the highest standard."" This video can not be played A comic is asking searching questions about race relations in the wake of the attack Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said there would be two minutes of silence on Friday, which is the Muslim day of prayer and will mark one week since the shooting. The Islamic call to prayer will also be broadcast on national TV and radio on Friday. The rites vary between regions, but one common feature is that the deceased must not be cremated - and must be buried as soon as possible after death, usually within 24 hours. However, community leaders say that if a person has not died from natural causes, a delay is acceptable. Other rites performed as soon as possible after death - often within hours - include washing the body, and wrapping it in cloth. Men's bodies are washed by men, and women's by women. ""We treat the body as if it is still alive,"" Rehanna Ali, of the Federation of Islamic Associations of New Zealand, told a press conference. ""We cleanse it as we would before we were about to pray. Because we believe that the soul in this body is about to undertake a journey to God, and this is a form of worship."" The body is shrouded in a simple white, unsewn cloth to symbolise that the person is leaving behind all material goods. Muslim funerals do not usually involve a service or eulogy. Before the burial, formal prayers are said for the forgiveness of the dead. Coffins are not used, and pallbearers rarely feature. Once at the cemetery, the body is shouldered by members of the Muslim community, and laid by the graveside. Family members will lower the deceased into the ground, with his or her head facing towards Mecca. Jacinda Ardern received a hug from a student when she visited Cashmere High School On Wednesday, Ms Ardern visited Cashmere High School, which lost pupils Sayyad Milne and Hamza Mustafa, and former student Tariq Omar, in the attack. She asked students to help her rid New Zealand of racism and reiterated her call ""never to mention the perpetrator's name... never remember him for what he did"". Following an appeal by Ms Ardern, some New Zealanders have begun handing in weapons. John Hart, a farmer in the North Island district of Masterton, posted on Twitter that he had given his semi-automatic rifle to police to be destroyed. Allow Twitter content?

Cyclone Idai triggers 'massive disaster',"This video can not be played Cyclone Idai: Survivors rescued by land and air Cyclone Idai has triggered a ""massive disaster"" in southern Africa affecting hundreds of thousands if not millions of people, the UN has said. The region has been hit by widespread flooding and devastation affecting Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi called it ""a humanitarian disaster of great proportion"". He said more than 1,000 people may have been killed after the cyclone hit the country last week. Idai made landfall near the port city of Beira in Sofala province on Thursday with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph). ""This is shaping up to be one of the worst weather-related disasters ever to hit the southern hemisphere,"" Clare Nullis, from the UN's weather agency, told the BBC on Tuesday.

An aerial survey of the province showed that a 50km (30 mile) stretch of land was under water after the Buzi river burst its banks, charity Save The Children said. The governor of neighbouring Manica province, Manuel Rodrigues, says there is an urgent need to rescue people still trapped, the BBC's Jose Tembe reports from the capital, Maputo.

""We can only imagine that they had been there for more than two or three days, without food and without clean drinking water."" Mozambique's government says 100,000 people need to be rescued from Beira Nelson Moda was in Beira in Mozambique when the storm hit. He told his story to the BBC OS radio programme: It was my son's birthday on 14 March and we were all at home. In the morning this strong storm started and it was moving the city, the trees, and the houses. It was like a war. It was horrific. The children were crying and we were hiding in the bathroom. I could see people dying and the house where I live has been destroyed. There are children who now have no father, no mother, and no home. I saw the city where I grew up being destroyed with my naked eyes. In Beira, there are no basic services and people don't know what they're going to eat or where they're going to sleep. I haven't been able to sleep since that night. In Zimbabwe, the government says 98 people have been killed and more than 200 are missing. President Emmerson Mnangagwa said that the government was conducting rescue missions and delivering food. In the south-eastern town of Chimanimani residents told harrowing stories of how they lost their relatives when the storm hit. Some rescuers said homes and even bodies were washed away, the BBC's Shingai Nyoka reports. Timber company workers were stranded after a road was damaged in Chimanimani, eastern Zimbabwe Floods of up to six metres deep had caused ""incredible devastation"" over a huge area in Mozambique, World Food Programme regional chief Lola Castro said.

Google reveals gaming platform Stadia,"The Stadia controller comes with a YouTube sharing button and another for Google Assistant. Google has unveiled a new digital gaming platform called Stadia which will stream better-than-console-quality games that have traditionally had to be either downloaded or purchased on disc. At launch it will work on existing desktops, laptops, TVs and phones, said the firm's Phil Harrison. Google also revealed a controller. It looks like a traditional console gamepad but the Stadia version has a button for capturing and sharing gaming directly to YouTube. It was also announced that id Software's major title Doom Eternal will be one of the first games available. No pricing was revealed at the event in San Francisco but the firm did say Stadia would launch in 2019 in the US, UK, Canada and Europe. Google experimented with streaming data-rich games in 2018 with Project Stream, when the tech giant made the Ubisoft game Assassin's Creed: Odyssey available to play to trial participants via the Chrome web browser. This video can not be played WATCH: Google's Phil Harrison on whether people will need to pay for high-speed internet in order to make the most of Stadia. This is possible because the games run elsewhere, on Google's own high-end hardware, but users connect to the game with their device via the web. ""We learned that we could bring a triple-A game to any device with a Chrome browser and an internet connection,"" said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, referring to big-budget titles. However, many streaming services to date have suffered due to the difficulty of offering high-end games via an internet connection. Gamers have complained of issues with ""lag"" - the delay between a player performing an action, and the game reacting to that move. In games where split-second reactions are a matter of winning or losing, high latency rates infuriates players. In an attempt to avoid this, Google said its Stadia controller would connect directly to the internet, communicating with Google's servers independently from the other hardware. id Software's demon-slayer title Doom Eternal will be among the first games on Stadia. The company has promised the service will offer games at 4K resolution, at 60 frames per second (fps) - and up to 8K, 120 fps in future. Today's most advanced consoles, the Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 Pro, can support 4K and 60 fps simultaneously, but only on a limited number of games. Google is hoping to leverage its success with YouTube, which is incredibly popular among gamers sharing their skills, to make its own gaming platform a success. ""Hundreds of millions of people watch gaming content on YouTube every single day. Our vision is to bring those worlds closer together,"" said Phil Harrison, Google's newly-hired head of gaming. During an on-stage demonstration, Mr Harrison demonstrated how someone viewing a video on YouTube could press a ""play on Stadia"" button and begin playing the title within seconds. Assassin's Creed:Odyssey was streamed during Google's initial Project Stream experiment Randolph Ramsay, editor in chief of gaming news site GameSpot, said the announcement was exciting news for gamers. ""It's been a long time since a brand-new platform came along that could challenge the major players like Microsoft and Sony,"" he told the BBC. Mr Ramsay added that Google would now have to prove that  lag and latency could be a thing of the past on Stadia. Some developers also expressed caution. ""Stadia looks very ambitious, but how much is the controller, how much is the service, what games do we get, how will ownership work, and how much does it cost to develop, publish and run games on Stadia?"" tweeted Dr Serkan Koto, from Tokyo-based games industry consultancy firm Kantan Games.

Waterfall death tourists 'not warned',"Sisters Izzy Squire (l) and Beth Anderson died in 2016 Three UK tourists in Vietnam who plunged 50ft (15m) over a waterfall to their deaths were not properly warned of the dangers, a coroner has ruled. Sisters Izzy Squire, 19, and Beth Anderson, 24, of Sheffield, died along with friend Christian Sloan, 24, of Kent, at Datanla in February 2016. They had slid down a natural water slide into a pool where they were meant to climb out. But the coroner ruled the local guide had not adequately explained this. The families said the deaths were ""wholly preventable"". The coroner, Chris Dorries, heard how the three friends had worn life jackets and helmets as they slid head first down the water slide before ending up in a 6ft deep pool. More stories across South Yorkshire here But, instead of getting out, the trio continued into the next tier of the river complex and died when they went over the waterfall. The inquest heard how their guide, Dang Van Si, said he warned them about how to get out of the pool safely. However, a range of witnesses, who were found through a Facebook appeal by Mr Sloan's family, contradicted this. Hunt saboteurs' car 'rammed' by 4x4 Knife crime a 'national crisis' - victim's sisters Cadbury pulls 'stupid' treasure hunt ad On Tuesday, Mr Dorries said he did not accept the guide's account and ruled that he had either not given a warning at all or not ensured it was properly understood. Speaking after the inquest the father of Ms Squire and Ms Anderson, David Squire, said he did not know how the criminal investigation into the deaths was progressing in Vietnam. Mr Squire said: ""To be clear, the events and circumstances that led to their deaths were wholly preventable."" The women died alongside Christian Sloan, from Deal, Kent Giving a narrative conclusion, Mr Dorries said: ""They were not adequately warned of the risks to be found at the bottom of the slide and, in particular, that there was a potentially lethal hazard of a further waterfall which they could be swept in from only 14 metres further on.""

More schools drop LGBT rights classes,"This video can not be played LGBT classes protester: I am not homophobic Four more schools in Birmingham have stopped teaching about LGBT rights following complaints by parents. Leigh Trust said it was suspending the No Outsiders programme until an agreement with parents was reached. Earlier this month the city's Parkfield Community School suspended the lessons after protests were held. Campaigner Amir Ahmed said some Muslims felt ""victimised"" but an LGBT group leader said No Outsiders helped pupils understand it is OK to be different. In a letter seen by the BBC, Leigh Trust said it was halting the lessons until after Ramadan, which finishes in June. The schools involved are Leigh Primary School, Alston Primary School, Marlborough Junior and Infants School and Wyndcliff Primary School. Leigh Trust - which is yet to comment publicly - said it wanted to discuss the programme with parents to find ""a positive way"" of teaching about the Equalities Act. Some parents at Parkfield, and the other four schools, claim the classes are inappropriate for young children and the schools' LGBT message contradicts Islam. The No Outsiders project was created and piloted at Parkfield in 2014 by assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat, who was made an MBE for services to equality and diversity in education in 2017. Ofsted has deemed the lessons as ""age-appropriate"". Mr Ahmed, one of the leaders of the Parkfield protests, said he had seen a presentation about the programme that was to be shown to the government as part of the school's Prevent strategy - which is aimed at reducing radicalisation. A series of protests were held outside Parkfield school's gates ""I think that's outrageous,"" he said. ""It's quite disgusting that the school has presented our children as potential radicals."" A spokesperson for Parkfield Community School said: ""The powerpoint was written four years ago in line with Prevent duty at that time. ""No Outsiders is all about tolerance, accepting difference and respect, which are all key aspects of community cohesion and our fundamental British values."" School's LGBT lessons 'are appropriate' Teachers' fears over Prevent anti-terror programme Latest news from the West Midlands Mr Ahmed said his community was ""respectful and tolerant"" of British values but now felt victimised. He claimed parents who had protested were ""effectively seen as homophobes in the wider community"". ""Fundamentally the issue we have with No Outsiders is that it is changing our children's moral position on family values on sexuality and we are a traditional community. ""Morally we do not accept homosexuality as a valid sexual relationship to have. It's not about being homophobic... that's like saying, if you don't believe in Islam, you're Islamophobic."" But Khakan Qureshi, a gay Muslim activist who runs Birmingham South Asian LGBT and was invited to visit Parkfield School last week, said he supported the need for the lessons. This video can not be played LGBT group reacts to protests at Parkfield school ""Myself and many others knew from a young age that we were different and we wish we had this sort of education,"" he said. He feels the Muslim community as a whole is not homophobic, but believes a minority within the protesters are ""agitating"". ""The attitudes of the protesters towards the No Outsiders programme is completely homophobic,"" he said. ""No matter how they package it, it still comes across as homophobic."" He said given the existing legislation to stop discrimination, ""I don't understand why certain communities here in the UK are not adhering to those laws"".

Former Staples chain in administration,"The former Staples stationery chain, Office Outlet, is in administration, putting 1,200 jobs at risk. The retailer has no connection to the online-only business which trades under the Staples UK name. Two partners at business services firm Deloitte were appointed joint administrators on Monday. Office Outlet, which is part-owned by Hilco, the former HMV owner, has 90 UK stores, which will continue to trade while a buyer is sought. The administrators said the chain had suffered as demand for stationery supplies had continued to fall and its suppliers cut the credit terms on which it trades. Office Outlet chief executive Chris Yates led a management buyout of the company last September, leaving Hilco as a minority owner. ""Over the last two years the business has been transformed from the heavily loss-making old Staples business to a near break even modern multichannel retailer,"" Mr Yates said. ""However, additional growth capital was required to continue delivery of the next stage of the management buyout business plan. Despite being highly impressed by the Office Outlet story potential investors have held back due to retail sector sentiment and the general level of uncertainty."" Joint administrator Richard Hawes said: ""The company has recently experienced a reduction in credit from key suppliers, given the economic outlook which has severely impacted the financial position of the company."" But he went on to say he was hopeful that a buyer could be found and that the business would carry on trading ""with that in mind"". Office Outlet ran into difficulty last August, when it arranged to close a number of stores under a form of insolvency called a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA). Hilco bought the UK stores of US-chain Staples in 2016, renaming it Office Outlet.

Woman nearly dies after fruit injection,"The woman was admitted to intensive care for five days A woman in China almost died after injecting herself with liquidised fruit in a bid to be healthy. The 51-year-old suffered liver, kidney, heart and lung damage and was put into intensive care for five days. There were over 20 kinds of fruit in the intravenous injection, an employee at the Affiliated Hospital of Xiangnan University in Hunan told the BBC. Social media users in China claim the case highlights the need for basic medical knowledge. After injecting herself with the mixture, the woman had itchy skin and a rising temperature. She was admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital on 22 February, before being transferred to a general ward and later discharged.

How could Brexit delay happen?,"The European Union (EU) has accepted the UK's request for a Brexit delay until 31 January 2020, with an option to leave sooner if a deal is approved by Parliament. Delaying the UK's exit date requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty that sets out what happens when a country decides it wants to leave the EU. Article 50 allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on the terms of exiting. It was triggered by then Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017, giving an exit date of 29 March 2019. But this date was extended twice, first to 12 April and then until 31 October, after Mrs May's deal was rejected in successive votes in the House of Commons. Now it is being extended for a third time - so how does this process work? The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it has to send a request to the 27 other EU countries. All 27 have to agree in order to secure an extension. On Saturday 19 October, Mr Johnson sent a letter, as he was compelled to by alaw known as the Benn Act. The law stated he must send an extension request should he fail to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons by the end of 19 October. Mr Johnson also sent a second letter saying he believed that a ""further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners"". Nevertheless, on 28 October the EU agreed to the extension proposed in his first letter. The EU was not obliged to say yes. Once it received the UK's delay request, in the form of a letter, the 27 leaders consulted with each other on their decision. It was then made following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. If EU leaders had decided to offer a longer extension they would have been likely to have met in person to set conditions of the extension. It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit. The UK can in theory do that without consulting anyone else. That would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to say that would they would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if they won a majority in a general election. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be ""unequivocal and unconditional"", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.

UK employment at highest since 1971,"The number of employed people in the UK has risen again, to a new record number of 32.7 million people between November and January,figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) show.,external The 76.1% employment rate is the highest since records began in 1971. Unemployment fell by 35,000 to 1.34 million in the period, putting the rate below 4% for the first time since 1975. The figure is 112,000 lower than a year ago, giving a jobless rate of 3.9%, well below the EU average of 6.5%. Average weekly earnings, excluding bonuses, were estimated to have increased by 3.4%, before adjusting for inflation, down by 0.1% on the previous month but still outpacing inflation. ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes said: ""The employment rate has reached a new record high, while the proportion of people who are neither working nor looking for a job - the so-called 'economic inactivity rate'- is at a new record low."" Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""Today's employment figures are further evidence of the strong economy the chancellor detailed in last week's Spring Statement, showing how our pro-business policies are delivering record employment."" The number of men in employment increased by 77,000 to a record high of 17.32 million. The number of employed women rose by 144,000 to a record high of 15.40 million - the largest increase since February-to-April 2014. The UK's highest regional employment rate was in the south-west of England (79.9%), while the largest estimated increase in workforce jobs was in the south-east of England (59,000). In December, London (91.5%) had the highest estimated proportion of people working in the services sector, while the East Midlands had the biggest proportion of production jobs (14.5%). The ONS figures also reveal a record number of 1.67 million people working for the NHS in December - 32,000 more than a year earlier. The unemployment rates for both men and women aged 16 years and above have been generally falling since late 2013. Men's unemployment then stood at 7.4% and women's at 6.9%. The new total unemployment rate of 3.9% has not been lower since the November 1974 to January 2015 period. The 4% figure for men is at its lowest since April to June 1975, while the 3.8% for women is the lowest since comparable records began in 1971. Meanwhile, the number of economically inactive people fell by 117,000 to 8.55 million, a rate of 20.7%, the lowest on record. The number of job vacancies in the economy increased by 4,000 to 854,000. By Andy Verity, BBC economics correspondent If you were being uncharitable to politicians, you might say today's jobs figures demonstrate how little they matter. ""Crisis, what crisis?"" said recruiters as they hired 220,000 people in the three months to the end of January. How can you reconcile all that job creation with talk of a Brexit-induced slowdown? One answer is that the jobs market lags behind the rest of the economy. Recruiting people takes time; it can be months between noticing you need some new staff and their starting work, so the recruitment decisions reflect recruiters' sentiments months ago. Another reason may be that our jobs market is highly flexible, which is to say the risks fall on employees. In uncertain times, a company whose order book is expanding may prefer to take on people who can be ""let go"" later if things go wrong. That can be less costly than investing large sums in new plant and machinery, for example - investment which might prove wasted if demand for your goods shudders to a halt in a few months' time. If that story is right, it helps explain why the economy is generating jobs, but not much investment. And although there are more of us working, notably women and older people joining the workforce, the amount we each produce is barely growing. That puts a question mark over the sustainability of real wage growth of 1.4% - the strongest in more than two years. It appears that Brexit is not stopping firms hiring staff - at least, not yet. Tej Parikh, senior economist at the Institute of Directors, said: ""Businesses have been steadfast in bringing on board new staff and in creating vacancies, despite question marks over the future path of the economy. ""But with uncertainty around Brexit reaching a crescendo, firms are becoming more and more cagey over their hiring decisions."" Andrew Wishart, UK economist with Capital Economics, said: ""There was no sign in the labour market data of Brexit concerns at the start of the year, as the data beat expectations in every regard."" Stephen Clarke, senior economic analyst at the Resolution Foundation think tank, said that Britain was closing in on Nordic employment rates and added: ""While business investment has stagnated, firms are choosing instead to invest heavily in new staff."" Wages are still ahead of inflation, despite a lower increase than last month. Analysts think that the outcome of Brexit could lead to an interest rates rise later this year. Mr Wishart said: ""If there is a long delay to Brexit or a deal is struck, we suspect the [Bank of England's] Monetary Policy Committee will raise interest rates this summer."" And Mr Parikh added: ""Employers will want to avoid a disorderly withdrawal from the EU and will above all be urging policymakers to return some much-needed oxygen to the skills and productivity agenda.""

What Bercow ruling means for Brexit,"The Brexit saga has taken another unexpected twist after Commons Speaker John Bercow said he would not allow another vote on Theresa May's withdrawal deal unless MPs were asked a different question. His dramatic intervention,external, described as a ""bombshell"" by many newspapers, came at a crucial moment in the process, with 10 days to go before the UK is scheduled to leave and the prime minister set to ask other European leaders for extra time to address the the current deadlock. Mrs May had been planning to hold a vote this week, ahead of the summit - provided she could convince enough of her own MPs and Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party to back it. The Speaker referees debates in the Commons chamber, often stepping in to shout ""order"" or rebuke an MP deemed to have broken the rules. The Speaker also calls MPs to speak and plays a behind-the-scenes role as chair of the Commons Commission, which is responsible for maintenance and other services on the Parliamentary estate. The holder of the office is an MP who has been elected by other MPs - and he or she is meant to remain politically impartial at all times. John Bercow, a former Conservative MP, has been Speaker since 2009. Unlike many other countries, the UK does not have a written constitution - procedures in Parliament are dictated instead by longstanding customs and traditions, which can be open to interpretation. When there is a constitutional crisis, of the kind that has blown up over Brexit, it falls to the Speaker to make rulings based on decisions made by their predecessors. Profile: John Bercow In a nutshell, he ruled out another vote on the withdrawal agreement negotiated with the EU if the motion put to MPs was ""the same or substantially the same"" as the one they rejected last week. MPs said no to Mrs May's deal a week ago by 149 votes, having first rejected it in January by 230 votes - the biggest ever Parliamentary defeat for a government. The Commons Speaker suggested there would have to be a ""demonstrable change"" to the deal put before MPs to allow another vote. May to press on despite Bercow ruling Can May still bring back her Brexit deal? 'Brexit destroyer' Bercow's 'bombshell' ruling Explaining his decision, he cited ""strong and longstanding"" parliamentary precedents dating back to 1604. Referring to Erskine May, Parliament's ancient and respected rule book, he said MPs should never be asked to vote again on the same proposition if they had already ""negatived"" it during the current Parliamentary session. He gave a number of examples where predecessors of his had enforced this convention, the most recent being in 1920. Labour MP Angela Eagle pressed the Commons Speaker on the matter He was asked to look into the matter by a Labour MP, although he had been expected to make an intervention in the Brexit process at some stage, as it has strained Parliament's normal procedures to breaking point. After the PM's deal was rejected for a second time, Labour's Angela Eagle asked the Speaker to rule whether it would be proper for the Commons to be asked to vote on a deal again that it had decisively rejected twice. Mr Bercow promised to go away to consider the matter and let MPs know. In reaching his ruling, he said he was acting on concerns that MPs could find themselves ""repeatedly"" having to vote on the same proposition ""ad infinitum"". This, he said, was not a ""sensible"" use of Parliament's time. He said it also risked undermining the legislature's reputation which depended, in part, on maintaining ""proper respect for the decisions it takes"". He asserted the Speaker's right to decide, at the time, whether future motions were in order or not. While it was not his ""last word on the matter"", he made clear he was setting a test that governments, and also MPs tabling Brexit-related amendments, would have to pass in future. The timing of Mr Bercow's announcement could not have been more politically explosive. The immediate consequence is that it has pretty much ended any chance of there being another vote on the PM's deal this week. Theresa May had been hoping to hold a third vote on Wednesday which, if successful, would have paved the way for her to ask for a short ""technical extension"" of about three months to complete the Brexit process. Although the prospect of her getting the deal through was far from guaranteed anyway, Mr Bercow's intervention would seem to have pretty much derailed, for now anyway, No 10's preferred sequence of events. The PM is now having to contemplate asking EU leaders on Thursday for a much longer delay, of potentially nine months or more - pushing the date of Brexit well beyond 29 March. MPs could still vote on the deal again next week, if it has been changed - or the Speaker has been overruled by MPs in a vote - but the political landscape may look very different. The cabinet was due to discuss the question of a Brexit delay on Tuesday Ranging from apoplectic to ecstatic, depending on which MP you speak to and where they stand on Brexit. Conservative MPs who had been persuaded to back the PM's deal, in a vote they expected this week, are particularly aggrieved. James Gray said he was ""absolutely furious"", while Greg Hands suggested Mr Bercow was one of the few public servants who was ""genuinely accountable to nobody"". Ardent Brexiteers who want the UK to leave without a deal seemed initially pleased, believing it would either force the EU to make more far-reaching concessions to the deal or scupper the chance of there being another vote and therefore make a no-deal exit next week more likely. The Labour leadership has stayed out of the row so far. But Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs who favour a ""softer"" form of Brexit or even a referendum sense a growing opportunity if the current deadlock drags on. Amid all the excitement, ex-cabinet minister Sir Oliver Letwin expressed a rather different view, saying the development ""was not terribly important"" since MPs would be able to re-organise their business, known as their standing orders, to allow another vote if they wanted one. All eyes are now on Thursday's summit of EU leaders, where they will discuss what to do next. Their decisions are likely to shape what happens in Parliament next week. If the EU agrees to an extension, MPs are likely to be asked to approve re-writing the Brexit date. Whether the government tries to bolt another vote on the PM's deal onto this remains to be seen. Some people think this could happen if alternative ways of getting round Mr Bercow's ruling - such as changing standing orders or even terminating the session of Parliament early - are deemed too difficult. Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs at No 10, has suggested there could be two votes - one in which MPs are asked to over-ride the conventions outlined by the Speaker and another on the deal itself. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has also hinted at this, telling the BBC that while he ""respected the referee's decision"", MPs would always ""find a way"" of expressing their will if the circumstances changed.

Syrian fighters 'overrun IS encampment'The camp near the Iraqi border made up most of the last patch of land held by the jihadist group.,"Some Syrian Democratic Forces fighters celebrated after returning from the front lines US-backed Syrian fighters are reported to have overrun an encampment that made up most of the last patch of territory held by the Islamic State group. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance said militants refusing to surrender had pulled back to a sliver of land along the River Euphrates south of Baghuz, and that clashes continued. Although it warned the battle was not over, some fighters began celebrating. Baghuz's fall would bring an end to the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS in 2014. IS women defiant in face of lost caliphate After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? The jihadist group once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of land stretching across Syria and Iraq, imposed its rule on almost eight million people, and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. This video can not be played Despite facing defeat and complete isolation, the mood amongst many remains defiant, as Quentin Sommerville reports After five years of bloody battles, local forces backed by world powers have driven IS out of all but a few hundred square metres. But the group is by no means defeated.US officials believe IS may have 15,000 to 20,000 armed adherents active in the region,external, many of them in sleeper cells, and that it will return to its insurgent roots while attempting to rebuild. It is not known. At the start of March, when the SDF began its final assault on the village, commanders estimated there were a few hundred militants holed up inside. The patch of land seized by the SDF was covered in tents, vehicles and foxholes But the Kurdish-led alliance was forced to slow its offensive after it emerged that a large number of civilians were also there, sheltering in buildings, tents and tunnels. As many as 20,000 children and women - many of them foreign nationals - have since been evacuated to an SDF-run camp for displaced people at al-Hol, swelling its population to 70,000 and overwhelming aid workers. Several thousand men have also surrendered and been taken to separate SDF detention centres. IS militants continue to put up fierce resistance Militants who chose to stay in Baghuz continued to put up fierce resistance,external, deploying suicide bombers and car bombs, but by Monday they had been driven back to a small patch of open farmland next to the Euphrates that was covered in tents, vehicles and foxholes. On Tuesday morning, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said it had taken control of the encampment and that the last militants had retreated to the riverbank. ""This is not a victory announcement, but a significant progress in the fight against [IS],"" he cautioned in a Twitter post. ""Clashes are continuing as a group of [IS] terrorists who are confined into a tiny area still fight back."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Bali added that hundreds of sick and wounded militants had been captured by the SDF as it took the encampment and that they had been taken to hospitals. On Tuesday afternoon, the BBC's Aleem Maqbool saw lorries leaving Baghuz packed with what he was told were hundreds of militants, as well asSDF fighters celebrating on their return from the front lines,external. Jiaker Amed, a spokesman for the Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF, told our correspondent they were celebrating ""a victory for all humanity"". IS militants and civilians were evacuated from Baghuz in lorries on Tuesday Mr Amed declared that all IS territory in Baghuz had been retaken, although he admitted that some militants might be hiding underground in tunnels. Later, Mr Bali told Reuters news agency that fighting was continuing and that militants remained ""in several pockets"". ""Their presence is not limited to a defined geography,"" he added. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, meanwhile reported that at least 14 SDF fighters were killed and 30 others injured by IS gunfire and landmine explosions as they attacked the encampment. An Italian man fighting for the SDF, Lorenzo Orsetti, was killed on Sunday. Even with its defeat in Baghuz imminent,IS released a defiant audio recording purportedly from its spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir,externalthat asserted that the caliphate was not over.

"More schools drop LGBT rights classesThe move comes as a campaigner says some members of Birmingham's Muslim community feel ""victimised"".Birmingham & Black Country","This video can not be played LGBT classes protester: I am not homophobic Four more schools in Birmingham have stopped teaching about LGBT rights following complaints by parents. Leigh Trust said it was suspending the No Outsiders programme until an agreement with parents was reached. Earlier this month the city's Parkfield Community School suspended the lessons after protests were held. Campaigner Amir Ahmed said some Muslims felt ""victimised"" but an LGBT group leader said No Outsiders helped pupils understand it is OK to be different. In a letter seen by the BBC, Leigh Trust said it was halting the lessons until after Ramadan, which finishes in June. The schools involved are Leigh Primary School, Alston Primary School, Marlborough Junior and Infants School and Wyndcliff Primary School. Leigh Trust - which is yet to comment publicly - said it wanted to discuss the programme with parents to find ""a positive way"" of teaching about the Equalities Act. Some parents at Parkfield, and the other four schools, claim the classes are inappropriate for young children and the schools' LGBT message contradicts Islam. The No Outsiders project was created and piloted at Parkfield in 2014 by assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat, who was made an MBE for services to equality and diversity in education in 2017. Ofsted has deemed the lessons as ""age-appropriate"". Mr Ahmed, one of the leaders of the Parkfield protests, said he had seen a presentation about the programme that was to be shown to the government as part of the school's Prevent strategy - which is aimed at reducing radicalisation. A series of protests were held outside Parkfield school's gates ""I think that's outrageous,"" he said. ""It's quite disgusting that the school has presented our children as potential radicals."" A spokesperson for Parkfield Community School said: ""The powerpoint was written four years ago in line with Prevent duty at that time. ""No Outsiders is all about tolerance, accepting difference and respect, which are all key aspects of community cohesion and our fundamental British values."" School's LGBT lessons 'are appropriate' Teachers' fears over Prevent anti-terror programme Latest news from the West Midlands Mr Ahmed said his community was ""respectful and tolerant"" of British values but now felt victimised. He claimed parents who had protested were ""effectively seen as homophobes in the wider community"". ""Fundamentally the issue we have with No Outsiders is that it is changing our children's moral position on family values on sexuality and we are a traditional community. ""Morally we do not accept homosexuality as a valid sexual relationship to have. It's not about being homophobic... that's like saying, if you don't believe in Islam, you're Islamophobic."" But Khakan Qureshi, a gay Muslim activist who runs Birmingham South Asian LGBT and was invited to visit Parkfield School last week, said he supported the need for the lessons. This video can not be played LGBT group reacts to protests at Parkfield school ""Myself and many others knew from a young age that we were different and we wish we had this sort of education,"" he said. He feels the Muslim community as a whole is not homophobic, but believes a minority within the protesters are ""agitating"". ""The attitudes of the protesters towards the No Outsiders programme is completely homophobic,"" he said. ""No matter how they package it, it still comes across as homophobic."" He said given the existing legislation to stop discrimination, ""I don't understand why certain communities here in the UK are not adhering to those laws"".

'More could have died' in disco crush,"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie died in the incident Police investigating the deaths of three teenagers at a St Patrick's Day party crush have said more could easily have been killed. Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie,died after the incident outside the Greenvale Hotel, Cookstown, on Sunday. CCTV showed as many as 400 people outside the hotel, the PSNI said. They have tracked down 160 witnesses, and reassured others they will not face questions about being under-age. Three teens dead after hotel disco 'crush' 'Then the literal crushing started' ""I think that we are fortunate, if that is the right word to use,"" said Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray. ""In these circumstances we are looking at three deaths... Bad enough, a horrendous tragedy, but we could easily could be looking at more."" A number of young people who witnessed the crush have complained about the response of security staff at the hotel as the emergency unfolded. Eyewitness Eboney Johnston told BBC News NI that the bouncers did not appear to ""realise the seriousness of what was going on"". She described seeing a toppling effect on the crowd during ""pushing and shoving"" in the queue. This video can not be played 'People just kept falling and falling' The 16-year-old has been to the Greenvale disco before and claimed that ""pushing and shoving would be normal"" in the queue. Ms Johnston explained at a previous disco at Christmas, the bouncers kept the queue in a straight line and removed any customers who were pushing and shoving, but she claimed that bouncers did not appear to take the same action on Sunday. BBC News NI put Ms Johnston's claims to the Greenvale Hotel, but its spokeswoman replied that it was ""not possible or appropriate"" for the hotel to comment ""while these matters are the subject of a police investigation"". As she laid flowers at the hotel gates on Tuesday, Ms Johnston praised the actions of some of the young people at the scene who tried to help those who had fallen in the crush. ""People just kept falling and falling,"" she recalled, explaining that some people fell over as they bent down to pick others up. Tributes have been paid to the three teenagers who died at the St Patrick's Day party The police said a large group of young people had been waiting to get into the disco at about 21:30 GMT. The security camera footage is being examined and police have appealed for videos captured by people at the disco. Officers have already spoken to a number of young people who were in the queue for the event; they plan to speak to others in the coming days. A number of parents had expressed concern that their under-age children were trying to enter the premises, added Mr Murray. He reassured them they were not the target of police inquiries. This video can not be played Cookstown crush victim 'had such a unique smile' After discussions with the Director of the Public Prosecution Service, Stephen Herron, the PSNI had agreed ""that is not an issue in this investigation"", he said. ""The focus of our investigation... is about trying to find answers for the families of the three teenagers who tragically died. ""We need to know what you saw so the heartbroken families of Connor, Lauren and Morgan know what happened to their children.""

""Talk to the staff, talk to your parents, and let them know what is on your mind,"" said Isabel Russell. ""Keep yourself busy, get on with your normal routine as best as you can. ""Feelings will change over time, and how you are feeling today, tomorrow, next week, will change with time. Catherine McHugh, principal at St Patrick's College in Dungannon, where Lauren was a pupil, described her as a ""leader among her peers and a quiet, strong and loyal presence"". ""A treasured friend and capable young lady with a bright future,"" she added. Prayer services have been held to mourn the three teenagers A relative of Morgan's said he was ""just a bundle of joy"". Connor was described as ""much loved and highly thought of"", while Lauren was an ""incredible friend"". Her best friend, Cora McKay, said Lauren was ""the most bubbly person you'd ever meet"".

Pro-Brexit activist denies harassing MP,"James Goddard denied three charges A pro-Brexit activist has pleaded not guilty to harassing MP Anna Soubry outside Parliament. James Goddard, 29, from Altrincham, Greater Manchester, is alleged to have called the MP a ""Nazi"" and a ""traitor"". He denied three charges before the case at Westminster Magistrates' Court was temporarily adjourned when people in the public gallery started shouting. Mr Goddard was remanded on bail until 19 July when he will face a two-day trial at the court in London. He was held by police following protests outside Parliament. He is charged with causing harassment between 18 December and 7 January; and racially aggravated harassment, alarm or distress, and harassment, alarm or distress on 7 January. The charges have been brought under the Protection from Harassment Act 1997, the Crime and Disorder Act 1998, and the Public Order Act 1986. Ms Soubry, the MP for Broxtowe who supports another Brexit referendum, resigned from the Conservative Party in February to join the Independent Group. The BBC's Simon Jones First appearances in court are usually pretty straightforward affairs - the accused speaks only to confirm his or her name, age and address, and it's all wrapped up in the space of just a few minutes. From the start though, this case was something different, with proceedings at times descending into chaos. James Goddard refused to give his address, saying he didn't want to reveal it in front of the 'vultures' inside court - as he gestured towards the gathered media. Around 50 of his supporters were packed into the public gallery. They applauded him on several occasions, then started chanting 'Shame on you' at the court officials. One shouted at the judge: ""He's not a terrorist, you know."" Calls for calm fell on deaf ears. Eventually the judge hastily left the courtroom. When the case finally resumed, the chaos continued, with Mr Goddard stepping out of the dock to complain that he would not get a fair trial. Mr Goddard is accused of shouting and chanting at Ms Soubry as she was being interviewed by broadcasters; pursuing her along the street, loudly and repeatedly demanding she answer questions, and filming her continuously on a phone. Protesters target attorney general's Westminster office Addressing the court, he said: ""It's not illegal to heckle an MP. All of this is wrong."" About 15 minutes into the hearing, the proceedings were adjourned after people in the public gallery started shouting that Mr Goddard should sack his lawyer and also chanted ""Soubry is a Nazi"". The courts service said it was ""deeply concerned to hear of intimidating behaviour"" at the hearing. A spokesperson added: ""We apologise to all those affected and are urgently investigating what happened. This sort of behaviour will not be tolerated.""

Love Island star's boyfriend took own life,"Aaron Armstrong died 20 days after his girlfriend Sophie Gradon A man killed himself days after the death of his Love Island star girlfriend, a coroner has found. Aaron Armstrong died on 10 July, 20 days after thedeath of Sophie Gradon, 32, who appeared on the 2016 series of the ITV2 dating show. Northumberland South coroner Eric Armstrong said the 25-year-old hanged himself after drinking alcohol and taking cocaine. Miss Gradon's inquest has been postponed. It had been due to be held on Thursday, but the coroner agreed to the deferment. Sophie Gradon appeared on Love Island in 2016 having been crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009 Northumbria Police said it was still treating her death as non-suspicious and was preparing a file for the coroner. Responding to media reports that new information had come to light, a force spokeswoman said: ""There's no new evidence. ""The family have been sent the coroner's report ahead of the inquest and they've requested more time to read it."" ITV2 leads tributes to ex-Love Island star Parents of Sophie Gradon say their 'hearts are broken' Friend says 'Love Island needs to offer more aftercare' Mr Armstrong was found dead at his home on Furnace Road in Bebside, Blyth, at about 12:20 on 10 July. His mother Donna Armstrong said he had been ""hysterical"" when he discovered Ms Gradon's body, while a friend who was with him the day before his death said he had been in a ""bad place"". The coroner said Mr Armstrong's thinking could have been ""muddled"" by the death of Miss Gradon, whom he had met on a night out in Newcastle in May. He concluded Mr Armstrong, having consumed alcohol and cocaine which ""prevented him thinking rationally"", took his own life by hanging. Miss Gradon, who was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009, died at her family home in Medburn, Ponteland. The day before he died, Mr Armstrong posted an emotional message to Miss Gradon on Instagram saying: ""Not a minute goes by without your gorgeous smile being a picture in my mind.""

Syrian fighters 'overrun IS encampment',"Some Syrian Democratic Forces fighters celebrated after returning from the front lines US-backed Syrian fighters are reported to have overrun an encampment that made up most of the last patch of territory held by the Islamic State group. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance said militants refusing to surrender had pulled back to a sliver of land along the River Euphrates south of Baghuz, and that clashes continued. Although it warned the battle was not over, some fighters began celebrating. Baghuz's fall would bring an end to the ""caliphate"" proclaimed by IS in 2014. IS women defiant in face of lost caliphate After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? The jihadist group once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of land stretching across Syria and Iraq, imposed its rule on almost eight million people, and generated billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. This video can not be played Despite facing defeat and complete isolation, the mood amongst many remains defiant, as Quentin Sommerville reports After five years of bloody battles, local forces backed by world powers have driven IS out of all but a few hundred square metres. But the group is by no means defeated.US officials believe IS may have 15,000 to 20,000 armed adherents active in the region,external, many of them in sleeper cells, and that it will return to its insurgent roots while attempting to rebuild. It is not known. At the start of March, when the SDF began its final assault on the village, commanders estimated there were a few hundred militants holed up inside. The patch of land seized by the SDF was covered in tents, vehicles and foxholes But the Kurdish-led alliance was forced to slow its offensive after it emerged that a large number of civilians were also there, sheltering in buildings, tents and tunnels. As many as 20,000 children and women - many of them foreign nationals - have since been evacuated to an SDF-run camp for displaced people at al-Hol, swelling its population to 70,000 and overwhelming aid workers. Several thousand men have also surrendered and been taken to separate SDF detention centres. IS militants continue to put up fierce resistance Militants who chose to stay in Baghuz continued to put up fierce resistance,external, deploying suicide bombers and car bombs, but by Monday they had been driven back to a small patch of open farmland next to the Euphrates that was covered in tents, vehicles and foxholes. On Tuesday morning, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said it had taken control of the encampment and that the last militants had retreated to the riverbank. ""This is not a victory announcement, but a significant progress in the fight against [IS],"" he cautioned in a Twitter post. ""Clashes are continuing as a group of [IS] terrorists who are confined into a tiny area still fight back."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Bali added that hundreds of sick and wounded militants had been captured by the SDF as it took the encampment and that they had been taken to hospitals. On Tuesday afternoon, the BBC's Aleem Maqbool saw lorries leaving Baghuz packed with what he was told were hundreds of militants, as well asSDF fighters celebrating on their return from the front lines,external. Jiaker Amed, a spokesman for the Kurdish militia that dominates the SDF, told our correspondent they were celebrating ""a victory for all humanity"". IS militants and civilians were evacuated from Baghuz in lorries on Tuesday Mr Amed declared that all IS territory in Baghuz had been retaken, although he admitted that some militants might be hiding underground in tunnels. Later, Mr Bali told Reuters news agency that fighting was continuing and that militants remained ""in several pockets"". ""Their presence is not limited to a defined geography,"" he added. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, meanwhile reported that at least 14 SDF fighters were killed and 30 others injured by IS gunfire and landmine explosions as they attacked the encampment. An Italian man fighting for the SDF, Lorenzo Orsetti, was killed on Sunday. Even with its defeat in Baghuz imminent,IS released a defiant audio recording purportedly from its spokesman Abu Hassan al-Muhajir,externalthat asserted that the caliphate was not over. Muhajir accused US President Donald Trump of ""falsely"" announcing victory over IS in Syria in December, and insisted IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was alive.

Google reveals gaming platform StadiaThe new digital platform will stream games and has its own controllerTechnology,"The Stadia controller comes with a YouTube sharing button and another for Google Assistant. Google has unveiled a new digital gaming platform called Stadia which will stream better-than-console-quality games that have traditionally had to be either downloaded or purchased on disc. At launch it will work on existing desktops, laptops, TVs and phones, said the firm's Phil Harrison. Google also revealed a controller. It looks like a traditional console gamepad but the Stadia version has a button for capturing and sharing gaming directly to YouTube. It was also announced that id Software's major title Doom Eternal will be one of the first games available. No pricing was revealed at the event in San Francisco but the firm did say Stadia would launch in 2019 in the US, UK, Canada and Europe. Google experimented with streaming data-rich games in 2018 with Project Stream, when the tech giant made the Ubisoft game Assassin's Creed: Odyssey available to play to trial participants via the Chrome web browser. This video can not be played WATCH: Google's Phil Harrison on whether people will need to pay for high-speed internet in order to make the most of Stadia. This is possible because the games run elsewhere, on Google's own high-end hardware, but users connect to the game with their device via the web. ""We learned that we could bring a triple-A game to any device with a Chrome browser and an internet connection,"" said Google chief executive Sundar Pichai, referring to big-budget titles. However, many streaming services to date have suffered due to the difficulty of offering high-end games via an internet connection. Gamers have complained of issues with ""lag"" - the delay between a player performing an action, and the game reacting to that move. In games where split-second reactions are a matter of winning or losing, high latency rates infuriates players. In an attempt to avoid this, Google said its Stadia controller would connect directly to the internet, communicating with Google's servers independently from the other hardware. id Software's demon-slayer title Doom Eternal will be among the first games on Stadia. The company has promised the service will offer games at 4K resolution, at 60 frames per second (fps) - and up to 8K, 120 fps in future. Today's most advanced consoles, the Xbox One X and PlayStation 4 Pro, can support 4K and 60 fps simultaneously, but only on a limited number of games. Google is hoping to leverage its success with YouTube, which is incredibly popular among gamers sharing their skills, to make its own gaming platform a success. ""Hundreds of millions of people watch gaming content on YouTube every single day. Our vision is to bring those worlds closer together,"" said Phil Harrison, Google's newly-hired head of gaming. During an on-stage demonstration, Mr Harrison demonstrated how someone viewing a video on YouTube could press a ""play on Stadia"" button and begin playing the title within seconds. Assassin's Creed:Odyssey was streamed during Google's initial Project Stream experiment Randolph Ramsay, editor in chief of gaming news site GameSpot, said the announcement was exciting news for gamers. ""It's been a long time since a brand-new platform came along that could challenge the major players like Microsoft and Sony,"" he told the BBC. Mr Ramsay added that Google would now have to prove that  lag and latency could be a thing of the past on Stadia. Some developers also expressed caution.

Why does Speaker shout order?,"So there's a new personin charge of proceedingsin the House of Commons. Sir Lindsay Hoyle has been elected by MPs as the new Commons Speaker, after previous Speaker John Bercow stepped down. You'll probably know John Bercow from the way he said ""order"" (pronounced ""odd-DEURRRR, odd-DEURRRRR!"") while trying to keep things calm and fair during discussions between the UK's political parties. Since 1997, Sir Lindsay has been a Labour party MP for Chorley in Lancashire - but he will have to quit that job because the Commons Speaker must be impartial. He was dragged to the Speaker's chair by two MPs, which is a tradition in the House of Commons when someone new takes the role. This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle was dragged to the chair after his election after four rounds of voting. As well as making a promise to be ""neutral"" and ""transparent"" Speaker, Sir Lindsay also paid tribute to his 28-year-old daughter Natalie, who died in 2017, during his acceptance speech. ""There is one difficult part I want to get over. There is one person who is not here; my daughter Natalie,"" he said. ""I wish she could have been here. She was everything to all of us."" This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle promised to ensure all MPs were heard Now he's the Speaker, he'll be sitting in that all-powerful green chair - given by Australia - deciding which MPs are allowed to speak. So here's a quick look at what the speaker does and what the role could mean for Brexit. This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House Simply put, the Speaker is in charge of what goes on within the House of Commons. If the Commons is the TV show Pointless, then the Speaker is Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman combined. Imagine that for a second. So that's why he or she will step in when things get too rowdy with the trademark cry of ""order!"". Contrary to popular belief, it's not because they're a fan of hors d'oeuvres. This video can not be played Order! Order! Speaker shows he runs PMQs By tradition, the Speaker is above politics and is supposed to represent only the rules and conventions of Parliament. So when he or she is elected, they stop representing their party. The title of Speaker dates back to 1377, and Sir Thomas Hungerford was the first. Back in the day it was a dangerous game. No fewer than seven Speakers were beheaded before 1535. And in a nod to this traditional past, when a new Speaker is elected, they will be physically dragged to the Chair by other MPs. This video can not be played Speaker Bercow dragged to the Speaker's chair That's because when the Speaker would communicate the opinion of the Commons to the monarch - there was a chance of early death if the monarch disagreed with the message. So you can understand why some previous speakers required a bit of gentle persuasion to accept the role. The modern role of the Speaker being independent from political parties evolved in the 18th and 19th centuries. Sir Thomas Hungerford rocking his best Brexit expression The new Speaker was selected by MPsusing a secret ballot system. If a candidate gets more than 50% of votes, they're elected to the post. But if no candidate gets more than half of the vote then there are more rounds of voting. Those with the fewest votes are eliminated and MPs keep on voting until one person gets a majority. Much like John Bercow, Sir Lindsay is likely to have a big role to play regarding Brexit. Mr Bercow was visible in the Brexit debate - and faced major criticism from Brexiteers who questioned his fairness. For example, hedidn't allowPrime Minister Boris Johnson to put his deal with the EU to a parliamentary vote after it had been rejected once. He said the reason was because of a parliamentary convention from 1604, which says a motion can't be brought back if it's the same ""in substance"" as a previous one. He alsoopposedallowing US President Donald Trump to speak in parliament in 2017. It was called ""an unprecedented and extraordinary rebuke"" and ""a diplomatic snub"" by BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier. This video can not be played MPs pay tribute to John Bercow at his last Prime Minister's Questions Mr Bercow - who was in the job for ten years - described his role as being similar to a referee in an interview by the US broadcaster CNN. ""I'm a regular at my club with my son, a season-ticket holder at Arsenal,"" he said. ""There are 60,000 people in the crowd, who think they know better than the referee."" And that's something Sir Lindsay will probably have to follow, to keep some vital order in the House. An earlier version of this feature was published in September 2019.

Kazakh leader resigns after three decades,"Mr Nazarbayev came to power in 1989 as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, the only man to lead the country since it emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, has resigned. In a televised address, he said the decision was ""not easy"" but he wanted to help ""a new generation of leaders"". Mr Nazarbayev, 78, has been largely unchallenged as leader of the oil-rich nation since 1989. He will retain much of his influence as head of the governing party. Mr Nazarbayev will remain at the helm of the influential security council and will hold the formal title Leader of the Nation. All you need to know about Kazakhstan ""I have decided to give up my powers as president,"" Mr Nazarbayev said during his surprise television address on Tuesday. As chairman of the security council, he added, he would retain ""major powers to determine the country's external and domestic policies"". ""I see my task now in facilitating the rise of a new generation of leaders who will continue the reforms that are under way in the country."" This video can not be played Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: 'I don't think Kazakh president will run again' Mr Nazarbayev said the speaker of the upper house of parliament, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, would take over as acting president for the remainder of his term which expires in April 2020. The former steel worker had been widely expected to seek re-election and has never indicated a successor. The announcement comes just weeks after the leader sacked the country's government, citing failures to improve the economy. ""In many areas of the economy, despite the adoption of many laws and government decisions, positive changes have not been achieved,"" he said in a statement at the time. Analysis by Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News In the past few months and even years, there has been speculation about Mr Nazarbayev's imminent resignation. These rumours reached a new level recently when he formally requested the Constitutional Court to clarify the process of a presidential resignation. The court confirmed that the president had a right to resign. However, his announcement today still caught many by surprise. Mr Nazarbayev is the only president independent Kazakhstan has known. Many regarded him as a president for life, a common practice for authoritarian states in Central Asia. He enjoyed great popularity, although it was never possible to independently measure it due to the lack of free and fair elections. Yet, because of the economic crisis, he has faced growing discontent from some of the population. Born in 1940, Mr Nazarbayev came to power as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in 1989 when it was a Soviet republic. After independence, he was re-elected against largely token opponents in 1999, 2005, 2011 and - most recently - in 2015. But the conduct of every election was criticised by foreign observers. During his long period in office Mr Nazarbayev has focused on economic reform while resisting moves to democratise the political system. Critics have accused him of corruption and widespread human rights abuses, as well as fostering a personality cult. His supporters say he preserved inter-ethnic peace and stability during the reform in the 1990s, and credit him for the country's impressive economic growth in first decade of the new millennium. Nursultan Nazarbayev (L) had a close working relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin Kazakhstan is as large as Western Europe and has vast mineral resources. Since independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, major investment in the oil sector has brought rapid growth. The country is ethnically diverse. The Kazakhs make up nearly two-thirds of the population, ethnic Russians just under a quarter, and smaller minorities the rest. Its main religion, Islam, is also undergoing a revival.

NZ PM vows never to say gunman's name,"This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern told parliament she would never use the Christchurch gunman's name New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed never to say the name of the Christchurch mosque gunman. ""He sought many things from his act of terror, but one was notoriety - that is why you will never hear me mention his name,"" Ms Ardern said in an emotional address at New Zealand's parliament. Last Friday's shootings at two mosques left 50 people dead and dozens wounded. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Who were the Christchurch victims? Stories of heroism emerge from NZ attacks The 'precious' mosque where peace was shattered The prime minister addressed a special meeting on Tuesday, opening her speech by using the Arabic greeting ""Al-Salaam Alaikum"", which in English means ""peace be upon you"". She said: ""I implore you, speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them. He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless."" PM Ardern met Muslim community leaders at Parliament House Ms Ardern assured MPs that the attacker would ""face the full force of the law"". She encouraged New Zealanders to acknowledge the grief of the Muslim community this Friday - which is the Muslim day of worship and will mark one week since the shooting. Ms Ardern has already announced that the nation's gun laws will be reformed and that the details would be presented within days. How mass shootings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? What is known about the suspect? The prime minister also called on social media platforms to do more to combat terror, after the gunman in Christchurch live-streamed his attack on Facebook. ""We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published,"" she said. ""They are the publisher. Not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit no responsibility."" On Tuesday it said that the gunman's video was viewed fewer than 200 times,externalduring the live broadcast, and about 4,000 times in total before it was removed. The social media company said it removed more than 1.5 million copies of the video in the first 24 hours after the incident, 1.2 million of which were blocked while being uploaded. How young people are responding Anger as shooter video spreads around world Christchurch and the new threat of alt-right violence This is not the first time disturbing material has appeared on social media related to mass shootings, with many survivors and victims' relatives angered by the publicity it affords the attackers. Does the media have a problem with coverage of mass shootings? The parents of one victim of the mass shooting at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012set up a campaign called No Notoriety,externalto tackle perpetrator-focused news coverage. This video can not be played Would we reduce the incentive to commit a mass shooting if we refused to report the killer? Its website argues for ""no name, no photo and no notoriety"", challenging the media to ""deprive violent like-minded individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave"". The Don't Name Them campaign by the ALERRT Center at Texas State University,externalis similar, arguing that giving attackers publicity ""allows the shooter to  accomplish one of his goals, and  validates his life and actions"". Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings The New Zealand legal system does have a name suppression option under the Criminal Procedure Act 2011. Courts can suppress the identity of the defendant if, among other things, it would prejudice a fair trial, cause undue hardship to the defendant or any victim of the offence or endanger the safety of any person. The identity ofa man accused of murdering British backpacker Grace Millanehas been suppressed by the High Court, although some UK media outlets have still named him, arguing the law does not apply in the UK. The New Zealand Herald reported on Tuesday,externalthat the mosque gun suspect had been moved to a maximum security prison in Auckland where he was segregated, had had no visitors, and was being denied access to newspapers, television and radio. He appeared in court last Saturday and entered no plea. His state-appointed lawyer said the suspect did not want his services and had indicated he would represent himself from now on. Islamic tradition calls for the cleansing and burial of bodies as soon as possible after death, but this has been delayed because of the slow process of identification and forensic documentation. This video can not be played New Zealand attack: How young people responded to the massacre Police on Tuesday said the bodies of six victims had now been released to families. They said that 12 bodies had been formally identified and all 50 post-mortem examinations were complete. A statement read: ""Police are acutely aware of frustrations by families associated with the length of time required for the identification process following Friday's terror attack. ""We are doing all we can to undertake this work as quickly as possible and return the victims to their loved ones."" Mohamed Safi, 23, whose father Matiullah Safi died at the Al Noor mosque, complained about the lack of information. He told AFP news agency: ""They are just saying they are doing their procedures... Why do I not know what you are going through to identify the body?"" The bodies of some of the victims were being washed and prepared in a Muslim ritual process on Tuesday, partly with the help of volunteers flown in from overseas. New Zealand's immigration service said it was processing visas for the families of the victims seeking to come from abroad to attend funerals.

Letter points to motive in Dutch gun attack,"Gokmen Tanis was known to police before he was arrested on Monday in connection with the shooting Dutch prosecutors investigating the murder of three people on a tram said a letter found in the gunman's getaway car was among the reasons why a terrorist motive was being seriously considered. Three people were killed and three others seriously wounded in the attack in the central city of Utrecht. Turkish-born suspect Gokmen Tanis was arrested on Monday evening. No connection has been found between Mr Tanis and the victims of the attack. Police said on Tuesday that armed officers had arrested another suspect, a 40-year-old man, in Utrecht. A statement said he was ""suspected of involvement"" and his role was under investigation. Two other men arrested on Monday were released and were no longer suspects, police said. Prime Minister Mark Rutte laid flowers at the scene of the attack on Tuesday afternoon. In a statement he paid tribute to the people of Utrecht who had ""remained calm despite the great threat"". ""So far a terrorist motive is being seriously taken into account. Among other things a letter found in the getaway car and the nature of the facts give rise to that,""a statement said (in Dutch), without detailing the contents of the letter.,external Prosecutors say a firearm was found when Tanis was detained. They say other motives have not been ruled out. This Renault car was found by police in Utrecht and is believed to be the getaway vehicle The red Renault Clio getaway car was stolen from the scene of the attack and later found in Utrecht's Tichelaarslaan close to where the suspect was arrested. Owner Frans Hoogendijk said he had abandoned the car with the engine running when he saw people fleeing the tram and one shouted at him to run for his life. ""I thought it was a bomb and leapt out of my car,"" he told the AD website. Neighbours had earlier described the suspected gunman as a ""loser"" and a petty criminal rather than a terrorist. Dutch justice officials confirmed on Tuesday that he had been released from custody recently in a rape case, which was due to go to court in July. He was freed after promising to co-operate with authorities. He has been convicted of crimes this month as well as in the past. According to Dutch law Tanis must appear in court by Thursday. Two of the three people who died have been named: Roos Verschuur, 19, worked in a snack-bar in Vianen south of Utrecht Rinke Terpstra, 49, was a football coach with the Desto youth club - he had three children The third victim was a 28-year-old man from Utrecht Dutch PM Mark Rutte and Justice Minister Ferdinand Grapperhaus (2nd R) laid flowers close to the scene of the attack Three of the wounded are in a serious condition and Mayor Jan van Zanen visited one of them in hospital on Tuesday. Two are women in their early 20s and a man in his 70s. Flags were flying at half-mast on public buildings in the Netherlands on Tuesday and flowers were laid at the site of the attack in Utrecht's 24 Oktoberplein. Allow Twitter content?

Anna Holligan, BBC News, Utrecht Sarah cycled to the scene to lay a fresh bouquet of tulips, her 13-month-old toddler, Jet, harnessed in a seat on the front of the bike. Teenagers were among many laying flowers at the scene on Tuesday ""I felt afraid to come out,"" she told me. ""But I had to show my daughter that we have to be strong, to keep living."" A note pinned to a bunch of roses read, ""It hit right through the heart."" A Muslim man fell to his knees, his head bowed and hands cupped in silent prayer. The victims appear to have been targeted at random. Among the tears and shows of solidarity, the overwhelming sense among the people is, it could have been one of us. Police released Gokmen Tanis's name after the shooting as they searched his home and other addresses. Prosecutors said he was known to police while friends told Dutch media that he had been in trouble on a number of occasions. Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country's intelligence service was ""looking into"" the attack. The threat level was temporarily raised to its highest point in the province of Utrecht Gokmen Tanis was not known for extreme religious beliefs, although he was once captured on video criticising a female reporter's clothing. A 47-year-old woman called Angelique told Algemeen Dagblad that Tanis was a drug user with a criminal record who was facing trial for raping her in 2017. She said he had recently been freed from custody after violating the conditions of an earlier release. ""He's not a terrorist but a psychopath,"" she said. This video can not be played Dutch attack eyewitness: ""I heard people yell: Shooting, shooting"" The case is due to return to court during the summer. Earlier this month he was given jail terms for shoplifting as well as burglary. In 2014 he was cleared of attempted manslaughter but given a jail term for illegal arms possession. Several reports said his marriage had fallen apart. A neighbour who grew up with the suspect told De Volkskrant newspaper that he did not go the mosque and the case had nothing to do with religion. ""He's a lost boy with the IQ of a shrimp."" At about 10:45 local time (09:45 GMT), police were called to reports of a shooting on board one of the city's trams at the 24 Oktoberplein junction. One witness told local media that ""a man started shooting wildly"". Another witness told Dutch public broadcaster NOS that he had helped an injured woman when the tram came to an emergency stop. ""I looked behind me and saw someone lying there behind the tram,"" he said. ""People got out of their cars... and they started to lift her up. ""I helped to pull her out and then I saw a gunman run towards us, with his gun raised,"" he said. ""I heard people yell 'Shooter! Shooter!' and I started to run."" The gunman then fled the scene, leading to the manhunt which lasted for much of Monday. A number of raids were reportedly carried out and counter-terrorism officers were pictured patrolling the streets near to where the attack happened.

Huge area submerged by Cyclone Idai,"This video can not be played Cyclone Idai: Survivors rescued by land and air Cyclone Idai has triggered a ""massive disaster"" in southern Africa affecting hundreds of thousands if not millions of people, the UN has said. The region has been hit by widespread flooding and devastation affecting Mozambique, Zimbabwe and Malawi. Mozambique's President Filipe Nyusi called it ""a humanitarian disaster of great proportion"". He said more than 1,000 people may have been killed after the cyclone hit the country last week. Idai made landfall near the port city of Beira in Sofala province on Thursday with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph). ""This is shaping up to be one of the worst weather-related disasters ever to hit the southern hemisphere,"" Clare Nullis, from the UN's weather agency, told the BBC on Tuesday.

An aerial survey of the province showed that a 50km (30 mile) stretch of land was under water after the Buzi river burst its banks, charity Save The Children said. The governor of neighbouring Manica province, Manuel Rodrigues, says there is an urgent need to rescue people still trapped, the BBC's Jose Tembe reports from the capital, Maputo. This video can not be played Aerial footage showing the disaster in Mozambique ""It's very sad and very complicated, given what we saw when we flew over the area. We saw people besieged and asking for help,"" Mr Rodrigues told reporters. ""They were on top of their roofs made up of zinc sheets. Others under flood waters. We saw many people. ""We can only imagine that they had been there for more than two or three days, without food and without clean drinking water."" Mozambique's government says 100,000 people need to be rescued from Beira Nelson Moda was in Beira in Mozambique when the storm hit. He told his story to the BBC OS radio programme: It was my son's birthday on 14 March and we were all at home. In the morning this strong storm started and it was moving the city, the trees, and the houses. It was like a war. It was horrific. The children were crying and we were hiding in the bathroom. I could see people dying and the house where I live has been destroyed. There are children who now have no father, no mother, and no home. I saw the city where I grew up being destroyed with my naked eyes. In Beira, there are no basic services and people don't know what they're going to eat or where they're going to sleep. I haven't been able to sleep since that night. In Zimbabwe, the government says 98 people have been killed and more than 200 are missing. President Emmerson Mnangagwa said that the government was conducting rescue missions and delivering food. In the south-eastern town of Chimanimani residents told harrowing stories of how they lost their relatives when the storm hit. Some rescuers said homes and even bodies were washed away, the BBC's Shingai Nyoka reports. Timber company workers were stranded after a road was damaged in Chimanimani, eastern Zimbabwe Floods of up to six metres deep had caused ""incredible devastation"" over a huge area in Mozambique, World Food Programme regional chief Lola Castro said. At least 1.7 million people were in the direct path of the cyclone in Mozambique and 920,000 have been affected in Malawi, the UN said. In Zimbabwe, at least 20,000 houses have been partially damaged in the south-eastern town of Chipinge, 600 others were completely destroyed. Local officials say they are distributing rice and maize from the national food reserve to those displaced. In Mozambique, several aid agencies are assisting government efforts in the search and rescue operations and in the distribution of food aid, ReliefWeb reports. The charity TÃ©lÃ©coms Sans FrontiÃ¨res has sent a team to Beira to set up communication networks for humanitarian operations. Many aid trucks are stuck on the impassable roads and unable to reach their destinations. The conditions have also limited air operations. Mozambique's National Institute for Disaster Management is also housing 3,800 families in Sofala province.

Team Sky change name to Team Ineos,"Chris Froome has won four Tours de France for Team Sky since 2013 Team Sky have officially become Team Ineos to reflect their new sponsor, a chemicals firm owned by Britain's richest man Sir Jim Ratcliffe. Broadcaster Sky said in December it would end its decade-long commitment at the end of 2019, during which time the team Sky have won eight Grand Tours. Ratcliffe is worth Â£21bn and has been in talks with Team Sky principal Sir Dave Brailsford for several weeks. The new team's launch will take place at the Tour de Yorkshire on 2 May. Ineos will become the sole owners of the team from 1 May and says it ""will continue to fund the current team in full, honouring all existing commitments to riders, staff and partners"". BeSpoke podcast: What does this mean for the future of cycling? Jim Ratcliffe: Turning cast-offs into gold Rich List 2018: Jim Ratcliffe is UK's richest man Four-time Tour de France winner Chris Froome expressed the view of the riders Ratcliffe, chairman and chief executive of Ineos, said: ""Cycling is a great endurance and tactical sport that is gaining ever more popularity around the world. ""Equally, cycling continues to mushroom for the general public as it is seen to be good for fitness and health, together with easing congestion and pollution in city environments. ""Ineos is delighted to take on the responsibility of running such a professional team."" Team Sky was launched in January 2010 and has amassed 327 victories since, including the eight Grand Tours. Current riders Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas have won five Tours de France between them, and Welshman Thomas signed a new three-year deal in September after winning his first Tour last July. This video can not be played 'It's just insane really' - Thomas reacts to Tour de France win Brailsford, who will continue in his role as team principal, said: ""Today's announcement is great news for the team, for cycling fans, and for the sport more widely. ""It ends the uncertainty around the team and the speed with which it has happened represents a huge vote of confidence in our future. ""In Sir Jim Ratcliffe and Ineos, I know we have found the right partner whose vision, passion and pioneering spirit can lead us to even greater success on and off the bike. It heralds the start of a hugely exciting new chapter for us all as Team Ineos."" Ineos is Britain's largest privately owned company and in 2018 posted annual pre-tax profits of Â£2bn. Ratcliffe has already invested Â£110m in Ben Ainslie's Americas Cup team. Team Sky have dominated the Tour de France in recent years, winning six of the past seven editions, while Froome also won the 2017 Vuelta a Espana and the 2018 Giro d'Italia. However, the efficient style and big spending that underpinned Sky's success has been unpopular with some fans, particularly in France. The team has also been subject to allegations of cheating. Froome, 33, had an anti-doping case brought against him and subsequently dropped by governing body the UCI, while former rider Bradley Wiggins has faced questions over his use of a medical exemption for hayfever medication. The UK Anti-Doping Agency also conducted a 14-month investigation into a 'mystery package' delivered to then-team doctor Richard Freeman on the final day of Wiggins' successful Criterium du Dauphine bid in 2011. Team Sky, Froome and Wiggins deny any wrongdoing in all three cases. BBC sports editor Dan Roan This has been a remarkable turnaround in fortunes for arguably the country's most successful and controversial sports team. Only a year ago, the brand appeared toxic and a group of MPs accused Team Sky of ""crossing the ethical line"". Although that was denied, once Sky announced it was pulling out, the future looked bleak. Some felt team boss Sir Dave Brailsford's bid to find a saviour could be scuppered by the medical tribunal of the team's ex-doctor. Richard Freeman denied a charge that he ordered a mystery delivery of testosterone to help a rider to cheat. But the case was bogged down in legal argument, then adjourned, damaging headlines were avoided, and now the team has been saved. From therapeutic use exemptions to 'jiffybags', Sir Jim Ratcliffe will have weighed up the team's various scandals in recent years, but concluded their unprecedented success is worth being associated with. This will come as a huge relief to the team's staff and fans who will be delighted that their star riders will now stay. Others, however, will be concerned that the dominance of cycling's wealthiest team could continue, making races too predictable. I understand the team's annual Â£35m budget will be maintained and perhaps even increased. Joining forces with Ratcliffe allows the team to preserve their British identity, although some will point out reports of the billionaire'scontroversial recent move to tax haven Monaco.,external Environmentalists will also be concerned that Ineos - one of the biggest plastic producers in Europe, with an interest in fracking in the UK - could be investing in the green sport of cycling as a PR tactic. Ineos' takeover secures the immediate futures of Brailsford and Team Sky's riders with contracts beyond the end of this season. Four-time Tour de France winner Froome's deal runs until the end of 2020, while Thomas is under contract until 2021. Geraint Thomas, the 2018 tour de Franvce winner, says he is ""super happy"" with the news This takeover also ensures the team will retain highly rated Colombian Egan Bernal, who signed a notable five-year deal in October. The 22-year-old won Paris-Nice on Sunday, will lead Team Sky at this year's Giro d'Italia and is expected to challenge for Grand Tour titles throughout his career. Ivan Sosa, another promising young Colombian, signed a three-year deal last year and Brailsford reportedly met the Colombian government and the country's largest petroleum company Ecopetrol while searching for new sponsorship. But Ineos' investment means the team remains backed by a UK company, with eight British riders in Team Sky's 29-man roster. Team Sky's accounts for 2017 revealed a budget of Â£34.5m, the biggest in professional cycling. Ineos is one of the world's largest manufacturers of chemicals and Britain's largest privately owned company. Ratcliffe announced Â£1bn worth of investments in the UK oil and chemical industries last month. Ineos moved its head office to the Swiss city of Lausanne in 2010 to cut its corporation tax bill, but returned to the UK in 2016, with headquarters in London and an office in Hampshire. The company has rights to explore for shale gas in sites in Cheshire, Yorkshire and the Midlands, but has yet to start fracking because of planning disputes, withRatcliffe criticising the government's fracking rules. Ratcliffe, 66, was born in Failsworth, near Manchester, and worked as a chemical engineer before founding Ineos in 1998 out of previous company Inspec. He retains a 60% stake in Ineos and was knighted in June last year, shortly after becoming the first British-born industrialist to top the Rich List. Ratcliffe supports Brexit and last month criticised the European Union, saying its ""foolish"" green taxes deterred investment in industry. He is a season ticket holder at Chelsea and waslinked with a Â£2bn bid,externalto buy the club from the Stamford Bridge club's owner Roman Abramovich. In 2017, he bought football club FC Lausanne-Sport, who play in the Swiss second tier.

Well now you might have an official reason as to why you're not acting like a mature adult. People don't become fully ""adult"" until they're in their 30s, according to brain scientists. Currently the UK law says you become a mature adult when you reach the age of 18. Scientists who study the brain and nervous system say the age at which you become an adult is different for everyone. Research suggests people aged 18 are still going through changes in the brain which can affect behaviour and make them more likely to develop mental health disorders. Scientists say the brain develops at different times in each person Professor Peter Jones, from Cambridge University, said: ""What we're really saying is that to have a definition of when you move from childhood to adulthood looks increasingly absurd. ""It's a much more nuanced transition that takes place over three decades."" He added: ""I guess systems like the education system, the health system and the legal system make it convenient for themselves by having definitions."" When you reach 18, you can vote, buy alcohol, get a mortgage and are also treated as an adult if you get in trouble with the police. Despite this, Professor Jones says he believes experienced criminal judges recognise the difference between a 19-year-old defendant and a ""hardened criminal"" in their late 30s. ""I think the system is adapting to what's hiding in plain sight, that people don't like (the idea of) a caterpillar turning into a butterfly,"" he said. ""There isn't a childhood and then an adulthood. People are on a pathway, they're on a trajectory."" Prof Jones is one of a number of experts who are taking part in a neuroscience meeting hosted by the Academy of Medical Sciences in Oxford.

"Love Island star's boyfriend took own lifeAaron Armstrong killed himself after the death of Sophie Gradon, who had appeared on the TV show.","Aaron Armstrong died 20 days after his girlfriend Sophie Gradon A man killed himself days after the death of his Love Island star girlfriend, a coroner has found. Aaron Armstrong died on 10 July, 20 days after thedeath of Sophie Gradon, 32, who appeared on the 2016 series of the ITV2 dating show. Northumberland South coroner Eric Armstrong said the 25-year-old hanged himself after drinking alcohol and taking cocaine. Miss Gradon's inquest has been postponed. It had been due to be held on Thursday, but the coroner agreed to the deferment. Sophie Gradon appeared on Love Island in 2016 having been crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009 Northumbria Police said it was still treating her death as non-suspicious and was preparing a file for the coroner. Responding to media reports that new information had come to light, a force spokeswoman said: ""There's no new evidence. ""The family have been sent the coroner's report ahead of the inquest and they've requested more time to read it."" ITV2 leads tributes to ex-Love Island star Parents of Sophie Gradon say their 'hearts are broken' Friend says 'Love Island needs to offer more aftercare' Mr Armstrong was found dead at his home on Furnace Road in Bebside, Blyth, at about 12:20 on 10 July. His mother Donna Armstrong said he had been ""hysterical"" when he discovered Ms Gradon's body, while a friend who was with him the day before his death said he had been in a ""bad place"". The coroner said Mr Armstrong's thinking could have been ""muddled"" by the death of Miss Gradon, whom he had met on a night out in Newcastle in May. He concluded Mr Armstrong, having consumed alcohol and cocaine which ""prevented him thinking rationally"", took his own life by hanging. Miss Gradon, who was crowned Miss Newcastle and Miss Great Britain in 2009, died at her family home in Medburn, Ponteland. The day before he died, Mr Armstrong posted an emotional message to Miss Gradon on Instagram saying: ""Not a minute goes by without your gorgeous smile being a picture in my mind.""

"Kazakh leader resigns after three decadesNursultan Nazarbayev, 78, became leader of oil-rich Kazakhstan in 1990.Asia","Mr Nazarbayev came to power in 1989 as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev, the only man to lead the country since it emerged from the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, has resigned. In a televised address, he said the decision was ""not easy"" but he wanted to help ""a new generation of leaders"". Mr Nazarbayev, 78, has been largely unchallenged as leader of the oil-rich nation since 1989. He will retain much of his influence as head of the governing party. Mr Nazarbayev will remain at the helm of the influential security council and will hold the formal title Leader of the Nation. All you need to know about Kazakhstan ""I have decided to give up my powers as president,"" Mr Nazarbayev said during his surprise television address on Tuesday. As chairman of the security council, he added, he would retain ""major powers to determine the country's external and domestic policies"". ""I see my task now in facilitating the rise of a new generation of leaders who will continue the reforms that are under way in the country."" This video can not be played Kassym-Jomart Tokayev: 'I don't think Kazakh president will run again' Mr Nazarbayev said the speaker of the upper house of parliament, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, would take over as acting president for the remainder of his term which expires in April 2020. The former steel worker had been widely expected to seek re-election and has never indicated a successor. The announcement comes just weeks after the leader sacked the country's government, citing failures to improve the economy. ""In many areas of the economy, despite the adoption of many laws and government decisions, positive changes have not been achieved,"" he said in a statement at the time. Analysis by Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News In the past few months and even years, there has been speculation about Mr Nazarbayev's imminent resignation. These rumours reached a new level recently when he formally requested the Constitutional Court to clarify the process of a presidential resignation. The court confirmed that the president had a right to resign. However, his announcement today still caught many by surprise. Mr Nazarbayev is the only president independent Kazakhstan has known. Many regarded him as a president for life, a common practice for authoritarian states in Central Asia. He enjoyed great popularity, although it was never possible to independently measure it due to the lack of free and fair elections. Yet, because of the economic crisis, he has faced growing discontent from some of the population. Born in 1940, Mr Nazarbayev came to power as first secretary of the Communist Party of Kazakhstan in 1989 when it was a Soviet republic. After independence, he was re-elected against largely token opponents in 1999, 2005, 2011 and - most recently - in 2015. But the conduct of every election was criticised by foreign observers. During his long period in office Mr Nazarbayev has focused on economic reform while resisting moves to democratise the political system. Critics have accused him of corruption and widespread human rights abuses, as well as fostering a personality cult. His supporters say he preserved inter-ethnic peace and stability during the reform in the 1990s, and credit him for the country's impressive economic growth in first decade of the new millennium. Nursultan Nazarbayev (L) had a close working relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin Kazakhstan is as large as Western Europe and has vast mineral resources. Since independence following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, major investment in the oil sector has brought rapid growth. The country is ethnically diverse. The Kazakhs make up nearly two-thirds of the population, ethnic Russians just under a quarter, and smaller minorities the rest. Its main religion, Islam, is also undergoing a revival.

Record numbers in employment in Wales,"Unemployment in Wales was 4.3% between November and January, higher than the UK average of 3.9%, according to the latest official figures. Wales saw one of the biggest reductions in the rate of ""economic inactivity"". This refers to working-age people who are not available for work because they have taken early retirement, or are sick, caring for someone else or a full-time student. In Wales this was down to 20.5%, lower than the UK average of 20.7%. Only Northern Ireland, the south-west of England and the east of England saw greater falls. The employment rate in Wales was 76% between November 2018 and January 2019, up 0.8 percentage points on the previous month. That is slightly lower than the UK average of 76.1%. These figures do not show how many hours people are working, or how many jobs they have. The number of employed people in the UK has risen again, to a new record number of 32.7m people. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""These are another set of overwhelmingly positive labour market statistics for Wales. There are 78,000 more people in work in Wales, with the largest increase in the rate of employment of any UK country or English region in the last year."" He said the UK government was ""committed to creating the right conditions"" for economic growth, attracting inward investment and facilitating job creation through its industrial strategy. ""I look forward to seeing Wales continue to break its own employment records year on year,"" he added. Economy Minister Ken Skates said the Welsh Government would continue to work tirelessly to support companies to invest and grow despite uncertainty from Westminster's ""chaotic approach to Brexit"". He added: ""These are challenging times but these figures underline that we have much to be positive about here in Wales.""

Sala transfer flights probe urged,"This video can not be played Emiliano Sala was on the light aircraft, which went missing on 21 January There are calls for a series of flights in the weeks before the fatal crash which killed footballer Emiliano Sala to be investigated by regulators. The aviation trade body Air Charter Association told BBC Wales it believes there are grounds to investigate other flights linked to the Â£15m transfer. These carried Sala, his agent, Cardiff City officials and others between the UK and France in December and January. Sala's plane crashed in the English Channel on 21 January. The Argentinian striker, 28, had been returning for his first training session after completing his club record move to Cardiff City from Nantes FC. Sala's remains were recovered from the plane wreckage found on the seabed in early February, but pilot David Ibbotson, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, is still missing. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is currently investigating what happened to the Piper Malibu light aircraft. However Air Charter Association (Baca) says it was concerned other flights involved in the footballer's transfer may not have been properly licensed. Who owned the plane? What does the interim air accident report say? Agent: 'The tragic events have shocked us all' Family's tribute to Sala The story of Emiliano Sala Air accident investigators' photo showing the rear left side of the fuselage The fatal flight and others which preceded it were commissioned and paid for by football agent Willie McKay and his family. In an exclusive interview with BBC Wales, Dave Edwards, chief executive officer of the Air Charter Association (Baca), warned the ""underground growth"" of illegal and so-called ""grey"" charter flights was putting passengers at risk. These relate to flights which are not properly licensed under regulations governing aircraft and pilots. He said the organisation's concerns about the sector date back about seven years and that they hold regular meetings with both the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) to discuss the issue. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson Mr Edwards said: ""The football agent has said on the record that they paid for a series of flights. ""We've done some background research into all of those flights and we're concerned more than ever that all of them have the potential to have, certainly, questions to be asked about them, which is what we've pushed the CAA to be doing recently and also Easa because the origin of the flight was in France so that comes under (their) territory. ""There's enough circumstantial evidence here that would make us push the authorities to do a full investigation into the background to ensure it was compliant."" Baca has done its own research through the European air traffic control agency and established the various operators and pilots for the flights linked to the Sala deal. BBC Wales has approached all those involved and invited them to respond to the questions raised by Baca. 5 December 2018- Flight from Stapleford in Essex to Nantes - carrying Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock, assistant manager Kevin Blackwell, Willie McKay and Mark McKay to see Emiliano Sala play against Marseilles 6 December- party returns from Nantes to Cardiff.Both flights made on G-KARE, operated by Surrey-based Flexifly Aircraft Hire Ltd 8 January 2019- Flight from Cardiff to Nantes - carrying Neil Warnock, Cardiff City player liaison Callum Davies, Willie and Mark McKay to meet Sala and his agent. They're flown back to Cardiff the same day.On N531EA, owned by Guernsey-based Channel Jets 14 January- Sala's agent, Meissa N'Diaye, flown from Paris to Nantes. N'Diaye and Sala are flown from Nantes to Cardiff to have a look around the Cardiff City Stadium, returning to Nantes the same day. N'Diaye is then flown back to Paris.All flights made on N843TE - owned by Channel Jets 18 January- Sala flies from Nantes to Cardiff for a medical and to sign his contract with Cardiff City.Via Channel Jets in N531EA.Sala's agent N'Diaye - who has travelled to Cardiff for the signing via a commercial flight -flown back to Paris by Lord George Porchester in his own aircraft, N14EF 19 January-Sala flown back to Nantes by David Ibbotson onN264DBto bid farewell to his Nantes team-mates and make personal arrangements. Mr Ibbotson books into a hotel to await the return leg of the journey - on 21 January - to deliver Sala back to Cardiff for his first training session 21 January- the flight leaves Nantes at 19:15 and disappears from radar around an hour into the journey. The final radar track record - given in the AAIB's interim report In its interim report on the Piper Malibu crash, the AAIB stated that Mr Ibbotson did not hold a commercial pilot's licence and could only fly passengers in the EU on a cost-sharing basis, not for reward. The AAIB is continuing to investigate and is expected to report on its findings early next year. It has already released information about the flight path, including radar records from its final moments. BBC Wales understands that all the earlier flights linked to the transfer deal were filed on flight plans as ""general aviation"" - therefore private, rather than commercial flights - and that none flew under an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC). An AOC is obtained from the CAA - for a cost - and provides a structure for air charter companies, including safety, flight operations, ground operations, compliance and training. Without this, BACA said the series of flights around Sala's transfer could only be operated on a ""dry lease"" basis - where an aircraft is leased by a customer and a pilot hired separately - or on a cost-share basis. One of the aviation companies involved - Channel Jets, a legitimate air charter company based in Guernsey - does hold an AOC, but only planes registered in Guernsey can be included on this. BBC Wales understands that the two jets used by Channel Jets on seven separate occasions did not fall under the AOC at the time. Both planes used were registered in America, which means they could not be flown commercially in Europe without the express permission of US regulator the Federal Aviation Authority and the CAA. The flights were listed on flight plans, as non-commercial. Sala pilot 'dropped out of training' Sala pilot's licence to be looked into BBC Wales has discovered that eight days after the plane carrying Sala crashed, one of these planes was de-registered in the US and re-registered as a Guernsey-based plane. It was then placed on the company's AOC. The BBC has approached Channel Jets, who declined to comment beyond saying they had ""provided full details to the CAA"". Asked whether the Sala tragedy could serve as a ""watershed moment"" for the aviation industry, Mr Edwards said: ""Our industry always had this line that it would take one famous person to be killed in an aircraft accident for it to come to the fore. ""It's certainly a moment which has brought the spotlight of attention onto charter flying in general. ""We have circumstantial evidence about other flights that take place every day. I do think eventually something has to give."" The CAA said: ""As there is an on-going AAIB investigation into this accident, it would be inappropriate for us to comment at the moment. We will be assisting that investigation as required."" BBC Wales has invited Willie McKay to comment for this story.

Why does the Speaker shout order?,"So there's a new personin charge of proceedingsin the House of Commons. Sir Lindsay Hoyle has been elected by MPs as the new Commons Speaker, after previous Speaker John Bercow stepped down. You'll probably know John Bercow from the way he said ""order"" (pronounced ""odd-DEURRRR, odd-DEURRRRR!"") while trying to keep things calm and fair during discussions between the UK's political parties. Since 1997, Sir Lindsay has been a Labour party MP for Chorley in Lancashire - but he will have to quit that job because the Commons Speaker must be impartial. He was dragged to the Speaker's chair by two MPs, which is a tradition in the House of Commons when someone new takes the role. This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle was dragged to the chair after his election after four rounds of voting. As well as making a promise to be ""neutral"" and ""transparent"" Speaker, Sir Lindsay also paid tribute to his 28-year-old daughter Natalie, who died in 2017, during his acceptance speech. ""There is one difficult part I want to get over. There is one person who is not here; my daughter Natalie,"" he said. ""I wish she could have been here. She was everything to all of us."" This video can not be played Sir Lindsay Hoyle promised to ensure all MPs were heard Now he's the Speaker, he'll be sitting in that all-powerful green chair - given by Australia - deciding which MPs are allowed to speak. So here's a quick look at what the speaker does and what the role could mean for Brexit. This video can not be played John Bercow's most memorable moments as Speaker of the House Simply put, the Speaker is in charge of what goes on within the House of Commons. If the Commons is the TV show Pointless, then the Speaker is Alexander Armstrong and Richard Osman combined. Imagine that for a second. So that's why he or she will step in when things get too rowdy with the trademark cry of ""order!"". Contrary to popular belief, it's not because they're a fan of hors d'oeuvres. This video can not be played Order! Order! Speaker shows he runs PMQs By tradition, the Speaker is above politics and is supposed to represent only the rules and conventions of Parliament. So when he or she is elected, they stop representing their party. The title of Speaker dates back to 1377, and Sir Thomas Hungerford was the first. Back in the day it was a dangerous game. No fewer than seven Speakers were beheaded before 1535. And in a nod to this traditional past, when a new Speaker is elected, they will be physically dragged to the Chair by other MPs. This video can not be played Speaker Bercow dragged to the Speaker's chair That's because when the Speaker would communicate the opinion of the Commons to the monarch - there was a chance of early death if the monarch disagreed with the message. So you can understand why some previous speakers required a bit of gentle persuasion to accept the role. The modern role of the Speaker being independent from political parties evolved in the 18th and 19th centuries. Sir Thomas Hungerford rocking his best Brexit expression The new Speaker was selected by MPsusing a secret ballot system. If a candidate gets more than 50% of votes, they're elected to the post. But if no candidate gets more than half of the vote then there are more rounds of voting. Those with the fewest votes are eliminated and MPs keep on voting until one person gets a majority. Much like John Bercow, Sir Lindsay is likely to have a big role to play regarding Brexit. Mr Bercow was visible in the Brexit debate - and faced major criticism from Brexiteers who questioned his fairness. For example, hedidn't allowPrime Minister Boris Johnson to put his deal with the EU to a parliamentary vote after it had been rejected once. He said the reason was because of a parliamentary convention from 1604, which says a motion can't be brought back if it's the same ""in substance"" as a previous one. He alsoopposedallowing US President Donald Trump to speak in parliament in 2017. It was called ""an unprecedented and extraordinary rebuke"" and ""a diplomatic snub"" by BBC political correspondent Eleanor Garnier. This video can not be played MPs pay tribute to John Bercow at his last Prime Minister's Questions Mr Bercow - who was in the job for ten years - described his role as being similar to a referee in an interview by the US broadcaster CNN. ""I'm a regular at my club with my son, a season-ticket holder at Arsenal,"" he said. ""There are 60,000 people in the crowd, who think they know better than the referee."" And that's something Sir Lindsay will probably have to follow, to keep some vital order in the House. An earlier version of this feature was published in September 2019.

Kuenssberg: Spanner in the works,"This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow rejects further Brexit votes without changes to motion ""He's breaking the constitution"" - quite the accusation, laid at the door of John Bercow's grand speaker's apartments. It's notable because it's the view of a government minister who is not one of those whose pulse quickens when discussing leaving or trying to stay in the European Union. There is, of course, precedent in the very well-thumbed copies of Erskine May, the parliamentary rules, for the speaker's decision. Quoting decisions as far back as 1604,John Bercow was quite clearthat governments are not meant to be able to keep asking parliament the same question, in the hope of boring MPs into submission if they keep saying no. But as another member of the government put it mildly, the speaker has a reputation for being ""interventionist"", and he has, this afternoon, chucked a hulking great spanner in the works. After the speaker's intervention, Theresa May's way forward is far from clear The government seems to have been cooling all day on the idea of getting MPs to vote again on Theresa May's Brexit deal this week, for a whole shopping list of reasons. But before Number 10 had a chance to make that decision, the speaker took it out of their hands. There will be no ""MV3"", to use the terrible jargon - there won't be another vote on the prime minister's Brexit deal unless it changes. Strangely, MPs who hate Theresa May's compromise, for different reasons, agree to an extent that it's the right call. But there is anger and astonishment too, partly because MPs will have to explain another potential delay to the process, when many of them sense the public's desire is to crack on. Listen: Brexitcast - Erskine Mayhem But there is festering concern about John Bercow's suspected wish to stop Brexit - always denied. This time the speaker, whose job it is stand up for parliament, has - with no warning - made a decision that some in government believe veers too close to trying to block the government from what it seeks to do. The way around it for Theresa May is far from clear. Third Brexit vote must be different - Speaker Third Brexit vote on same motion ruled out.

England water shortage 'within 25 years',"Low water levels at Wayoh Reservoir near Bolton in the UK heatwave in July 2018 Within 25 years England will not have enough water to meet demand, the head of the Environment Agency is warning. The impact of climate change, combined with population growth, means the country is facing an ""existential threat"", Sir James Bevan told the Waterwise Conference in London. He wants to see wasting water become ""as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby"". ""We all need to use less water and use it more efficiently,"" he said. Sir James Bevan was appointed chief executive of the Environment Agency - the public body responsible for protecting the environment and wildlife in England - in 2015 after a career as a diplomat. He told his audience that, in around 20 to 25 years, England would reach the ""jaws of death - the point at which, unless we take action to change things, we will not have enough water to supply our needs"". ""We won't have long term water security unless all of us change our behaviour,"" Sir James said Huge costs of climate impacts in 2018 Climate change is 'shrinking winter' How much water goes from Wales to England? The tone of Sir James' warnings is more strident than we're used to. Phrases like ""existential threat"" and ""jaws of death"" are, he admits, designed to jolt people into facing uncomfortable truths. The problem is the unfortunate combination of growing population and potentially shrinking supply by 2040. That implies a suite of tough decisions like persuading consumers and firms to use less water. The most pressing decisions, though, are over hardware. Infrastructure developments like giant pipes transferring water to the South East will be years in the planning. There's a risk to wildlife, too. But most controversial are plans for reservoirs. Locals have been fighting one in South Oxfordshire since the 1990s. Protestors say they acknowledge the water shortage problem but believe water firms are exaggerating the level of population growth. What's more, they say, reservoirs in a water shortage area like the Thames Valley is not a wise solution. And they will fight on. Alongside action being taken by the government, water companies and regulators, Sir James wants the public to use less water, and use it more efficiently. Currently, people in England use an average of 140 litres of water a day. Sir James is calling on people to cut their usage to 100 litres - the target set by Waterwise, which campaigns for water efficiency. ""In the last few decades we've radically changed behaviour on smoking (everybody did it) and seatbelts (nobody wore them),"" he is expected to say. ""In the last two years we've changed behaviour on plastic. We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea."" Get a low-flush toilet Take short showers, not deep baths Use the most efficient shower-head Get a water-efficient washing machine Don't use your dishwasher until it's full Turn the tap off when brushing your teeth Don't water your lawn (it will survive) ""If by 2050 we reduced per capita consumption to 100 litres a day, leakage by 50%, and did nothing else, it would provide enough water for an additional 20 million people without taking any more from the environment,"" Sir James said. Sir James in his speech declined to get embroiled in the political arguments over whether water companies should remain privatised or be taken back into public ownership. However, he did say that the present companies needed to up their game - on fixing leaks, bearing down on pollution and making the necessary investments that would future-proof the water delivery system. Reality Check: What have water companies done on leaks? And as well as reducing demand for water, he also called for a big push on maximising its supply. This, he said, would include: Water transfers between regions, from areas of water surplus to areas of deficit Desalination plants that convert brackish water from into clean drinking water New reservoirs to be built to hold water for use in times of severe water stress ""We have not built a new reservoir in the UK for decades, largely because clearing all the planning and legal hurdles necessary is so difficult and local opposition so fierce,"" he explained. But, Sir James argued, the economic case for greater resilience was clear, citing a 2016 Environment Agency report that found ""that while a severe drought would cost each household more than Â£100, the cost per household of the investment that would greatly reduce the risk was only Â£4 a year."" The Environment Agencyhas previously warnedof water shortages by 2050 andthe government has already suggested,externalthat people's water use should be reduced, in its 25-year plan published last year. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have separate public bodies responsible for environment protection, because the environment is a devolved matter.

Another Brexit vote not ruled out,"With 10 days to go before Brexit, Theresa May will meet her cabinet on Tuesday The government says it will try to get Theresa May's Brexit deal through the Commons, despite Speaker John Bercow throwing the process into doubt. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay suggested a vote could take place next week - after Mrs May has sought a delay to Brexit from the EU. Mr Bercow has ruled that the PM can not bring her deal back for a third vote without ""substantial"" changes. The UK is due to leave the EU in 10 days with or without a deal. The prime minister had hoped to have another try at getting MPs to back the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU this week - but Speaker Bercow effectively torpedoed that with hissurprise interventionon Monday. What Bercow ruling means for Brexit Who is the Speaker and why does he shout order? Brexit: What could happen next? Stephen Barclay told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Commons Speaker had made a ""serious ruling"" and ministers were giving it ""serious consideration"". He said it was important to ""respect the referee"" and abide by his decisions - but, he added, Mr Bercow himself had said, in the past, that if Parliament was guided only by precedent then ""nothing ever would change"". Mr Bercow cited a ruling from 1604 to justify his decision to block a third vote, after the PM's deal was rejected for a second time last week, by 149 votes. Mr Barclay suggested that MPs would ""find a way"" to get another vote, if the government manages to persuade enough of them, including the 10 Democratic Unionists, to change their mind and back the deal. He suggested it would also depend on Theresa May getting ""clarity"" from the EU on the ""terms of an extension"" to Brexit. He accepted that there would now have to be a ""short extension"" to the Article 50 withdrawal process if the deal gets through Parliament, to get the necessary legislation through. Mrs May is writing to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask for an extension. The PM has warned Brexiteer Tories that a long extension may be needed if they do not back her deal but Downing Street said it would not reveal what the PM has asked for at this stage. There would, however, need to be a vote in both Houses of Parliament to change the 29 March departure date, which is written into law, the PM's spokesman said. Mr Bercow refused to discuss his decision when quizzed by the BBC, as he made his way to Parliament earlier. Government ministers and MPs have been floating different ideas on how to get a vote on the prime minister's deal, in light of the Speaker's ruling. This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow rejects further Brexit votes without changes to motion Children and Families' minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Newsnight that one of the options was for MPs to vote on whether to ignore the 400-year-old convention that Mr Bercow had cited in making his ruling. Mr Zahawi, who is a Brexiteer, was asked whether the government was going to bypass Mr Bercow's ruling. He said: ""Let's see, we have to look at all our options."" A really simple guide to the UK leaving the EU How could Brexit be delayed? Bercow chucks a spanner in the works Can May still bring back her Brexit deal? Solicitor General Robert Buckland said a vote to overrule the Speaker was the most likely way forward. He told BBC Radio Wiltshire that if enough MPs show they want another vote on the Brexit deal, it can return to Parliament despite the current block. He said this would be a more practical solution than asking the Queen to formally close and reopen Parliament, which some have suggested would get round the rule that MPs cannot be repeatedly asked to vote on the same question in a Parliamentary session. Nikki da Costa, former director of legal affairs at Downing Street, told the Today programme: ""I think the PM and the government can still have a third meaningful vote... but it will be extraordinarily difficult to have a fourth meaningful vote so I think MPs really have to think very carefully if that vote does come back."" There is also a question mark over whether any agreement reached by Theresa May in Brussels on extending Brexit would overrule a vote by MPs, as it would have force under international law. Angela Merkel: I will fight to the last hour of the deadline German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would struggle until the last possible moment to achieve an orderly Brexit, saying the interests of Germany, Britain and the EU were at stake. ""I will fight to the last hour of the deadline on 29 March for an orderly exit,"" she told a press conference in Berlin. ""We don't have a lot of time for it but still have a few days."" EU ministers are, meanwhile, meeting in Brussels to prepare for this week's summit. Germany's Europe minister, Michael Roth, said: ""Our patience is really being put to the test at the moment and I can only ask our partners in London to finally make a concrete proposal why they are seeking an extension."" France's Europe minister, Nathalie Loiseau, said:  ""'Grant an extension, what for?' is always the question. Time is not a solution... we need a decision from London."" European Commission chief Jean Claude Juncker and European Council President Donald Tusk, who is holding talks with Irish premier Leo Varadkar in Dublin. are due to hold press conferences later. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to meet the leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party for talks on Brexit. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford, Lib Dem leader Vince Cable, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts and Green Party MP Caroline Lucas have all released a joint statement calling for another referendum. ""The best and most democratic way forward is to put the decision back to the people in a new vote - with the option to Remain on the ballot paper,"" they said.

Cabinet row over PM's Brexit delay request,"Prime Minister Theresa May is writing to the EU to formally ask for Brexit to be postponed. One ministerial source told the BBC the longer delay could be up to two years, amid reports of a cabinet row, but No 10 said no decision had been made. EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said the EU would not grant a delay without a ""concrete plan"" from the UK about what they would do with it. Under current law the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal in nine days. MPs rejected the withdrawal deal Mrs May has negotiated with the EU for a second time last week by 149 votes. They also voted in favour of ruling out leaving the EU without a deal, andin favour of extending the Brexit process. The prime minister had hoped to have another try at getting MPs to back the deal this week - but Speaker John Bercow effectively torpedoed that with hissurprise interventionon Monday. Kuenssberg: Cabinet split on Brexit delay Brexitcast: The last days of Rome Merkel to fight for 'orderly Brexit' Brexit: A really simple guide She still hopes to ultimately get it in front of MPs for a third go, but says even if that happens and they vote in favour of it, the UK will need a short extension to get the necessary legislation through Parliament. A cabinet source told the BBC she therefore plans to ask the EU to agree to postpone the UK's departure until 30 June, but with an option of a longer delay as well. Mrs May has warned Brexiteer Tories that a longer extension will be needed if her deal does not get through Parliament. This video can not be played Will the UK leave the EU on time? One ministerial sourcetold the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg,externalthere was ""no agreement"" around the cabinet table when a delay was discussed. Another cabinet source said they were frustrated that the PM had not been clear about which delay option she would be arguing for. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom is said to have criticised colleagues, saying they now amounted to a ""Remain cabinet"", not a ""Brexit cabinet"". Chancellor Philip Hammond said ministers all wanted the ""shortest possible delay"" but cabinet members ""have different approaches to how we should do this"". Any delay will have to be agreed by all 27 EU member states and Mrs May is heading to Brussels on Thursday to discuss the options with fellow leaders. The PM is writing to the EU to ask for Brexit to be postponed Mrs May will travel to an EU summit in Brussels on Thursday to discuss the delay options All 27 EU members have to agree to any extension proposed If an extension is agreed, Mrs May will probably try to get her deal - that was previously heavily defeated - through Parliament MPs and peers will also get a vote on any delay Talks have been continuing with the DUP and Tory Brexiteers who voted against the deal The government could seek to hold a third ""meaningful vote"" on the withdrawal agreement next week But the speaker has said he will not let MPs vote again if the question is exactly the same The UK leaves the EU on 29 March with or without a deal, unless a delay is agreed Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, who campaigned to remain in the EU, told BBC Newsnight that the question of whether to have another referendum was ""for a later time"". Although leaving without a deal was still the default position, Mr Blair said a no-deal Brexit ""won't happen"", adding that the challenge now was making any extension to Article 50 count. Mr Blair called for a delay of between nine months and a year to ""allow Parliament to reach a conclusive opinion on the central Brexit question - soft or hard?"" On Monday, the Speaker said he would not allow a third ""meaningful vote"" in the coming days on ""substantially the same"" motion as MPs rejected last week. What Bercow ruling means for Brexit Who is the Speaker and why does he shout order? Brexit: What could happen next? How could Article 50 be extended? Mr Bercow declined to discuss the reasons for his decision when questioned by the BBC, as he made his way in to Parliament the following day. This video can not be played Commons Speaker John Bercow is questioned on Brexit vote decision Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay suggested a third vote on the Brexit deal could take place next week - after Mrs May has sought a delay. On Mr Bercow's ruling, he said it was important to ""respect the referee"" and abide by his decisions - but, he added, the Speaker himself had said in the past that if Parliament was guided only by precedent then ""nothing ever would change"". Mr Barclay suggested that MPs would ""find a way"" to get another vote, if the government manages to persuade enough of them, including the 10 Democratic Unionists, to change their mind and back the deal. At a news conference in Brussels, Mr Barnier said it was up to the 27 EU leaders to decide whether to grant a delay, based on what was in the ""best interest"" of the bloc. But for a longer delay ""there needs to be a new event"" or a ""new political process"" - so that ""we are not back in the same situation as today"". ""Extending the uncertainty without a clear plan would add to the economic cost for our business but will also incur a political cost for the EU,"" said Mr Barnier. ""It is for the British government and Parliament to decide very quickly what the UK wants to do next."" Mr Barnier also warned that UK MPs voting against ""no deal"" would not prevent it from happening, saying that ""everyone should now finalise all preparations for a no-deal scenario"". BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the EU had ""little trust"" in the prime minister, with some leaders wanting to see proof from Parliament that MPs would support a longer delay before the EU signed up to it. She said there was ""irritation"" that those at Westminster appeared to be ""inward-looking"" and were not taking into account the cost of a delay to the EU. And she said the EU's final decision on a delay may not be given this week, with talk of an emergency summit on 28 March. Angela Merkel: I will fight to the last hour of the deadline Earlier,German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would struggleuntil the last possible moment to achieve ""an orderly Brexit"", saying the interests of Germany, Britain and the EU were at stake. Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar and European Council president Donald Tusk released a joint statement after their meeting in Dublin. ""They agreed that we must now see what proposals emerge from London in advance of the European Council meeting in Brussels on Thursday,"" it said. The Labour leader has been holding talks with other opposition parties Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the Speaker's intervention showed Mr Bercow was ""ensuring Parliament is taken seriously"". He said he had spoken to Conservative and Labour MPs about a so-called Norway-Plus style of future relationship with the EU - a closer one than Mrs May's deal would bring about - calling it an ""interesting idea"" which had not got his ""complete support"". When asked about another referendum, he said: ""The issue has to be put to the people after Parliament has made some kind of decision."" He said a public vote had to be on a range of options, saying: ""It cannot just be on Theresa May's deal or Remain - there has to be some choice for the people."" Mr Corbyn also held ""constructive"" talks with the Westminster leaders of the SNP, Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and Green Party about the potential to unite around a closer future relationship with the EU, a Labour spokesman said. Reality Check: What is the Norway model? What happened with Brexit last week? But Liz Saville Roberts, Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader, suggested the Labour leader had not really engaged during the meeting with the case for giving the public the final say on Brexit. ""We were there to talk about a People's Vote and the only thing I felt he was comfortable talking about was Labour's version of Brexit,"" she said.

Can May still bring back her deal?,"Here is the relevant commandment from Erskine May aka the parliamentary bible: ""A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session, may not be brought forward again during that same session."" So, how can the government get round this rather large obstacle and get another vote on Theresa May's deal? LIVE: Updates from Parliament Third Brexit vote must be different - Speaker Brexit: What could happen next? Well, first of all, rules are there to be changed. If MPs suspend or change the ""standing orders"" of Parliament, they could get the Brexit deal back on the agenda. But here the power would be in the hands of Parliament as a whole, and could not be done at the whim of government ministers. Secondly, the government could change the proposition on offer. The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has suggested that something ""substantially"" different would be to ask Parliament to vote for the deal subject to a referendum. It may be argued too that moving the Brexit date from 29 March to a later date would be substantial enough if Mrs May tacks this on to her deal. But the Speaker can set a high bar here. In response to MPs' questions, he has hinted that simply coming up with new legal advice or clarifications wouldn't be substantial enough. So, already there is a focus on the word ""session"" in Erskine May. If MPs can't discuss the same thing in the same session of Parliament, why not simply start a new one? In the parlance, Parliament would be ""prorogued"" - in other words, the Queen would end the current session and a new one would begin soon after. But this strategy would be extremely controversial, and may even be resisted by Buckingham Palace if it appeared that the monarchy was being used in a politically contentious way.

Sainsbury and Asda vow merger price cuts,"Sainsbury's and Asda say their planned merger will save them Â£1.6bn and allow them to pass on Â£1bn in price cuts to savers. Sainsbury's also says it will cap the amount of profit it makes on petrol. It says it will invite an independent body to check this promise in public. The supermarket giants are battling to convince the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to allow them to merge, a move that would see them overtake Tesco to become the UK's biggest chain. The CMA said last month it could block the merger between Sainsbury's, the UK's second-biggest supermarket chain and Asda the third biggest, currently owned by US giant Walmart. The CMA says such a move would result in higher prices and less choice. Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade Supermarket mega-merger faces crunch decision Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Business Live: Sainsbury's-Asda reaction The CMA said that if it did allow the merger to proceed, it could force the sale of a large number of stores or even one of the brand names. On Tuesday, Sainsbury's and Asda's joint statement said the CMA's provisional findings contained ""significant errors"". In a robust statement, it criticised the CMA's threshold at which concerns were triggered. It said this was set at an ""unprecedentedly low level"", which, therefore, generated an unreasonably high number of areas of concern. Sainsbury's and Asda's statement made a number of commitments: To deliver Â£1bn of lower prices annually by the third year following completion of the merger. To invest Â£300m in the first year of the merger and a further Â£700m over the following two years, as the cost savings flow through. This would reduce prices by around 10% on everyday items. Sainsbury's will cap its fuel gross profit margin to no more than 3.5p per litre for five years; Asda will guarantee its existing fuel pricing strategy. The price commitments will be independently reviewed by a third party and the parties will publish the performance each year, holding them to public account Sainsbury's will move to pay small suppliers (turnover with the business of less than Â£250,000) within 14 days; Asda will continue to pay its small suppliers within 14 days, in line with existing commitments The CMA's final decision is due on 30 April. This mega merger has been in doubt after the CMA raised a catalogue of concerns in its initial findings last month. The tie-up would create a supermarket juggernaut leapfrogging Tesco in market share. The big three would become the big two controlling nearly 60% of the grocery market. For Sainsbury's and Asda bigger is better. They say joining forces would make them better placed to fend off the likes of Aldi and Lidl.

More could have died in disco crush,"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie died in the incident Police investigating the deaths of three teenagers at a St Patrick's Day party crush have said more could easily have been killed. Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie,died after the incident outside the Greenvale Hotel, Cookstown, on Sunday. CCTV showed as many as 400 people outside the hotel, the PSNI said. They have tracked down 160 witnesses, and reassured others they will not face questions about being under-age. Three teens dead after hotel disco 'crush' 'Then the literal crushing started' ""I think that we are fortunate, if that is the right word to use,"" said Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray. ""In these circumstances we are looking at three deaths... Bad enough, a horrendous tragedy, but we could easily could be looking at more."" A number of young people who witnessed the crush have complained about the response of security staff at the hotel as the emergency unfolded. Eyewitness Eboney Johnston told BBC News NI that the bouncers did not appear to ""realise the seriousness of what was going on"". She described seeing a toppling effect on the crowd during ""pushing and shoving"" in the queue. This video can not be played 'People just kept falling and falling' The 16-year-old has been to the Greenvale disco before and claimed that ""pushing and shoving would be normal"" in the queue. Ms Johnston explained at a previous disco at Christmas, the bouncers kept the queue in a straight line and removed any customers who were pushing and shoving, but she claimed that bouncers did not appear to take the same action on Sunday. BBC News NI put Ms Johnston's claims to the Greenvale Hotel, but its spokeswoman replied that it was ""not possible or appropriate"" for the hotel to comment ""while these matters are the subject of a police investigation"". As she laid flowers at the hotel gates on Tuesday, Ms Johnston praised the actions of some of the young people at the scene who tried to help those who had fallen in the crush. ""People just kept falling and falling,"" she recalled, explaining that some people fell over as they bent down to pick others up. Tributes have been paid to the three teenagers who died at the St Patrick's Day party The police said a large group of young people had been waiting to get into the disco at about 21:30 GMT. The security camera footage is being examined and police have appealed for videos captured by people at the disco. Officers have already spoken to a number of young people who were in the queue for the event; they plan to speak to others in the coming days. A number of parents had expressed concern that their under-age children were trying to enter the premises, added Mr Murray. He reassured them they were not the target of police inquiries. This video can not be played Cookstown crush victim 'had such a unique smile' After discussions with the Director of the Public Prosecution Service, Stephen Herron, the PSNI had agreed ""that is not an issue in this investigation"", he said. ""The focus of our investigation... is about trying to find answers for the families of the three teenagers who tragically died. ""We need to know what you saw so the heartbroken families of Connor, Lauren and Morgan know what happened to their children."" Police have asked people who were at the event and who have video and photographsnot to publish them online but to upload them to the Major Incident Public Portal.,external A memorial service for the victims was held earlier on Tuesday in Cookstown's Holy Trinity Church, where the principal of Holy Trinity College called on pupils not to bottle up their concerns. ""Talk to the staff, talk to your parents, and let them know what is on your mind,"" said Isabel Russell. ""Keep yourself busy, get on with your normal routine as best as you can. ""Feelings will change over time, and how you are feeling today, tomorrow, next week, will change with time. Catherine McHugh, principal at St Patrick's College in Dungannon, where Lauren was a pupil, described her as a ""leader among her peers and a quiet, strong and loyal presence"". ""A treasured friend and capable young lady with a bright future,"" she added. Prayer services have been held to mourn the three teenagers A relative of Morgan's said he was ""just a bundle of joy"". Connor was described as ""much loved and highly thought of"", while Lauren was an ""incredible friend"". Her best friend, Cora McKay, said Lauren was ""the most bubbly person you'd ever meet"". ""You were just met with her smile,"" she told BBC News NI ""It was just such a unique smile and she was just an incredible friend."" This video can not be played 'More could have died' in Cookstown crush In a Facebook post,external, Edendork Gaelic Athletic Association football club said it was devastated by the death of ""much loved and highly thought of"" player and member Connor.

Record employment rate in Wales,"Unemployment in Wales was 4.3% between November and January, higher than the UK average of 3.9%, according to the latest official figures. Wales saw one of the biggest reductions in the rate of ""economic inactivity"". This refers to working-age people who are not available for work because they have taken early retirement, or are sick, caring for someone else or a full-time student. In Wales this was down to 20.5%, lower than the UK average of 20.7%. Only Northern Ireland, the south-west of England and the east of England saw greater falls. The employment rate in Wales was 76% between November 2018 and January 2019, up 0.8 percentage points on the previous month. That is slightly lower than the UK average of 76.1%. These figures do not show how many hours people are working, or how many jobs they have. The number of employed people in the UK has risen again, to a new record number of 32.7m people. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""These are another set of overwhelmingly positive labour market statistics for Wales. There are 78,000 more people in work in Wales, with the largest increase in the rate of employment of any UK country or English region in the last year."" He said the UK government was ""committed to creating the right conditions"" for economic growth, attracting inward investment and facilitating job creation through its industrial strategy. ""I look forward to seeing Wales continue to break its own employment records year on year,"" he added. Economy Minister Ken Skates said the Welsh Government would continue to work tirelessly to support companies to invest and grow despite uncertainty from Westminster's ""chaotic approach to Brexit"". He added: ""These are challenging times but these figures underline that we have much to be positive about here in Wales.""

Scottish unemployment at new record low,"Scotland's unemployment rate fell to a new record low over the winter months, according to official figures. Between November and January, the jobless total fell by 9,000 to 94,000. The new unemployment rate of 3.4% was well belowthe UK rate of 3.9%. Meanwhile, the number of Scots in work rose by 13,000 to 2,592,000, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The Scottish employment rate for those of working age now stands at 75.3%. Scottish Business Minister Jamie Hepburn welcomed the fall in unemployment - but warned that leaving the European Union could ""cost jobs"". Mr Hepburn said: ""Despite the huge and continued challenges of Brexit, the Scottish economy and jobs market continues to strengthen. ""Scotland is performing particularly well on unemployment rates for women and young people. At 2.6% for women and 7.4% for young people, both rates are at record lows and significantly lower than in the rest of the UK. ""However, while Scotland's economy and jobs market continues to grow, the UK government's Brexit plans, in whatever form, will cost jobs, make people poorer and damage our society."" The UK government's Scottish Secretary, David Mundell, said it was ""great news"" that employment continued to rise in Scotland. He added: ""Scotland's two governments are working together to strengthen our economy and create jobs, with initiatives such as our growth deal programme beginning to reap rewards. ""In the last few weeks we have co-signed the Â£250m Ayrshire growth deal and announced Â£345m in joint government funding for the Borderlands. ""The UK government's investment in growth deals in Scotland is now more than Â£1.35bn, and shows our huge commitment to growing Scotland's job sector.""

Peaky blinders: Celebrating Scotland's Munros,"The view to Braeriach, the third highest mountain in Britain and one of Scotland's 282 Munros, in a picture by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service To mark 100 years since the death of mountaineer Sir Hugh Munro, whose name is used to describe Scottish mountains with a height of 914m (3,000ft) or more, we asked climbers to pick their favourites from the list of 282 peaks. ""That's a very difficult question,"" says outdoor writer, photographer and long-distance walker Chris Townsend when asked to name the Munro closest to his heart. ""Overall I think my favourite is Ben Macdui, because of its situation at the heart of a huge area of wild land and spectacular mountain scenery."" Soggy Ben Nevis can be remarkably dry In pictures: Scotland's mountains Britain's second highest mountain, 1,309m (4,295ft) Ben Macdui is in the Cairngorms. The mountain is said to be haunted by a supernatural creature, The Big Grey Man of Ben Macdui. The myth describes him as a Scottish Bigfoot, said to loom large in shifting grey cloud. The summit of Ben Macdui in the Cairngorms The Big Grey Man of Ben Macdui first came to prominence in the 1920s during a dinner speech at an annual gathering of the Cairngorm Club in Aberdeen. Its honorary president, the highly respected mountaineer Prof John Norman Collie, told of a frightening experience on Ben Macdui in the Cairngorms 35 years earlier. It is believed Prof Collie had been spooked bya weather effect know as a brocken spectre. Chris first climbed the Munro more than 40 years ago. Chris Townsend says it is hard to pick a favourite Munro ""I've been walking in the Scottish hills since 1976 when I climbed Cairn Gorm and Ben Macdui, my first Munros,"" he says. ""On the summit I feel far from anywhere and the views are tremendous. There's a feeling of seriousness, remoteness and vast space."" Rock climber and journalist Natalie Berry'sfavourite is another giant of the Scottish mountains. ""Despite having grown up in the north of Glasgow from the age of three, it wasn't until my early 20s that I started venturing into the hills,"" she says. ""As a rock climber, I haven't done nearly as many Munros as a hillwalker might notch up, but my favourite would have to be Ben Nevis."" Climber Natalie Berry on Ben Nevis One of the best known Munros, Ben Nevis is Britain's highest mountain at 1,345m (4,413ft). Natalie reached its summit with Lochaber-based Ben Nevis expert Dave MacLeod having climbed a winter route together called Pink Panther. It was the first route Natalie had climbed on the Ben. ""Leading up the snow slope to the summit was quite exciting, and as I pulled over the cornice at the top my foot slipped,"" she says. ""Thankfully my axes held, but it was a nonetheless memorable moment."" Who was Sir Hugh Munro? Hugh Munro, whose family were Scottish landowners, was born in London in 1856 and brought up at Lindertis near Kirriemuir in Angus. He was educated at Crieff, Winchester and Cambridge. Munro went on to learn German in Stuttgart, studied a business course in London and served as a cavalryman in the Basuto War in southern Africa. He had climbed in the Alps while in Germany, and he continued this interest in mountains when he settled at the family estate near Kirriemuir. Munro was a founder and president ofthe Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC),external. And it was the club that set him the task of listing all mountains of 3,000ft or more. Celebrations on Meall Ghaordaidh near Killin after a Munroist bagged his final Munro. Picture by Will Stark, Edinburgh According to The Munro Society,external, Munro was the ideal person for this work because of his meticulous record-keeping, enthusiasm for work in the outdoors and fascination with mountain landscapes. Munro never managed to climb all the mountains he listed. In 1919, he died of pneumonia while running a canteen for soldiers in Provence, France. He was 63. But Munro's fascination with Scottish mountains lives on in the many people who climb them today. Among them are Munroists or Munro-baggers, climbers dedicated to ascending every one of the 282 listed Munros. Those who accomplish this feat are known by the SMC as ""compleators"". Sir Hugh's achievements are celebrated as part of the exhibition at theKirriemuir Gateway to the Glens Museum,external. There is also Munro Society exhibition dedicated to the mountaineerrunning at Perth's A K Bell Library,external. Climber, writer and film-maker Dave MacLeod, who accompanied Natalie on her first ascent of Pink Panther, has been walking and climbing in Scotland's hills for 25 years. ""I haven't climbed all the Munros because I've been more focused on the climbing side. For this reason Ben Nevis is undoubtedly my favourite Munro,"" he says. ""Its size and many steep and hidden coires make it seem more like a mountain range than a single mountain. ""There's enough interest on the Ben for a lifetime of climbing, or indeed interest of multiple types."" Helen Rennard on Bidean nam Bian in Glen Coe Last year, Helen Rennard became the first woman to complete the Winter Tranter Round, a 36-mile challenge that involves 19 Munros, among them the Mamores, Aonachs and Ben Nevis. ""My first Munro was Cairn Gorm at the age of 11, during a family summer holiday to Aviemore,"" she says. ""There was then a gap of six years, until I was 17, when I went on a week's winter mountaineering trip to Glen Coe and Ben Nevis with a climbing club from Stafford. ""It was me plus a load of men in their 40s, which was a bit odd, looking back on it."" Lochnagar in a picture taken by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service Helen got the winter climbing bug when she was 20 and at university in Aberdeen. Her favourite Munro is 1,155m Lochnagar, a mountain not too far from Aberdeen. ""I love the view of the coire in winter, especially when you get your first glimpse of it. ""The whole place has huge sentimental value for me as it's where I started Scottish winter climbing and I've had many days out in winter there with good friends."" The other Hugh Munro Slioch in an image taken by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service Today, there is a Hugh Munro close to completing his first round of all the 282 Munros. From Westhill, Aberdeenshire, he just has a handful of mountains left to bag and plans to finish with 981m (3,218ft) Slioch with its ""calendar views"" of Loch Maree in Wester Ross. ""When I got to 200 Munros I thought I would have to do them all,"" he says. ""I looked up the list that is maintained by the Scottish Mountaineering Club, where people register if they have completed the Munros, and I noticed no-one called Hugh Munro has ever done them all."" Hugh had hoped to have completed his round by the 100th anniversary of Sir Hugh Munro's death, but an injury sustained in a skiing accident hampered his progress. Now recovered, he has resumed his effort to complete his round. ""From an early age I have been interested in mountains,"" he says. ""When I was 14, I went on a camping trip through the Lairig Ghru in the Cairngorms. That was a life changing moment and I have never looked back since then."" Fiona Russell, who runs the business Fiona Outdoors and is an outdoors and adventure journalist and blogger, has been climbing in Scotland's hills for about 20 years. She says: ""I have always been a sporty person, enjoying judo, running, triathlon, cycling and skiing. However, I was around the age of 30 when I started to venture into the hills and mountains of Scotland. ""I started walking the Munros when I met my husband Gordon (Lacey) almost 10 years ago. I never imagined I would be as close as I am now to finishing a round."" Fiona and her husband Gordon on Liathach in Torridon She adds: ""My husband finished his first round within about two years of us meeting. I walked around 80 of his last Munros in his first round with him. ""Some years later I realised I had walked more than half of the 282 Munros. Now I have just 42 to go."" Gordon, meanwhile, is two thirds of the way through his second round. Fiona has favourite groups of Munros. She says: ""It was on the Five Sisters of Kintail - with its three Munros, Sgurr na Ciste Duibhe, Sgurr na Carnach and Sgurr Fhuaran - that I first met Gordon. ""We became walking buddies and friends and then we got together romantically. We were married last year on a snowy mountain slope in British Columbia. At the top of Ben Starav. Simon Wallace captured these scenes for BBC Scotland's Your Pictures while climbing three Munros in nine hours with his son ""My second favourite group of Munros is across the glen on the South Glen Shiel Ridge. We enjoyed an amazing walk of the seven Munros there one fabulously sunny day in early summer some years ago. ""The Munro I'm most proud of is the Inaccessible Pinnacle on the Cuillin Ridge on Skye. ""I am not good with heights yet I made it to the top of that exposed rock."" Fiona adds: ""There are so many Munros that bring back amazing memories.""

Ocado sales hit by warehouse fire,"Ocado's revenue grew by 11.2% in the 13 weeks to 13 March compared with the same period last year, although the online food retailer's income was hit by a fire in its warehouse in February. It brought in Â£404m during the period, but the fire in its Andover base had a 1.2% impact on its sales. The firm had more orders per week, but their average size was slightly lower. Last month,Ocado announced a deal with Marks & Spencerto give the department store its first home delivery service. It will start in September 2020 at the latest, once Ocado's current deal with Waitrose has expired. More than 30,000 orders - 10% of Ocado's capacity - were processed at the Andover warehouse, which was on fire for four days. Chief executive Tim Steiner said: ""The fire has been a setback, but it will only be a temporary one. ""Our teams have been working hard to minimise any disruption to our customers and we will build a state-of-the-art replacement facility that reflects all the innovations and improvements we have made since Andover opened in November 2016."" Ocado warehouse fire in Andover finally out Inside Ocado's burning robotic warehouse Ocado also said that the initial investigation into the causes of the fire did not suggest there was any risk relating to its model, which relies on robotic warehouse machines to pack orders. Meanwhile, a temporary delivery outpost is being set up in Andover and capacity at another customer fulfilment centre in Erith is being increased faster than planned to cope with the disruption. Ocado is selling the operating system to other retailers and there was concern it could affect the other parts of its business. Mr Steiner said that with the Marks & Spencer deal, he felt that ""Ocado Retail has never been in a stronger position"". He added: ""We are looking forward to the future with excitement and determination."" Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Today's announcement leaves no doubt Ocado has its eyes firmly on the future, with the group letting investors know last month's warehouse fire will be nothing more than a temporary setback. ""The first quarter has gone about as well as can be expected and it's looking more and more like Ocado will make it over this bump in the road.""

"Former Staples chain in administrationThe former Staples stationery chain, Office Outlet, is in administration, putting 1,200 jobs at risk.Business","The former Staples stationery chain, Office Outlet, is in administration, putting 1,200 jobs at risk. The retailer has no connection to the online-only business which trades under the Staples UK name. Two partners at business services firm Deloitte were appointed joint administrators on Monday. Office Outlet, which is part-owned by Hilco, the former HMV owner, has 90 UK stores, which will continue to trade while a buyer is sought. The administrators said the chain had suffered as demand for stationery supplies had continued to fall and its suppliers cut the credit terms on which it trades. Office Outlet chief executive Chris Yates led a management buyout of the company last September, leaving Hilco as a minority owner. ""Over the last two years the business has been transformed from the heavily loss-making old Staples business to a near break even modern multichannel retailer,"" Mr Yates said. ""However, additional growth capital was required to continue delivery of the next stage of the management buyout business plan. Despite being highly impressed by the Office Outlet story potential investors have held back due to retail sector sentiment and the general level of uncertainty."" Joint administrator Richard Hawes said: ""The company has recently experienced a reduction in credit from key suppliers, given the economic outlook which has severely impacted the financial position of the company."" But he went on to say he was hopeful that a buyer could be found and that the business would carry on trading ""with that in mind"".

Facial recognition 'could boost pig health',"3D images of pigs' faces are being analysed Scientists are using facial recognition technology to assess the emotional state of pigs. It is hoped the project at Scotland's Rural College (SRUC) Pig Research Centre in Penicuik, Midlothian, could help improve animal wellbeing. Researchers want to work out from a pig's expression whether the animal is content or distressed. A tool could then be developed to monitor individual faces and alert farmers to health and welfare problems. Previous SRUC studies,externalhave shown pigs can communicate with each other using different facial expressions. Facial recognition targets chimp trade Sheep 'can recognise human faces' Scientists have been capturing 3D and 2D facial images of the breeding sow population. The images are then processed at the University of the West of England (UWE Bristol) where techniques are being developed to automatically identify different emotions. Sows suffering from lameness could benefit if different facial expressions are seen to show pain before and after being given medication. Prof Melvyn Smith, from UWE Bristol's Centre for Machine Vision, said: ""Machine vision technology offers the potential to realise a low-cost, non-intrusive and practical means to biometrically identify individual animals on the farm. ""Our work has already demonstrated a 97% accuracy at facial recognition in pigs. Our next step will be, for the first time, to explore the potential for using machine vision to automatically recognise facial expressions that are linked with core emotion states, such as happiness or distress, in the identified pigs."" Dr Emma Baxter, from SRUC, said the research could result in financial benefits for farmers. ""Early identification of pig health issues gives farmers the potential to improve animal wellbeing by tackling any problems quickly and implementing tailored treatment for individuals. ""This will reduce production costs by preventing impact of health issues on performance.""

World's most expensive cities revealed,"Paris has come top of a ranking of the world's most expensive cities, alongside Hong Kong and Singapore. It's the first time three cities have shared the top spot in the 30-year history of the annual Economist Intelligence Unit survey. The French capital - ranked second most expensive last year - is one of four European cities in the top 10. The survey compares the cost of 160 items, such as food, drink, transport, utility bills, and rent, in 133 cities. It then tracks whether prices have gone up or down by comparing them with the cost of living in New York, which is used as a benchmark. The annual index was designed to help companies calculate cost-of-living expenses for expatriates and business travellers. The world's most liveable city named Is the single life more expensive? The Economist Intelligence Unit noted that costs in the cheapest cities were low by Western standards, partly because low wages limiting household spending are the norm there. It also said a ""growing number of locations"" were becoming cheaper because of the impact of political or economic disruption, citing crisis-hit Caracas in Venezuela and war-torn Damascus in Syria, which are at the bottom of the list. ""There is a considerable element of risk in some of the world's cheapest cities,"" the report said, adding, ""Put simply, cheaper cities also tend to be less liveable."" Report author Roxana Slavcheva said Paris had been among the top 10 most expensive cities since 2003 and was ""extremely expensive"" to live in. ""Only alcohol, transport and tobacco offer value for money compared with other European cities,"" she said. The average cost of a woman's haircut, for example, costs $119.04 (Â£90) in Paris, compared with $73.97 in Zurich and $53.46 in Japanese city Osaka. ""European cities tend to have the highest costs in the household, personal care, recreation and entertainment categories - with Paris being a good representative in these categories - perhaps reflecting a greater premium on discretionary spending,"" Ms Slavcheva said.

Dutch police arrest tram shooting suspect,"Police released this image of Gokmen Tanis A man has been arrested after three people were killed and five wounded, some seriously, in a shooting on a tram in the Dutch city of Utrecht. Gokmen Tanis, a 37-year-old born in Turkey, was found several hours after the attack in a building about two miles (3km) from the scene. Authorities said the attacker's motive was unclear. Police raided several properties and arrested two others in connection with the incident, Dutch media reported. The shooting sparked a city-wide manhunt and the closure of schools. At about 10:45 local time (09:45 GMT), police were called to reports of a shooting on board one of the city's trams at the 24 Oktoberplein junction. One witness told local media that ""a man started shooting wildly"". Several of the injured were said to be in a critical condition. This video can not be played Dutch attack eyewitness: ""I heard people yell: Shooting, shooting"" Another witness told Dutch public broadcaster NOS that he had helped an injured woman when the tram came to an emergency stop. ""I looked behind me and saw someone lying there behind the tram,"" he said. ""People got out of their cars... and they started to lift her up. ""I helped to pull her out and then I saw a gunman run towards us, with his gun raised,"" he said. ""I heard people yell 'Shooter! Shooter!' and I started to run."" The gunman then fled the scene, leading to the manhunt which lasted for much of Monday. Schools were closed and security was increased at airports and mosques while counter-terrorism police worked to locate the suspect. A photograph of him was posted on social media by police, who warned people against approaching him. A number of raids were reportedly carried out and counter-terrorism officers were pictured patrolling the streets near to where the attack happened. Police surrounded a building not far from the scene of the attack and arrested Mr Tanis on Monday evening. Police said the shooting appeared to be a terrorist incident but, at a press conference on Monday evening, a prosecutor said it could have been motivated by ""family reasons"". Mr Tanis was known to Dutch police, the prosecutor added. The threat level was temporarily raised to its highest point in the province of Utrecht Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the country had been ""jolted by an attack"", which he described as ""deeply disturbing"". ""There are many questions and rumours,"" he said. ""It is unclear what the motives are behind this attack."" He said local elections would go ahead as planned on Wednesday but flags would be flown at half-mast. Leaders from around the world, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, offered their condolences. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU ""stands side by side with the Netherlands and its people during these difficult times."" Police surrounded a house earlier on Monday The threat level in Utrecht was reduced following the arrest. It had earlier been raised to its highest level and paramilitary police posted to airports and mosques. Utrecht University closed all its buildings and trains were not allowed to run into the city's central station. Utrecht, the Netherlands' fourth largest city, has a population of about 340,000. Crime levels are low and gun killings are rare, which is the case for much of the country.

Frozen musical to head to London stage,"Caissie Levy plays Elsa in the current Broadway production of Frozen The stage adaptation of Frozen, which opened on Broadway early last year, is coming to London's West End. It will reopen the Drury Lane Theatre in Autumn 2020 after the theatre's refurbishment, producers confirmed. The musical is based on the 2013 Disney movie of the same name - the most successful animated film ever, with box office takings of more than Â£1.25bn. The storyline of the musical is broadly the same as in the movie, but extra songs have been written for the stage. Actors currently starring in the Broadway production will stay in New York, while a new British cast will appear in the West End. Songs made famous in the movie such as Let It Go, Do You Want To Build A Snowman and For The First Time In Forever all appear in the stage production. But the songwriters behind the film's music, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, were enlisted to write additional material for the musical - a daunting prospect given the classic status of the originals. ""We felt the pressure, but that was the something we had to, well, let go of,"" says Robert Lopez in what sounds like a genuinely unintended pun. Let It Go won Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez an Oscar for best original song ""Because there's no way to really create from pressure, you have to create from a sense of play and enjoyment and love."" Kristen Anderson-Lopez adds that the new songs were not written for the sole purpose of lengthening the story, ""because then they would just feel like padding"". ""What was more important,"" she says, ""was to write songs that took the place of a lot of the work that the animation did. ""For instance, if you think about Elsa, you don't really hear much from her at all during the first part of the movie, the way you experience her story is through close-ups, through looks of alarm in her eyes. ""In the theatre, you can't do that, because some people will be 100 yards away, so they can't zero-in on the eyes, so that's where the songs come in. They help you understand what's going on in her heart and in her head."" Frozen had strong ticket sales during its first year on Broadway and is currently booking until August. A North American tour also begins later this year which will continue until at least January 2021. The show has had generally warm, albeit not outstanding, reviews from critics during its Broadway run. In herthree-star review for The Guardian,external, Alexis Soloski noted the huge popularity of the show with young girls, many of whom attend the show dressed as Anna or Elsa. ""A likable transfer for the animated phenomenon will please fans but an extended running time highlights a thin plot,"" she wrote. ""Frozen could be more inventive, more imaginative, more vital, more necessary. But as those little girls would almost certainly say, let it go."" Elsa, Anna and Olaf are among the film characters brought to life on stage in the musical Jesse Green in the New York Times,externalpraised some elements of the show but also said there were a few ""icy patches"". ""You can feel the director, Michael Grandage, and his design team straining to make something artistically worthy of the property's commercial promise,"" he wrote. But Grandage, who is also directing the London production, says the West End version won't be exactly the same as one currently playing on Broadway. ""We don't want to just replicate a production,"" he tells BBC News. ""We want it to evolve and respond to the time of watching it. ""And so London will offer us an opportunity to make some adjustments, enhance and develop everything. ""We want to give a bespoke production in England. On one level it could be technical, the magic we use in the show, the spectacle... we want to make sure we evolve with the technology that's available to us."" Thrills and chills at Frozen musical 'Even Disney princesses get terrified' 5 questions about Frozen 2 we just can't let go Grandage, a West End veteran and the former artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse, adds he was glad to have the opportunity to direct a brand new show. ""I'd never directed a new musical before, I'd just directed a lot of music revivals,"" he explains. ""And so I've always been seeking the opportunity to do a new musical, because you can collaborate with the book writer, the lyricists, the composers, and work on something you can develop with them for the first time."" Michael Grandage says the West End show will be tweaked slightly from its Broadway version Jennifer Lee, who wrote the script both for the film and the stage, says one of the main benefits of putting the story into the theatre was ""being able to open these characters up"". ""Elsa became much richer,"" she explains. ""She had so many more dimensions to her, and on stage we're able to get to know her a lot better than we do in the film. ""The film was the blueprint, but what we were actually allowed to do was go as deep into the story as we always wanted to do. ""And sitting in the theatre and writing and seeing the actors in front of you, they're alive and you're able to work scenes and lines, which is pretty opposite of the experience in film, especially in animation, where there's a lot of projecting of what will become, and only getting pieces of the process along the way. ""Theatre is much more immediate, and it gives you a lot of room to work your craft."" Lee is currently busy working on the Frozen film sequel, which is currently in production, after which the work on putting the West End show together will begin. ""We're on 12-hour days, seven days a week right now!"" she says. ""We've been so focused on Frozen 2, we lock in June. [After that] I'll be able to open up my focus."" Patti Murin and Caissie Levy (Anna and Elsa) pictured at the Broadway launch Kristen Anderson-Lopez feels strongly that the musical should remind audiences that Frozen is a relatable story for all audiences, and not just young girls. ""Years of retail have created the idea that Frozen is this thing for little girls, but it's a very rich and adult story about trauma from childhood and the way it can freeze people into roles for their lifetime,"" she says. ""When the film first came out, adults said, 'Oh I love Frozen'. But somehow, because of the lunchboxes, two years later, everyone came up and said, 'Oh my niece loves Frozen'. ""And we were very anxious to create a story where an adult of any age could say, 'I love Frozen'."" 5 questions about Frozen 2 we just can't let go 'Even Disney princesses get terrified' Thrills and chills at Frozen musical Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures Million year-old bubbles could solve ice age mystery 'Where do I go?'

Sainsbury and Asda vow merger price cutsThe retail giants tell the competition watchdog a merger will bring billions of price cuts and savings.Business,"Sainsbury's and Asda say their planned merger will save them Â£1.6bn and allow them to pass on Â£1bn in price cuts to savers. Sainsbury's also says it will cap the amount of profit it makes on petrol. It says it will invite an independent body to check this promise in public. The supermarket giants are battling to convince the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to allow them to merge, a move that would see them overtake Tesco to become the UK's biggest chain. The CMA said last month it could block the merger between Sainsbury's, the UK's second-biggest supermarket chain and Asda the third biggest, currently owned by US giant Walmart. The CMA says such a move would result in higher prices and less choice. Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade Supermarket mega-merger faces crunch decision Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Business Live: Sainsbury's-Asda reaction The CMA said that if it did allow the merger to proceed, it could force the sale of a large number of stores or even one of the brand names. On Tuesday, Sainsbury's and Asda's joint statement said the CMA's provisional findings contained ""significant errors"". In a robust statement, it criticised the CMA's threshold at which concerns were triggered. It said this was set at an ""unprecedentedly low level"", which, therefore, generated an unreasonably high number of areas of concern. Sainsbury's and Asda's statement made a number of commitments: To deliver Â£1bn of lower prices annually by the third year following completion of the merger. To invest Â£300m in the first year of the merger and a further Â£700m over the following two years, as the cost savings flow through. This would reduce prices by around 10% on everyday items. Sainsbury's will cap its fuel gross profit margin to no more than 3.5p per litre for five years; Asda will guarantee its existing fuel pricing strategy. The price commitments will be independently reviewed by a third party and the parties will publish the performance each year, holding them to public account Sainsbury's will move to pay small suppliers (turnover with the business of less than Â£250,000) within 14 days; Asda will continue to pay its small suppliers within 14 days, in line with existing commitments The CMA's final decision is due on 30 April. This mega merger has been in doubt after the CMA raised a catalogue of concerns in its initial findings last month. The tie-up would create a supermarket juggernaut leapfrogging Tesco in market share. The big three would become the big two controlling nearly 60% of the grocery market. For Sainsbury's and Asda bigger is better. They say joining forces would make them better placed to fend off the likes of Aldi and Lidl. Their main selling point is the plan to negotiate better prices with their biggest suppliers which could then be passed on to consumers. They pledge a 10% price cut on everyday products. Today's update provides some more detail on that price commitment. It's part of their attempt to persuade the CMA to change its mind. But given the scale of the regulator's concerns and how hard they will be to overcome, Sainsbury's faces an uphill task to secure the green light, even if it is promising Â£1bn a year to drop prices.

"Grime music being 'stifled', MPs say","Croydon-born rapper ShaoDow told MPs he'd had difficulty staging gigs Grime music faces significant challenges because of discrimination against urban acts, MPs have said. Despite the success of Stormzy, Dave and Skepta, it is often difficult for grime acts to play live, they said. Licensing authorities and police have been known to cancel gigs at short notice, affecting musicians' ability to gain a following. ""Prejudices against grime artists risks stifling one of the UK's most exciting musical exports,"" MPs said in a report. This video can not be played A brief history of grime music The comments came as part of anextensive report into the UK's live music scene,externalby the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS) committee, made up of 11 MPs from the Conservatives, Labour and the SNP. 'Urban acts have it tougher than bands starting out' They called on the government to come up with new guidelines for police and local authorities, which would ""ensure that urban music acts are not unfairly targeted"". As part of its investigation, the committee invited rapper ShaoDow to tell them about his experiences and he explained that he had faced frustrations when attempting to put on shows in London. ""I had a venue cancel on me on the day that I was meant to go there,"" he said. ""I was booked for a performance in a club and called them ahead of time to say, 'I am on my way', and they said, 'Oh, by the way, we were just listening to your music. You make hip-hop'. ""I said, 'Yes', and he said, 'Oh, we cannot do that here, we will lose our licence'."" Last year, Arctic Monkeys' manager called for Viagogo to be shut down Another witness told the committee that ""institutionalised racism"" amongst local councils and licensees ""is hindering that scene rather than allowing it to flourish"". UK Music, which represents the industry, welcomed the DCMS committee's call to action, saying: ""We must root out discrimination wherever we find it"". The live music report said that gigs and festivals were essential to the future of the British music industry, accounting for almost one quarter of its Â£4.5bn contribution to the UK economy. It noted that concert revenue was increasingly important to artists. On average, live shows make up 49% of musicians' income, compared to just 3% from recording. However, the DCMS said small, local venues were facing a ""perfect storm"" of challenges including rising rents and business rates against a backdrop of stagnating incomes; and called on the government to consider easing the financial burden on venue owners. The review also looked into touting and took the unusual step of warning consumers to avoid ticket resale site Viagogo. MPs said the site used ""misleading sales practices"" which had ""caused distress to too many music fans for too long"". They also criticised the company for failure to appear before the committee. Their rebuke comes two weeks after the competition watchdog said Viagogo had not complied with a court order demanding it provide accurate and upfront information about the tickets sold on its website. In a statement to the BBC, Viagogo said it was ""disappointed"" MPs had ""singled us out"". The company argued it was ""complying"" with the court order and ""will absolutely continue to work constructively with the CMA to make further amends where necessary"". Elsewhere in the live music report, ministers suggested establishing a taskforce to nurture new talent; and supported calls for the introduction of a EU-wide touring visa, enabling British artists to play in Europe without hindrance after Brexit. ""Urgent action is needed if the live music industry is to continue to make a significant contribution to both the economy and cultural life of the country,"" said committee chairman Damian Collins. ""We also look to the music industry to make sure that enough of the big money generated at the top finds its way down to grassroots level to support emerging talent. ""It happens with sport, why not music?"" UK Music welcomed what it called a ""landmark report"", saying MPs had ""really listened to the live music industry"". ""Their report is a real wake-up call for everyone who wants to safeguard live music,"" said chief exexutive Michael Dugher.

This video can not be played Dutch attack eyewitness: ""I heard people yell: Shooting, shooting"" Another witness told Dutch public broadcaster NOS that he had helped an injured woman when the tram came to an emergency stop. ""I looked behind me and saw someone lying there behind the tram,"" he said. ""People got out of their cars... and they started to lift her up. ""I helped to pull her out and then I saw a gunman run towards us, with his gun raised,"" he said. ""I heard people yell 'Shooter! Shooter!' and I started to run."" The gunman then fled the scene, leading to the manhunt which lasted for much of Monday. Schools were closed and security was increased at airports and mosques while counter-terrorism police worked to locate the suspect. A photograph of him was posted on social media by police, who warned people against approaching him. A number of raids were reportedly carried out and counter-terrorism officers were pictured patrolling the streets near to where the attack happened. Police surrounded a building not far from the scene of the attack and arrested Mr Tanis on Monday evening. Police said the shooting appeared to be a terrorist incident but, at a press conference on Monday evening, a prosecutor said it could have been motivated by ""family reasons"". Mr Tanis was known to Dutch police, the prosecutor added. The threat level was temporarily raised to its highest point in the province of Utrecht Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the country had been ""jolted by an attack"", which he described as ""deeply disturbing"". ""There are many questions and rumours,"" he said. ""It is unclear what the motives are behind this attack."" He said local elections would go ahead as planned on Wednesday but flags would be flown at half-mast. Leaders from around the world, including French President Emmanuel Macron and Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez, offered their condolences. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said the EU ""stands side by side with the Netherlands and its people during these difficult times."" Police surrounded a house earlier on Monday The threat level in Utrecht was reduced following the arrest. It had earlier been raised to its highest level and paramilitary police posted to airports and mosques. Utrecht University closed all its buildings and trains were not allowed to run into the city's central station. Utrecht, the Netherlands' fourth largest city, has a population of about 340,000. Crime levels are low and gun killings are rare, which is the case for much of the country.

Witness recalls horror of 'crush',"Police said a large group of young people had been waiting to get into the disco An eyewitness to an incident in Cookstown, County Tyrone, in which three teenagers died, has described how ""pushing and shoving"" led to ""literal crushing"". Lauren Bullock, 17, Connor Currie, 16, and Morgan Barnard, 17, died after reports of a crush outside the Greenvale Hotel on Sunday night. The hotel was hosting a St Patrick's Day party. Eimear Tallon recalled the horror in a Facebook post on Monday: ""It started with pushing and shoving but everyone was still laughing and having a good time. Then the literal crushing started. The people on the outside of this line were so determined to get in they felt the need to not only push us against the wall but push with all their strength. No matter how much we screamed and pushed back, there was no movement. Flowers were left outside the Greenvale Hotel in Cookstown on Monday Two of my friends fell to the ground. I tried to pull them up but at that point there was no room for them to even come back up. So I started screaming at the top of my lungs: My friends are on the ground, move back! My friends have fainted, move back! My friends can't breathe, move back! Nothing. Not one bit of movement. I could still see people laughing with no idea what was going on. At this point I thought my friends were going to die, I was standing up and I couldn't breathe so I couldn't imagine how they felt. Daylight on Monday revealed the scene of the incident I was hysterically screaming for people to move but it was only the people around me who knew the seriousness. With more and more pushing, I also fell. But the thing about me was that I wasn't on the ground, I was on top of someone, and this person was on top of someone else. As I looked down I could see multiple bodies underneath me and as I looked up I could see multiple bodies on top of me. It was the most traumatic, frightening and stressful moment of my life. I was looking about for my friends and trying to keep my head up. As dramatic as it sounds, I closed my eyes for a little and accepted what was going to happen however, an elbow to my throat soon woke me up. Signs of the panic remained in the hotel car park People were scratching, biting and grabbing anything they could to pull themselves up to breathe. I think that's what really shows the seriousness of it all - people were literally fighting for their lives. It got to a point where even when I had my eyes open.  I couldn't see. It felt like this went on forever but eventually I felt bodies being dragged over me and beside me. It wasn't the bouncers and it wasn't the police, it was the young people in the line who pulled me out. My leg was caught underneath someone and my hair was caught somewhere else, my jeans were pulled down around my thighs and my jersey above my head but I was getting pulled out nonetheless. I lay on the ground and opened my eyes, I remember seeing some motionless legs, a few socks and shoes and then I was pulled up and brought away. I rang my parents to explain what had happened and let them know I was okay, I then tried to find my friends. I ran about frantically. I saw a young boy lying motionless trying to be resuscitated by the ambulance crew and I saw his friends screech as they found out he wasn't going to make it. I don't think I will ever experience more relief in my life than when I saw one of my friends that had fallen, I was shocked she was alive. We all eventually found each other apart from my other friend that had fallen. Forensic officers at the scene on Monday We heard people had seen him, that he was roughed up but he was okay, I needed to see him myself though. He then came running towards us sobbing and all we could do was hug him. These 'people' aren't just 'people', they were young people, teenagers at 16/17 years old. They were only children. It could've been anyone. Unfortunately, a friend of mine who I had seen in the line and chatted to minutes beforehand has died. Morgan and the two other angels, just like the rest of us, left their families last night for an enjoyable night out but unlike the rest of us, they didn't make it home. My heart breaks for their poor families. There is no sugar coating what happened last night.""

"Sala transfer flights probe urgedA series of flights around the Cardiff City striker transfer should be investigated, says aviation body.Wales","This video can not be played Emiliano Sala was on the light aircraft, which went missing on 21 January There are calls for a series of flights in the weeks before the fatal crash which killed footballer Emiliano Sala to be investigated by regulators. The aviation trade body Air Charter Association told BBC Wales it believes there are grounds to investigate other flights linked to the Â£15m transfer. These carried Sala, his agent, Cardiff City officials and others between the UK and France in December and January. Sala's plane crashed in the English Channel on 21 January. The Argentinian striker, 28, had been returning for his first training session after completing his club record move to Cardiff City from Nantes FC. Sala's remains were recovered from the plane wreckage found on the seabed in early February, but pilot David Ibbotson, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, is still missing. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is currently investigating what happened to the Piper Malibu light aircraft. However Air Charter Association (Baca) says it was concerned other flights involved in the footballer's transfer may not have been properly licensed. Who owned the plane? What does the interim air accident report say? Agent: 'The tragic events have shocked us all' Family's tribute to Sala The story of Emiliano Sala Air accident investigators' photo showing the rear left side of the fuselage The fatal flight and others which preceded it were commissioned and paid for by football agent Willie McKay and his family. In an exclusive interview with BBC Wales, Dave Edwards, chief executive officer of the Air Charter Association (Baca), warned the ""underground growth"" of illegal and so-called ""grey"" charter flights was putting passengers at risk. These relate to flights which are not properly licensed under regulations governing aircraft and pilots. He said the organisation's concerns about the sector date back about seven years and that they hold regular meetings with both the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) and the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (Easa) to discuss the issue. Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson Mr Edwards said: ""The football agent has said on the record that they paid for a series of flights. ""We've done some background research into all of those flights and we're concerned more than ever that all of them have the potential to have, certainly, questions to be asked about them, which is what we've pushed the CAA to be doing recently and also Easa because the origin of the flight was in France so that comes under (their) territory. ""There's enough circumstantial evidence here that would make us push the authorities to do a full investigation into the background to ensure it was compliant."" Baca has done its own research through the European air traffic control agency and established the various operators and pilots for the flights linked to the Sala deal. BBC Wales has approached all those involved and invited them to respond to the questions raised by Baca. 5 December 2018- Flight from Stapleford in Essex to Nantes - carrying Cardiff City manager Neil Warnock, assistant manager Kevin Blackwell, Willie McKay and Mark McKay to see Emiliano Sala play against Marseilles 6 December- party returns from Nantes to Cardiff.Both flights made on G-KARE, operated by Surrey-based Flexifly Aircraft Hire Ltd 8 January 2019- Flight from Cardiff to Nantes - carrying Neil Warnock, Cardiff City player liaison Callum Davies, Willie and Mark McKay to meet Sala and his agent. They're flown back to Cardiff the same day.On N531EA, owned by Guernsey-based Channel Jets 14 January- Sala's agent, Meissa N'Diaye, flown from Paris to Nantes. N'Diaye and Sala are flown from Nantes to Cardiff to have a look around the Cardiff City Stadium, returning to Nantes the same day. N'Diaye is then flown back to Paris.All flights made on N843TE - owned by Channel Jets 18 January- Sala flies from Nantes to Cardiff for a medical and to sign his contract with Cardiff City.Via Channel Jets in N531EA.Sala's agent N'Diaye - who has travelled to Cardiff for the signing via a commercial flight -flown back to Paris by Lord George Porchester in his own aircraft, N14EF 19 January-Sala flown back to Nantes by David Ibbotson onN264DBto bid farewell to his Nantes team-mates and make personal arrangements. Mr Ibbotson books into a hotel to await the return leg of the journey - on 21 January - to deliver Sala back to Cardiff for his first training session 21 January- the flight leaves Nantes at 19:15 and disappears from radar around an hour into the journey. The final radar track record - given in the AAIB's interim report In its interim report on the Piper Malibu crash, the AAIB stated that Mr Ibbotson did not hold a commercial pilot's licence and could only fly passengers in the EU on a cost-sharing basis, not for reward. The AAIB is continuing to investigate and is expected to report on its findings early next year. It has already released information about the flight path, including radar records from its final moments. BBC Wales understands that all the earlier flights linked to the transfer deal were filed on flight plans as ""general aviation"" - therefore private, rather than commercial flights - and that none flew under an Air Operator's Certificate (AOC). An AOC is obtained from the CAA - for a cost - and provides a structure for air charter companies, including safety, flight operations, ground operations, compliance and training. Without this, BACA said the series of flights around Sala's transfer could only be operated on a ""dry lease"" basis - where an aircraft is leased by a customer and a pilot hired separately - or on a cost-share basis. One of the aviation companies involved - Channel Jets, a legitimate air charter company based in Guernsey - does hold an AOC, but only planes registered in Guernsey can be included on this. BBC Wales understands that the two jets used by Channel Jets on seven separate occasions did not fall under the AOC at the time. Both planes used were registered in America, which means they could not be flown commercially in Europe without the express permission of US regulator the Federal Aviation Authority and the CAA. The flights were listed on flight plans, as non-commercial. Sala pilot 'dropped out of training' Sala pilot's licence to be looked into BBC Wales has discovered that eight days after the plane carrying Sala crashed, one of these planes was de-registered in the US and re-registered as a Guernsey-based plane. It was then placed on the company's AOC. The BBC has approached Channel Jets, who declined to comment beyond saying they had ""provided full details to the CAA"". Asked whether the Sala tragedy could serve as a ""watershed moment"" for the aviation industry, Mr Edwards said: ""Our industry always had this line that it would take one famous person to be killed in an aircraft accident for it to come to the fore. ""It's certainly a moment which has brought the spotlight of attention onto charter flying in general. ""We have circumstantial evidence about other flights that take place every day. I do think eventually something has to give."" The CAA said: ""As there is an on-going AAIB investigation into this accident, it would be inappropriate for us to comment at the moment. We will be assisting that investigation as required."" BBC Wales has invited Willie McKay to comment for this story.

Facebook gives new details on NZ attack videoFacebook says a live-stream of the NZ attacks was seen fewer than 200 times as pressure on the firm rises.Business,"A tribute to victims of the Christchurch mosque attacks The original live video of last week's Christchurch attacks was viewed 4,000 times before it was removed, Facebook has said. On Friday, a gunman live-streamed for 17 minutes the attack on two mosques that killed 50 people. Fewer than 200 people had watched it live and the first user report of the video had come 12 minutes after it had ended, Facebook said. But by then a copy had been placed on alt-right file-sharing site 8chan. Once alerted to the video, Facebook removed the original and hashed it - essentially made a digital fingerprint - meaning that material that was visibly similar to the original could be automatically detected and removed. And within 24 hours, it had blocked 1.2 million copies at the point of upload and deleted another 300,000. However, copies that had been edited or recorded from a screen had proved harder to spot. It said it was working with the New Zealand Police on its investigation. ""We continue to work around the clock to prevent this content from appearing on our site, using a combination of technology and people,"" wrote Facebook vice-president Chris Sonderbyin an update posted on the platform,external. In the wake of the shooting, several world leaders have called on social media companies to take more responsibility for the extremist material posted on their platforms. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said social networks were ""the publisher not just the postman"", in reference to their potential liability for the material shared on them. Who were the Christchurch victims? Social sites seek to stop NZ attack clips Australia's leader, Scott Morrison, expressed concern over the ""unrestricted role"" of internet technologies in terrorist attacks. In a letter to Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who also chairs the G20, he asked for the issue to be discussed at the upcoming meeting of the G20. ""It is unacceptable to treat the internet as an ungoverned space,"" he wrote. Mr Morrison said the aim was to ""agree on co-ordinated action to afford greater protection from terrorist violence"". ""It is imperative that the global community works together to ensure that technology firms meet their moral obligation to protect the communities which they serve and from which they profit."" UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid also called on social media firms to take actionto stop extremism on their channels. Facebook seems to have acted pretty swiftly in the circumstances and it is striking that it was an 8chan user who made the video go viral. But the real question is whether it was sensible to give between two and three billion people instant access to a live broadcasting platform Facebook must have known would be impossible to moderate in real time.

Talks on next Brexit steps after Bercow twist,"With 10 days to go before Brexit, Theresa May will meet her cabinet on Tuesday The government says it will try to get Theresa May's Brexit deal through the Commons, despite Speaker John Bercow throwing the process into doubt. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay suggested a vote could take place next week - after Mrs May has sought a delay to Brexit from the EU. Mr Bercow has ruled that the PM can not bring her deal back for a third vote without ""substantial"" changes. The UK is due to leave the EU in 10 days with or without a deal. The prime minister had hoped to have another try at getting MPs to back the withdrawal deal she has agreed with the EU this week - but Speaker Bercow effectively torpedoed that with hissurprise interventionon Monday. What Bercow ruling means for Brexit Who is the Speaker and why does he shout order? Brexit: What could happen next? Stephen Barclay told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the Commons Speaker had made a ""serious ruling"" and ministers were giving it ""serious consideration"". He said it was important to ""respect the referee"" and abide by his decisions - but, he added, Mr Bercow himself had said, in the past, that if Parliament was guided only by precedent then ""nothing ever would change"". Mr Bercow cited a ruling from 1604 to justify his decision to block a third vote, after the PM's deal was rejected for a second time last week, by 149 votes. Mr Barclay suggested that MPs would ""find a way"" to get another vote, if the government manages to persuade enough of them, including the 10 Democratic Unionists, to change their mind and back the deal. He suggested it would also depend on Theresa May getting ""clarity"" from the EU on the ""terms of an extension"" to Brexit. He accepted that there would now have to be a ""short extension"" to the Article 50 withdrawal process if the deal gets through Parliament, to get the necessary legislation through. Mrs May is writing to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask for an extension. The PM has warned Brexiteer Tories that a long extension may be needed if they do not back her deal but Downing Street said it would not reveal what the PM has asked for at this stage. There would, however, need to be a vote in both Houses of Parliament to change the 29 March departure date, which is written into law, the PM's spokesman said. Mr Bercow refused to discuss his decision when quizzed by the BBC, as he made his way to Parliament earlier. Government ministers and MPs have been floating different ideas on how to get a vote on the prime minister's deal, in light of the Speaker's ruling. This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow rejects further Brexit votes without changes to motion Children and Families' minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Newsnight that one of the options was for MPs to vote on whether to ignore the 400-year-old convention that Mr Bercow had cited in making his ruling. Mr Zahawi, who is a Brexiteer, was asked whether the government was going to bypass Mr Bercow's ruling. He said: ""Let's see, we have to look at all our options."" A really simple guide to the UK leaving the EU How could Brexit be delayed? Bercow chucks a spanner in the works Can May still bring back her Brexit deal? Solicitor General Robert Buckland said a vote to overrule the Speaker was the most likely way forward. He told BBC Radio Wiltshire that if enough MPs show they want another vote on the Brexit deal, it can return to Parliament despite the current block. He said this would be a more practical solution than asking the Queen to formally close and reopen Parliament, which some have suggested would get round the rule that MPs cannot be repeatedly asked to vote on the same question in a Parliamentary session. Nikki da Costa, former director of legal affairs at Downing Street, told the Today programme: ""I think the PM and the government can still have a third meaningful vote... but it will be extraordinarily difficult to have a fourth meaningful vote so I think MPs really have to think very carefully if that vote does come back."" There is also a question mark over whether any agreement reached by Theresa May in Brussels on extending Brexit would overrule a vote by MPs, as it would have force under international law. Angela Merkel: I will fight to the last hour of the deadline German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would struggle until the last possible moment to achieve an orderly Brexit, saying the interests of Germany, Britain and the EU were at stake. ""I will fight to the last hour of the deadline on 29 March for an orderly exit,"" she told a press conference in Berlin. ""We don't have a lot of time for it but still have a few days."" EU ministers are, meanwhile, meeting in Brussels to prepare for this week's summit.

Tributes paid to hotel crush victims,"Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie died in the incident Police investigating the deaths of three teenagers at a St Patrick's Day party crush have said more could easily have been killed. Lauren Bullock, 17, Morgan Barnard, 17, and 16-year-old Connor Currie,died after the incident outside the Greenvale Hotel, Cookstown, on Sunday. CCTV showed as many as 400 people outside the hotel, the PSNI said. They have tracked down 160 witnesses, and reassured others they will not face questions about being under-age. Three teens dead after hotel disco 'crush' 'Then the literal crushing started' ""I think that we are fortunate, if that is the right word to use,"" said Det Ch Supt Raymond Murray. ""In these circumstances we are looking at three deaths... Bad enough, a horrendous tragedy, but we could easily could be looking at more."" A number of young people who witnessed the crush have complained about the response of security staff at the hotel as the emergency unfolded. Eyewitness Eboney Johnston told BBC News NI that the bouncers did not appear to ""realise the seriousness of what was going on"". She described seeing a toppling effect on the crowd during ""pushing and shoving"" in the queue. This video can not be played 'People just kept falling and falling' The 16-year-old has been to the Greenvale disco before and claimed that ""pushing and shoving would be normal"" in the queue. Ms Johnston explained at a previous disco at Christmas, the bouncers kept the queue in a straight line and removed any customers who were pushing and shoving, but she claimed that bouncers did not appear to take the same action on Sunday. BBC News NI put Ms Johnston's claims to the Greenvale Hotel, but its spokeswoman replied that it was ""not possible or appropriate"" for the hotel to comment ""while these matters are the subject of a police investigation"". As she laid flowers at the hotel gates on Tuesday, Ms Johnston praised the actions of some of the young people at the scene who tried to help those who had fallen in the crush. ""People just kept falling and falling,"" she recalled, explaining that some people fell over as they bent down to pick others up. Tributes have been paid to the three teenagers who died at the St Patrick's Day party The police said a large group of young people had been waiting to get into the disco at about 21:30 GMT. The security camera footage is being examined and police have appealed for videos captured by people at the disco. Officers have already spoken to a number of young people who were in the queue for the event; they plan to speak to others in the coming days. A number of parents had expressed concern that their under-age children were trying to enter the premises, added Mr Murray. He reassured them they were not the target of police inquiries. This video can not be played Cookstown crush victim 'had such a unique smile' After discussions with the Director of the Public Prosecution Service, Stephen Herron, the PSNI had agreed ""that is not an issue in this investigation"", he said. ""The focus of our investigation... is about trying to find answers for the families of the three teenagers who tragically died. ""We need to know what you saw so the heartbroken families of Connor, Lauren and Morgan know what happened to their children."" Police have asked people who were at the event and who have video and photographsnot to publish them online but to upload them to the Major Incident Public Portal.,external A memorial service for the victims was held earlier on Tuesday in Cookstown's Holy Trinity Church, where the principal of Holy Trinity College called on pupils not to bottle up their concerns. ""Talk to the staff, talk to your parents, and let them know what is on your mind,"" said Isabel Russell. ""Keep yourself busy, get on with your normal routine as best as you can. ""Feelings will change over time, and how you are feeling today, tomorrow, next week, will change with time. Catherine McHugh, principal at St Patrick's College in Dungannon, where Lauren was a pupil, described her as a ""leader among her peers and a quiet, strong and loyal presence"". ""A treasured friend and capable young lady with a bright future,"" she added. Prayer services have been held to mourn the three teenagers A relative of Morgan's said he was ""just a bundle of joy"". Connor was described as ""much loved and highly thought of"", while Lauren was an ""incredible friend"". Her best friend, Cora McKay, said Lauren was ""the most bubbly person you'd ever meet"". ""You were just met with her smile,"" she told BBC News NI ""It was just such a unique smile and she was just an incredible friend."" This video can not be played 'More could have died' in Cookstown crush In a Facebook post,external, Edendork Gaelic Athletic Association football club said it was devastated by the death of ""much loved and highly thought of"" player and member Connor. ""Connor will forever be remembered with the greatest affection by all associated with our club and indeed the wider Edendork community."" A relative of Morgan's said he was ""just a bundle of joy, always bouncing around, he seemed to have a lot of energy in him - a gentleman, he was."" Fintan Donnelly, the principal of St Patrick's Academy in Dungannon, where the two boys were pupils, said the tragedy had ""had a huge impact on the whole school community"". Books of condolence have also been opened in Cookstown, Dungannon and Magherafelt. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Karen Bradley, visited Cookstown on Tuesday to offer her condolences to all those affected by the tragedy. She met members of the emergency services and council representatives and thanked them for their efforts in the aftermath of the crush. Allow Twitter content?

"England water shortage 'within 25 years'Wasting water should be as taboo as blowing smoke in a baby's face, says Environment Agency boss.UK","Low water levels at Wayoh Reservoir near Bolton in the UK heatwave in July 2018 Within 25 years England will not have enough water to meet demand, the head of the Environment Agency is warning. The impact of climate change, combined with population growth, means the country is facing an ""existential threat"", Sir James Bevan told the Waterwise Conference in London. He wants to see wasting water become ""as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby"". ""We all need to use less water and use it more efficiently,"" he said. Sir James Bevan was appointed chief executive of the Environment Agency - the public body responsible for protecting the environment and wildlife in England - in 2015 after a career as a diplomat. He told his audience that, in around 20 to 25 years, England would reach the ""jaws of death - the point at which, unless we take action to change things, we will not have enough water to supply our needs"". ""We won't have long term water security unless all of us change our behaviour,"" Sir James said Huge costs of climate impacts in 2018 Climate change is 'shrinking winter' How much water goes from Wales to England? The tone of Sir James' warnings is more strident than we're used to. Phrases like ""existential threat"" and ""jaws of death"" are, he admits, designed to jolt people into facing uncomfortable truths. The problem is the unfortunate combination of growing population and potentially shrinking supply by 2040. That implies a suite of tough decisions like persuading consumers and firms to use less water. The most pressing decisions, though, are over hardware. Infrastructure developments like giant pipes transferring water to the South East will be years in the planning. There's a risk to wildlife, too. But most controversial are plans for reservoirs. Locals have been fighting one in South Oxfordshire since the 1990s. Protestors say they acknowledge the water shortage problem but believe water firms are exaggerating the level of population growth. What's more, they say, reservoirs in a water shortage area like the Thames Valley is not a wise solution. And they will fight on. Alongside action being taken by the government, water companies and regulators, Sir James wants the public to use less water, and use it more efficiently. Currently, people in England use an average of 140 litres of water a day. Sir James is calling on people to cut their usage to 100 litres - the target set by Waterwise, which campaigns for water efficiency. ""In the last few decades we've radically changed behaviour on smoking (everybody did it) and seatbelts (nobody wore them),"" he is expected to say. ""In the last two years we've changed behaviour on plastic. We need water wastage to be as socially unacceptable as blowing smoke in the face of a baby or throwing your plastic bags into the sea."" Get a low-flush toilet Take short showers, not deep baths Use the most efficient shower-head Get a water-efficient washing machine Don't use your dishwasher until it's full Turn the tap off when brushing your teeth Don't water your lawn (it will survive) ""If by 2050 we reduced per capita consumption to 100 litres a day, leakage by 50%, and did nothing else, it would provide enough water for an additional 20 million people without taking any more from the environment,"" Sir James said. Sir James in his speech declined to get embroiled in the political arguments over whether water companies should remain privatised or be taken back into public ownership. However, he did say that the present companies needed to up their game - on fixing leaks, bearing down on pollution and making the necessary investments that would future-proof the water delivery system. Reality Check: What have water companies done on leaks? And as well as reducing demand for water, he also called for a big push on maximising its supply. This, he said, would include: Water transfers between regions, from areas of water surplus to areas of deficit Desalination plants that convert brackish water from into clean drinking water New reservoirs to be built to hold water for use in times of severe water stress ""We have not built a new reservoir in the UK for decades, largely because clearing all the planning and legal hurdles necessary is so difficult and local opposition so fierce,"" he explained. But, Sir James argued, the economic case for greater resilience was clear, citing a 2016 Environment Agency report that found ""that while a severe drought would cost each household more than Â£100, the cost per household of the investment that would greatly reduce the risk was only Â£4 a year."" The Environment Agencyhas previously warnedof water shortages by 2050 andthe government has already suggested,externalthat people's water use should be reduced, in its 25-year plan published last year. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have separate public bodies responsible for environment protection, because the environment is a devolved matter.

Cancer doctor shortage 'puts care at risk',"A shortage of cancer doctors will hamper the ability of the NHS to provide cutting-edge care, experts are warning. A Royal College of Radiologists census of 62 major UK cancer centres found more than 7.5% of consultant posts were vacant, with services maintained only by large amounts of overtime. It said this was unsustainable and would put treatments at risk. But the NHS said plans were in place to increase doctor numbers. Doctor training places are increasing, as is investment in the NHS. But the college said this was not enough to cover the increases in demand for care, particularly given the number of doctors who are retiring. Dr Tom Roques, from the college, said: ""The UK is seeing more and more fantastic innovations in cancer treatment from the introduction of new immunotherapy drugs to high energy proton beam radiotherapy. ""These doctors are vital to the rollout of these new therapies but we do not have enough of them and our workforce projections are increasingly bleak.""  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The college asked cancer centres about the number of consultant clinical oncologists they had in post. These are the senior cancer doctors that specialise in non-surgical cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It found there were the equivalent of 863 full-time doctors in post. The centres had another 70 posts that were vacant - with most of those unfilled for at least a year. That is a vacancy rate of more than 7.5%, compared with 5% five years ago. The college also asked about the amount of overtime being done. It found the full-time doctors already in post were working just over six hours extra a week on average. And, the college said, if this was taken into account, the NHS was 184 clinical oncologists short - a figure it predicted would worsen in the coming years. The college is worried about the stress and burnout its members are facing, pointing out half of clinical oncologists retire before the age of 60. And as well as the threat to new treatments, the college said, the shortage of doctors would also be a factor in delays to patients receiving treatment. Last week, NHS figures in England showed long waits had reached their highest levels since records began, in 2009. The rest of the UK is also struggling to see patients within the target time of 62 days. Dr Rosie Loftus, chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""We know that hard-working NHS professionals are already struggling to cope with escalating workloads, which are in part due to staffing challenges. ""Gaps in the workforce can lead to longer waits to start treatment, which in turn add to the worry and anxiety many people already feel following their diagnosis. ""To meet the bold ambitions for improving cancer care , we urgently need a costed plan to increase and sustain the number of staff needed to deliver them."" While there are shortages of staff in place, it is worth pointing out that the overall numbers of clinical oncologists working in the NHS is increasing by about 5% a year. It is just that these increases have not been enough to cope with the rising demand. The government has promised more money for the NHS. In England, services will have an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023 and cancer has been made a key priority for spending. Extra funding is also being made available to other parts of the UK, under the plan announced by the prime minister last year summer. The number of doctors in training is also rising. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care in England said: ""Improving cancer care and reducing waits is a priority for the NHS and we recently unveiled a series of commitments as part of the NHS Long Term Plan backed by Â£200m to fund new ways to rapidly detect and treat cancer.""

Hospital infection inquiry begins at HolyroodMSPs are investigating all healthcare facilities in Scotland following several deaths related to infection outbreaks.Scotland politics,"Hospital infection rates are being investigated by a Holyrood committee Communication between infection control nurses and maintenance staff at a Glasgow hospital hit by a series of outbreaks was ""not particularly great"", MSPs have been told. Holyrood's health committee launched an inquiry in the wake of problems at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Two people died after contracting an infection related to pigeon droppings. MSPs were told a ""backlog"" of repairs had built up and that there were issues with communication about the work. However, they also heard that Scotland's overall performance in infection control was ""right up there with the very best"", and that ""Glasgow as a health board are actually doing better than the Scottish average"". The Holyrood inquiry is looking at safety and infection control across NHS Scotland, with a wider focus than the investigation into the QEUH ordered by the health secretary. Child's death links to Glasgow hospital pigeon infection Look back on the committee session on Holyrood Live. The MSPs' inquiry was set up after problems with ventilation, water hygiene and building maintenance were identified at Scotland's largest hospital. They want to examine whether infection control is adequate and whether more can be done to improve patient safety. Two patients died after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital The committee has already accepted written evidence and held a meeting with executives responsible for managing and monitoring safety in healthcare settings. Alastair Delaney, director of quality assurance at watchdog Healthcare Improvement Scotland, published a report earlier in March highlighting ""challenges"" in communication between estates staff and the infection control team at the Glasgow hospital. He told the committee this was ""something that we would be concerned about across the country"", because it was ""absolutely essential that there is good working relationships between the nursing staff - particularly for infection control - and the buildings staff."" He added: ""Obviously in that particular circumstance, we had quite a large backlog of repairs to be done and the communication was not particularly great about how those were being managed and what happened when they were being reported and potentially having to be reported again. ""So it demonstrated that that level of leadership governance was really important."" Alastair Delaney from Healthcare Improvement Scotland said there had been ""quite a large backlog"" of repairs at the hospital Phillip Couser, an official with NHS National Services Scotland and Health Protection Scotland, told members that there was no evidence of an increase in deaths due to infection. He said that while ""some boards are doing better than others"", Scotland's overall performance in infection control is ""right up there with the very best"". Why do patients get ill with hospital-acquired infections? The troubled past of Glasgow's QUEH Ahead of the session, the committee's convener Lewis Macdonald said: ""Recently there have been increasing incidents of infection in Scotland's hospitals raising serious questions about the safety and control of our healthcare environments. ""Our session on Tuesday is vital for the committee to learn the scale of the problem and ensure robust measures are in place to combat any issues. ""This evidence session will allow us to hear directly from those responsible for the healthcare facilities in Scotland and we will ensure any issues raised are brought to the attention of the Scottish government."" In December, a 10-year-old boy and a 73-year-old woman diedafter contracting the fungus Cryptococcus, which is linked to bird droppings. In the case of the child, it was a contributory factor in his death. Although the woman was found to have the fungal infection it was not the cause of her death. Both cases are being investigated by the Crown Office. Lewis Macdonald wants to understand the scale of the problem The Cryptococcus is believed to have come from pigeon droppings located in a plant room on the hospital's roof. Prosecutors are also investigating the death of a third patient at the QEUH. A 63-year-old woman was one of two patients affected by the fungal infection Mucor in January. Separately, 23 children contracted bloodstream infections in the cancer wards at the Royal Hospital for Children - which shares the Queen Elizabeth campus - between January and September last year. The infections were thought to be linked to bacteria in the water supply - with a report later finding ""widespread contamination"" at both hospitals. The inquiry also followsthe death of a patient at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley on 7 Februaryafter contracting the hospital infection Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The bacteria was named as a contributing factor in the death. Andtwo babies died after contracting the Staphylococcus aureus bacteriumat the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in January.

"Peaky blinders: Celebrating Scotland's MunrosTo mark 100 years since the death of Sir Hugh Munro, climbers pick their favourite Scottish peaks classed as Munros.Scotland","The view to Braeriach, the third highest mountain in Britain and one of Scotland's 282 Munros, in a picture by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service To mark 100 years since the death of mountaineer Sir Hugh Munro, whose name is used to describe Scottish mountains with a height of 914m (3,000ft) or more, we asked climbers to pick their favourites from the list of 282 peaks. ""That's a very difficult question,"" says outdoor writer, photographer and long-distance walker Chris Townsend when asked to name the Munro closest to his heart. ""Overall I think my favourite is Ben Macdui, because of its situation at the heart of a huge area of wild land and spectacular mountain scenery."" Soggy Ben Nevis can be remarkably dry In pictures: Scotland's mountains Britain's second highest mountain, 1,309m (4,295ft) Ben Macdui is in the Cairngorms. The mountain is said to be haunted by a supernatural creature, The Big Grey Man of Ben Macdui. The myth describes him as a Scottish Bigfoot, said to loom large in shifting grey cloud. The summit of Ben Macdui in the Cairngorms The Big Grey Man of Ben Macdui first came to prominence in the 1920s during a dinner speech at an annual gathering of the Cairngorm Club in Aberdeen. Its honorary president, the highly respected mountaineer Prof John Norman Collie, told of a frightening experience on Ben Macdui in the Cairngorms 35 years earlier. It is believed Prof Collie had been spooked bya weather effect know as a brocken spectre. Chris first climbed the Munro more than 40 years ago. Chris Townsend says it is hard to pick a favourite Munro ""I've been walking in the Scottish hills since 1976 when I climbed Cairn Gorm and Ben Macdui, my first Munros,"" he says. ""On the summit I feel far from anywhere and the views are tremendous. There's a feeling of seriousness, remoteness and vast space."" Rock climber and journalist Natalie Berry'sfavourite is another giant of the Scottish mountains. ""Despite having grown up in the north of Glasgow from the age of three, it wasn't until my early 20s that I started venturing into the hills,"" she says. ""As a rock climber, I haven't done nearly as many Munros as a hillwalker might notch up, but my favourite would have to be Ben Nevis."" Climber Natalie Berry on Ben Nevis One of the best known Munros, Ben Nevis is Britain's highest mountain at 1,345m (4,413ft). Natalie reached its summit with Lochaber-based Ben Nevis expert Dave MacLeod having climbed a winter route together called Pink Panther. It was the first route Natalie had climbed on the Ben. ""Leading up the snow slope to the summit was quite exciting, and as I pulled over the cornice at the top my foot slipped,"" she says. ""Thankfully my axes held, but it was a nonetheless memorable moment."" Who was Sir Hugh Munro? Hugh Munro, whose family were Scottish landowners, was born in London in 1856 and brought up at Lindertis near Kirriemuir in Angus. He was educated at Crieff, Winchester and Cambridge. Munro went on to learn German in Stuttgart, studied a business course in London and served as a cavalryman in the Basuto War in southern Africa. He had climbed in the Alps while in Germany, and he continued this interest in mountains when he settled at the family estate near Kirriemuir. Munro was a founder and president ofthe Scottish Mountaineering Club (SMC),external. And it was the club that set him the task of listing all mountains of 3,000ft or more. Celebrations on Meall Ghaordaidh near Killin after a Munroist bagged his final Munro. Picture by Will Stark, Edinburgh According to The Munro Society,external, Munro was the ideal person for this work because of his meticulous record-keeping, enthusiasm for work in the outdoors and fascination with mountain landscapes. Munro never managed to climb all the mountains he listed. In 1919, he died of pneumonia while running a canteen for soldiers in Provence, France. He was 63. But Munro's fascination with Scottish mountains lives on in the many people who climb them today. Among them are Munroists or Munro-baggers, climbers dedicated to ascending every one of the 282 listed Munros. Those who accomplish this feat are known by the SMC as ""compleators"". Sir Hugh's achievements are celebrated as part of the exhibition at theKirriemuir Gateway to the Glens Museum,external. There is also Munro Society exhibition dedicated to the mountaineerrunning at Perth's A K Bell Library,external. Climber, writer and film-maker Dave MacLeod, who accompanied Natalie on her first ascent of Pink Panther, has been walking and climbing in Scotland's hills for 25 years. ""I haven't climbed all the Munros because I've been more focused on the climbing side. For this reason Ben Nevis is undoubtedly my favourite Munro,"" he says. ""Its size and many steep and hidden coires make it seem more like a mountain range than a single mountain. ""There's enough interest on the Ben for a lifetime of climbing, or indeed interest of multiple types."" Helen Rennard on Bidean nam Bian in Glen Coe Last year, Helen Rennard became the first woman to complete the Winter Tranter Round, a 36-mile challenge that involves 19 Munros, among them the Mamores, Aonachs and Ben Nevis. ""My first Munro was Cairn Gorm at the age of 11, during a family summer holiday to Aviemore,"" she says. ""There was then a gap of six years, until I was 17, when I went on a week's winter mountaineering trip to Glen Coe and Ben Nevis with a climbing club from Stafford. ""It was me plus a load of men in their 40s, which was a bit odd, looking back on it."" Lochnagar in a picture taken by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service Helen got the winter climbing bug when she was 20 and at university in Aberdeen. Her favourite Munro is 1,155m Lochnagar, a mountain not too far from Aberdeen. ""I love the view of the coire in winter, especially when you get your first glimpse of it. ""The whole place has huge sentimental value for me as it's where I started Scottish winter climbing and I've had many days out in winter there with good friends."" The other Hugh Munro Slioch in an image taken by the Scottish Avalanche Information Service Today, there is a Hugh Munro close to completing his first round of all the 282 Munros. From Westhill, Aberdeenshire, he just has a handful of mountains left to bag and plans to finish with 981m (3,218ft) Slioch with its ""calendar views"" of Loch Maree in Wester Ross. ""When I got to 200 Munros I thought I would have to do them all,"" he says. ""I looked up the list that is maintained by the Scottish Mountaineering Club, where people register if they have completed the Munros, and I noticed no-one called Hugh Munro has ever done them all."" Hugh had hoped to have completed his round by the 100th anniversary of Sir Hugh Munro's death, but an injury sustained in a skiing accident hampered his progress. Now recovered, he has resumed his effort to complete his round. ""From an early age I have been interested in mountains,"" he says. ""When I was 14, I went on a camping trip through the Lairig Ghru in the Cairngorms. That was a life changing moment and I have never looked back since then."" Fiona Russell, who runs the business Fiona Outdoors and is an outdoors and adventure journalist and blogger, has been climbing in Scotland's hills for about 20 years. She says: ""I have always been a sporty person, enjoying judo, running, triathlon, cycling and skiing. However, I was around the age of 30 when I started to venture into the hills and mountains of Scotland. ""I started walking the Munros when I met my husband Gordon (Lacey) almost 10 years ago. I never imagined I would be as close as I am now to finishing a round."" Fiona and her husband Gordon on Liathach in Torridon She adds: ""My husband finished his first round within about two years of us meeting. I walked around 80 of his last Munros in his first round with him. ""Some years later I realised I had walked more than half of the 282 Munros. Now I have just 42 to go."" Gordon, meanwhile, is two thirds of the way through his second round. Fiona has favourite groups of Munros. She says: ""It was on the Five Sisters of Kintail - with its three Munros, Sgurr na Ciste Duibhe, Sgurr na Carnach and Sgurr Fhuaran - that I first met Gordon. ""We became walking buddies and friends and then we got together romantically. We were married last year on a snowy mountain slope in British Columbia. At the top of Ben Starav. Simon Wallace captured these scenes for BBC Scotland's Your Pictures while climbing three Munros in nine hours with his son ""My second favourite group of Munros is across the glen on the South Glen Shiel Ridge. We enjoyed an amazing walk of the seven Munros there one fabulously sunny day in early summer some years ago. ""The Munro I'm most proud of is the Inaccessible Pinnacle on the Cuillin Ridge on Skye. ""I am not good with heights yet I made it to the top of that exposed rock."" Fiona adds: ""There are so many Munros that bring back amazing memories.""

"Ocado sales hit by warehouse fireThe firm had more orders per week, but their average size was slightly lower.Business","Ocado's revenue grew by 11.2% in the 13 weeks to 13 March compared with the same period last year, although the online food retailer's income was hit by a fire in its warehouse in February. It brought in Â£404m during the period, but the fire in its Andover base had a 1.2% impact on its sales. The firm had more orders per week, but their average size was slightly lower. Last month,Ocado announced a deal with Marks & Spencerto give the department store its first home delivery service. It will start in September 2020 at the latest, once Ocado's current deal with Waitrose has expired. More than 30,000 orders - 10% of Ocado's capacity - were processed at the Andover warehouse, which was on fire for four days. Chief executive Tim Steiner said: ""The fire has been a setback, but it will only be a temporary one. ""Our teams have been working hard to minimise any disruption to our customers and we will build a state-of-the-art replacement facility that reflects all the innovations and improvements we have made since Andover opened in November 2016."" Ocado warehouse fire in Andover finally out Inside Ocado's burning robotic warehouse Ocado also said that the initial investigation into the causes of the fire did not suggest there was any risk relating to its model, which relies on robotic warehouse machines to pack orders. Meanwhile, a temporary delivery outpost is being set up in Andover and capacity at another customer fulfilment centre in Erith is being increased faster than planned to cope with the disruption. Ocado is selling the operating system to other retailers and there was concern it could affect the other parts of its business. Mr Steiner said that with the Marks & Spencer deal, he felt that ""Ocado Retail has never been in a stronger position"". He added: ""We are looking forward to the future with excitement and determination."" Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Today's announcement leaves no doubt Ocado has its eyes firmly on the future, with the group letting investors know last month's warehouse fire will be nothing more than a temporary setback. ""The first quarter has gone about as well as can be expected and it's looking more and more like Ocado will make it over this bump in the road.""

UK scientists join race for lab-grown meatResearchers have grown animal cells on blades of grass - could a slaughter-free bacon supply be feasible?Science & Environment,"Scientists are racing to grow meat from pigs, chickens and cattle from cells alone British scientists have joined the race to produce meat grown in the lab rather than reared on the hoof. Scientists at the University of Bath have grown animal cells on blades of grass, in a step towards cultured meat. If the process can be reproduced on an industrial scale, meat lovers might one day be tucking into a slaughter-free supply of ""bacon"". The researchers say the UK can move the field forward through its expertise in medicine and engineering. Lab-based meat products are not yet on sale, though a US company, Just, has said its chicken nuggets, grown from cells taken from the feather of chicken that is still alive, will soon be in a few restaurants. We ate chicken without harming the bird. Really Could lab-grown meat be the future of food? Synthetic meat grown in Dutch lab Chemical engineer Dr Marianne Ellis, of the University of Bath, sees cultured meat as ""an alternative protein source to feed the world"". Cultured pig cells are being grown in her laboratory, which could one day lead to bacon raised entirely off the hoof. In the labs at Bath, the building blocks of artificial meat In the future, you would take a biopsy from a pig, isolate stem (master) cells, grow more cells, then put them into a bioreactor to massively expand them, says postgraduate student Nick Shorten of Aberystwyth University. ""And the pig's still alive and happy and you get lots of bacon at the end."" To replicate the taste and texture of bacon will take years of research. For structure, the cells must be grown on a scaffold. 2013:  First lab-grown burger, created by a team in the Netherlands at a cost of â¬250,000 - largely due to the time and labour needed to turn millions of tiny cells into meat December 2018: A ""steak""grown from cells in the lab and not requiring the slaughter of a cow was produced in Israel. It cost $50 for a small thin strip, but, according to its makers, needs perfecting. At Bath, they're experimenting with something that's entirely natural - grass. They're growing rodent cells, which are cheap and easy to use, on scaffolds of grass, as a proof of principle. ""The idea was to essentially, rather than feeding a cow grass and then us eating the meat - why don't we, in quotation marks, 'feed our cells grass',"" says Scott Allan, a postgraduate student in chemical engineering. ""We use it as a scaffold for them to grow on - and we then have an edible scaffold that can be incorporated into the final product."" Dr Marianne Ellis is leading the project The end product would be pure muscle tissue - basically, lean mince, rather than something with the taste and texture of a chop or steak, which means adding fat cells and connective cells to give it ""a bit more taste"". For cultured meat to be available widely in the future, cells will need to be grown on a very large scale in a commercial facility. ""What we're doing here is looking to design bioreactors, and the bioprocess around the bioreactors, to grow muscle cells on a large scale that is economical and safe and high quality, so we can supply the muscle cells as cultured meats to as many people as want it,"" says Dr Ellis. The world's first lab-grown burger was revealed in 2013 - at an eye-watering cost She envisages taking ""primary cells"" from a living or recently slaughtered animal, or using a population of ""immortalised"" cells, that will keep on dividing. ""Which means that you don't kill any animals; you have this immortal cell that can be used forever."" Slaughter-free meat is clearly a big selling point. Cultured meat might also be of interest to meat lovers who are concerned about the environmental problems that come with livestock production. Richard Parr is managing director for Europe of The Good Food Institute, a non-profit group that promotes alternatives to the products of conventional agriculture. He says cell-based meat has the potential to use much less land and water, produce less carbon dioxide, spare billions of animals from immense pain and suffering, and help fight anti-microbial resistance and food contamination. ""It's also a massive commercial opportunity, which companies, universities and governments should seize the opportunity to support and invest in,"" he argues. You can reduce your carbon foodprint by cutting down on red meats such as beef and lamb. According to Marianne Ellis, most analysis seems to suggest a significant reduction in greenhouse gases, land use and water use for cultured meat, while the implications for energy use are less clear. One recent study found lab-grown meatcould actually be worse for the climate than conventional meat- although the research did not look at water and land use. ""Cultured meat might be one of these promising alternatives to reduce agricultural emissions but until we get more production data we can't automatically assume that for the time being,"" says the author of the paper, John Lynch of the University of Oxford. The researchers at Bath see a future where cultured meat exists alongside traditional agriculture. Illtud Dunsford, co-founder with Marianne Ellis of the biotech start-up Cellular Agriculture, comes from a long line of farmers in Wales and is an advocate of traditional agriculture, but says there will be a need in the future to manage farmland for nature, with cattle playing a role, albeit in much smaller numbers. ""In my little farm in West Wales, ideally what I'd like to see is that we kept a range of very, very traditional native breeds of livestock on a very, very small scale to an exceptionally high welfare standard. ""The by-product from their use as a land management tool - whether that's in clearing land or restoring grasslands - would be the harvesting of cells for the culturing of cell-based meats."" Illtud Dunsford is both a farmer and a biotech entrepreneur Lab-grown meat is not expected to be available widely for at least five years. It remains to be seen whether people will want to eat it, but surveys in the UK suggest 20% would eat it, 40% wouldn't and the rest are undecided, with younger generations, urbanites and wealthier people more open to the idea. Chris Bryant, a psychologist at the University of Bath, says the three major concerns are to do with price, taste, and naturalness and the related issue of safety. The third is most difficult to address, he says, based on ""the naturalistic fallacy"", where people reason that natural things are good and unnatural things are bad. Ultimately, then, it will be consumers who will be the judge of the success or failure of lab-grown meat. Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

Facebook gives new details on NZ attack video,"A tribute to victims of the Christchurch mosque attacks The original live video of last week's Christchurch attacks was viewed 4,000 times before it was removed, Facebook has said. On Friday, a gunman live-streamed for 17 minutes the attack on two mosques that killed 50 people. Fewer than 200 people had watched it live and the first user report of the video had come 12 minutes after it had ended, Facebook said. But by then a copy had been placed on alt-right file-sharing site 8chan. Once alerted to the video, Facebook removed the original and hashed it - essentially made a digital fingerprint - meaning that material that was visibly similar to the original could be automatically detected and removed. And within 24 hours, it had blocked 1.2 million copies at the point of upload and deleted another 300,000. However, copies that had been edited or recorded from a screen had proved harder to spot. It said it was working with the New Zealand Police on its investigation. ""We continue to work around the clock to prevent this content from appearing on our site, using a combination of technology and people,"" wrote Facebook vice-president Chris Sonderbyin an update posted on the platform,external. In the wake of the shooting, several world leaders have called on social media companies to take more responsibility for the extremist material posted on their platforms. New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said social networks were ""the publisher not just the postman"", in reference to their potential liability for the material shared on them. Who were the Christchurch victims? Social sites seek to stop NZ attack clips Australia's leader, Scott Morrison, expressed concern over the ""unrestricted role"" of internet technologies in terrorist attacks. In a letter to Japan's Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, who also chairs the G20, he asked for the issue to be discussed at the upcoming meeting of the G20. ""It is unacceptable to treat the internet as an ungoverned space,"" he wrote. Mr Morrison said the aim was to ""agree on co-ordinated action to afford greater protection from terrorist violence"". ""It is imperative that the global community works together to ensure that technology firms meet their moral obligation to protect the communities which they serve and from which they profit."" UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid also called on social media firms to take actionto stop extremism on their channels. Facebook seems to have acted pretty swiftly in the circumstances and it is striking that it was an 8chan user who made the video go viral. But the real question is whether it was sensible to give between two and three billion people instant access to a live broadcasting platform Facebook must have known would be impossible to moderate in real time.

Italian opera house to return Saudi millions,"La Scala is the home of opera in Milan Italy's La Scala opera house is to return more than â¬3 million (Â£2.5m; $3.4m) to Saudi Arabia after a funding plan with the kingdom triggered a public backlash. The deal would have allowed the Saudi culture minister a seat on the board. Saudi Arabia's human rights record is under close scrutiny after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October. The partnership plan was criticised by rights groups and politicians. ""We have unanimously decided to return the money,"" opera house president Giuseppe Sala, who is also the mayor of Milan, told reporters after a board meeting on Monday. ""We'll go back to scratch today. We'll see if there are other opportunities for collaboration."" The Jamal Khashoggi story so far The â¬3m already delivered was part of a proposed â¬15m five-year partnership proposal with the Saudi culture ministry. But the plan drew widespread criticism, including from members of Italy's governing League party. League leader and deputy prime minister Matteo Salvini urged the opera house to scrap the deal while the governor of the Lombardy region, who is also a League member, demanded the opera's artistic director, Alexander Pereira, be sacked. Mr Sala said that Mr Pereira, who negotiated the deal, would keep his job. There has been no comment so far from Saudi officials. Saudi Arabia has blamed the killing of Jamal Khashoggi on rogue agents and denied claims that Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had any knowledge of the operation. What happened to Jamal Khashoggi?

""It is imperative that the global community works together to ensure that technology firms meet their moral obligation to protect the communities which they serve and from which they profit."" UK Home Secretary Sajid Javid also called on social media firms to take actionto stop extremism on their channels. Facebook seems to have acted pretty swiftly in the circumstances and it is striking that it was an 8chan user who made the video go viral. But the real question is whether it was sensible to give between two and three billion people instant access to a live broadcasting platform Facebook must have known would be impossible to moderate in real time.

Let it come! Frozen musical to head to London stage,"Caissie Levy plays Elsa in the current Broadway production of Frozen The stage adaptation of Frozen, which opened on Broadway early last year, is coming to London's West End. It will reopen the Drury Lane Theatre in Autumn 2020 after the theatre's refurbishment, producers confirmed. The musical is based on the 2013 Disney movie of the same name - the most successful animated film ever, with box office takings of more than Â£1.25bn. The storyline of the musical is broadly the same as in the movie, but extra songs have been written for the stage. Actors currently starring in the Broadway production will stay in New York, while a new British cast will appear in the West End. Songs made famous in the movie such as Let It Go, Do You Want To Build A Snowman and For The First Time In Forever all appear in the stage production. But the songwriters behind the film's music, Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez, were enlisted to write additional material for the musical - a daunting prospect given the classic status of the originals. ""We felt the pressure, but that was the something we had to, well, let go of,"" says Robert Lopez in what sounds like a genuinely unintended pun. Let It Go won Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez an Oscar for best original song ""Because there's no way to really create from pressure, you have to create from a sense of play and enjoyment and love."" Kristen Anderson-Lopez adds that the new songs were not written for the sole purpose of lengthening the story, ""because then they would just feel like padding"". ""What was more important,"" she says, ""was to write songs that took the place of a lot of the work that the animation did. ""For instance, if you think about Elsa, you don't really hear much from her at all during the first part of the movie, the way you experience her story is through close-ups, through looks of alarm in her eyes. ""In the theatre, you can't do that, because some people will be 100 yards away, so they can't zero-in on the eyes, so that's where the songs come in. They help you understand what's going on in her heart and in her head."" Frozen had strong ticket sales during its first year on Broadway and is currently booking until August. A North American tour also begins later this year which will continue until at least January 2021. The show has had generally warm, albeit not outstanding, reviews from critics during its Broadway run. In herthree-star review for The Guardian,external, Alexis Soloski noted the huge popularity of the show with young girls, many of whom attend the show dressed as Anna or Elsa. ""A likable transfer for the animated phenomenon will please fans but an extended running time highlights a thin plot,"" she wrote. ""Frozen could be more inventive, more imaginative, more vital, more necessary. But as those little girls would almost certainly say, let it go."" Elsa, Anna and Olaf are among the film characters brought to life on stage in the musical Jesse Green in the New York Times,externalpraised some elements of the show but also said there were a few ""icy patches"". ""You can feel the director, Michael Grandage, and his design team straining to make something artistically worthy of the property's commercial promise,"" he wrote. But Grandage, who is also directing the London production, says the West End version won't be exactly the same as one currently playing on Broadway. ""We don't want to just replicate a production,"" he tells BBC News. ""We want it to evolve and respond to the time of watching it. ""And so London will offer us an opportunity to make some adjustments, enhance and develop everything. ""We want to give a bespoke production in England. On one level it could be technical, the magic we use in the show, the spectacle... we want to make sure we evolve with the technology that's available to us."" Thrills and chills at Frozen musical 'Even Disney princesses get terrified' 5 questions about Frozen 2 we just can't let go Grandage, a West End veteran and the former artistic director of the Donmar Warehouse, adds he was glad to have the opportunity to direct a brand new show. ""I'd never directed a new musical before, I'd just directed a lot of music revivals,"" he explains. ""And so I've always been seeking the opportunity to do a new musical, because you can collaborate with the book writer, the lyricists, the composers, and work on something you can develop with them for the first time."" Michael Grandage says the West End show will be tweaked slightly from its Broadway version Jennifer Lee, who wrote the script both for the film and the stage, says one of the main benefits of putting the story into the theatre was ""being able to open these characters up"". ""Elsa became much richer,"" she explains. ""She had so many more dimensions to her, and on stage we're able to get to know her a lot better than we do in the film. ""The film was the blueprint, but what we were actually allowed to do was go as deep into the story as we always wanted to do. ""And sitting in the theatre and writing and seeing the actors in front of you, they're alive and you're able to work scenes and lines, which is pretty opposite of the experience in film, especially in animation, where there's a lot of projecting of what will become, and only getting pieces of the process along the way. ""Theatre is much more immediate, and it gives you a lot of room to work your craft."" Lee is currently busy working on the Frozen film sequel, which is currently in production, after which the work on putting the West End show together will begin. ""We're on 12-hour days, seven days a week right now!"" she says. ""We've been so focused on Frozen 2, we lock in June. [After that] I'll be able to open up my focus."" Patti Murin and Caissie Levy (Anna and Elsa) pictured at the Broadway launch Kristen Anderson-Lopez feels strongly that the musical should remind audiences that Frozen is a relatable story for all audiences, and not just young girls. ""Years of retail have created the idea that Frozen is this thing for little girls, but it's a very rich and adult story about trauma from childhood and the way it can freeze people into roles for their lifetime,"" she says. ""When the film first came out, adults said, 'Oh I love Frozen'. But somehow, because of the lunchboxes, two years later, everyone came up and said, 'Oh my niece loves Frozen'. ""And we were very anxious to create a story where an adult of any age could say, 'I love Frozen'."" 5 questions about Frozen 2 we just can't let go 'Even Disney princesses get terrified' Thrills and chills at Frozen musical Los Angeles wildfires approach Hollywood sign, with Sunset Boulevard 'in ruins' Watch: The scene across LA as firefighters attempt to contain blazes Flu numbers rise and A&E performance slips, as you share stories of NHS pressures Million year-old bubbles could solve ice age mystery 'Where do I go?'

Hospital infection inquiry begins at Holyrood,"Hospital infection rates are being investigated by a Holyrood committee Communication between infection control nurses and maintenance staff at a Glasgow hospital hit by a series of outbreaks was ""not particularly great"", MSPs have been told. Holyrood's health committee launched an inquiry in the wake of problems at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Two people died after contracting an infection related to pigeon droppings. MSPs were told a ""backlog"" of repairs had built up and that there were issues with communication about the work. However, they also heard that Scotland's overall performance in infection control was ""right up there with the very best"", and that ""Glasgow as a health board are actually doing better than the Scottish average"". The Holyrood inquiry is looking at safety and infection control across NHS Scotland, with a wider focus than the investigation into the QEUH ordered by the health secretary. Child's death links to Glasgow hospital pigeon infection Look back on the committee session on Holyrood Live. The MSPs' inquiry was set up after problems with ventilation, water hygiene and building maintenance were identified at Scotland's largest hospital. They want to examine whether infection control is adequate and whether more can be done to improve patient safety. Two patients died after contracting an infection linked to pigeon droppings at the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital The committee has already accepted written evidence and held a meeting with executives responsible for managing and monitoring safety in healthcare settings. Alastair Delaney, director of quality assurance at watchdog Healthcare Improvement Scotland, published a report earlier in March highlighting ""challenges"" in communication between estates staff and the infection control team at the Glasgow hospital. He told the committee this was ""something that we would be concerned about across the country"", because it was ""absolutely essential that there is good working relationships between the nursing staff - particularly for infection control - and the buildings staff."" He added: ""Obviously in that particular circumstance, we had quite a large backlog of repairs to be done and the communication was not particularly great about how those were being managed and what happened when they were being reported and potentially having to be reported again. ""So it demonstrated that that level of leadership governance was really important."" Alastair Delaney from Healthcare Improvement Scotland said there had been ""quite a large backlog"" of repairs at the hospital Phillip Couser, an official with NHS National Services Scotland and Health Protection Scotland, told members that there was no evidence of an increase in deaths due to infection. He said that while ""some boards are doing better than others"", Scotland's overall performance in infection control is ""right up there with the very best"". Why do patients get ill with hospital-acquired infections? The troubled past of Glasgow's QUEH Ahead of the session, the committee's convener Lewis Macdonald said: ""Recently there have been increasing incidents of infection in Scotland's hospitals raising serious questions about the safety and control of our healthcare environments. ""Our session on Tuesday is vital for the committee to learn the scale of the problem and ensure robust measures are in place to combat any issues. ""This evidence session will allow us to hear directly from those responsible for the healthcare facilities in Scotland and we will ensure any issues raised are brought to the attention of the Scottish government."" In December, a 10-year-old boy and a 73-year-old woman diedafter contracting the fungus Cryptococcus, which is linked to bird droppings. In the case of the child, it was a contributory factor in his death. Although the woman was found to have the fungal infection it was not the cause of her death. Both cases are being investigated by the Crown Office. Lewis Macdonald wants to understand the scale of the problem The Cryptococcus is believed to have come from pigeon droppings located in a plant room on the hospital's roof. Prosecutors are also investigating the death of a third patient at the QEUH. A 63-year-old woman was one of two patients affected by the fungal infection Mucor in January. Separately, 23 children contracted bloodstream infections in the cancer wards at the Royal Hospital for Children - which shares the Queen Elizabeth campus - between January and September last year. The infections were thought to be linked to bacteria in the water supply - with a report later finding ""widespread contamination"" at both hospitals. The inquiry also followsthe death of a patient at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley on 7 Februaryafter contracting the hospital infection Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. The bacteria was named as a contributing factor in the death. Andtwo babies died after contracting the Staphylococcus aureus bacteriumat the Princess Royal Maternity Hospital in January.

Limbless girl finishes half-marathon,"This video can not be played Harmonie-Rose lost her limbs to meningitis but was pushed around a half-marathon course. A girl who lost all her limbs after contracting meningitis was cheered across the finish line at a half-marathon. Harmonie-Rose Allen, five, walked the final few metres of the course in Bath on Sunday after being pushed for the rest by a team of family and teachers. As a baby in 2014 Harmonie-Rose contracted meningococcal septicaemia and was given a 10% chance of survival. She said the half-marathon had been ""freezing"" and she was ""a bit tired"". A seven-person support team, including two of Harmonie-Rose's teachers and family, took it in turns to push her special running chair around the course. But she decided to walk the final yards. Her proud parents, Ross Allen and Freya Hall, gave her a big hug as she crossed the line. Harmonie-Rose lost all her limbs after contracting meningitis Ms Hall said: ""We stopped a few times and Harmonie did get a bit bored but she soldiered on, she was such a little star. ""She was amazing. She is just a normal five-year-old and after an hour she was [asking] 'Where's my mummy?' but she just soldiered on. ""At the end she said she wanted to walk, so she went for it. I feel so proud of her."" In 2017she took her first steps on Â£10,000 prosthetic limbs. Two other children also took part alongside Harmonie-Rose. Seven-year-old Devon Baker, from Midsomer Norton, is undergoing treatment for leukaemia, while Ellie Payne, also seven, has undergone heart surgery.

Third Brexit vote must be different - Speaker,"This video can not be played Speaker John Bercow rejects further Brexit votes without changes to motion Speaker John Bercow has thrown the UK's Brexit plans into further confusion by ruling out another vote on the PM's deal unless MPs are given a new motion. In a surprise ruling, he said he would not allow a third ""meaningful vote"" in the coming days on ""substantially the same"" motion as MPs rejected last week. With 11 days to go before the UK is due to leave the EU, ministers have warned of a looming ""constitutional crisis"". The UK is currently due to leave the EU on 29 March. Theresa May has negotiated the withdrawal deal with the EU but it must also be agreed by MPs. They have voted against it twice, and the government has been considering a third attempt to get it through Parliament. Mr Bercow cited a convention dating back to 1604 that a defeated motion could not be brought back in the same form during the course of a parliamentary session. He said the second vote on the prime minister's deal last week was ""in order"" as it was substantially different to the first, but any further votes must pass the ""test"" he set out to be allowed. Brexit extension debated by MPs Brexit: What could happen next? Can May still bring back her Brexit deal? Bercow chucks a spanner in the works Listen: Brexitcast - Erskine Mayhem The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the speaker's intervention does not stop Brexit from happening, but it makes it ""extremely unlikely"" that the government will put another vote on the deal to Parliament this week. She said this makes it less likely the prime minister will ask EU leaders at a summit this week for a short extension - which Mrs May had said she would do if her deal got through Parliament. This in turn makes it more likely there will be a longer delay to Brexit, she added. She said: ""The conclusion that most people in Westminster would reach from that means that we're heading - it's likely - towards a closer relationship with the European Union, a softer Brexit than the one Theresa May has set out."" However, she added: ""That said, the government does believe that, although they're not clear about what it might be yet,  there is a way round this complication - but it is another significant obstacle for Number 10 tonight and it has, in the words of one senior official, made things significantly more complicated."" Mr Bercow's statement appeared to take Downing Street by surprise, with the prime minister's official spokesman saying it had not been warned of its contents ""or indeed the fact that he was making one"". Later, a Number 10 spokesman said the statement had been noted and required ""proper consideration"". The role of the speaker, who is the highest authority of the House of Commons, includes controlling debates, calling MPs to speak and choosing which amendments can be debated. Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson How can the government get another vote on Theresa May's deal? Well, first of all, rules are there to be changed. If MPs suspend or change the ""standing orders"" of Parliament, they could get the Brexit deal back on the agenda. Secondly, the government could change the proposition on offer. The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has suggested that something ""substantially"" different would be to ask Parliament to vote for the deal subject to a referendum. Or change the Parliament? If MPs can't discuss the same thing in the same session of Parliament, why not simply start a new one? Read Iain's complete analysis here. The prime minister had been expected to submit her Brexit deal for MPs to vote on for a third time this week - a week afterthey rejected itby 149 votes - and ahead of the EU summit on Thursday. Last week MPs also voted in favour of ruling out leaving the EU without a deal, andin favour of extending the Brexit process- though an extension would have to be agreed by all 27 EU member states. Brexit minister Kwasi Kwarteng has confirmed Mrs May will be writing to European Council President Donald Tusk to ask to postpone the UK's exit date. If the EU agreed, the government would ask both Houses of Parliament to approve the change, he said. Mr Kwarteng said the length of the extension would depend on ""whether the meaningful vote goes through or not"". ""If we have a deal... we will ask for a short extension,"" he said. ""Now if for whatever reason that vote doesn't happen, or is frustrated or is voted down, we will probably ask for a long extension of the period - and that would be a matter for the EU and for our government to decide."" European leaders are expected to discuss the UK request to extend the Brexit process and delay the UK's departure at the summit on Thursday. Shadow Brexit minister Matthew Pennycook said the fact that Article 50 needed to be extended was ""a mark of this government's failure"". Meanwhile, the government has been trying to convince the DUP and Tory Brexiteers, who have both voiced concerns about the backstop - the controversial arrangement to prevent physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland - to vote in favour of the deal. The DUP has opposed the deal up to now and are seeking further ""clarifications"" on the government's legal advice about the backstop, and how the UK could exit it. Ministers and MPs supportive of Mrs May's deal expressed anger at the timing of Mr Bercow's intervention. Conservative MP James Gray, who plans to vote for the deal after rejecting it twice, said he was ""absolutely furious""; while fellow Tory Greg Hands suggested Mr Bercow was the only person in the country who was ""accountable to nobody"". Solicitor General Robert Buckland warned there was now a ""constitutional crisis"" and suggested the onus was on the EU to come up with ""new solutions"" to enable MPs to vote on the deal again. ""Frankly we could have done without this, but it is something we are going to have to deal with,"" he said. He suggested ""there were ways around this"" - including potentially cutting short the current session of Parliament, a move which would lead to calls for a general election. Some opponents of the PM's Brexit deal welcomed the Speaker's ruling. Conservative former cabinet minister Owen Paterson said it was a ""game-changer"" and would ""concentrate minds"" ahead of Thursday's EU summit. Sir Bill Cash, chairman of the European Scrutiny Committee, said it seemed to make an ""enormous amount of sense"" given that the Brexit deal has been defeated twice and there would need to be a ""substantial difference"" to allow a third vote. But the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford suggested there was now a ""constitutional crisis"" and he suggested the prime minister should ""immediately"" call a meeting of opposition leaders. And Brexiteer Nadhim Zahawi, Tory minister for children and families, told BBC Newsnight that the Speaker had ""made it now much more difficult to have the short extension"" and a meaningful vote, ""therefore the longer extension is now clearly on the table. I don't believe that's a good thing"". By BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming The EU's official position is that they are waiting for Theresa May to come to a summit in Brussels on Thursday with a clear statement about how she plans to proceed, and there definitely won't be any more negotiations when she gets here. Unofficially, EU officials wonder if the government can get itself out of this situation, either with Parliamentary wizardry or by coming up with UK-only additions to the package, such as new guarantees about the role of Northern Ireland's Stormont Assembly in the future. And could the joint UK/EU decision about an extension to the Brexit process, due to be taken on Thursday, be appended to the deal and then count as something new enough to justify another vote in the Commons? But explain to diplomats that the solution might be the Queen closing Parliament and re-opening a new session with a speech and their reactions are priceless.

Christchurch and the new threat of alt-right violence,"The suspect flashed a hand sign as he appeared in court on Saturday charged with murder The man accused of the Christchurch shootings left a trail of references to online culture and extremist alt-right ideology. When he first appeared in court, Brenton Tarrant flashed an ""OK"" hand sign. The gesture was described in some accounts as a white nationalist symbol, but perhaps more accurately could be called a trollish gesture. It is used by extremists, but also by a range of conservatives, far-right figures and the alt-right - a disparate group of activists who congregate on extreme message boards. A document posted shortly before the shooting and widely credited to the suspect, indicates the author is steeped in the alt-right's toxic culture. Online, white nationalist ideology hides under layers of irony, often allowing its proponents to duck accusations of extremism while actively spreading hateful language and memes. Potential clues to the suspect's ideology and inspiration also appear in a live-streamed video whichsocial networks have struggled to completely take down. The written document was posted on the extreme message board 8chan shortly before the attack began on Friday. It has been called a ""manifesto"" but that term rather grandly overstates a confused jumble of thoughts and misinformation which rambles on for 74 poorly-written pages. Beyond Today podcast:Christchurch: how do you find the terrorists among the trolls? BBC Trending radio:What is 4chan? In it, the author describes the conservative activist Candace Owens as a key influence. While Owens has repeated claims about declining birth rates and dubious statistics about population growth in European countries, her influence over the suspect is doubtful considering his committed opposition to minorities in Western countries and the fact that Owens is an African-American. The document also includes an internet-famous joke - a piece of ""copypasta"", or a block of text that has been copied and pasted from elsewhere. The joke involves a US ""Navy Seal"" who claims to be posting on 4chan's extreme /pol/ (short for ""politically incorrect"") message board. Elsewhere in the document, the writer says that popular video games taught him about ethno-nationalism and violence, before immediately dismissing that idea. All of these appear to be sick ""jokes"" - not the laugh-out-loud funny kind but rather the internet meme kind, designed to make it difficult for people to glean his true meaning. Difficult - but not impossible. Police officers stand guard near the scene of the deadly shooting in New Zealand At the start of the document and throughout, the author refers to a conspiracy theory central to the new brand of far-right extremism springing from the alt-right: that there is a grand plan to eliminate the ""white race"" through a combination of immigration and interbreeding. It's a fiction that plays into the paranoia of the hardcore alt-right, and relies on false assumptions about fixed, sharply genetically defined racial groups, bogus and distorted statistics, and the racist ""one-drop"" theory from early 20th Century America: the idea that any amount of racial interbreeding negates white racial heritage. The bizarre conception of a monolithic genetic ""white"" culture under worldwide attack is a mainstay of the alt-right - although most of the amorphous movement's leaders would outwardly denounce specific acts of violence like the attack in Christchurch. Mosque attacks mapped What is known about NZ shooting suspect? Trumpâs shock troops: Who are the âalt-rightâ? 'I went undercover in the alt-right' The movement's foot soldiers are less inhibited. Shortly after the attack, on the nearly-anything-goes message boards 8chan and 4chan, there were a few scattered thoughts of condolence for the victims. But they were swamped by waves of vile abuse, extremist celebration of the attacks, exhortations to more violence and worries about how the attack would negatively affect white nationalist causes. At the same time, alt-right and relatively less extreme activists speculated that mainstream media outlets would take the entire ""manifesto"" document at face value. That didn't really happen. Robert Evans,writing for the investigative news site Bellingcat,external, sounded an early alarm shortly after the attacks, and wrote that the document was a trap laid for journalists. ""There is truth in there, and valuable clues to the shooter's radicalization, but it is buried beneath a great deal"" of trolling (Evans himself uses a more specific, scatological, term). Local news outlets including Radio New Zealand and The New Zealand Herald steered clear of reporting on the document in any detail in the hours immediately after the attacks. At the same time, reporters from the international mainstream press - outlets likeThe New York Times,externalandThe Atlantic,external- easily saw through the apparent misinformation. One question raised in the aftermath of the attack is: Why aren't the authorities doing more to monitor sites like 4chan and 8chan to pick up on potential extremist activity? Setting aside the difficulty of tracing people who use the completely anonymous message boards, even constant monitoring might not be effective. This is because of the sheer volume of material posted, which includes near-constant violent language and threats. According to web statistics site Alexa, 8chan isamong the top 5,000 websites in the world,external, even though it does not show up in Google results. 4chan,which is among the top 1,000,external, claims to host 1 million new posts per day and attract nearly 28 million monthly unique visitors. The chans are places where racial slurs and exhortations to violence and suicide are not just common, but form the fundamental language by which users communicate. On the slices of 4chan and 8chan devoted to politics (there are many other sections devoted to less extreme parts of internet culture), there is a near total dehumanisation of victims of terror attacks - and everyone else. The victims: a child, a father, an aspiring footballer 'This mosque was precious to us': A city in shock The children who lost a best friend Anyone looking from the outside might have difficulty separating the often-shocking irony from authentic red flags - posts like the one made shortly before the Christchurch attacks. Alt-right activists have used this irony as both a sword and a shield - to poke their liberal enemies who take their words at face value and to deny responsibility for egging on murderers and white nationalist terrorists. For instance, the idea of turning the ""OK"" gesture into a white nationalist signifierwas floated in early 2017,external. The anonymous poster - on 4chan,everyoneis an anonymous poster - outlined a plan to create fake accounts that would supposedly trick ""leftists"" into denouncing a common, everyday hand gesture, and thus open themselves to ridicule. Many people on social media took the bait. At the same time, far-right activists and conservatives started flashing the ""OK"" sign more frequently - as did hardcore white nationalists. When the alt-right first came to prominence on the coattails of Donald Trump's election campaign, its cheerleaders onright-wing websites were able to dismiss concerns about the movement,externalas overreaction by left-wing activists and the mainstream media. But that was before the full extent of the movement's violent fringes had completely come to light. According to a recent study from the US-based Southern Poverty Law Center,more than 40 murders have been committed by people with alt-right links,externalsince 2014. Some of the more well-known incidents include the murder of a peaceful protester in Charlottesville, Virginia, a 2017 double murder in Portland, Oregon, and a massacre at a synagogue in Pittsburgh last year. And now, in Christchurch, the alt-right death toll has more than doubled.

Can May still bring back her Brexit deal?,"Here is the relevant commandment from Erskine May aka the parliamentary bible: ""A motion or an amendment which is the same, in substance, as a question which has been decided during a session, may not be brought forward again during that same session."" So, how can the government get round this rather large obstacle and get another vote on Theresa May's deal? LIVE: Updates from Parliament Third Brexit vote must be different - Speaker Brexit: What could happen next? Well, first of all, rules are there to be changed. If MPs suspend or change the ""standing orders"" of Parliament, they could get the Brexit deal back on the agenda. But here the power would be in the hands of Parliament as a whole, and could not be done at the whim of government ministers. Secondly, the government could change the proposition on offer. The former Attorney General Dominic Grieve has suggested that something ""substantially"" different would be to ask Parliament to vote for the deal subject to a referendum. It may be argued too that moving the Brexit date from 29 March to a later date would be substantial enough if Mrs May tacks this on to her deal. But the Speaker can set a high bar here. In response to MPs' questions, he has hinted that simply coming up with new legal advice or clarifications wouldn't be substantial enough. So, already there is a focus on the word ""session"" in Erskine May. If MPs can't discuss the same thing in the same session of Parliament, why not simply start a new one? In the parlance, Parliament would be ""prorogued"" - in other words, the Queen would end the current session and a new one would begin soon after. But this strategy would be extremely controversial, and may even be resisted by Buckingham Palace if it appeared that the monarchy was being used in a politically contentious way.

Ardern vows never to say gunman's nameNew Zealand prime minister says person who attacked mosques should not be given notoriety.Asia,"This video can not be played Jacinda Ardern told parliament she would never use the Christchurch gunman's name New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has vowed never to say the name of the Christchurch mosque gunman. ""He sought many things from his act of terror, but one was notoriety - that is why you will never hear me mention his name,"" Ms Ardern said in an emotional address at New Zealand's parliament. Last Friday's shootings at two mosques left 50 people dead and dozens wounded. Australian Brenton Tarrant, 28, a self-described white supremacist, has been charged with murder. Who were the Christchurch victims? Stories of heroism emerge from NZ attacks The 'precious' mosque where peace was shattered The prime minister addressed a special meeting on Tuesday, opening her speech by using the Arabic greeting ""Al-Salaam Alaikum"", which in English means ""peace be upon you"". She said: ""I implore you, speak the names of those who were lost rather than the name of the man who took them. He is a terrorist. He is a criminal. He is an extremist. But he will, when I speak, be nameless."" PM Ardern met Muslim community leaders at Parliament House Ms Ardern assured MPs that the attacker would ""face the full force of the law"". She encouraged New Zealanders to acknowledge the grief of the Muslim community this Friday - which is the Muslim day of worship and will mark one week since the shooting. Ms Ardern has already announced that the nation's gun laws will be reformed and that the details would be presented within days. How mass shootings have changed gun laws What are New Zealand's gun laws? What is known about the suspect? The prime minister also called on social media platforms to do more to combat terror, after the gunman in Christchurch live-streamed his attack on Facebook. ""We cannot simply sit back and accept that these platforms just exist and that what is said on them is not the responsibility of the place where they are published,"" she said. ""They are the publisher. Not just the postman. There cannot be a case of all profit no responsibility."" On Tuesday it said that the gunman's video was viewed fewer than 200 times,externalduring the live broadcast, and about 4,000 times in total before it was removed. The social media company said it removed more than 1.5 million copies of the video in the first 24 hours after the incident, 1.2 million of which were blocked while being uploaded. How young people are responding Anger as shooter video spreads around world Christchurch and the new threat of alt-right violence This is not the first time disturbing material has appeared on social media related to mass shootings, with many survivors and victims' relatives angered by the publicity it affords the attackers. Does the media have a problem with coverage of mass shootings? The parents of one victim of the mass shooting at a movie theatre in Aurora, Colorado, in 2012set up a campaign called No Notoriety,externalto tackle perpetrator-focused news coverage. This video can not be played Would we reduce the incentive to commit a mass shooting if we refused to report the killer? Its website argues for ""no name, no photo and no notoriety"", challenging the media to ""deprive violent like-minded individuals the media celebrity and media spotlight they so crave"". The Don't Name Them campaign by the ALERRT Center at Texas State University,externalis similar, arguing that giving attackers publicity ""allows the shooter to  accomplish one of his goals, and  validates his life and actions"". Six radical ways to tackle US school shootings The New Zealand legal system does have a name suppression option under the Criminal Procedure Act 2011. Courts can suppress the identity of the defendant if, among other things, it would prejudice a fair trial, cause undue hardship to the defendant or any victim of the offence or endanger the safety of any person. The identity ofa man accused of murdering British backpacker Grace Millanehas been suppressed by the High Court, although some UK media outlets have still named him, arguing the law does not apply in the UK. The New Zealand Herald reported on Tuesday,externalthat the mosque gun suspect had been moved to a maximum security prison in Auckland where he was segregated, had had no visitors, and was being denied access to newspapers, television and radio. He appeared in court last Saturday and entered no plea. His state-appointed lawyer said the suspect did not want his services and had indicated he would represent himself from now on. Islamic tradition calls for the cleansing and burial of bodies as soon as possible after death, but this has been delayed because of the slow process of identification and forensic documentation. This video can not be played New Zealand attack: How young people responded to the massacre Police on Tuesday said the bodies of six victims had now been released to families. They said that 12 bodies had been formally identified and all 50 post-mortem examinations were complete. A statement read: ""Police are acutely aware of frustrations by families associated with the length of time required for the identification process following Friday's terror attack. ""We are doing all we can to undertake this work as quickly as possible and return the victims to their loved ones."" Mohamed Safi, 23, whose father Matiullah Safi died at the Al Noor mosque, complained about the lack of information. He told AFP news agency: ""They are just saying they are doing their procedures... Why do I not know what you are going through to identify the body?"" The bodies of some of the victims were being washed and prepared in a Muslim ritual process on Tuesday, partly with the help of volunteers flown in from overseas. New Zealand's immigration service said it was processing visas for the families of the victims seeking to come from abroad to attend funerals.

"World's most expensive cities revealedParis comes top of a ranking of the world's most expensive cities, alongside Hong Kong and Singapore.Business","Paris has come top of a ranking of the world's most expensive cities, alongside Hong Kong and Singapore. It's the first time three cities have shared the top spot in the 30-year history of the annual Economist Intelligence Unit survey. The French capital - ranked second most expensive last year - is one of four European cities in the top 10. The survey compares the cost of 160 items, such as food, drink, transport, utility bills, and rent, in 133 cities. It then tracks whether prices have gone up or down by comparing them with the cost of living in New York, which is used as a benchmark. The annual index was designed to help companies calculate cost-of-living expenses for expatriates and business travellers. The world's most liveable city named Is the single life more expensive? The Economist Intelligence Unit noted that costs in the cheapest cities were low by Western standards, partly because low wages limiting household spending are the norm there. It also said a ""growing number of locations"" were becoming cheaper because of the impact of political or economic disruption, citing crisis-hit Caracas in Venezuela and war-torn Damascus in Syria, which are at the bottom of the list. ""There is a considerable element of risk in some of the world's cheapest cities,"" the report said, adding, ""Put simply, cheaper cities also tend to be less liveable."" Report author Roxana Slavcheva said Paris had been among the top 10 most expensive cities since 2003 and was ""extremely expensive"" to live in. ""Only alcohol, transport and tobacco offer value for money compared with other European cities,"" she said. The average cost of a woman's haircut, for example, costs $119.04 (Â£90) in Paris, compared with $73.97 in Zurich and $53.46 in Japanese city Osaka. ""European cities tend to have the highest costs in the household, personal care, recreation and entertainment categories - with Paris being a good representative in these categories - perhaps reflecting a greater premium on discretionary spending,"" Ms Slavcheva said.

"Driver who rammed woman in Tesco car park jailedLucy Turner drove at Tesco employee Danielle Wood at an estimated 35mph, leaving her with a broken back.Beds, Herts & Bucks","This video can not be played Lucy Turner arriving at St Albans Crown Court A getaway driver who broke a woman's back when she rammed into her in a supermarket car park has been jailed. Lucy Turner, 32, sent shop worker Danielle Wood sprawling over the bonnet as she drove into shoppers outside Tesco in Rickmansworth on 23 December. They tried to block the car with their trolleys as Turner attempted to drive off with stolen alcohol. She was jailed for three years and two months for offences including causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Turner, from Borehamwood, also pleaded guilty to two charges of theft, attempted theft, using a vehicle without insurance, driving while disqualified, failing to stop and failing to report a collision. St Albans Crown Court heard Turner was the getaway driver as her accomplices - a man and woman - stole Â£174 worth of alcohol. After failing to get out of the fire exit, they were intercepted by staff at the front door, with the store manager trying to block the car with trolleys, prosecutor Richard Jones said. A social media video of shoppers being driven at was shared hundreds of times. Danielle Wood wears a brace to support her back after being knocked over After hitting Ms Wood at an estimated 35mph, Turner swapped places in the car with the man, who barged out of the car park and fled. He remains on the run, the court was told. Ms Wood, 26, said she was ""petrified"" as the car drove at her at between 35mph and 40mph. ""I was in agony. I knew I had broken my back. I was screaming 'My back, my back!'"" she said. She was treated in hospital over Christmas for a fractured vertebra but, three months on, is still wearing a brace and has postponed planning her wedding. Ms Wood added: ""I fear I will always have pain. It hurts emotionally and physically."" Chantelle Stocks, defending, said Turner had developed a drug addiction after the death of her son in 2008. Turner was also banned from driving for four-and-a-half years.

The storm made landfall near the port city of Beira on Thursday with winds of up to 177 km/h (106 mph), but aid teams only reached the city on Sunday. A UN aid worker told the BBC that every building in Beira - home to half a million people - had been damaged. Gerald Bourke, from the UN's World Food Programme, said: ""No building is untouched. There is no power. There is no telecommunications. The streets are littered with fallen electricity lines. ""The roofs on so many houses have fallen in, likewise the walls.

"Cancer doctor shortage 'puts care at risk'Despite patients urgently needing treatment, 7.5% of key posts are vacant, a study of NHS staffing finds.Health","A shortage of cancer doctors will hamper the ability of the NHS to provide cutting-edge care, experts are warning. A Royal College of Radiologists census of 62 major UK cancer centres found more than 7.5% of consultant posts were vacant, with services maintained only by large amounts of overtime. It said this was unsustainable and would put treatments at risk. But the NHS said plans were in place to increase doctor numbers. Doctor training places are increasing, as is investment in the NHS. But the college said this was not enough to cover the increases in demand for care, particularly given the number of doctors who are retiring. Dr Tom Roques, from the college, said: ""The UK is seeing more and more fantastic innovations in cancer treatment from the introduction of new immunotherapy drugs to high energy proton beam radiotherapy. ""These doctors are vital to the rollout of these new therapies but we do not have enough of them and our workforce projections are increasingly bleak.""  If you can't see the NHS Tracker,click or tap here,external. The college asked cancer centres about the number of consultant clinical oncologists they had in post. These are the senior cancer doctors that specialise in non-surgical cancer treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy. It found there were the equivalent of 863 full-time doctors in post. The centres had another 70 posts that were vacant - with most of those unfilled for at least a year. That is a vacancy rate of more than 7.5%, compared with 5% five years ago. The college also asked about the amount of overtime being done. It found the full-time doctors already in post were working just over six hours extra a week on average. And, the college said, if this was taken into account, the NHS was 184 clinical oncologists short - a figure it predicted would worsen in the coming years. The college is worried about the stress and burnout its members are facing, pointing out half of clinical oncologists retire before the age of 60. And as well as the threat to new treatments, the college said, the shortage of doctors would also be a factor in delays to patients receiving treatment. Last week, NHS figures in England showed long waits had reached their highest levels since records began, in 2009. The rest of the UK is also struggling to see patients within the target time of 62 days. Dr Rosie Loftus, chief medical officer at Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ""We know that hard-working NHS professionals are already struggling to cope with escalating workloads, which are in part due to staffing challenges. ""Gaps in the workforce can lead to longer waits to start treatment, which in turn add to the worry and anxiety many people already feel following their diagnosis. ""To meet the bold ambitions for improving cancer care , we urgently need a costed plan to increase and sustain the number of staff needed to deliver them."" While there are shortages of staff in place, it is worth pointing out that the overall numbers of clinical oncologists working in the NHS is increasing by about 5% a year. It is just that these increases have not been enough to cope with the rising demand. The government has promised more money for the NHS. In England, services will have an extra Â£20bn a year by 2023 and cancer has been made a key priority for spending. Extra funding is also being made available to other parts of the UK, under the plan announced by the prime minister last year summer. The number of doctors in training is also rising. A spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Social Care in England said: ""Improving cancer care and reducing waits is a priority for the NHS and we recently unveiled a series of commitments as part of the NHS Long Term Plan backed by Â£200m to fund new ways to rapidly detect and treat cancer.""

"'Lewis Hamilton of pigeons' fetches Ã¢ÂÂ¬1.25mBelgian bird Armando, who turns five this year, has retired from racing and is fathering chicks.Europe","Armando, pictured, is now enjoying his retirement A champion pigeon has been sold for a record â¬1.25m ($1.42m; Â£1.07m). Auction house Pipa called Armando the ""best Belgian long-distance pigeon of all time"". He's also been dubbed the ""Lewis Hamilton of pigeons"". Before this sale, the record was â¬376,000 (Â£321,800). However, Pipa says this was beaten within a day of Armando being put up for bids. The champ, who turns five this year, is now enjoying his retirement and has already fathered a number of chicks. ""It was unreal, the feeling - it was something out of this world,"" Nikolaas Gyselbrecht, the CEO of Pipa - short for ""Pigeon Paradise"" - told the BBC of the moment someone put down a bid of more than â¬1m. ""In our wildest dreams, we had never hoped for a price like that. We hoped for around â¬400,000 to â¬500,000, and we only dreamed of â¬600,000."" He's going to turn five this year Mr Gyselbrecht said that two buyers from China ended up in a bidding war, escalating from â¬532,000 up to â¬1.25m in just over an hour. To put it all in perspective, he says, the usual price for a racing pigeon is around â¬2,500. But Armando is no usual pigeon. The last three races of his career were the 2018 Ace Pigeon championship, the 2019 Pigeon Olympiad and the AngoulÃªme - and he won them all.

Fred Vancaillie, president of the local pigeon fancying association in Perwez, told Belgian broadcaster RTBF that he was ""the Lewis Hamilton of pigeons"", adding that he was one of the best in the history of the sport. Although Armando's racing days are behind him, Mr Gyselbrecht says that racing pigeons can carry on having chicks until they're about 10, and live up to 20. While Armando will now settle in for a quiet life, it's likely his new owners will breed him and race his progeny.
