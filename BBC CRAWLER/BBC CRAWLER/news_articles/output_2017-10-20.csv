Mugabe named goodwill ambassador by WHO,"Critics say health services have collapsed under Mr Mugabe's rule The choice of Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe as a World Health Organization (WHO) goodwill ambassador has been criticised by several organisations including the British government. It described his selection as ""surprising and disappointing"" given his country's rights record, and warned it could overshadow the WHO's work. The opposition in Zimbabwe and campaign groups also criticised the move. The WHO head said he was ""rethinking his approach in light of WHO values"". Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus had previously praised Zimbabwe for its commitment to public health. He said it was a country that ""places universal health coverage and health promotion at the centre of its policies to provide health care to all"". Profile: Robert Mugabe Africa's 'medical tourist' presidents Mr Mugabe's appointment as a ""goodwill ambassador"" to help tackle non-communicable diseases has attracted a chorus of criticism. Critics have long argued that Zimbabwe's health service is not meeting the needs of patients The British government said it was all the more surprising given US and EU sanctions against him. ""We have registered our concerns"" with the director general, a spokesman said. ""Although Mugabe will not have an executive role, his appointment risks overshadowing the work undertaken globally by the WHO on non-communicable diseases."" Zimbabwe's leader has been frequently taken to task over human rights abuses by the European Union and the US. Critics say Zimbabwe's health care system has collapsed, with staff often going without pay while medicines are in short supply. Dr Tedros, who is Ethiopian,is the first African to lead the WHO. He was elected in May with a mandate to tackle perceived politicisation in the organisation. US-based campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) said it was an embarrassment to give the ambassador role to Mr Mugabe, because his ""utter mismanagement of the economy has devastated health services"". Critics of the president say that Zimbabwe's health care system is in a shambolic state HRW's Kenneth Roth said Mr Mugabe's appointment was a cause for concern because the president and some of his officials travel abroad for treatment. ""When you go to Zimbabwean hospitals, they lack the most basic necessities,"" he said. Zimbabwe's main MDC opposition party also denounced the WHO move. ""The Zimbabwe health delivery system is in a shambolic state, it is an insult,"" spokesman Obert Gutu told AFP. ""Mugabe trashed our health delivery system... he allowed our public hospitals to collapse."" Other groups who have criticised Mr Mugabe's appointment include the Wellcome Trust, the NCD Alliance, UN Watch, the World Heart Federation and Action Against Smoking. President Mugabe heard about his appointment while attending a conference held by the WHO, a UN agency, on non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in Montevideo, Uruguay. He told delegates his country had adopted several strategies to combat the challenges presented by such diseases,which the WHO says kill about 40 million people a year,externaland include cancers, respiratory diseases and diabetes. ""Zimbabwe has developed a national NCD policy, a palliative care policy, and has engaged United Nations agencies working in the country, to assist in the development of a cervical cancer prevention and control strategy,"" Mr Mugabe was reportedby the state-run Zimbabwe Herald newspaper,externalas saying. But the president admitted that Zimbabwe was similar to other developing countries in that it was ""hamstrung by a lack of adequate resources for executing programmes aimed at reducing NCDs and other health conditions afflicting the people"". Medicine is often in short supply at Zimbabwe's hospitals, critics say Imogen Foulkes, BBC News, Geneva The UN has a bit of thing for goodwill ambassadors, especially famous ones. Angelina Jolie, as ambassador for the UN Refugee Agency, was regularly pictured comforting displaced families in over-crowded camps. Swiss tennis star Roger Federer visits aid projects in Africa for Unicef and plays charity matches to raise money. Further back in time, film star and Unicef goodwill ambassador Audrey Hepburn visited disaster zones and graced gala dinners where her glittering presence was an encouragement to donors. The publicity does attract support for relief efforts. But it is hard to imagine 93-year-old Robert Mugabe fulfilling a similar remit. Will he provide comfort in WHO field clinics in conflict zones? Would one of his suit jackets fetch a high price at auction? Would the presence of a man who is widely accused of human rights abuses encourage more $10,000-a-plate attendees at a gala ball? Somehow it just does not seem likely, which begs the question, what exactly is Mr Mugabe going to do in his new role? The World Health Organization has not made this at all clear.

Anger over Trump's UK crime tweet,"Donald Trump has been accused of fuelling hate crime with a tweet erroneously linking a rise in the UK crime rate to ""radical Islamic terror"". He said crime in the UK had risen by 13% amid the ""spread"" of Islamist terror - despite the figure referring to all crimes, not just terrorism. The Labour MP, Yvette Cooper, said the statement was ""inflammatory and ignorant"", while ex-Labour leader Ed Miliband said Mr Trump was ""a moron"". The Home Office declined to comment.

Mr Trump's tweet used data from the Office for National Statistics (ONS)'slatest crime update, which reported a 13% increase across all offences in the 12 months to June. It covered England and Wales, not the whole of the UK. Police recorded 5.2m offences in the last year, the bulk of which were not associated with terrorism. Rises were recorded in crime public order offences, stalking and harassment, possession of weapons and robbery. The statistics - which made no reference to ""radical Islamic terror"" - showed that 35 out of the 664 homicides in England and Wales were caused by terror attacks in London and Manchester. US media outlets have speculated whether Mr Trump's tweet followed a TV report on One America News Network, a conservative TV channel, which aired the statistics on Friday morning. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent: Donald Trump is half right. Crime has gone up by 13% - but not in the UK. The increase announced yesterday covered England and Wales whereas Scotland and Northern Ireland publish their data separately. But overlooking that mistake, what about the phrase that appears to connect the increase to the ""spread of radical Islamic terror""? The number of cases of murder and attempted murder linked to Islamist-related extremism, has indeed gone up substantially. Of the 664 homicides recorded in the year ending June 2017, 34 resulted from the Westminster Bridge, Manchester Arena and London Bridge attacks - there were no such deaths last year. The attacks also accounted for the majority of the 426 additional attempted murders registered by police. Arrests for terror-related offences went up as well, from 226 to 379, across England, Wales and Scotland, though that number also includes people detained for far-right extremism. But in terms of overall offending, this increase in terror-related crime represents a fraction, when you consider that there were an extra 579,553 offences recorded by police compared with the year before. More from Reality Check: Is crime up or down? However, the tweet sparked a fierce backlash in the UK and was widely condemned on social media. Labour MP Yvette Cooper, chair of the Commons Home Affairs Committee, said Mr Trump's comments could fuel hate crime. She said: ""Hate crime in the UK has gone up by almost 30% and rubbish like this tweet from Donald Trump is designed to provoke even more of it. ""If we are to properly tackle hate crime and every other crime, we have to challenge this kind of nonsense."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Loaded' Kodi box trader avoids jail,"Brian Thompson had previously said he wanted to know whether he was doing anything illegal A trader who sold TV boxes which allowed viewers to watch subscription films and football for free has been given a suspended jail term. Brian Thompson had denied breaking the law by selling the Kodi boxes, setting up the prospect of a landmark trial. But appearing at Teesside Crown Courthe changed his plea to guilty. The 55-year-old, who runs Cut Price Tomo's TV store in Middlesbrough, was given an 18-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. Thompson, of Barnaby Avenue, Middlesbrough, admitted one count of selling and one count of advertising devices ""designed, produced or adapted for the purpose of enabling or facilitating the circumvention of effective technological measures"". The court heard Thompson had been selling ""fully loaded"" Kodi boxes - ones that had been installed with third-party add-ons that can access pirated content. He had previously claimed the law was a ""grey area"" and said he wanted to know whether he was ""doing anything illegal"". Thompson had sold an estimated 400 boxes, earning him about Â£40,000, and losses to Sky were an estimated Â£200,000 in subscriptions, the court heard. Judge Peter Armstrong said there could be no doubt now about the legality of the fully loaded boxes. ""Those who lawfully have to pay Â£50 a month or more on Sky or BT subscriptions, are done a disservice by people like you and those who buy these devices,"" he said. He said he was suspending Thompson's jail sentence but others in the future may not be so fortunate. Cameron Crowe, prosecuting, said streaming devices were not illegal if they were used to access free content. But he added: ""If they are designed, produced or adapted for gaining unauthorised access to copyright content or subscription services - such as Sky and BT Sports - they become illegal."" Kodi turns compatible devices into a ""media centre"" Some shops sell ready-to-use set-top boxes or television sticks preloaded with the Kodi software. The developers behind Kodi say their software does not contain any content of its own and is designed to play legally owned media or content ""freely available"" on the internet. However the software can be modified with third-party add-ons that provide access to illegal copies of films and TV series, or provide free access to subscription television channels. Some traders sell Kodi boxes preloaded with third-party add-ons that can access pirated content. It is the sale of these ""fully-loaded"" boxes which was the subject of the case against Mr Thompson. Trading Standards officers made a test purchase from Thompson's Dundas shopping centre outlet in 2015 and a raid was carried out. He moved premises after the raid and advertised on Facebook claiming to have ""every film and box set ever made, even ones at the cinema"". Paul Fleming, defending, said his client was a hard worker who had succeeded and failed in businesses over the years. Kieron Sharp, the chief executive of Fact (formerly the Federation Against Copyright Theft), said one million illegal Kodi TV boxes had been sold in the UK in the past two years. He said the perpetrators were not ""Robin Hood characters"", but criminals. ""Selling pre-configured streaming devices that allow access to content you normally would have to pay for is illegal,"" he added.

Ex-PC jailed for filming sex partners,"Jayson Lobo was found guilty of 11 counts of voyeurism An ex-police officer who secretly filmed sexual encounters with seven women on his mobile phone has been jailed for three years. Jayson Lobo, 48, formerly of Lancashire Police, met most of his victims on a dating website between 2011 and 2015. Sentencing him at Liverpool Crown Court, Judge Neil Flewitt QC said his deceit was ""staggering"". The former Commonwealth Games runner was found guilty of 11 counts of voyeurism following a trial. He denied all the charges and was cleared of seven counts of the same offence, including one count relating to an eighth woman. Lobo was caught when one of his victims found out he had a long-term partner during their relationship. She had earlier caught him filming her as they had sex but he had promised he would delete it. Lobo, of Mellor, Blackburn, was arrested after the woman made a complaint to police and had his phones seized which revealed the full extent of his offending. Judge Flewitt QC said he had used the women to satisfy his sexual appetite and it was ""a calculated and selfish course of conduct, pursued without regard for the feelings of those women concerned"". The Preston-based response officer was suspended from the force after his arrest in December 2015. Lobo was then sacked for gross misconduct relating to a separate matter in August last year, after a hearing found he had shared details and images from police incidents.

Road 'misery' to end and EU 'saves May',"A number of papers focus on what the UK's Brexit bill might be Some of the papers try to put a figure on what the UK's Brexit bill might be. The Daily Mirror,externalthinks it could be Â£36bn, noting that Prime Minister Theresa May did not rule out a doubling of the current Â£18bn offer. The Daily Telegraph's suggestion,externalis Â£40bn, while the Sun says it has been told by one senior Brussels diplomatthe EU wants Â£48bn,external. The paper says this would leave the prime minister needing to convince taxpayers why it is worth paying such a huge sum, although it does note some believe that the long-term losses from not striking a deal could dwarf this figure. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The way the EU referendum was fought and the role of Twitter,externalis the subject of an article on the Buzzfeed website. It says a study has found that a network of more than 13,000 bots - or automated pieces of software - tweeted predominantly pro-Brexit messages in the run-up to the vote. The researchers at City, the University of London, say they are concerned this tactic gave a ""false sense of momentum behind certain ideas"". Damian Collins, the Conservative chair of the Commons Culture, Media and Sport Committee, tells Buzzfeed he has written to Twitter to ask whether there has been any ""interference in the democratic process"". Twitter says its systems identify more than three million suspicious accounts every week. There seems to be a consensus that the EU softened its stance on Brexit at the European Council summit. The Daily Telegraph thinks this was because offears in Brussels that Mrs May's government could collapse,externalif the negotiations remained deadlocked. Oliver Duff, the editor of thei paper,external, goes further, arguing Mrs May successfully emphasised her weakness - in effect saying ""you think I'm a pain in the proverbial? Try Boris or David Davis"". A number of papers focus on what the UK's Brexit bill might be The Sun,externalwarns Brussels not to overplay its hand by asking for too much money in return for trade talks. The Guardianthinks the prime minister had a decent 24 hours,externalin Brussels and hopes there is a shared recognition that the EU and the UK have a common interest in making the best of Brexit. The Times columnist, Matthew Paris, warns the crisis in Catalonia couldbring a violent civil conflict to Spain,externaland threaten its very existence. He is angry that what he calls ""tinpot nationalists on both sides have puffed themselves into an entirely avoidable high noon"", arguing the problems could have been resolved with ""a little respect"". According to the Financial Times,two board members of the Weinstein Company tried for years to investigate Harvey Weinstein,externalbecause of allegations of sexual misconduct. Donald Trump's tweet claiming crime in the UK has risen because of Islamic terror prompts a backlash in the papers. TheDaily Mirror,externalquotes the Conservative MP Sir Nicholas Soames, who calls Mr Trump ""a daft twerp"", suggesting he should ""fix gun control"" instead. TheWashington Post suggests the president was again trying to raise the spectre of terrorism,external- days after another court blocked one of his travel bans. In its coverage of the controversy, the Daily Telegraphcompares crime levels in London and New York,externaland comes to the conclusion the British capital is worse. It says the cities both have similar populations but in London someone is six times more likely to be burgled and three times more likely to report a rape - although the murder rate in New York remains higher. The paper puts the difference down to New York's zero tolerance approach in the 1990s. On its front page, theDaily Mail asks ""have our police lost the plot?"",external- picturing two support officers wearing bear masks. It says forces are being urged to abandon silly stunts and get officers back on the beat. In its lead, the Times reports that the 50mph (80km/h) speed limit imposed on drivers going past roadworks is to be eased. It says research involving heart monitors suggests drivers are more relaxed going at 60mph (96km/h), in part because they can overtake slower-moving lorries. But, it seems, motorists are facing added stress at airports because of a sharp rise in short-term parking fees. According to the Daily Mail, they are beingcharged up to 35 pence a minute to drop off loved ones,external. taking the cost of a goodbye kiss to about Â£3.

Why Tina Turner came out of retirement,"Adrienne Warren will play Tina Turner in the musical, which opens in April A new musical based on the life of Tina Turner is set to open in the West End in 2018 - and the singer even came out of retirement (somewhat reluctantly) to work on it. ""Retirement is wonderful,"" Turner says as she launches Tina: The Musical in London. ""You sleep long, do what you want, decorate the house two or three times. Just easy things that you dreamt about when you were working and that's all you did."" She says her lifestyle when she was famous involved spending most of her time on tour buses, planes and cars, adding: ""That was work and that's sometimes what you had to do. ""But you had a dream not to have to do any of it."" Turner, whose hits include The Best and What's Love Got To Do With It, was initially reluctant to sign up for working on the show, which opens at London's Aldwych Theatre in April. ""I didn't want to because I didn't really understand it or agree with it, whatever there is - the magic between stage and music is totally different,"" she says. ""So I'm learning and experiencing what musicals are about."" The producers of Tina had to fly out to Switzerland, where Turner now lives, to convince her to give the project her blessing. The pair performed together at the launch of the musical in London this week Turner was eventually won over, and now comments: ""This took me out of retirement... I'm very excited to be a part of it."" But the big question of course, was who was going to play Tina in the show. This week, the theatre world got its answer: Adrienne Warren. ""She can sing,"" Turner says. ""She will do the dancing. Maybe she hasn't done the type of dancing that me and my girls would do, but she can do that. She's pretty. And we're giving it a try."" Giving audiences a flavour of what they can expect, Warren performed three songs at the launch, including two duets with Turner, proving in the process that she definitely has the voice to pull this role off. Speaking after the performance, the Virginia-born actress said: ""She's a motivation, inspiration to all women, and especially women of colour. ""It's the first time I ever realised that I could grow up in the South and have dreams that would take me all over the world. I wouldn't have become a performer if it wasn't for Tina Turner."" Adrienne Warren said audiences will find the musical ""inspirational"" She adds: ""When you haven an opportunity like this, I call it a responsibility. Because I'm a Tina Turner fan first, so that's a responsibility and I don't take that lightly."" Details of the plot and songs included in the show haven't been announced yet, but producers say it will be a fairly comprehensive telling of Turner's life story - not shying away from issues such as the domestic abuse she suffered at the hands of her husband Ike. Describing the show's content, Adrienne said: ""Dark? No. Inspirational? Yes. It is the truth of her story. Sometimes the best things in life come out of the worst things in life, so that's what's so appealing about this show. ""There are challenges, the stamina that is required for this show was something like I've never seen before, and actually having Tina as my coach as I do this is something quite interesting as well, so I love every second of it. ""It shows all of us that no matter what obstacle comes your way, whether it's your family not supporting you, whether it's bullying, domestic violence, don't ever let that stop you achieving your dreams.""

Brexit deadlock talk 'exaggerated' - Tusk,"Reports of deadlock over Brexit negotiations may have been exaggerated, European Council President Donald Tusk has said after a Brussels summit. Progress was ""not sufficient"" to begin trade talks with the UK now but that ""doesn't mean there is no progress at all"", he said. EU leaders will discuss the issue internally, paving the way for talks with the UK, possibly in December. Theresa May said there was ""some way to go"" but she was ""optimistic"". Speaking at the end of a two-day summit, Mr Tusk told reporters: ""My impression is that the reports of the deadlock between the EU and the UK have been exaggerated."" Reality Check: How are the Brexit talks actually going? Tell EU you'll walk away, Eurosceptics tell May Brexit: How do other EU countries see a 'no deal'? The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier,described the talks as deadlockedearlier this month. Mr Tusk said he was not at odds with Mr Barnier, but his own role was to be a ""positive motivator for the next five or six weeks"". He said he felt there was ""goodwill"" on both sides ""and this is why I, maybe, in my rhetoric, I'm, maybe, a little bit more optimistic than Michel Barnier, but we are also in a different role"". The so-called divorce bill remains a major sticking point in talks with the EU. French President Emmanuel Macron said there was still much work to be done on the financial commitment before trade talks can begin, adding: ""We are not halfway there."" Theresa May declined to say in a press conference after the summit what the UK would be prepared to pay, saying the ""final settlement"" would come as part of a ""final agreement"" with the EU. The UK prime minister did not name any figures but refused to deny that she had told other EU leaders the UK could pay many more billions of pounds than the Â£20bn she had indicated in her Florence speech last month. ""I have said that ... we will honour the commitments that we have made during our membership,"" she said. But those commitments were being analysed ""line by line"" she said, adding: ""British taxpayer wouldn't expect its government to do anything else."" This video can not be played Three key points about how the Brexit talks are going By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor There are whispers that Theresa May has privately reassured the other leaders that she is willing to put a lot more than the implicit 20 billion euros (Â£17.8bn) on the table as we leave. Number 10 doesn't deny this, Mrs May didn't deny it when we asked her in the press conference today, nor did she reject the idea that the bill could be as high as 60 billion euros. If she has actually given those private reassurances though, there's not much evidence the other EU leaders believe her or think it's enough. But if she is to make that case more forcefully she has big political problems at home. Read Laura's blog She said the two sides were within ""touching distance"" of a deal on other issues - particularly on citizens' rights. ""I am ambitious and positive for Britain's future and for these negotiations but I know we still have some way to go,"" she said. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, following last year's referendum result. It had hoped to move onto phase two of negotiations - covering future trade arrangements - after this week's summit. But EU leaders took just 90 seconds to officially conclude that not enough progress has been made on the issues of citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the border in Northern Ireland, but ""internal preparations"" would begin for phase two. The prime minister made a personal appeal to her 27 EU counterparts at a working dinner on Thursday night, telling them that ""we must work together to get to an outcome that we can stand behind and defend to our people"". BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said all EU leaders knew Mrs May was in a politically difficult situation and did not want her to go home empty-handed, so had promised they would start talking about trade and transition deals among themselves, as early as Monday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were ""encouraging"" signs of progress in Brexit negotiations and the process was progressing ""step by step"". And European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he hoped it would be possible to reach a ""fair deal"" with Britain. ""Our working assumption is not the 'no-deal' scenario. I hate the 'no-deal' scenario. I don't know what that means,"" he said.

"Catalonia belongs in Spain, king says","Spain's King Felipe VI has said Catalonia ""is and will remain"" an essential part of the country. It is his second intervention in the Catalonia secession crisis. He told an awards ceremony in the northern city of Oviedo that the Catalan government was causing a rift and Spain would solve the problem through democratic institutions. Catalonia's leader has threatened to declare independence, and Madrid is making plans to impose direct rule. According to the opposition Socialists - who support the central government's stand against Catalan independence - the plans include elections in Catalonia in January. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? The man who wants to break up Spain Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will announce the full set of measures on Saturday, two days after a deadline for Catalonia's autonomous government to abandon its independence bid. Cases for and against independence Catalan crisis: How the press sees it The crisis in 300 words The central government has said it will trigger Article 155 of the constitution, which allows it to impose direct rule in a crisis, for the first time. Other moves may include taking control of Catalonia's regional police force. Article 155 does not give the government the power to fully suspend autonomy. This video can not be played Why is there a Catalan crisis? The answer is in its past A referendum, regarded as illegal by Spain, was held in Catalonia on 1 October. Of the 43% of Catalans who reportedly voted, 90% were in favour of independence. Most anti-independence voters boycotted the ballot. King Felipepreviously saidCatalan President Carles Puigdemont and other separatist leaders who organised the referendum had ""broken the democratic principles of the rule of law"" and showed ""disrespect to the powers of the state"". James Badcock, BBC News, Madrid While the dissolution of Catalonia's parliament and the holding of snap regional elections may appear to offer a way of defusing today's state of extreme tension, there are plenty of reasons to doubt that such a strategy would provide a clear solution to the crisis. The far-left CUP has suggested that it would boycott any election imposed on the region. Other pro-independence forces might do the same. Massive street protests against any form of direct rule from Madrid can also be expected. And what are the potential consequences of forcing an election on Catalonia? Mr Puigdemont has promised to call a formal vote on independence in Catalonia's parliament if Article 155 is invoked. If such a declaration were approved, the pro-independence forces could style the ballot as the election of a constituent assembly for a new republic, the next stage laid down in the secessionists' road map. Assuming the participation of all parties, voters would be bound to interpret the election as a de facto plebiscite on independence. If a separatist majority emerged once again, it is hard to see how the conflict could be considered closed. Cases for and against independence Would Catalonia be a viable country?

David Blaine denies UK model rape claim,"US illusionist David Blaine is being investigated by the Metropolitan Police over an alleged rape of a British former model in 2004. Natasha Prince, 34, claimed the US magician attacked her at a house in Chelsea, west London, when she was 21. Police have asked Mr Blaine to travel to the UK for interview under caution, according to emails seen by the BBC. Mr Blaine, 44, ""vehemently denies"" the allegations and will ""fully co-operate"" with a police inquiry, his lawyer said. In an email to Ms Prince, the Met said officers had told Mr Blaine's lawyers that they were investigating a ""historic allegation of sexual assault made by a female in London"". The allegation was reported to police in London in November 2016. Ms Prince, who now works as an art dealer in New York, has waived her right to anonymity under sexual offences legislation to confirm she made the allegation. She first made the claims public to US website theDaily Beast,external, saying: ""I think I tried really hard to block it out. But I carried this awful feeling with me."" Mr Blaine's lawyer, Marty Singer, denied all the allegations and told the website: ""My client vehemently denies that he raped or sexually assaulted any woman, ever, and he specifically denies raping a woman in 2004."" He said Mr Blaine will ""fully co-operate"" with any police investigation, saying he has ""nothing to hide"". The Met's Child Abuse and Sexual Offences Command confirmed it was investigating an allegation of rape at an address in Chelsea in June or July 2004 of a woman aged 21. The force said there had been no arrests and enquiries were ongoing.

Visa U-turn for stroke survivor's wife,"Leah Waterman cares for her husband Simon who can barely speak and needs 24-hour help The wife of a stroke survivor who was told she must leave the UK to apply for a visa has now had it approved. Leah Waterman, who is from the Philippines, hadfaced being split from her husbandSimon who can barely speak and needs 24-hour help. Mr Waterman had been told he would have to become the sole carer of their two children at their home in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. But the Home Office has now confirmed they can stay together. Mrs Waterman said she felt ""happy and overwhelmed"". ""I'm looking forward to every day now we don't have to think about what's going to happen next,"" she said. ""We are more focussed on Simon's condition. ""We can be more relaxed and not worry about anything, it means we can move forward."" Leah Waterman cares for her husband who has seizures Mr Waterman, who can communicate with the help of a mobile phone app, said he felt ""happy, awesome, proud"" after the decision. Mr Waterman, 56, uses a wheelchair and has regular seizures after having a severe stroke in September 2015 when living in the Philippines. After spending more than a month in hospital, Mr Waterman and his wife and children - now seven and 10 - visited family in Monmouthshire in December 2015. Shortly afterwards, Mr Waterman developed seizures and the couple decided to stay near his family for support. On the expiry of Mrs Waterman's visitor's visa in July 2016, she applied to remain in the country. The Home Office had ruled the family did not have the exceptional circumstances required to apply for a visa from within the UK and Leah would need to apply from the Philippines, leaving the family behind. But with the help of their MP David Davies, the visa has now been approved. ""In light of the new information provided as part of Ms Waterman's appeal, we were able to take into account her exceptional circumstances and have now granted her limited leave to remain,"" said a Home Office spokesperson.

Coronation Street forerunner's script found,"Tony Warren created Coronation Street in 1960 A script for Coronation Street creator Tony Warren's previously unknown first attempt at a soap opera has been found. Before Warren changed the TV landscape with Coronation Street in 1960, he started writing Seven, Bessie Street. His friend David Tucker said it centres on a terraced street but is otherwise very different from Coronation Street. The script was found in his possessions after he died in 2016 and is now part of an exhibition dedicated to Warren at Salford Museum and Art Gallery. Warren left his estate to Mr Tucker, a friend of 22 years, with an instruction to destroy all creative works that weren't already in the public domain. Seven, Bessie Street was billed as ""a new soap opera in half-hourly episodes"" But Mr Tucker decided to keep the Seven, Bessie Street - with the proviso that no one else could read it. The script is in a frame in the Salford exhibition with just the cover page, billing it as ""a new soap opera in half-hourly episodes"", on show. Mr Tucker has read it, however, and says it was ""quite obviously planned as a soap opera"". ""The only thing really that relates to Coronation Street is the setting of a terraced street and the fact that it jumps a little bit between peoples' lives,"" he told BBC News. ""But there are no characters that relate to Coronation Street at all, and no scenarios. It's very different."" The exhibition traces Warren's life and career Seven, Bessie Street revolves around a family - perhaps inspired by Warren's own - who all have theatrical connections. ""That's what Tony did know about in his youth,"" Mr Tucker said. ""That's probably why it would never have worked as it was, because there was so much in the stories about theatre. ""He was writing from what he knew in that Bessie Street script, but it probably wasn't going to relate that well to everybody else. ""So he then shifted the focus to the more mundane aspects of terraced street life."" Although Warren cast the script aside, Bessie Street did make its way into Coronation Street. Weatherfield's local primary school is called Bessie Street School. The exhibition also includes the typewriter Warren used in his early years. Warren modelled knitwear products in his youth After jettisoning Seven, Bessie Street, Warren pitched a drama titled Our Street to the BBC. But he didn't hear back, so he reworked it as Florizel Street for Granada. Florizel Street was changed to Coronation Street because - as legend has it - a tea lady named Agnes remarked that Florizel sounded like the name of a disinfectant. Coronation Street launched in December 1960 and soon became one of the most popular programmes on television. The exhibition also traces Warren's early life and career, which included acting in the BBC's Northern Children's Hour and writing for police series Shadow Squad. According to a 1958 receipt, he was paid Â£150 for the latter. The exhibition also shows his past as a male model, appearing on the cover of a 1957 edition of Knitters Digest and on the packet for a pullover knitting pattern. There are many mementos from the Corrie years too, including his MBE, various awards, his red This Is Your Life book and letters from former poet laureate John Betjeman describing it as his ""favourite programme"". Betjeman and Laurence Olivier were such fans that they were chairman and president respectively of the British League for Hilda Ogden, established in 1979.

Tenants 'unfairly miss out on credit',"Tenants' regular rent payments should be recorded on their credit score and used as proof to lenders that mortgage demands can be met, MPs are to be told. At present, mortgage applicants are unable to rely on rent payment history as proof that they would be safe to lend to when buying a home. A debate is being held in Parliament on Monday following a petition which aimed to raise awareness of the issue. The government has said that lenders should consider a range of factors. The petition, signed by 147,307 people, argued that ""paying rent on time [should] be recognised as evidence that mortgage repayments can be met"". Campaigners have argued that rent payment history should be included on a tenant's credit score, even though it is not strictly a form of credit. Steve Burrows, managing director of LateRent which offers a service to landlords, said: ""It is no secret that owning a property has become a distant prospect for many and the private rental sector continues to grow as a result. ""It is therefore oddly out of step that tenants are unable to utilise rental payments as part of their credit profile - particularly as the government increasingly seeks to promote homeownership across the UK."" Conservative MP Paul Scully, who will introduce and lead the debate on Monday, said that he was sympathetic to those who were paying more for credit, or being turned down, simply because they had been renting a home. This was particularly true when monthly rent was higher than typical monthly mortgage repayments. ""It is clear that in many cases if someone is renting, they can afford the equivalent mortgage,"" he said. The petition was cut short owing to the general election being called earlier this year, but still garnered sufficient support for a debate to be called. In its response to the petition, the government said regulators insisted that lots of financial information was needed to prove that an applicant could repay a mortgage, such as testing whether a borrower could cope were interest rates to rise. ""Lenders must consider a range of factors when assessing a mortgage application. Meeting rental payments is not sufficient in itself to demonstrate affordability over the lifetime of the loan,"" it said. ""It is important to be aware that home ownership brings a number of additional expenses that may not be incurred when renting, including maintenance costs and buildings insurance. ""Before extending a loan, lenders must satisfy themselves that a borrower will be able to meet these additional on-going costs when considering a mortgage application.""

Meteor shower to fill weekend skies,"Dozens of shooting stars are expected in the skies over the weekend The sky will be filled with shooting stars this weekend thanks to debris from Halley's Comet. The annual Orionid meteor shower will see around 20 meteors passing through the sky every hour. The shower is visible throughout the month, but experts say the peak time to view it in the UK will be early on Sunday, between midnight and 03:00 BST. Astronomer Tom Kerss said the Orionid meteors are known for their ""speed and brilliance"". Meteor bursting into flames caught on camera Stunning images of Perseid meteor shower Halley's Comet is the only comet regularly visible from Earth by the naked eye and it comes into view once every 75 years. The last time it appeared was in 1986, with the next viewing expected in 2061. When Halley's Comet passes through the solar system, particles of debris break away from it. These hurtle towards Earth at the speed of 148,000mph, and we see them as shooting stars. Mr Kerss, who is based at the Royal Observatory Greenwich, recommended secluded spots with the darkest skies for the best view, but he said not to worry about bringing any equipment. ""There's no advantage to using binoculars or a telescope,"" he said. ""Your eyes are the best tool available for spotting meteors."" ""So, relax and gaze up at the sky, and eventually your patience will be rewarded.""

MP sorry for 'unacceptable language',"A Labour MP has apologised for using ""offensive and unacceptable"" language at the party conference last month. Norwich South MP Clive Lewis was filmed on stage at a fringe event in Brighton saying: ""Get on your knees, bitch"" - the video emerged on social media. Among female MPs criticising him was Labour's Harriet Harman, whotweeted,external: ""Inexplicable. Inexcusable. Dismayed."" The Labour Party said the language ""was completely unacceptable and falls far short of the standard we expect"". It is not clear who Mr Lewis, a former frontbencher, was addressing in the video. He is among several people on stage at the time. This video can not be played Clive Lewis apologises for 'unacceptable language' Aaron Bastani, the co-founder of left wing website Novara Media, tweeted: ""I was there. The video has been up at @novaramedia for a month - Clive was saying this to a man."" But after criticism of his alleged comments, Mr Lewistweeted,external: ""I apologise unreservedly for the language I used at an event in Brighton last month. It was offensive and unacceptable."" Among MPs lining up to condemn his language on Twitter were the Conservative Mims Davies, who suggested Mr Lewis needed to go on a training course. Mr Lewis's fellow Labour MP Jess Phillips said: ""Just seen the Clive Lewis video. Obviously I am appalled, just listened to seven teenage girls speak up about gender inequality. Perhaps I'll bring them to work on Monday."" And Rebecca Hilsenrath, chief executive of the Equality and Human Rights Commission, said Mr Lewis's use of language was ""completely inexcusable"" adding: ""We, and the women in Mr Lewis's constituency, have every right to expect our MPs to behave in a more professional manner."" Education Secretary Justine Greening, who is also minister for women and equalities, called on Jeremy Corbyn to help stamp out misogynistic behaviour towards MPs. The Conservative minister said the Labour leader should condemn Mr Lewis's words and asked Mr Corbyn to set out how he was going to stamp out sexism in his own party. BBC East political correspondent Andrew Sinclair said the MP has told friends the comments were directed at a man during a ""boozy and sweary"" comedy event as part of ""on-stage banter"" and were not intended to cause offence.

Police cleared over moped crash death,"This video can not be played The Met has released CCTV footage of Henry Hicks Four Met officers have been cleared of gross misconduct over an 18-year-old man who died in a moped crash. Henry Hicks was fleeing officers in two unmarked cars when he died, aninquest jury found. Police were following him at speeds of more than 50mph when he came off his moped in Islington, north London, in December 2014. A Met Police disciplinary panel ruled the four officers were not technically in a police pursuit at the time. Henry Hicks died after his moped collided with another vehicle on Wheelright Street in Islington Following the hearing Mr Hick's sister, Claudia Hicks, said: ""We are beyond disappointed by this ruling. ""We won't stop fighting for accountability for Henry's death. We miss him every day."" The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) had previouslyrecommended to the force the pursuit had been carried out without proper authorisationand the officers should face disciplinary proceedings. However, the panel ruled the accusations were not proven as they were not technically engaged in a pursuit, as defined by police rules. Officers claimed they were travelling too far behind Mr Hicks for him to know he was being followed, even though they had turned on their blue lights and sirens. Henry Hicks died after he collided with another vehicle on Wheelwright Street in Islington Under Met Police policy, the control room has to be immediately alerted to pursuits, which must be authorised in all but exceptional circumstances. Mr Hicks died when his moped crashed into a minicab in Wheelwright Street, near to Pentonville prison. He was found to be carrying seven bags of skunk cannabis and multiple phones. The teenager had been stopped and searched at least 71 times between October 2011 and December 2014. Deborah Coles, director of Inquest - a charity which looks into deaths in custody - said the decision ""raised serious questions about the integrity of police misconduct hearings"". ""It is difficult to reconcile this outcome, reached after two days evidence of a police disciplinary panel, with the conclusions of an inquest jury after two weeks of evidence which came to the opposite conclusion,"" Ms Coles said. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said: ""Every day in London we ask our officers to make difficult decisions in fast-moving situations. ""Policing is a job that people sign up to because they want to help the public."" Following Mr Hicks' death the Met carried out a review of its pursuit policy, he added.

What it's like being black and working class at Cambridge,"Chelsea Kwakye is not your typical Cambridge University student. Her mum is a nurse, her dad works in a post office depot, she went to a state school - and she's black and British. Newly released data has found that four-fifths ofstudents accepted at Oxbridgebetween 2010 and 2015 have parents in top professional and managerial jobs. The figures also show that only three of Oxford's 32 colleges made an offer to a black A-level applicant every year over the same period. Statistics from Cambridge revealed a quarter of colleges failed to make any offers to black British applicants during that time. Chelsea, 20, is in her final year studying history at Cambridge. She told Newsbeat how her university experience had in many ways been shaped by a lack of representation. Chelsea is the only black female on her university course ""I'm the only black female on my course at the moment, and in terms of males I think there are about two,"" she said. ""There's so much opportunity to study such a breadth of history from all over the world, Europe, Asia and Africa. ""But it has been difficult at times being taught by a white lecturer and then being the only black student when you're doing a paper in the history of Africa."" ""Visibility is definitely a problem. It's almost like a cycle where you don't see many black people at Cambridge or in courses like history so you think it's something that black people don't do."" A spokesman at Cambridge said it currently spent Â£5m on outreach to encourage students from all backgrounds to apply. But in Chelsea's experience, she wishes the teachers at her state school had known more about the application process. ""The main resource that I had to use was the internet, so looking at the website online and going on YouTube to find out about the interview process,"" she said. ""But I remember at college my teachers didn't know a lot about the application process. ""So I think in terms of access it's not just about focusing on prospective students, but also the teachers and how they're encouraging students from state schools to apply."" Chelsea says she wishes teachers at her state school knew more about the Cambridge application process Chelsea, who is vice-president of the Cambridge University African Caribbean Society, says the lack of representation extends further than race. ""For me something that I do try to emphasise is that black doesn't always mean working class. ""So I think we need to be careful when we talk about this situation as it affects white working-class people too. ""But in spite of this I've had a very good experience - we can't let a lack of representation stop us from getting the best out of our time here.""

The wild birds caged because they sing too well," An almost luminous emerald Javan green magpie raises comical, Groucho Marx eyebrows quizzically - cocking its head. With a bright orange beak and black bandit mask plumage, it looks for all the world like a cartoon character. The garish look helps camouflage the bird in its natural home in the rainforest. But its voice is not so discreet. It announces its presence by barking out a loud, eclectic range of calls - from rhythmic trills of increasing pitch, to high squeaks and low, raucous squawks. Often, all are performed in combination. I am not watching this bird in the mountain forests of Java - its natural home, but in a high-security aviary. Once, it had been stolen for its song. Today, it is under lock and key in a yard patrolled by two large dogs and surrounded by a tall, spiked fence. This is for its own protection. No-one has reported seeing a wild Javan green magpie in its natural habitat for several years. Conservationists think the number remaining in the wild is vanishingly small - perhaps as low as 50. The bird - a tropical relative of the crows and magpies so familiar across much of Europe - is now a poster child for what conservationists are calling the songbird crisis. Almost 50 different species of songbirds are native to Indonesia. They used to be a common sight, but now they are threatened with extinction, according to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). For 19 of those species, the sad irony of their slide towards oblivion is that they are trapped in the wild to supply markets, because there is a national adoration, an obsession, with pet songbirds. They are a status symbol - even a cultural requirement. Owning a caged bird, for some, is a high-value ticket to prizes worth tens of thousands of US dollars - the top prize for national bird-singing competitions. That is why - while forests rapidly fall silent - almost any species can be found crammed into bird markets in the bustling capital Jakarta, and across the country. Pramuka Market in Jakarta is said to be the largest wildlife market in Asia, and possibly the world. The open-sided, multi-storey concrete structure is several storeys high, with walkways and stalls packed with cages - large and small. Some are filled with dozens of birds, piled on top of one another. Some of the highest-value birds have ornate cages of their own. But it is the sheer volume that is striking. Cages hang like a chaotic array of Christmas tree baubles. The sellers hand-feed birds with long, skinny spoons that they poke through narrow gaps between cage bars. Some use hoses to shower their birds in fresh water. Walking through the market, it feels too crammed, noisy and overwhelming to make any reliable assessment of how many, and what kinds of birds are here. But Andrew Owen from Chester Zoo in the UK is here regularly, with his team of Indonesian and international colleagues, in an attempt to do just that. The most thorough study, published by the wildlife trade monitoring network Traffic in 2015, found almost 20,000 birds for sale in a single day, in three of Jakarta’s bird markets. Most of those were caught from the wild. Many were protected species, and being sold in violation of Indonesian law. Andrew Owen “Indonesia has a really high number of bird species, and there are more than 140 threatened species,” Owen says. “Some of them are protected under Indonesian law, and we may well see some of those here today.” Pramuka Market’s director Ajie Ruslan, who shows us around, simply says his market does not sell endangered birds. But Owen has seen protected species up for sale here. And while he and his colleagues would like to see enforcement to prevent illegal trade, the problem is now about scale. It is wider than just a lack of official protection for a small group of threatened species. “When the price of a popular bird goes up, because it is getting very rare, the trappers will move on to another species as a substitute. So then that gets targeted,” says Owen. “It’s a vicious circle. We have to record everything here and not try to get too upset, but it’s hard when you see birds that should be flying free in the forest sitting here in little cages. “Many of them have very short, sad lives.” Javan green magpies are high on the list of endangered species. They were formally listed as critically endangered. Occasionally, they show up in the markets. “A new, trapped bird turning up in the market is one of the few ways we have to confirm that there are still wild populations,”  says Owen.  “They’re so difficult to find in the forests now.” The bird I watched in the conservation aviary was found for sale in a market in the West Javan city of Bandung. At her new home at the Cikananga Conservation Breeding Centre, the bird has been named Jimat - the Indonesian word for mascot - by centre manager Anais Tritto. Anais Tritto at the CCBC “We received word that there was a Javan green magpie in the market there in December 2014,” she says. She and her team needed photographic evidence, so they sent someone to the market with a camera. “The pictures showed a bright blue magpie - not the normal colour for this species. “But when they’re kept in cages, their colour changes from green to bright blue.” The birds literally fade as they survive in a cage on an inadequate diet. Javan green magpie ""Jimat""without green pigment In the wild, they naturally dye themselves bright green by eating lots of green insects that contain a yellow pigment called lutein. “In the market, the bird only receives commercial pellets, brown crickets and mealworms, so they fade to blue,” says Tritto. Finally, a team from Cikananga was dispatched to Bandung, to confiscate the bird. “After the bird was moved to our aviaries, and received a diet supplemented with lutein, little by little after moulting, she came back to her original colour,” says Tritto.

Even the high fences and locked aviaries of Cikananga have been targeted by bird trappers looking for the rarest birds to sell. A few months before Jimat’s rescue and her arrival at Cikananga, the bird keepers walked through the gates in the morning to find the place strangely quiet. “You normally hear so much noise in the morning - it’s like a contained dawn chorus,” Jonathan Beilby from Cikananga explains. Jonathan Beilby “They realised that all the aviaries on one side had been ripped open and dozens of birds had been stolen. “The robbery focused on black-winged mynas - they took 140 birds. “One of those might fetch 1.5m rupiah - over $100 - which is more than a month’s wages for some people.” The team was devastated. Cikananga is home to the rarest of the rare, such as the critically endangered magpies and mynas - as well as rufous-fronted and Sumatran laughingthrushes.  Rufous-fronted laughingthrush (top)and Sumatran laughingthrush Every pair of these birds provides the prospect of a stronger future for each species. Before they’re introduced to a potential mate, every bird is genetically screened to work out which males and females are most biologically compatible. They are then carefully monitored. Years of this painstaking conservation work was wrecked in one night by that break-in. It meant, though, that by the time Jimat arrived to join the other 60 Javan green magpies that the thieves had left behind, the aviaries had received a security overhaul. Cikananga Conservation Breeding Centre CCBC is now surrounded by a high, metal fence. Guard dogs patrol the outer yard and a CCTV network covers every enclosure, providing 24-hour coverage. That also allows the team here to monitor the nests - keeping a close watch over eggs and precious chicks. The team thinks the robbers might not have known that the magpies were in the block of aviaries just next door to the ones they raided. If they had, they would almost certainly have taken those birds, too. “Everyone who keeps songbirds wants a magpie,” says Chester Zoo’s Andrew Owen. “They’re used as teacher birds, because they have such a complex repertoire of songs.” As the birds instinctively try to out-sing one another, they pick up new sounds and put together repertoires that will earn them a higher score from an expert judge. Heri Pranoto is one of these passionate, competitive bird-owners. As he shows me up to the large, open terrace of his home, we pass one ornate wooden bird cage in the hall, containing a white-rumped shama. Another two are hanging up outside on the terrace, with another shama and a black-and-white oriental magpie-robin. Both species are now bred in captivity in huge numbers - such is their popularity in the bird-singing competition world. Heri Pranoto He has five birds in the house. The one in the hallway is a five-time winner of the President’s Cup - a major, national bird-singing competition, where the top prize is one billion rupiah, about $80,000 (£60,500). Today, Pranoto is helping to manage a competition run by the PBI - a bird breeding association of which he is a member. PBI represents some of the upper echelons of the bird-singing world and runs its own competitions. It has set up a small competition with white-rumped shamas and lovebirds - another of Java’s favourite avian singers. It is a relatively small event - the prize money is only a few hundred US dollars. Entrants arrive at the arena with their birds’ pristine cages covered up - many carrying special bird-cage backpacks, or with more than one birdcage strapped to a moped. Six judges stand around the cages listening to the birds - which instinctively sing when they see one another. The birds are scored in three categories - tone, volume and performance. The atmosphere is jovial - but be in no doubt, people are here to win. Men - and almost everyone here is male - puff on cigarettes as they survey the competition. Owners signal, click and whistle to their birds to encourage them. Tony Sumampau has arranged our invitation to the event. He is a wealthy and influential friend of the bird breeders association. He owns and manages a successful safari park called Taman Safari, and says he now wants to invest profit from that business into helping save Java’s wild birds. “In Java, to truly be a man,” he says, “it is said that you should have a house, a wife, horses - or transport - a weapon and a bird. “Then you are real Javanese.” Tony Sumampau Sumampau, and the people at the head of the bird-breeding association, understand that owning birds is so deeply-rooted in local culture that it is pointless to fight the trade in the name of conservation. Instead, they aim to encourage sellers to learn how to breed the birds that people want in captivity - to supply the trade sustainably and preserve the wild. “This association has already banned wild-caught birds from its events,” says Sumampau. “We now want to encourage other associations to do the same.” Today, Pranoto is helping to manage a competition run by the PBI - a bird breeding association of which he is a member.

Habitat is being destroyed by encroaching civilisation. More remote areas, once safe for wildlife because they were difficult to reach, are becoming more accessible. To understand what drives poaching and trapping here, I went to visit Mount Malabar, a protected forest and the focal point of a mission by the organisation Conservation International (CI) to bring another victim of the pet trade back to the wild. Here, CI is running a project to release endangered Javan gibbons which have been rescued from the pet trade. Javan gibbons The trade in primates is still a threat to endangered ape species in Indonesia, but this site and the work here provide a glimmer of hope for the gibbons. A released male and female - both of which were rescued and rehabilitated - have just had a baby. It is the first born in the wild here. Part of Conservation International’s success is its work with former hunters and trappers, like Uwas, my guide on a trek to spot the newly wild gibbon family. Uwas “I used to hunt here, so I know this forest,” says Uwas. “I would catch any birds - from big to small birds. Anything that lives in this forest.” Uwas shows me how to build a small bird trap from just a few twigs and some string. It is a spring-loaded device that snatches up a bird’s legs in a loop. Trappers’ methods are adapting quickly, though. Surveys carried out here and in other areas of forest habitat, show that larger numbers of birds are being targeted by increasingly high-tech methods. Chester Zoo’s Andrew Owen has seen evidence of bird-trappers using large mist nets - where metres of netting are strung up to capture anything that flies. Uwas no longer hunts, because he is now able to channel his knowledge of the forest into his new role monitoring and protecting the gibbons - including patrolling for any sign of illegal hunting in the protected parkland of Mount Malabar. “It was not my main job to hunt,” says Uwas. “I would just do it when I had no work and needed money. “When I started to work here, I realised how important these animals and the forest are - for all of us.” But many do not have the opportunity of a new job in conservation. Thirty million Indonesians still live in poverty - and trapping is a guaranteed income, because demand is still so high. Many in Indonesia are feeling the positive effects of their growing economy, and there is more disposable income - income that is used to buy birds.

The aim for the future of the birds at Cikananga is to move beyond life in a cage. The team hopes ultimately to release the birds bred here into the wild. Black-winged myna But their attempts to find somewhere safe to do this have so far been unsuccessful. Even with the ranger patrols, trapping still happens in Mount Malabar’s forests. And the green hills and agricultural land close to Cikananga itself - still peppered with trees - looks like good habitat upon first viewing. But surveys have found trappers to be active in the area. This is where Tony Sumampau comes in. Taman Safari, his park in the hills between the towns of Bogor and Sukubumi, is 260 hectares of highly forested land. Zebra-spotting in Taman Safari Park While the jungle fairground that is the safari park is in the centre, there is still a large area of undeveloped forest. So he is using his own land to provide a safe home for the critically endangered black-winged myna. So far, 15 birds born and bred in the aviary at Taman - tucked away from the animal shows and selfie-snapping tourists - have been released into the forest. There is enough space and plenty of trees for the birds to nest, feed and breed. And because it is Sumampau’s own land, he is able to protect it. “We have been working with the local community here to encourage them not to buy wild-caught birds.” It is one small pocket of success - the birds released here have not been targeted by trappers. And Sumampau’s ultimate goal - with this encouragement of bird-breeding - is to “flood the market with captive-bred birds”. So people will be able to buy the birds easily and keep them in their homes.” Because, he says, with bird-ownership so ingrained in Javanese culture, they will “never be able to stop people from wanting to own birds”. At Cikananga, the team hopes that Java’s children can become the future custodians of their environment. Ade Imansyah, an education officer at the centre, visits local schools regularly to talk to the children about the wildlife that is - or should be - on their doorstep. Here, in these upland villages, a few hours from the chaos of the city, most of the children have parents who farm. Ade Imansyah talks to school children Birds, he explains to the attentive children, are not just pretty, feathered singers. They’re also natural pest-controllers - feeding on insects that eat the crops. “I hope they will understand the benefit of wild animals and birds for them, for their parents, for their agriculture,” says Imansyah. Birds like Jimat - one of the few remaining members of her species - face a future under lock and key in the secure Cikananga aviaries. The determined team there have years of work ahead to keep these birds safe and to breed them in captivity. Jimat herself has just been introduced to a new mate in the hope that she will raise some precious Javan green magpie chicks. If any patch of forest can be made safe, they might once again fill the mountains with the alluring, complex song that made them such a target. Built with Shorthand"
Has May promised EU more divorce money?,"It's all about the money. The UK and the EU have managed together to make a tiptoe forward in the Brexit talks. But listening to EU leaders this afternoon it is abundantly clear that unless they change their minds, the UK is going to have to budge on the cash to make enough progress by December to be able to truly get on to the next phase of talks. Certainly public money is tight in this administration, but frankly a hefty Brexit bill in exchange for a good deal would be the one big payment that the Chancellor Philip Hammond would be happy to sign off. A move on the money is, therefore, primarily a political problem rather than anything to do with the actual funds. There are whispers that Theresa May has privately reassured the other leaders that she is willing to put a lot more than the implicit 20 billion euros (Â£17.8bn) on the table as we leave. Number 10 doesn't deny this, Mrs May didn't deny it when we asked her in the press conference today, nor did she reject the idea that the bill could be as high as 60 billion euros. If she has actually given those private reassurances though, there's not much evidence the other EU leaders believe her or think it's enough. But if she is to make that case more forcefully she has big political problems at home. A much bigger payment is anathema to many Conservatives, and could frustrate swathes of voters who plumped for Brexit, in part on a promise that the country would get money back. Number 10 is well aware of this. One insider told me ""it's all about the quantum,"" what ""the party would swallow'. Could a party with a powerful group of Brexiteers, including ministers who have gone on the record to say we shouldn't be shelling out much, really tolerate the prime minister calling for support to pay tens of billions? This is not a question for now, but it has been logged for future reference inside Number 10. Will there be a day when the prime minister decides to make a plain admission to the country, that the potential cost of leaving with no deal is a scarier prospect than having to cough up as much as 60 billion euros? About half what we spend on the NHS, but more than we spend on defence? Or will she be pushed by those in her party who genuinely believe that is far better to cut our losses and walk out, than commit to an expensive deal. Carrying her party and her European counterparts at the same time is Theresa May's fundamental challenge - on the face of it almost impossible. And today's tiptoe forward is no guarantee that ultimately she will be able to go all the way. PSThere's lots of speculation that when the French President said the UK was not even ""half way there"" he was hinting that the bill could therefore be ultimately at least double 40 billion euros. It wasn't really clear during the press conference that is what he meant, or whether he was using ""half way there"" to describe the state of the negotiations. However, for ages in Westminster there has been an expectation that the eventual bill will be somewhere in that region, somewhere between 40 and 60, so it is not crazy to imagine that Macron's comments are further evidence that's the case.

Bringing Nazi camp tourism to the British Isles,"Four major camps operated in Alderney between 1942 and 1944, named after the German North Sea Islands Helgoland, Borkum, Norderney, and Sylt The western-most concentration camp in the Third Reich, Lager Sylt, was located on British soil - only about 70 miles south of Bournemouth on the island of Alderney. Should this camp and other relics of the Channel Islands' occupation by Nazi Germany be developed into tourist attractions? Arrive in Alderney at its small and ageing airport and you will see an island map, pointing out Victorian forts, a Roman nunnery and World War Two coastal defences. There is, however, no mention of the four wartime camps that housed thousands of slave labourers, many of whom died as part of Nazi Germany's attempts to turn Alderney into a fortress island. Workers were kept in conditions of ""deliberate inhumanity"" with beatings, disease, and starvation rife, according to a post-war report It is these locations that Marcus Roberts, director of the National Anglo-Jewish Heritage Trail, believes should be developed as ""sites of memory"", in part to boost the island's flagging tourism industry. ""Alderney is perhaps the best place to go to understand the realities of the Nazi slave labour system,"" he said. ""People could go and understand what the consequences of tyranny are and the mistreatment of other people. ""I think there's a role for respectable tourism, which would be part of the overall tourism strategy for the island."" Alderney occupation V1 rockets were developed in nearby Cherbourg Demilitarised in 1940, along with other Channel Islands Occupied by German forces in July 1940 The most heavily fortified Channel Island as part of Hitler's Atlantic Wall Nearly all of Alderney's population was evacuated to England Four labour camps were established - named after the German islands Borkum, Helgoland, Norderney and Sylt Mr Roberts believes there were significantly more forced labourers on Alderney than post-war reports stated, including about 10,000 predominantly French Jews. Albert Eblagon survived Norderney and described to Israeli journalist Solomon Steckoll in an account published in 1982 how fellow prisoners were beaten and starved to death. Some aged over 70, they worked up to 14 hours each day building the island's fortifications. ""Every day there were beatings, and people's bones were broken, their arms or their legs,"" he recalled. ""People died from overwork. We were starved and worked to death; so many died from total exhaustion."" The number of his fellow prisoners and forced labourers who did not survive has been contested, ranging from an official post-war report that stated 389 deaths, to as many as 70,000. Marcus Roberts says his research has shown a greater number of Jews were killed on occupied Alderney than has been previously estimated Focusing on thistraumatic pastled to Mr Roberts being accused of promoting Alderney as a ""bone-yard"" and making it less attractive to visitors. In response, he wrote a letter to theAlderney Journal,externalin June defending his research and pointing to nearby northern France where military cemeteries are popular tourist attractions. The number of people travelling to and from the island by air has fallen by more than a quarter in the 10 years to 2016, although there was a slight rise in summer 2017 compared to the year before. But developing the island's former Nazi sites for visitors is something States of Alderney Vice President Ian Tugby is against. ""We're supposed to be a lovely island, going forward,"" he said. ""I'm more interested in the future, basically, than what's gone on in the past, because the past is gone. ""We can't change it, and do we want to continue to drag up the downside of what went on in Alderney all those years ago?"" The entrance posts of Lager Sylt, the western-most concentration camp in the Third Reich The four major camps were run by the Todt Organisation, responsible for Nazi Germany's military and civic engineering. Sylt, the only concentration camp, was taken over by the SS Baubrigade in 1943, part of the so-called death's head formation, which ran concentration camps. More than 40,000 camps and incarceration sites were established by the Nazis across Europe for forced labour, detention - and mass murder. Alderney inmates were predominantly Russian, and comprised of prisoners of war, forced labourers, ""volunteers"" from Germany and occupied countries, Jews, and political prisoners. Helgoland and Norderney, today a campsite, both had the capacity for 1,500 forced labourers. Borkum housed specialist craftsmen, many ordered there from either Germany or occupied countries, with between 500 and 1,000 prisoners at the site. Mr Tugby's voting record in the island's parliament suggests he is serious. In 2015, he and fellow Alderney-born politician Louis Jean were the only two politicians to vote against designating Lager Sylt a conservation area. Economic independence for the island, reliant on its larger neighbour Guernsey, lies in approving a Â£500m electricity cable project linking France and Britain through the island, not in promoting its wartime occupation, Mr Tugby said. The FAB Link project will run through a conservation area, at Longis Common, but developers say the cable would avoid known World War Two burial sites Graham McKinley voted in favour of Lager Sylt becoming a conservation site, and would like the dark past of the three other island forced labour camps to be made more apparent to visitors However, fellow politician Graham McKinley, who voted in favour of Sylt being protected, would like to see a similar memorial to the one at Sylt (pictured above) at the three other forced labour sites, including Lager Norderney, the largest, which is today home to Alderney's campsite. ""There should be some sort of memorial put up there, and some sort of indication that that was happening."" People would visit sites like these, he said, if they were more aware of the island's ""unique wartime interest"". ""Look at the prisoner-of-war camps in Poland and in Germany which attract an enormous amount of visitors every year and bring in much-needed revenue,"" he said. ""We need that sort of thing."" Alderney's population was evacuated ahead of its occupation, with few local eyewitnesses to what happened in the island's camps Unlike with the island's plentiful occupation-era coastal defences, there is little remaining of the forced labour sites, except for entrance gates and the odd structure. Sylt is protected after Alderney's government designated it a conservation area in 2015, while the other three sites could yet be afforded similar protection under a plan awaiting government approval. The 2017 Land Use Plan would see the sites where the forced labour camps stood, and other locations of wartime significance, registered as heritage assets. Only development that is ""sensitive to the former use and history of these assets"" would be permitted at the wartime sites, under the plan. Various parts of Alderney, highlighted in purple, have been identified as ""unregistered heritage assets of significant value"" Such protection is long overdue, according to Trevor Davenport, author of Festung Alderney, a book on German defences on the island. Despite a long association with protecting World War Two sites, Mr Davenport does not, however, want to see former forced labour sites developed for visitors. ""I have no objection to people being made aware of the labour camps,"" he said. ""But it is not, unless you are a ghoul, a heritage issue that needs promoting, except as part of the overall occupation story."" The Alderney Museum in St Anne is home to a small section telling the story of the island's forced workers Certainly, the island's tourism body Visit Alderney is reluctant to promote this part of the island's history above any other. ""Our tourism focus remains on the historical importance and education of all our heritage periods,"" a spokeswoman said. ""The local population are respectful of our past whatever the historical period. ""Promoting tourism and respectful memoriam should not be confused."" Former forced labour camp Norderney is today home to Alderney's campsite The Hammond Memorial overlooking Longis Common contains tributes in many languages to those who died constructing this small section of Hitler's Atlantic Wall But for Marcus Roberts, encouraging people to come to Alderney to consider what happened there during the Nazi occupation makes sense both financially and morally. Not only was this important for the descendents of Nazi Germany's victims, he said, but also for the historical record. ""It's not just an island matter; it does affect people literally from around the world. ""Each person who died was someone's family, someone's son, and all lives are valuable.""

What happened after England won World Cup?,"England's women visited Downing Street at the end of August Women's Ashes: Australia v England Venues:Brisbane, Coffs Harbour, Sydney, CanberraDates:22 October - 21 November -full schedule here Coverage details:Ball-by-ball commentary of the series on BBC Radio 5 live sports extra; live text commentary on the Tests & T20s on the BBC Sport website and app Even when you have won the World Cup in the most-watched game of women's cricket of all time, finding somewhere to celebrate isn't as easy as you might think. Yes, there was the emotion of family and friends joining the victorious England team on the Lord's outfield, and the singing of the team song in the dressing room was so loud it ""made the walls shake"". But winning a World Cup on a Sunday is not ideal for finding a venue to keep the party going long into the night - the team's Kensington hotel had to be persuaded to reopen their bar when England returned. While they waited, some players ordered cheese toasties, while others visited the takeaway across the road. Captain Heather Knight was laid low with food poisoning, while match-winner Anya Shrubsole purposely kept a clear head for the early morning media appointments the following day. Later on, a group who went looking for a nightclub - still wearing their kit - were left disappointed. ""It was Katherine Brunt's idea, but nowhere was open,"" said all-rounder Nat Sciver. ""We had a taxi ride around London, got back to the hotel and no-one was left in the bar, so we went to bed."" The enormity of what happened on that grey July day dawned on coach Mark Robinson before he left Lord's, when he saw BBC News at Ten broadcasting live from the Grace Gates. For the rest of the team, it would be revealed over the days and weeks that followed, both publicly and privately. Knight saw pictures of herself on big screens as she passed through Euston Station. Jenny Gunn's welcome home was a banner on the front of her house. Shrubsole was guest of honour at her beloved Portsmouth. Danielle Wyatt paraded the trophy at Stoke City. Tammy Beaumont, the player of the tournament, has since commentated on men's Twenty20 matches for Sky, whileKnight temporarily lost the trophywhen she appeared on BBC Test Match Special. The whole squad were invited to an NFL game at Wembley. For spinner Alex Hartley, returning home to Manchester presented the unique challenge of keeping her medal from boyfriend and Lancashire wicketkeeper Alex Davies. ""After I got back, I had my medal on,"" she said. ""He took it off me and said, 'Right, that's enough now. It's my turn to wear it.' So he wore it for half the day. We shared it for a while. We're a bit sad like that."" Sciver's problems were more practical. The house that she co-owns with Brunt,nicknamed 'Alan'because of the road on which it sits, is no longer home to Sciver, Brunt, Fran Wilson, Beth Langston, Amy Jones and Bailey the dog. They have all vacated, replaced by Loughborough students, with Wilson now living with Tash Farrant. Sciver, Brunt, Langston and Jones have relocated to a temporary abode while they wait for another Sciver-Brunt property to have an extension built. The result has been two house-moves in three months. ""Our time spent at home after the World Cup was actually time spent moving out,"" said Sciver. ""Hopefully the new house will be ready when we get back from the Ashes. We're missing the stressful part of the extension being built - Katherine's dad is being the project manager."" Busy with multiple moves, Sciver was not even aware of her place on the Cricketer magazine's list of the 50 most powerful people in English cricket - she came in at 48th, with Knight 33rd. ""I haven't had a lot of time to look at things like that,"" she said. ""I don't think it will give me any more influence, or let me skip ahead in the queue for the bathroom."" Powerful or not, Sciver says she has only been recognised away from cricket once, and that was standing outside her front door: ""We have to be careful not to make too much noise, because now the new neighbours know who we are."" For Hartley, being recognised at Old Trafford is not unusual. Being proposed to is. ""I was walking out after a Super League game, putting some stuff in the car, and I got shouted at by a group from a cricket club. ""One minute I was having a selfie with one of them, the next I was having a picture with the whole team. One of them proposed to me. It was a surreal moment."" This video can not be played Prime minister welcomes World Cup winners & runners-up With the Super League beginning little more than two weeks after the World Cup was won, the squad disbanded to their domestic teams and only reunited at the end of August for a trip to Downing Street to meet Prime Minister Theresa May. ""I had to back the more politically left-wing in the group to keep their opinions to themselves,"" said Robinson. ""Ali Maiden, the assistant coach, was convinced he could sort Brexit out given half an hour with the PM, but he never got his opportunity. ""The biggest problem was getting everyone in there and making sure they all had the right outfit on. Jenny Gunn put the wrong suit on and was a bit embarrassed."" Gunn actually had two suits with her in London, neither of which were right. That, though, wasn't the only problem with the team's outfits, as the prime minister would learn. ""We were all wearing heels and were in the garden, sinking into the ground. Once you were in one position you couldn't move off too quickly,"" said Sciver. Hartley added: ""There was a photo of me pointing at the prime minister's shoes because she had leopard-print flats. She knew what she was doing. I was telling her that her lawn isn't practical for heels. ""Apart from that, we were all on our best behaviour. No-onedid a Matthew Hoggard.,external ""When I got inside I took my shoes off to feel what the carpet was like. It wasn't that soft. I was quite disappointed."" Alex Hartley discusses footwear with Prime Minister Theresa May Robinson admits the increased attention and demands on their time has ""hit the players like a hurricane"". When they met up to begin their preparations for the Ashes, which begin on Sunday, he said he found them to be ""jaded, not as fresh as we would like them to be"". Before that World Cup win - the moment that changed their lives if not forever, then certainly for the foreseeable future -Robinson described his players as ""lovely"". Has success, the limelight and adulation had an effect? ""They are definitely still the same people,"" he says. ""They know that, as a team, they are not yet where they want to be, so we will make sure we keep striving. ""We wanted to win the World Cup and we want to win the Ashes, but it is not the be-all and end-all. Winning is the best feeling in the world, and you're a mug if you don't want that feeling, but winning does not define us. ""They are people first and cricketers second.""

Visa u-turn for stroke survivor's wife,"Leah Waterman cares for her husband Simon who can barely speak and needs 24-hour help The wife of a stroke survivor who was told she must leave the UK to apply for a visa has now had it approved. Leah Waterman, who is from the Philippines, hadfaced being split from her husbandSimon who can barely speak and needs 24-hour help. Mr Waterman had been told he would have to become the sole carer of their two children at their home in Abergavenny, Monmouthshire. But the Home Office has now confirmed they can stay together. Mrs Waterman said she felt ""happy and overwhelmed"". ""I'm looking forward to every day now we don't have to think about what's going to happen next,"" she said. ""We are more focussed on Simon's condition. ""We can be more relaxed and not worry about anything, it means we can move forward."" Leah Waterman cares for her husband who has seizures Mr Waterman, who can communicate with the help of a mobile phone app, said he felt ""happy, awesome, proud"" after the decision. Mr Waterman, 56, uses a wheelchair and has regular seizures after having a severe stroke in September 2015 when living in the Philippines. After spending more than a month in hospital, Mr Waterman and his wife and children - now seven and 10 - visited family in Monmouthshire in December 2015. Shortly afterwards, Mr Waterman developed seizures and the couple decided to stay near his family for support. On the expiry of Mrs Waterman's visitor's visa in July 2016, she applied to remain in the country. The Home Office had ruled the family did not have the exceptional circumstances required to apply for a visa from within the UK and Leah would need to apply from the Philippines, leaving the family behind. But with the help of their MP David Davies, the visa has now been approved. ""In light of the new information provided as part of Ms Waterman's appeal, we were able to take into account her exceptional circumstances and have now granted her limited leave to remain,"" said a Home Office spokesperson.

Mayor declines to meet Prince Charles,"Prince Charles has been meeting people impacted by August's floods in Northern Ireland The mayor of Derry has refused to meet Prince Charles, who is visiting flood victims in the north west. Sinn FÃ©in's MaolÃ­osa McHugh said he would not meet the Prince due to his role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Parachute Regiment. Fourteen people were killed on Bloody Sunday when British paratroopers opened fire on a civil rights march through the city in January 1972. Mr McHugh said meeting the Prince would be ""premature"". MaolÃ­osa McHugh said meeting the Prince would be 'premature' Prince Charles arrived in County Londonderry earlier to visit communities affected by August's flooding. Mr McHugh said: ""Today's visit to Derry by Prince Charles is difficult for many families in the city, given his ongoing role as Colonel-in-Chief of the Parachute Regiment. ""While I have supported meetings between Sinn FÃ©in and members of the British Royal family, I believe that meeting him in Derry is premature given the ongoing and unresolved sensitivities around the legacy of the massacre carried out by that Regiment."" The DUP's East Londonderry MP, Gregory Campbell, of ""retreating to the comfort of backwoods republicanism"". He added: ""We hear a great deal from republicans about respect and criticisms of unionism for not reaching out to recognise other cultures and traditions. ""It is clear, however, that Maoliosa McHugh does not believe such responsibilities extend to him."" Prince Charles began his visit in Eglinton, where he met residents who had been forced out of their homes. He also met farmers and business owners affected by the flooding. The Prince is also due to visit Drumahoe, an area also badly impacted by the flooding and meet with representatives from the emergency services.

Moped death crash pursuit police cleared,"This video can not be played The Met has released CCTV footage of Henry Hicks Four Met officers have been cleared of gross misconduct over an 18-year-old man who died in a moped crash. Henry Hicks was fleeing officers in two unmarked cars when he died, aninquest jury found. Police were following him at speeds of more than 50mph when he came off his moped in Islington, north London, in December 2014. A Met Police disciplinary panel ruled the four officers were not technically in a police pursuit at the time. Henry Hicks died after his moped collided with another vehicle on Wheelright Street in Islington Following the hearing Mr Hick's sister, Claudia Hicks, said: ""We are beyond disappointed by this ruling. ""We won't stop fighting for accountability for Henry's death. We miss him every day."" The Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) had previouslyrecommended to the force the pursuit had been carried out without proper authorisationand the officers should face disciplinary proceedings. However, the panel ruled the accusations were not proven as they were not technically engaged in a pursuit, as defined by police rules. Officers claimed they were travelling too far behind Mr Hicks for him to know he was being followed, even though they had turned on their blue lights and sirens. Henry Hicks died after he collided with another vehicle on Wheelwright Street in Islington Under Met Police policy, the control room has to be immediately alerted to pursuits, which must be authorised in all but exceptional circumstances. Mr Hicks died when his moped crashed into a minicab in Wheelwright Street, near to Pentonville prison. He was found to be carrying seven bags of skunk cannabis and multiple phones. The teenager had been stopped and searched at least 71 times between October 2011 and December 2014. Deborah Coles, director of Inquest - a charity which looks into deaths in custody - said the decision ""raised serious questions about the integrity of police misconduct hearings"". ""It is difficult to reconcile this outcome, reached after two days evidence of a police disciplinary panel, with the conclusions of an inquest jury after two weeks of evidence which came to the opposite conclusion,"" Ms Coles said. Met Police Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said: ""Every day in London we ask our officers to make difficult decisions in fast-moving situations. ""Policing is a job that people sign up to because they want to help the public."" Following Mr Hicks' death the Met carried out a review of its pursuit policy, he added.

10 fines at the dentist... that weren't fine,"When dentists warned that tens of thousands of people were being unfairlyfined Â£100 after a visit to the surgery- it prompted a big response from the audience. They described their distress at getting mistakenly caught up in a system of penalties intended to catch fraudsters getting free treatment. They talked of their confusion over forms and complained that fines had been applied without adequate checks. The NHS Business Services Authority is looking for ways to improve information and simplify forms. ""I am most distraught because I received a penalty charge notice two days ago. I have worked most of my life and paid my NHS contributions. After suffering from breast cancer, the aftercare treatment had a horrendous effect on me, especially on my teeth. So I contacted the emergency dentist and on arrival I was asked for my NHS exempt card, which I provided. ""I received one filling - and weeks later the penalty charge notice came through the door. I am being fined Â£100. ""As I am on a low income and could not afford to pay the fine, I have been given the option to pay over a period of months. I am upset to the extreme to have received this fine."" ""The same thing happened to my son a couple of months ago. My son is a vulnerable adult with Asperger's syndrome. He was sent a letter saying he had claimed exemption, but in fact we had paid for his dental care in full. ""I had to copy my receipts for the payment and go to the dentist's surgery to get a confirmation receipt as well as writing a cover letter. ""What a waste of time and resources for all concerned. Fortunately the penalty was withdrawn, but there was no hint of an apology in the letter for the stress and worry their mistake had caused."" ""I no longer go to the dentist after receiving three penalty notices of Â£100 - the last two after already providing the evidence required. Normal citizens being treated as fraudsters has become normalised."" ""This happened to my sister. She has a learning disability and completed the same form she had always completed, saying that she received a disability benefit and was entitled to free treatment. ""She subsequently received the Â£100 fine and, not understanding why this had been received, she asked me to investigate. ""I wrote to the chief executive of the NHS agency expressing how immoral and badly managed the system was - running the risk that it would discourage people from looking after their health. ""I pointed out that it penalised the most vulnerable people in society and ultimately me - as I had to pay the fine and waste time working out what had gone on. I received a reply explaining that they were unable to correspond with me, even though they accepted my cheque."" ""My daughter is severely disabled and wheelchair bound. She has full time carers, but I handle all her paperwork. She is in receipt of the higher rate disability living allowance and enhanced employment support allowance (EESA). ""On her last trip to the dentist, they asked me again what was her entitlement to free treatment and I ticked the box for EESA. What I had failed to understand was that there are two types of EESA and only one type gives entitlement to free dentist care. ""Several weeks later, we received a penalty notice informing us of a fine of Â£100 plus the original dental costs of over Â£50. ""How could I have checked something that I didn't know about? There is no way she could have paid the penalty out of her benefits, so I had to."" ""I am all for abusers being made to pay for NHS services when not eligible. ""But an honest mistake filling out a simple form at a dental surgery should have some flexibility or subsequent appeal or checks, so as not to penalise people in such a harsh manner."" ""My adult dependent son has just been fined Â£100 because nobody knew what box to tick at the dentist. ""The receptionist was extremely unhelpful, and I paid for the treatment (a check-up). I then rang the NHS refund helpline, and they told me I should have ticked a particular box, despite the receptionist arguing against it. Dentist Charlotte Waite says it is distressing when so many wrong fines are being issued ""After telling my dentist practice manager what the NHS helpline had said, I was refunded my money. ""My son then received a letter fining him Â£100, despite having no income and being aged 19 and still in full-time further education. ""How are patients supposed to navigate a system that is faulty? I have appealed and refused to pay the fine."" ""I feel disgusted and embarrassed. I have been assumed as a fraud by the dentist and the NHS - due to them not, maybe, checking their paperwork, not asking me. It doesn't just affect vulnerable people."" ""My wife has a severe brain trauma injury, which impacts on her mental capacity to understand simple issues. ""She commenced dental treatment at our NHS dental surgery and afterwards received a bill for Â£ 244 together with a Â£100 fine. I immediately responded, in sheer panic. I refused to pay the fine as she had done nothing wrong. ""The question was asked by the dentist if she was receiving benefits. What about employment support allowance (ESA)? Yes, she is in receipt of ESA. In that case your dental treatment will be free. It transpires that there are two types of ESA, and my wife's does not entitle her to free dental treatment. ""I received a call from a debt-recovery company, giving me an additional 30 days to provide medical evidence of my wife's brain injury. ""Regardless, we will not be paying this fine and if necessary will defend this in court. ""My wife together with all her other issues is aware of an impending fine but doesn't quite understand why. This in my opinion is sheer bullying tactics and these people must be challenged. ""It's having a severe impact on my wife and I. This matter is really taking its toll."" ""I am now reluctant to arrange any more appointments having lost my job two months ago and not being in the position to risk getting fined again. The system is obviously flawed."" The NHS Business Services Authority says: ""We continually review our data-matching process and make improvements where possible. ""We're also working with various partner organisations to educate patients and healthcare professionals on the rules around eligibility for free dental treatment, to reduce the number of incorrect claims caused by confusion or lack of awareness.""

Spain plans to force Catalan elections,"Catalan authorities have refused to drop their campaign for independence from Spain Spain's conservative government has agreed with the socialist opposition to hold regional elections in Catalonia in January, the socialists say. The elections are part of a package of measures being put in place to suspend the region's autonomy, as its leader threatens to declare independence. Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy will announce measures to impose direct rule after a cabinet meeting on Saturday. A referendum, outlawed by Spain, was held in Catalonia on 1 October. Of the 43% of Catalans who reportedly voted, 90% were in favour of independence. Most anti-independence voters boycotted the ballot. Mr Rajoy's Popular Party (PP) has not confirmed the agreement to press for a regional vote, announced by the socialist party (PSOE). Cases for and against independence Catalan crisis: How the press sees it The crisis in 300 words Speaking at a press conference in Brussels on Friday, Mr Rajoy said the measures to impose direct rule would have the backing of the PSOE and the centrist party Ciudadanos. PSOE politician Carmen Calvo announced the agreement to hold regional elections in an interview on national television on Friday. She appealed to Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont to endorse the elections. Mr Puigdemont has refused calls from the Spanish government to abandon his secessionist campaign. This video can not be played Why is there a Catalan crisis? The answer is in its past Catalonia's government will be dissolved ahead of the vote, which is part of a package of extraordinary measures being imposed on the region. The government has said it will trigger Article 155 of the constitution, which allows Madrid to impose direct rule in a crisis but has never been invoked in its nearly 40-year history. Reality Check: Would Catalonia be a viable country? The man who wants to break up Spain The full list of measures will be drawn up during Saturday's cabinet meeting. Spain's Senate, controlled by the PP and its allies, would then have to approve the list. Other measures may include taking control of Catalonia's regional police force. Article 155 does not give the government the power to fully suspend autonomy, and it will not be able to deviate from the list of measures. James Badcock, BBC News, Madrid While the dissolution of Catalonia's parliament and the holding of snap regional elections may appear to offer a way of defusing today's state of extreme tension, there are plenty of reasons to doubt that such a strategy would provide a clear exit from the crisis. The far-left CUP has suggested that it would boycott any election imposed on the region. Other pro-independence forces might do the same. Massive street protests against any form of direct rule from Madrid can also be expected. And what are the potential consequences of forcing an election on Catalonia? Mr Puigdemont has promised to call a formal vote on independence in Catalonia's parliament if Article 155 is invoked. If such a declaration were approved, the pro-independence forces could style the ballot as the election of a constituent assembly for a new republic, the next stage laid down in the secessionists' road map. Assuming the participation of all parties, voters would be bound to interpret the election as a de facto plebiscite on independence. If a separatist majority emerged once again, it is hard to see how the conflict could be considered closed. As a deadline for the Catalan authorities to abandon independence came and went on Thursday, the government accused the region of seeking confrontation. The independence campaign had caused ""serious damage"" to ""the co-existence and the economic structure of Catalonia"", the government said in a statement. Mr Rajoy is currently attending an EU summit in Brussels. The president of the European Council, Donald Tusk, says there is no space for any international mediation or EU action on the Catalan crisis - though he did say there was ""no hiding that the situation in Spain is concerning"". UK Prime Minister Theresa May on Friday sided with Mr Rajoy, telling reporters that ""people should be abiding by the rule of law and uphold the Spanish constitution"".

Japan's 'living artwork' invents new style,"This video can not be played Living art: Meet Harajuku's ethereal fashion icon An artist has garnered a cult online following internationally after inventing a quirky Japanese street fashion style eight years ago. Minori combined Shironuri (which means ""painted white"") powdery make-up with vintage clothing to form a new style. By using her body as a canvas, Minori is essentially a ""living artwork"", and her art is primarily depicted in photos. Her creative expression has inspired other young women to adopt the trend. Minori, 26, lives in Tokyo. The white make-up offers her anonymity, and only her friends and family know her real identity, which means that when she is not dressed up, she can live a private life away from prying eyes. In her teens, Minori was just one of the many young women who frequented Harajuku, a district in Shibuya, Tokyo where people go to see and be seen in quirky, unusual and often outrageous fashion styles. Minori says she is inspired by nature and the blank canvas white make-up offers She used to enjoy wearingElegant Gothic Lolita fashion,but over time she didn't feel that the style suited her. ""I always felt a sense of discomfort that my skin colour and make-up did not match my clothes,"" she tells the BBC. ""Once I painted my face white, I could make my face from my imagination, and that felt wonderful. 'This is it!' I thought."" Minori designs and creates all her outfits from scratch In Japan, there is a long tradition of using white make-up that dates back to medieval times. From the 9th to 11th Centuries, a time known as the Heian period, men from aristocrat families painted their faces as a mark of their status. The trend was later adopted by women in the 17th century, whengeisha,external- high class female entertainers - began to appear. Then, during the Showa era - from 1926 to 1989 - the word ""Shironuri"" was first coined. Inspired by the ultra-nationalism at the time, people wore male and female Japanese school uniform styles gakuran and sailor fuku, carried Japanese war flags, and painted their faces painted white using geisha make-up. Instead of a political expression or entertainment tool, Minori has evolved Shironuri into an art form, applying unusual false eyelashes and intricate make-up that matches the themes of her outfits. She grew up in the Japanese countryside, and considers nature to be one of the main inspirations for her art. Minori emulating the sea and the sand ""The pattern of fallen leaves and tree branches, the shape of flowers - I thought that it would be beautiful if I combined white paint with such motifs in make-up,"" she says. ""At the time, only geisha make-up was mainstream, but I thought that it was boring. I really wanted to create something that no one had seen before, had never done before."" Over the last three years, Minori has started to appear at Japanese fashion events in other parts of the world, invited by fans who learned about her work fromfashion blogs.,external Minori has been invited to various countries, including Thailand, to showcase her art She was also asked to appear in the ITV documentary seriesJoanna Lumley's Japan,external, and in the Japan episode of Chelsea Handler's Netflix seriesChelsea,external. However, she says that she is probably least popular in Japan, where views on what young women should be wearing are still quite conservative, despite the diversity of fashions seen in the capital. ""Many Japanese people think I am a strange being, but overall the response is more positive than before,"" she says. Her family is very proud of her and her mother sells photo books featuring her many different outfits to friends. Minori is not alone in her career as a living artwork - in the UK, artist, fashion designer and stylist Daniel Lismore, 32, has been doing something similar for the last 15 years. He has more than 6,000 items of clothing and accessories. Minori says she wants to represent a sort of ""living energy"", while Mr Lismore seeks to trigger reactions from viewers. But despite the differences in their work, both artists are no strangers to adversity. Minori enjoys being photographed surrounded by nature ""I've been spat on, beaten up, hurt and abused on the street, and then I've been put on private jets, flown around the world and invited to royal palaces, and my work's been put in museums around the world,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's a really interesting way to live - it's fun and it's creative, it opens up doors to me that probably wouldn't be open to me any other way, and closes doors as well. ""It's a chance for me to show my art. It's walking street art in way."" However, Mr Lismore has learned to become comfortable in his own skin, and during a recent meeting with Minori at the Frieze Art Fair in London, he urged her to continue with her art, no matter how other people react to it. British ""living artwork"" artist Daniel Lismore meets Minori ""You get all sorts of reactions, some very positive and some very negative,"" said Mr Lismore, who is an ambassador for Tate'sCircuit Programme,,externalwhich helps young people gain access to museums across the UK. ""There's a lot of fear in people. It's fear of the unknown, and fear via lack of culture. ""A lot of people won't like what you do and won't be able to understand it, but the right people will love you for who you are and what you do. ""Everyone else is irrelevant.""

Dr Ranj Singh, from Chatham, who is the resident doctor on ITV's This Morning programme, had called for gay conversion therapy to be made illegal, during an interview on BBC Radio Kent that was prompted by the prime minister's recent condemnation of the controversial practice. He said: ""It should be illegal, it is akin to almost psychological abuse. ""We have to understand that it is not always black and white, there are some people who are definitely heterosexual, there are some people who are definitely homosexual and they know their identities, and there are some people who are in between."" During an interview on BBC Radio Kent, Dr Ranj Singh called for gay conversion therapy to be made illegal The question ""Should gay conversion therapy be banned?"" was then posed to the station's 53,000 followers on Twitter, who were asked to either agree that it should be banned or say they thought it was an acceptable practice. More than 100 people commented on the tweet, with most saying they were offended. Some Twitter users also questioned the use of an emoji in the tweet that featured a lightning bolt, as gay conversion therapy practices can include electroshock treatment.

Mexico's female prisoners learn stand-up,"SofÃ­a NiÃ±o de Rivera performs in front of female inmates Best known for her Netflix shows and stand-up tours, SofÃ­a NiÃ±o de Rivera is one of Latin America's leading comedians. The 35-year-old from Mexico City has long been making audiences laugh, but she recently embarked on a more serious mission: supporting vulnerable women in Mexico's notoriously dangerous prisons. In a bid to help female inmates overcome frustration and depression, SofÃ­a gave 10 stand-up workshops in the Mexican capital's vast Santa Martha Acatitla penitentiary over the summer. The project came about after her cousin, Saskia NiÃ±o de Rivera, asked her to do a benefit gig to raise funds for Reinserta, a charity she runs to improve conditions in Mexican jails. The comedian accepted but wanted to do more than just raise money. They agreed that stand-up workshops could help inmates to use comedy as an emotional release for the benefit of their mental health. ""Stand-up is a really cathartic psychological tool. It has helped me a lot in my life,"" SofÃ­a says at a hotel in Guadalajara, the morning after a sold-out public performance. ""Women in prison don't have a lot of tools to help them handle emotional issues,"" she adds. ""I think stand-up is something that can help them."" Women account for just 5% of Mexico's 211,000 prison population, but they receive fewer visits and are more likely to be abandoned by their families than male inmates, according to a Reinserta survey. Saskia, a lawyer and philanthropist who founded Reinserta in 2013, says inmates rarely have access to psychologists and find therapeutic lessons difficult to put into practice when in ""survival mode"" in their cells. SofÃ­a NiÃ±o de Rivera giving her workshop The combination of her cousin's public profile and Reinserta's experience working in jails helped convince the prison authorities to back the project, but it proved tougher to persuade inmates to participate. ""It was very difficult because stand-up is a relatively new concept in Mexico,"" Saskia says. ""The women in prison didn't know who SofÃ­a was or what stand-up was, so it wasn't easy to introduce this activity."" Instead of giving stand-up performances herself, SofÃ­a taught the inmates to laugh about their own experiences. Mexican muralists transform violent neighbourhoods UN demands Mexico prison riot probe She also invited other Mexican comedians to perform specially tailored sets with jokes that inmates could relate to about life behind bars. At first the women were reluctant to open up, but SofÃ­a gradually began to win their trust. ""It's very hard to show them stand-up but it's been so interesting to learn their stories and watch them try,"" SofÃ­a says. ""It's a tool they didn't know they had."" Reinserta also works with children living inside the prison While she encourages inmates to make light of their difficult surroundings, SofÃ­a warns they must be careful to choose the right moment. ""It's not something they can use very publicly,"" she says, noting that one woman was transferred to a cell with stricter conditions for mocking the way a guard spoke. SofÃ­a and Saskia are currently working on a documentary to increase awareness about the conditions in Mexico's overcrowded and unsafe prisons. A recent government survey revealed that almost half of inmates share their cell with more than five prisoners, nearly a third feel unsafe in prison, and one in five feel unsafe in their own cells. One in three prisoners was a victim of illegal conduct last year, including theft, injury, extortion, threats and sexual assault. And four out of 10 inmates have suffered from corruption, with guards charging them to receive visitors, bedding, food, drinking water or medical attention. Violent prison riots are common. More than a dozen inmatesdied in clashes at a prisonin Nuevo Leon state last week. Another riot at Acapulco's Las Cruces prison killed 28 people in July Hazael RuÃ­z, the undersecretary for Mexico City's penitentiary system, says the stand-up workshops have helped ease tensions in Santa Martha Acatitla. He's now planning more sessions in another women's prison and possibly a male facility. ""The girls that participated have shown a very positive change in attitude,"" Mr RuÃ­z says. ""Through stand-up they found the tools to channel the negativity that they've experienced into comedy."" ""They make daily life enjoyable,"" he adds. ""They get along with less tension than the others and their new outlook on life is contagious."" SofÃ­a is encouraged by this progress but warns that Mexico must do more to generate more humane conditions in its jails.

"MP received Â£165,000 from trade union","MP Ian Lavery received Â£165,000 from the 10-member trade union he ran. We have learned this from the trade union regulator which has now released a report into Mr Lavery's actions as general secretary of the NUM Northumberland Area. He will now face questions on his record over a number of disputed payments by the union he ran. Mr Lavery, who is the chairman of the Labour Party, denies any wrongdoing. Ian Lavery is a coming power in the land, Jeremy Corbyn's general election joint co-ordinator and chairman of the Labour Party. If the Conservatives fall, he's most likely destined for high office. But, perhaps, for one thing: his refusal to answer a simple question asked by BBC Newsnight last year: ""Did you pay off the mortgage?"" BBC Newsnight asked him nine times without getting a reply. This video can not be played Newsnight's John Sweeney confronts Labour MP Ian Lavery The answer, it turns out, is no. He didn't pay off his mortgage. The union of which he was general secretary for 18 years, the NUM Northumberland Area, paid it off and paid him much more besides. Last year, both Jeremy Corbyn and the parliamentary watchdog cleared Mr Lavery. He denies any wrongdoing. The reason we know more about Mr Lavery's peculiar mortgage arrangements is because the trade union regulator, the Certification Officer, Gerard Walker, examined the books after investigations by BBC Newsnight and the Sunday Times. Mr Lavery ran the NUM Northumberland Area for 18 years until he stepped down in 2010 to become the MP for Wansbeck. The regulator's findings are availableonline,external. The regulator found that that the Northumberland Provident and Benevolent fund had lent Mr Lavery Â£72,500 to buy a house in 1994. 13 years on, the union Mr Lavery was then running forgave the loan to Mr Lavery. So he was Â£72,500 the richer. But there's more. He'd been paying into an endowment fund to pay back the capital cost of the house. It had underperformed, but it still paid out Â£18,000. The regulator found Mr Lavery kept that too. And that's not all. The regulator found that in 2005, Mr Lavery sold a 15% stake in his house to the Union for Â£36,000. In 2013 the house was worth less, so he bought it back from the union for Â£27,500 - a notional profit of Â£8,500. And then there's Mr Lavery's ""termination payments"", totalling Â£89,887.83. However, that total is a matter of some dispute between him and the union. The regulator says that neither Mr Lavery nor the union could provide documentary evidence of the process or the decision by which Mr Lavery was made redundant - or why, given he was leaving for a job as an MP, he needed any redundancy payments at all. Adding Â£89,887 he received for his undocumented redundancy package to the Â£72,500 for the forgiven house loan to the Â£18,000 he was gifted from his endowment, that totals Â£180,387. But, then, it seems Mr Lavery and his old union fell out. The union recently realised it had overpaid Mr Lavery's redundancy by Â£30,600. The regulator's report shows that the union asked for it back. Mr Lavery disputed Â£10,600 of it - and said he'd only give them Â£15,000. When the regulator asked the union why they settled for this, they simply replied that they were mindful of Mr Lavery disputing it and the potential legal costs: ""Mr. Lavery was adamant that Â£15,000 was his final offer, we were left with little choice but to accept."" So our running total of dosh from the union to its one-time general secretary is reduced by Â£15,000 to Â£165,387. That's a bob or two in anyone's language. A year ago, when we started questioning Mr Lavery on this matter, Jeremy Corbyn gave him the benefit of the doubt and the Parliamentary commissioner cleared him of wrongdoing, which he has always denied. Since then, Mr Lavery has risen in Labour's ranks to be one of the Labour leader's closest and most trusted lieutenants. Now that we know just how much money he got from the trade union he used to run, it's fair to ask whether this man is a fit and proper person to be chairman of the Labour Party. Ian Lavery told BBC Newsnight in a statement tonight: ""Under my stewardship, the union always complied with the rules and the Certification Officer signed off every year's transactions. As the Certification Officer's report makes clear, no member of the union, past or present, has made a complaint about the financial affairs of the union. I am pleased that the Certification Officer has decided to not appoint an inspector or take further action. ""This report should draw a line under almost two years of allegations and innuendo directed at me and my former colleagues. Our legacy is helping miners and their families when others abandoned them, bringing millions of pounds of compensation into the Northumberland Coalfield. I remain immensely proud of our record.""

US company in talks to search for MH370,"The search for the Malaysia Airlines plane was suspended in January Malaysia is negotiating a ""no find-no fee"" deal with a US company to renew the search for downed flight MH370. The government announced in a statement that it was in talks with Texas-based salvage firm Ocean Infinity. If the deal goes ahead, Ocean Infinity will foot the bill and recoup costs only if it finds the missing plane. The disappearance of MH370 remains shrouded in mystery. The flight fell off radar on 8 March 2014 en route to Beijing, with 239 people on board. Australian Transport Minister Darren Chester said on Friday that a deal had been reached between Malaysia and Ocean Infinity, but the Malaysian government later clarified in astatement,externalthat it was still in talks. A massive search operation for the plane cleared 120,000 sq km at an estimated cost of about A$200m (Â£120m; â¬133m), before it was suspended in January. Ocean Infinity has not revealed the estimated cost of a search. According to Mr Chester, any new operation will focus on a 25,000 sq km area identified by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau as having a ""high probability"" of containing the aircraft. Families criticise MH370 search halt Enduring mystery 'almost inconceivable' What we know about missing plane Ocean Infinity is in talks with the government about using a centuries-old model known in the salvage industry as ""no cure-no pay"" - a type of deal usually applied in the recovery of valuable sunken cargo. Under such a deal, a salvage company will take on the financial risk of a recovery and recoup from the owner a percentage of the cargo's value if it is found, often 80 or 90%. In this case, Ocean Infinity would be working instead for a set fee from the Malaysian government, and for the significant publicity on offer should it find the wreckage, an industry expert told the BBC. A search operation that went on for almost three years failed to find the wreckage MH370 was carrying passengers and crew from 14 different countries when it disappeared, most from China and Malaysia. Australia led the initial search, after aviation officials identified the ocean floor off its coast as the likely location of the wreckage. The country has agreed to provide technical assistance for the new search, Mr Chester said. Earlier this month, Malaysian Transport Minister Liow Tiong Lai said the government had received proposals from three private search firms - Ocean Infinity, Dutch firm Fugro and an unidentified Malaysian company. Delivering its report into the disappearance earlier this month, Australia's Transport Safety Bureau said it was ""almost inconceivable"" that the aircraft had not been found.

Oxbridge even posher than we thought,"This video can not be played What do students feel as new data shows Oxbridge offers are moving backwards in terms of elistism? The sheer dominance by the top two social classes of Oxford and Cambridge University admissions has been revealed in newly released data. Four-fifths of students from England and Wales accepted at Oxbridge between 2010 and 2015 had parents with top professional and managerial jobs, and the numbers have been edging upwards. The data,obtained by David Lammy MP,external, also shows a ""shocking"" regional bias, with more offers made to Home Counties pupils than the whole of northern England. Mr Lammy said he was ""appalled to discover"" Oxbridge is actually moving backwards in terms of elitism. Unveiling the data, he described the universities as the ""last bastion of the old school tie"" and highlighted stark regional divisions. Nationally about 31% of people are in the top two social income groups. They are the doctors, the lawyers, the senior managers. The data reveals these top two social classes cleaned up in terms of places, with their share of offers rising from 79% to 81% between 2010 and 2015. This was despite both universities spending Â£5m each a year on efforts to cast the net wider for students, according to official figures. The data on admissions by region provided by the universities themselves showed: More than a quarter of Cambridge offers went to eight local authority areas Just under a quarter of Oxford offers went to eight local authority areas London and south-east England received 48% of offers from both Oxford and Cambridge The Midlands received 11% of Oxford offers and 12% of Cambridge offers The North West, the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber between them received 15% of Oxford offers and 17% of Cambridge offers Oxford made about 100 offers to students in the whole of Wales last year The University of Cambridge made nearly 2,953 offers to four home counties, and 2,619 offers to the whole of the north of England. Whereas Oxford made 2,812 offers to applicants in five home counties and 2,619 to students in the whole of northern England. Applications were, however, significantly higher from both the counties surrounding London and around the universities themselves. A spokesman for Cambridge said its admissions were based on academic considerations alone, adding that the greatest barrier to disadvantaged students was poor results. ""We currently spend Â£5m a year on access measures leading to 190,000 interactions with pupils and teachers."" The story of Oxford University's first black student 'I'm the first person in my family to go to university' A blind refugee's story to Cambridge graduation An Oxford spokesman said: ""We absolutely take on board Mr Lammy's comments, and we realise there are big geographical disparities in the numbers and proportions of students coming to Oxford. ""On the whole, the areas sending few students to Oxford tend also to be the areas with high levels of disadvantage and low levels of attainment in schools. ""Rectifying this is going to be a long journey that requires huge, joined-up effort across society - including from leading universities like Oxford - to address serious inequalities."" Mr Lammy said the scale of the regional divide went far beyond anything he could have imagined. He accused Oxbridge of failing to live up to its responsibilities as national universities, saying: ""Oxbridge take over Â£800m a year from the taxpayer - paid for by people in every city, town and village. ""Whole swathes of the country - especially our seaside towns and the 'left behind' former industrial heartlands across the North and the Midlands are basically invisible. ""If Oxbridge can't improve, then there is no reason why the taxpayer should continue to give them so much money."" Mr Lammy added: ""Whilst some individual colleges and tutors are taking steps to improve access, in reality many Oxbridge colleges are still fiefdoms of entrenched privilege, the last bastions of the old school tie."" He called for a centralised admissions system to be introduced at the universities and for Oxbridge to communicate more directly with talented students by writing to all straight A students to invite them to apply. This video can not be played ""It's quite unexpected...It's not something that happens where I'm from"" says Max as he prepares to go to Cambridge University By Branwen Jeffreys, BBC News education editor We should all care who goes to our top universities because they end up running the country. Less than 1% of the adult population graduated from Oxford or Cambridge, but the two universities have produced most of our prime ministers, the majority of our senior judges and civil servants, and many people in the media. So surely it's good news that more of their students are from state schools? As this research shows, that's only part of the story.  The home counties of southern England are significantly wealthier than the north. You just have to look at how many children are from families earning so little their children qualify for free school meals. In Buckinghamshire it's just 5.5% of pupils, in Surrey 6.8%.

Tarantino 'knew enough' about Weinstein,"Quentin Tarantino has worked closely with Harvey Weinstein on many of his films US film director Quentin Tarantino has admitted knowing for years about movie mogul Harvey Weinstein's alleged misconduct toward women. ""I knew enough to do more than I did,"" Mr Tarantino toldthe New York Times.,external His comments come as Los Angeles police are investigating Mr Weinstein over a suspected sexual assault in 2013. The producer already facesallegations of sexual misconduct and assaultfrom dozens of women. He has ""unequivocally"" denied having ""non-consensual sex"". ""There was more to it than just the normal rumours, the normal gossip. It wasn't second-hand. I knew he did a couple of these things,"" Mr Tarantino said in an interview with the US newspaper. ""I wish I had taken responsibility for what I heard. If I had done the work I should have done then, I would have had to not work with him."" Weinstein was one of Hollywood's top producers The Hollywood director has worked closely with Mr Weinstein on many of his films, including Django Unchained and Inglorious Basterds. Harvey Weinstein's accusers Nyong'o accuses Weinstein of harassment How the scandal unfolded Meanwhile, Los Angeles police announced its first investigation involving Mr Weinstein in California. ""The Los Angeles Police Department's Robbery Homicide Division has interviewed a potential sexual assault victim involving Harvey Weinstein which allegedly occurred in 2013,"" LAPD spokesman Sal Ramirez told the BBC. ""The case is under investigation. There is no more information at this time."" It falls within California's 10-year statute of limitations for the crime of rape, and could lead to a trial if prosecutors decide they have enough evidence to support a case against the filmmaker. The alleged victim is a 38-year-old Italian model and actress, according to US media outlets. She is reported to have met detectives this week.

Obama and Bush decry deep US divisions,"This video can not be played Neither Barack Obama nor George W Bush mentioned President Donald Trump by name Former Presidents Barack Obama and George W Bush have voiced concern about the current political climate in the US, in comments seen as a veiled rebuke of Donald Trump's leadership. Mr Obama urged Americans to reject the politics of ""division"" and ""fear"", while Mr Bush criticised ""bullying and prejudice"" in public life. They were speaking separately. Neither mentioned President Trump by name. Mr Trump, who has been critical of his two predecessors, is yet to comment. Ex-presidents traditionally shy away from commenting publicly on their successors, and Mr Obama said on leaving office he would extend that courtesy for a time to Mr Trump, as George W Bush had to him. He has broken his silence since to issue statements on Mr Trump's efforts to dismantle Obamacare, as well as his controversial ""Muslim ban"" and decision to abandon the Paris climate accord. Speaking at a Democratic campaign event in Newark, New Jersey, Mr Obama said Americans should ""send a message to the world that we are rejecting a politics of division, we are rejecting a politics of fear"". He added: ""What we can't have is the same old politics of division that we have seen so many times before that dates back centuries. ""Some of the politics we see now, we thought we put that to bed. That's folks looking 50 years back. It's the 21st Century, not the 19th Century. Come on!"" Decoding Bushâs thinly veiled Trump speech Five reasons Trump's widow story stings Top aide defends Trump over widow remarks He touched on similar themes at another event later in Richmond, Virginia, saying: ""We've got folks who are deliberately trying to make folks angry, to demonise people who have different ideas, to get the base all riled up because it provides a short-term tactical advantage."" Speaking just hours earlier in New York, Mr Bush said: ""Bigotry seems emboldened. Our politics seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication. ""There are some signs that the intensity of support for democracy itself has waned - especially among the young."" Americans, he said, have ""seen our discourse degraded by casual cruelty"". ""At times it can seem like the forces pulling us apart are stronger than the forces binding us together. ""We've seen nationalism distorted into nativism, forgotten the dynamism that immigration has always brought to America."" President Trump has in the past criticised both Mr Obama and Mr Bush Both former presidents have until now largely avoided commenting publicly on Mr Trump's policies. Before his election last year, Mr Trump was highly critical of both Mr Obama and Mr Bush, describing each of them at one time or another as ""perhaps the worst president in the history"" of the US. Since his inauguration in January, Mr Trump's combative style and direct public comments on a number of key issues have caused controversy both among Democrats and Republicans. He has regularly blamed the media, which he says do not focus on his achievements and instead choose to concentrate on what he describes as ""fake news"". Analysisby Gary O'Donoghue in Richmond, Virginia President Barack Obama still knows how to draw a crowd - and they queued round the block for hours to see him speak. If they were hoping for head-on attacks on Donald Trump, they were to be disappointed. However, the criticisms when they came were scarcely veiled - with talk of pandering to the extremes and sowing divisiveness. The speech followed a much more full-frontal attack on the current political situation by former Republican President George W Bush. He talked about bigotry and falsehood threatening American democracy - while celebrating immigration and arguing for a more open trade policy. These attacks certainly aren't co-ordinated - but they do demonstrate just how widely concerns about the current president are shared.

Soaring childcare costs 'crippling parents',"Childcare costs for young children have risen up to seven times faster than wages since 2008, a study suggests. TUC research shows that average costs in England for parents with a one-year-old rose 48% between 2008 and 2016, while average wages increased 12%. Mum-of-three Ellie Thouret said it was ""absolutely pointless"" to return to work because of the ""crippling costs"". The government says it has doubled the free childcare available to working parents of three and four-year-olds. The trade union body, the TUC, said that, while parents with children aged two and above received financial support from the government, most working parents with one-year-olds did not get any state help. Your 30-hour free childcare questions Workers 'cut hours' over childcare costs Summer childcare costs at record level TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""There is a real gap in childcare support for one-year-olds until government assistance kicks in at age two. ""Parents need subsidised, affordable childcare from as soon as maternity leave finishes to enable them to continue working, and so mums don't continue to have to make that choice between having a family and a career."" One mum Ellie Thouret, who has three children, says it would have been ""absolutely pointless"" for her to return to work after having twins. ""We looked at the sums and the cost of the childcare for three children under three would have just been crippling."" The figures suggest that two parents working full-time, with a one-year-old in nursery for 21 hours a week were typically spending 11% of their wages on childcare in 2016, up from 8% in 2008. Ms O'Grady said that the picture for single parents was ""even worse"". Single parents working full-time, again with a one-year-old in nursery for 21 hours a week, spent, on average, more than a fifth (21%) of their wages on childcare last year, up from a sixth (17%) in 2008, the study said. For all children aged three and four parents get 15 hours of free childcare a week Parents who are in work can get 30 hours free for three-and-four-year-olds And for disadvantaged two-year-olds, parents get 15 hours of free childcare a week Source:Department for Education,external But childminders say the government's 30 hours' scheme is forcing them to close or reduce numbers. Heidi Stuart says regulations and Ofsted requirements have increased workloads and mean childminding is ""far beyond simply caring for a child"". ""We are constantly having to undergo and update training related to safety, development and information, the cost of which is from our own pockets and not subsidised or paid for by parents/government. ""As self-employed people we are simply trying to earn a living and support our families. ""It is an enigma to me why some parents feel that childcare is 'expensive' when we are caring and nurturing their children, the future generation."" Robert Goodwill, the Children and Families Minister, said the government had saved parents ""thousands a year"" and helped them ""get back into work"" by doubling the free childcare available to working parents of three and four-year-olds to 30 hours a week. Ellen Broome, chief executive of the Family and Childcare Trust, said the cost of childcare meant ""it does not pay to work"" for many parents. She said low-income families claiming universal credit typically take home Â£1.96 per hour after childcare costs have been paid. Helen Bryce, who works full-time, told BBC Radio 5 live that childcare was a ""constant juggle"". She said her husband was taking a career break to spend time with their children and they also used a childminder. When they used a nursery, she says, the costs were ""astronomical"". ""I know at one stage we had our children, we had three young children, all in nursery part time. Our costs were over Â£1,500 a month, which was more than I was making.""

EU paves way for trade talks to begin,"Reports of deadlock over Brexit negotiations may have been exaggerated, European Council President Donald Tusk has said after a Brussels summit. Progress was ""not sufficient"" to begin trade talks with the UK now but that ""doesn't mean there is no progress at all"", he said. EU leaders will discuss the issue internally, paving the way for talks with the UK, possibly in December. Theresa May said there was ""some way to go"" but she was ""optimistic"". Speaking at the end of a two-day summit, Mr Tusk told reporters: ""My impression is that the reports of the deadlock between the EU and the UK have been exaggerated."" Reality Check: How are the Brexit talks actually going? Tell EU you'll walk away, Eurosceptics tell May Brexit: How do other EU countries see a 'no deal'? The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier,described the talks as deadlockedearlier this month. Mr Tusk said he was not at odds with Mr Barnier, but his own role was to be a ""positive motivator for the next five or six weeks"". He said he felt there was ""goodwill"" on both sides ""and this is why I, maybe, in my rhetoric, I'm, maybe, a little bit more optimistic than Michel Barnier, but we are also in a different role"". The so-called divorce bill remains a major sticking point in talks with the EU. French President Emmanuel Macron said there was still much work to be done on the financial commitment before trade talks can begin, adding: ""We are not halfway there."" Theresa May declined to say in a press conference after the summit what the UK would be prepared to pay, saying the ""final settlement"" would come as part of a ""final agreement"" with the EU. The UK prime minister did not name any figures but refused to deny that she had told other EU leaders the UK could pay many more billions of pounds than the Â£20bn she had indicated in her Florence speech last month. ""I have said that ... we will honour the commitments that we have made during our membership,"" she said. But those commitments were being analysed ""line by line"" she said, adding: ""British taxpayer wouldn't expect its government to do anything else."" This video can not be played Three key points about how the Brexit talks are going By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor There are whispers that Theresa May has privately reassured the other leaders that she is willing to put a lot more than the implicit 20 billion euros (Â£17.8bn) on the table as we leave. Number 10 doesn't deny this, Mrs May didn't deny it when we asked her in the press conference today, nor did she reject the idea that the bill could be as high as 60 billion euros. If she has actually given those private reassurances though, there's not much evidence the other EU leaders believe her or think it's enough. But if she is to make that case more forcefully she has big political problems at home. Read Laura's blog She said the two sides were within ""touching distance"" of a deal on other issues - particularly on citizens' rights. ""I am ambitious and positive for Britain's future and for these negotiations but I know we still have some way to go,"" she said. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, following last year's referendum result. It had hoped to move onto phase two of negotiations - covering future trade arrangements - after this week's summit. But EU leaders took just 90 seconds to officially conclude that not enough progress has been made on the issues of citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the border in Northern Ireland, but ""internal preparations"" would begin for phase two. The prime minister made a personal appeal to her 27 EU counterparts at a working dinner on Thursday night, telling them that ""we must work together to get to an outcome that we can stand behind and defend to our people"". BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said all EU leaders knew Mrs May was in a politically difficult situation and did not want her to go home empty-handed, so had promised they would start talking about trade and transition deals among themselves, as early as Monday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were ""encouraging"" signs of progress in Brexit negotiations and the process was progressing ""step by step"". And European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he hoped it would be possible to reach a ""fair deal"" with Britain. ""Our working assumption is not the 'no-deal' scenario. I hate the 'no-deal' scenario. I don't know what that means,"" he said.

Mobile companies overcharging customers,"The government thinks mobile operators need to inform customers once the handset is paid off Vodafone, EE and Three are continuing to charge customers for the mobile phones they buy as part of a contract, even after the cost of the handset has been paid off, research suggests. Citizens Advice found that customers who do not take out a new contract are paying an average Â£22 extra a month. The government said the mobile firms needed to inform customers when they had paid for their handsets. The operators said that their billing systems were fair. Minister for Digital Matt Hancock said: ""It's only right that mobile customers should be notified when they have paid off the price of their handset, and that their future bills should reflect this. ""I welcome Citizens Advice's call for better billing information for consumers, and hope that providers will now take the initiative by clearly separating the cost of handsets and tariffs in mobile contracts."" Vodafone told the BBC it strives to give customers ""the price plan that best suits them"". Who's affected and what can you do? Anyone who purchased a mobile deal with the operators Three, Vodafone or EE, which included a handset, is being overcharged when their contract comes to an end Users can ask their phone company to swap them to a cheaper sim-only deal, or they can end the contract and find another provider No-one is automatically entitled to compensation - consumers can only make a claim if it wasn't made clear in their contract that the deal would continue at the same price Source: Citizens Advice The consumers who were overcharged ""Wherever possible, we contact customers nearing the end of their contract to offer them a range of options. These include being able to upgrade their handset, receiving an extra allowance to enhance their existing plan or, if they choose, a sim-only plan,"" the firm said in a statement. Three said: ""Whenever a new customer signs with us, we make the end-date of the contract term very clear. We also let them know that they can contact us at any time to discuss the range of options available should they wish to change their plan with us."" And EE commented: ""Separating phone and tariff doesn't always represent the best deal for consumers, it can sometimes result in them paying more."" O2 does separate airtime and device costs and chief marketing officer Nina Bibby said: ""Forcing customers to continue to pay for a phone they already own not only hits their pockets but undermines trust and the reputation of the industry."" The majority of those who take out a mobile phone contract with the cost of the new handset included in the price will have paid off the price of phone over a period of two years, the study found. The research suggested that users paying out for handsets such as the iPhone 7, the Galaxy S and Xperia XZ Premium, paid Â£38 extra a month, after the two-year period. According to the study,  people aged over 65 were the most likely to be stung - with 23% staying on their contract past the end of the fixed deal period. Overall, 36% of people with a handset-inclusive contract failed to change it after the end of the fixed deal period. Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said: ""The cost of handsets are hidden within some mobile phone contracts giving phone providers a way to exploit their customers. ""It is clearly unfair that some phone providers are charging loyal customers for handsets that they have already paid for. It's especially concerning that older customers are more likely to be stung by this sharp practice."" She called on the phone providers to make sure that any customers staying on a contract past the end of the fixed deal have their monthly bill reduced to reflect the fact they have paid for the handset. ""Providers could make it much easier for consumers to compare prices by separating out the cost of handsets from the cost of services like data and minutes for all contracts; that way it would be much clearer what they're paying for,"" she added.

Mass protest disrupts US far-right speech,"Protesters chanting ""Go home Nazis"" have disrupted a white supremacist's speech at the University of Florida. Richard Spencer's address in Gainesville prompted Florida's governor to declare a state of emergency. His speech came two months after a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, left a woman dead. Three of Mr Spencer's supporters have been charged with attempted murder after firing into a crowd of protesters during the event. Texas natives William Henry Fears, 30, Colton Gene Fears and Tyler Eugene Tenbrink, both 28, threatened the group and shouted Nazi salutes, according to the Gainesville Police Department. Mr Tenbrink got out of the vehicle and allegedly fired a single shot, missing the crowd, as the other two men encouraged him, police said. The suspects fled the scene and were later arrested. Two others were arrested in connection to the event, police added. Inside the the campus auditorium several dozen supporters of Mr Spencer were overwhelmingly outnumbered by protesters who shouted down the speaker. This video can not be played Why did a black man hug a neo-Nazi skinhead in Florida? ""I'm not going home, I will stand here all day if I have to,"" Mr Spencer said, calling the crowd a mob of ""shrieking and grunting morons"". Audience members continued to heckle him, chanting ""Nazis are not welcome here"" and ""Let's go, Gators!"" - a reference to the college mascot. The university said it did not want to let ""vile"" Mr Spencer speak, but was obliged under law to do so. Nada Tawfik, BBC News, Gainesville, Florida The university was prepared for the worst. Roadblocks and barricades were set up to control the crowds. And helicopters and drones circled, while snipers stood atop buildings surrounding the Phillips Center for Performing Arts. Most students avoided this side of campus altogether, but a sizeable number did still turn out, either to attend the speech or decry it. Spencer's national policy institute tried to screen those seeking tickets, but once the so-called leader of the alt right started speaking, it was clear they had failed. Richard Spencer began his remarks declaring everyone had the right to free speech, ideology aside. But immediately, it was clear that the majority of the crowd was determined to drown him out with their own message. They chanted ""go home"" and ""Nazis are not welcome here"". Dozens held raised fists in a sign of resistance, others chose the middle finger to express themselves. Mr Spencer taunted the crowd in return, calling them shrieking and grunting morons, a mob whose action he said was the best recruiting tool for his group. Police began dressing in riot gear as the emotions ran high but Mr Spencer left the stage once his allotted time ran out. And both sides have remained for the most part peaceful. Richard Spencer denied he was a white supremacist during a news conference before his speech The Alachua County Sheriff's Office said two people had been arrested. One man, who they said was armed security hired by the media, was arrested for carrying a firearm on campus. Before Thursday's speech at the college performing arts centre, Mr Spencer addressed media to thank university president Kent Fuchs for allowing him to speak,according to the Miami Herald,external. The newspaper also reported that two Democratic state legislators filed bills on Thursday to remove all remaining Confederate monuments from the state's public spaces. Mr Fuchs tweeted: ""I don't stand behind racist Richard Spencer"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The college said it would have to spend more than $500,000 (Â£380,000) on security while hundreds of state and local police were deployed to campus. Mr Spencer's organisation, the National Policy Institute, is paying $10,000 to rent the facility. Protesters disrupted the event, raising their fists and shouting as Mr Spencer spoke Hundreds of protesters gathered outside, some of whom shouted: ""We don't want your Nazi hate"" Protesters unfurled a sign on campus proclaiming ""Love, not hate"" and drew chalk designs on a pavement promoting inclusiveness and diversity.

Decoding Bush's thinly veiled Trump speech ""Bigotry or white supremacy in any form is blasphemy against the American creed,"" he said.

N Korea 'on cusp' of nuclear capability,"North Korea has ramped up its missile testing in recent months CIA director Mike Pompeo has warned that North Korea is on the cusp of being able to hit the US with a nuclear missile. He stressed Washington still preferred diplomacy and sanctions but said military force remained an option. North Korea claims it already has the capability to strike the US. Mr Pompeo also said that aUS-Canadian hostage couple freedlast week had in fact been held in Pakistan, rather than Afghanistan as initially assumed. He said Canadian Joshua Boyle and his US wife Caitlan Coleman had been ""held for five years inside of Pakistan"". This contradicted accounts from Pakistani officials, who said the family had been held in Afghanistan, and moved across the border into the Kurram tribal district of Pakistan on 11 October. North Korea is ""close enough now in their capabilities that from a US policy perspective we ought to behave as if we are on the cusp of them achieving that objective,"" Mr Pompeo said at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a conservative Washington think tank, on Thursday. ""They are so far along in that, it's now a matter of thinking about how do you stop the final step."" Mr Pompeo said military force had to remain an option He warned Pyongyang's missile expertise was now advancing so quickly that it was hard for US intelligence to be sure when it would succeed. ""When you're now talking about months our capacity to understand that at a detailed level is in some sense irrelevant,"" he said. N Korea urges Australia to reassess US How to talk to the world's most secretive country North Korea crisis in 300 words How advanced is the nuclear programme? Last weekend, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson had also insisted President Donald Trump wanted to resolve the confrontation with North Koreathrough diplomacy. His statement had come after Mr Trump had publicly told him not to waste time seeking talks with Kim Jong-un. In his speech, the CIA director also commented on the return of hostages Joshua Boyle and Caitlan Coleman. The couple were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012 and had three children while in captivity. Mr Pompeo said they had been ""held for five years inside of Pakistan"" - contradicting the official story given by Pakistani authorities that the couple had been held by the Taliban in neighbouring Afghanistan, and were recently moved across the border into Pakistan. This video can not be played Freed hostage Joshua Boyle after five years held hostage His comments reinforce US media reports of anonymous US officials claiming the hostages had in fact been held by a Pakistani militant group supported by the country's secret service the entire time. The Haqqani militant group is regarded as a close Taliban ally with support from Pakistan's military-run intelligence service. Pakistan denies such claims. ""I think history would indicate that expectations for the Pakistanis willingness to help us in the fight against radical [Islamist] terrorism should be set at a very low level,"" Mr Pompeo said. ""Our intelligence would indicate the same."" ""I think we should have a very real conversation with them about what it is they're doing and what it is they should do and the American expectations for how they should behave,"" he added. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is due to travel to Pakistan next week. In his wide-ranging speech, Mr Pompeo also said that the intelligence community had concluded ""that the Russian meddling that took place did not affect the outcome of the [US] election"". The CIA later issued a statement that appeared to contradict Mr Pompeo's remark. ""The intelligence assessment with regard to Russian election meddling has not changed, and the Director did not intend to suggest that it had,"" Dean Boyd, director of the CIA's office of public affairs, said. Trump denies he or his team ever colluded with Russia The public report by the Director of National Intelligence released in January stated that the intelligence community did ""not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election."" US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Trump and now there are several investigations looking into whether anyone from his campaign helped. However, they have not assessed whether alleged Russian interference affected the election outcome. Russia denies the allegations and President Trump has denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian officials. The allegations are currently investigated by several US parliamentary committees as well as a special counsel, former FBI director Robert Mueller.

""I have said that ... we will honour the commitments that we have made during our membership,"" she said. But those commitments were being analysed ""line by line"" she said, adding: ""British taxpayer wouldn't expect its government to do anything else."" This video can not be played Three key points about how the Brexit talks are going By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor There are whispers that Theresa May has privately reassured the other leaders that she is willing to put a lot more than the implicit 20 billion euros (Â£17.8bn) on the table as we leave. Number 10 doesn't deny this, Mrs May didn't deny it when we asked her in the press conference today, nor did she reject the idea that the bill could be as high as 60 billion euros. If she has actually given those private reassurances though, there's not much evidence the other EU leaders believe her or think it's enough. But if she is to make that case more forcefully she has big political problems at home. Read Laura's blog She said the two sides were within ""touching distance"" of a deal on other issues - particularly on citizens' rights. ""I am ambitious and positive for Britain's future and for these negotiations but I know we still have some way to go,"" she said. The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019, following last year's referendum result. It had hoped to move onto phase two of negotiations - covering future trade arrangements - after this week's summit. But EU leaders took just 90 seconds to officially conclude that not enough progress has been made on the issues of citizens' rights, the UK's financial obligation and the border in Northern Ireland, but ""internal preparations"" would begin for phase two. The prime minister made a personal appeal to her 27 EU counterparts at a working dinner on Thursday night, telling them that ""we must work together to get to an outcome that we can stand behind and defend to our people"". BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said all EU leaders knew Mrs May was in a politically difficult situation and did not want her to go home empty-handed, so had promised they would start talking about trade and transition deals among themselves, as early as Monday. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there were ""encouraging"" signs of progress in Brexit negotiations and the process was progressing ""step by step"". And European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said he hoped it would be possible to reach a ""fair deal"" with Britain. ""Our working assumption is not the 'no-deal' scenario. I hate the 'no-deal' scenario. I don't know what that means,"" he said.

Oxbridge 'even posher than we thought',"This video can not be played What do students feel as new data shows Oxbridge offers are moving backwards in terms of elistism? The sheer dominance by the top two social classes of Oxford and Cambridge University admissions has been revealed in newly released data. Four-fifths of students from England and Wales accepted at Oxbridge between 2010 and 2015 had parents with top professional and managerial jobs, and the numbers have been edging upwards. The data,obtained by David Lammy MP,external, also shows a ""shocking"" regional bias, with more offers made to Home Counties pupils than the whole of northern England. Mr Lammy said he was ""appalled to discover"" Oxbridge is actually moving backwards in terms of elitism. Unveiling the data, he described the universities as the ""last bastion of the old school tie"" and highlighted stark regional divisions. Nationally about 31% of people are in the top two social income groups. They are the doctors, the lawyers, the senior managers. The data reveals these top two social classes cleaned up in terms of places, with their share of offers rising from 79% to 81% between 2010 and 2015. This was despite both universities spending Â£5m each a year on efforts to cast the net wider for students, according to official figures. The data on admissions by region provided by the universities themselves showed: More than a quarter of Cambridge offers went to eight local authority areas Just under a quarter of Oxford offers went to eight local authority areas London and south-east England received 48% of offers from both Oxford and Cambridge The Midlands received 11% of Oxford offers and 12% of Cambridge offers The North West, the North East, Yorkshire and the Humber between them received 15% of Oxford offers and 17% of Cambridge offers Oxford made about 100 offers to students in the whole of Wales last year The University of Cambridge made nearly 2,953 offers to four home counties, and 2,619 offers to the whole of the north of England. Whereas Oxford made 2,812 offers to applicants in five home counties and 2,619 to students in the whole of northern England. Applications were, however, significantly higher from both the counties surrounding London and around the universities themselves. A spokesman for Cambridge said its admissions were based on academic considerations alone, adding that the greatest barrier to disadvantaged students was poor results. ""We currently spend Â£5m a year on access measures leading to 190,000 interactions with pupils and teachers."" The story of Oxford University's first black student 'I'm the first person in my family to go to university' A blind refugee's story to Cambridge graduation An Oxford spokesman said: ""We absolutely take on board Mr Lammy's comments, and we realise there are big geographical disparities in the numbers and proportions of students coming to Oxford. ""On the whole, the areas sending few students to Oxford tend also to be the areas with high levels of disadvantage and low levels of attainment in schools. ""Rectifying this is going to be a long journey that requires huge, joined-up effort across society - including from leading universities like Oxford - to address serious inequalities."" Mr Lammy said the scale of the regional divide went far beyond anything he could have imagined. He accused Oxbridge of failing to live up to its responsibilities as national universities, saying: ""Oxbridge take over Â£800m a year from the taxpayer - paid for by people in every city, town and village. ""Whole swathes of the country - especially our seaside towns and the 'left behind' former industrial heartlands across the North and the Midlands are basically invisible. ""If Oxbridge can't improve, then there is no reason why the taxpayer should continue to give them so much money."" Mr Lammy added: ""Whilst some individual colleges and tutors are taking steps to improve access, in reality many Oxbridge colleges are still fiefdoms of entrenched privilege, the last bastions of the old school tie."" He called for a centralised admissions system to be introduced at the universities and for Oxbridge to communicate more directly with talented students by writing to all straight A students to invite them to apply. This video can not be played ""It's quite unexpected...It's not something that happens where I'm from"" says Max as he prepares to go to Cambridge University By Branwen Jeffreys, BBC News education editor We should all care who goes to our top universities because they end up running the country. Less than 1% of the adult population graduated from Oxford or Cambridge, but the two universities have produced most of our prime ministers, the majority of our senior judges and civil servants, and many people in the media. So surely it's good news that more of their students are from state schools? As this research shows, that's only part of the story.  The home counties of southern England are significantly wealthier than the north. You just have to look at how many children are from families earning so little their children qualify for free school meals. In Buckinghamshire it's just 5.5% of pupils, in Surrey 6.8%.

Malta journalist bomb 'set off remotely',"Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of the government and alleged corruption in Malta Maltese officials say they believe investigative journalist Daphne Caruana Galizia was killed by a bomb under her car that was triggered remotely. A government spokeswoman said this assumption was based on initial results of an investigation into Monday's explosion in Bidnija, near Mosta. Caruana Galizia was known for her blog accusing top politicians of corruption. Meanwhile, journalists held a rally in the capital Valletta, saying they would not be intimidated by the killing. Protesting journalists held front pages and placards splattered in blood-red paint ""The attack on one of us will not stop us from shining a light where others want darkness,"" said Herman Grech, online editor at the Times of Malta. ""The attack on one of us will not muzzle us,"" he said, reading a joint statement. In a separate development on Thursday, Caruana Galizia's three sons said they refused to endorse a â¬1m (Â£890,000; $1,185,000 ) reward for evidence leading to a conviction in the case. In a Facebook post,external, they said this was despite ""unrelenting pressure"" from Malta's leaders to endorse the move. They also urged Prime Minister Joseph Muscat to resign. ""Show political responsibility and resign. Resign for failing to uphold our fundamental freedoms,"" they said. This video can not be played A friend of the murdered Maltese journalist reflects on her death and corruption in Malta The sons also demanded he replace Malta's police commissioner and attorney general ""with public servants who won't be afraid to act on evidence against him and those he protects"". Malta's anti-corruption warrior After Caruana Galizia's death, Mr Muscat denounced the killing, calling it an attack ""on the freedom of expression in our country"". Speaking to the BBC, he said the journalist was ""a very harsh critic of mine"" and described her killing as ""a nightmare"". ""I wouldn't know whether this is because of something she had written, or something she was going write,"" he said. This video can not be played Debris was strewn over the road and a nearby field Caruana Galizia was a harsh critic of the government and effectively triggered an early election this year by publishing allegations linking Mr Muscat to the Panama Papers scandal. Mr Muscat and his wife denied claims they used secret offshore bank accounts to hide payments from Azerbaijan's ruling family - and he was returned to power in the election, despite the controversy. Caruana Galizia's popular blog had also targeted opposition politicians. She called the country's political situation ""desperate"" in her final post.

Canadian producer accused of sex abuse,"Gilbert Rozon (right) at a Gucci event in Paris Canadian producer Gilbert Rozon has left several television productions amid accusations he sexually abused and harassed several women. Montreal police are investigating an incident that took place in Paris in 1994, Radio Canada reported. The 62-year-old resigned from his role as boss of the Just For Laughs comedy festival on Wednesday. French channel M6 also suspended its broadcast of ""France's Got Talent"", which features Mr Rozon as a judge. Mr Rozon issued a statement on Facebook shortly before a story byMontreal newspaper Le Devoir,externalwas published, detailing allegations of sexual abuse and sexual harassment from nine women spanning three decades. ""Shaken by the allegations against me, I want to dedicate all my time to review the matter,"" Rozon wrote on Facebook. ""To all those who I may have offended in my life, I'm sincerely sorry."" In addition to leaving Just for Laughs, he also announced that he would be resigning from his role as commissioner of the Montreal 375th anniversary preparations. How 'Me Too' is exposing the scale of sexual abuse Exploring the casting-couch culture of LA Mr Rozon did not elaborate on the allegations, which range from sexual harassment to forced penetration, none of which have been proven in court. Just For Laughs is one of the world's largest comedy festivals and attracts talents such as John Cleese Mr Rozon is famous in both his home country of Canada and abroad. He founded the Just for Laughs festival in 1983 and has expanded the brand to include television shows and specials. The brand is currently used in 150 countries, and is considered the largest comedy festival in the world. He also had a prominent role as a judge, similar to talent show judge Simon Cowell, on the French television show France's Got Talent. But allegations of sexual misconduct have swirled around him for at least a decade. He pleaded guilty to sexual assault of a 19-year-old woman in 1998, which resulted in an absolute discharge.

Irish prisoner freed from Egypt jail,"Campaigners posted a Facebook message on Thursday to say Mr Halawa had been freed. Ibrahim Halawa, an Irishman who has spent more than four years in prison in Egypt, has been freed. Mr Halawa, who is from Dublin, was arrested during a siege at the Al-Fath mosque in Cairo in 2013.

The 21-year-old wasacquitted of all chargesmore than a month ago, but his release was delayed. Who is Ibrahim Halawa? Irishman cleared of charges in Egypt Jailed man writes 'graduation day' letter Concerns for Irishman on hunger strike That delay prompted a former Irish justice ministerto call for Egypt's ambassador to Ireland to be expelled.

Pollution linked to one in six deaths,"Pollution has been linked to nine million deaths worldwide in 2015, a report inThe Lancet,externalhas found. Almost all of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, where pollution could account for up to a quarter of deaths. Bangladesh and Somalia were the worst affected. Air pollution had the biggest impact, accounting for two-thirds of deaths from pollution. Brunei and Sweden had the lowest numbers of pollution-related deaths. Most of these deaths were caused by non-infectious diseases linked to pollution, such as heart disease, stroke and lung cancer. ""Pollution is much more than an environmental challenge - it is a profound and pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health and wellbeing,"" said the study's author, Prof Philip Landrigan, of the Icahn School of Medicine, at Mount Sinai in New York. The biggest risk factor, air pollution, contributed to 6.5 million premature deaths. This included pollution from outdoor sources, such as gases and particulate matter in the air, and in households, from burning wood or charcoal indoors. The next largest risk factor, water pollution, accounted for 1.8 million deaths, while pollution in the workplace was linked to 800,000 deaths globally. About 92% of these deaths occurred in poorer countries, with the greatest impact felt in places undergoing rapid economic development such as India, which had the fifth highest level of pollution deaths, and China, which had the 16th. In the UK, about 8% or 50,000 deaths are estimated to be linked to pollution. This puts the UK in 55th place out of the 188 countries measured, placing them behind the US and many European countries, including Germany, France, Spain, Italy, Denmark. Dr Penny Woods, of the British Lung Foundation, said: ""Air pollution is reaching crisis point worldwide, and the UK is faring worse than many countries in Western Europe and the US. ""A contributing factor could be our dependence on diesel vehicles, notorious for pumping out a higher amount of poisonous particles and gases. ""These hit people with a lung condition, children and the elderly hardest."" How bad is air pollution in the UK? The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said a Â£3 billion plan had been put in place to improve air quality and reduce harmful emissions. A spokesman said: ""We will also end the sale of new diesel and petrol cars by 2040, and next year we will publish a comprehensive Clean Air Strategy which will set out further steps to tackle air pollution."" Mike Hawes from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the latest diesel cars were the cleanest in history. He said the biggest change to air quality would be achieved ""by encouraging the uptake of the latest, lowest emission technologies and ensuring road transport can move smoothly"". In the United States, more than 5.8% - or 155,000 - deaths could be linked to pollution. The authors said air pollution affected the poor disproportionately, including those in poor countries as well as poor people in wealthy countries. Study author Karti Sandilya, from Pure Earth, a non-governmental organisation, said: ""Pollution, poverty, poor health, and social injustice are deeply intertwined. ""Pollution threatens fundamental human rights, such as the right to life, health, wellbeing, safe work, as well as protections of children and the most vulnerable."" The results were the product of a two-year project. The authors have published aninteractive map,externalillustrating their data.
