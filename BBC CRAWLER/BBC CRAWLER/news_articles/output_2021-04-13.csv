Covid travel ban in Scotland to be eased on Friday,"The Covid-19 restriction on travelling around Scotland are to be relaxed from Friday, while people are to be allowed to meet up in larger groups outdoors. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said measures were being eased earlier than planned to help people's mental health. People will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings. And they will be permitted to travel across Scotland to do so, as long as they do not stay overnight. Other restrictions are expected to be eased from 26 April - with premises including shops, gyms, pubs and restaurants due to reopen on a restricted basis. Hospitality businesses will need to close their doors at 20:00 indoors and 22:00 outdoors, with alcohol only allowed to be served outside. Groups of six people from six different households will be allowed to meet in outdoor hospitality. Restrictions on travel from Scotland to other parts of the UK are also expected to be lifted from 26 April. From 17 May, pubs will be able to open indoors until 22:30 and contact sports, cinemas, and some small scale events will be able to take place. Also from that date in May, up to four people from two households will be able to meet indoors. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days Outdoor drinking and diningresumed on Monday in England, with shops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos also opening their doors. And many hospitality and tourism businesses in Scotland havecriticised the more cautious approachnorth of the border. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, said Ms Sturgeon's announcement ""falls short of what is required to make licensed premises viable"". She added: ""We desperately need a return to licensing hours indoors, as well as allowing alcohol to be sold indoors from 26 April. ""The first minister points to indoor reopening being ahead of England, but without alcohol service it is meaningless to licensed hospitality businesses and little comfort to Scottish brewers and other parts of the supply chain who will see no benefit."" However, Ms Sturgeon warned that ""we do still need to be cautious"" to keep case numbers down and to prevent new variants of the virus from being imported. The changes were announced as the first minister confirmed that Scotland has ""effectively met"" its initial vaccination target of offering a first dose to all over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with particular underlying health conditions. Ms Sturgeon said infection rates had been higher in Scotland than other parts of the UK in recent weeks, but were now ""falling more markedly and more consistently"". The first minister said this meant she could confirm a ""very significant re-opening of the economy"" from 26 April, when the whole of Scotland will move into level three of the Covid-19 restrictions system. Scotland's island communities - which have been in level three for some time - will stay in the same level as the mainland in the immediacy, to allow people to travel between areas. Ms Sturgeon insisted that the announcement had nothing to do with the Holyrood election on 6 May Ms Sturgeon said she expected the whole of Scotland to then move to level two on 17 May - allowing people to meet up indoors - and to level one and then zero in June. And she said some changes to the travel restrictions that had not been due to come into force until 26 April would be made earlier than originally planned in an effort to boost people's mental health and wellbeing. The first minister insisted the move had nothing to do with the ongoing Holyrood election campaign, saying there was ""a bit of limited headroom"" to make changes due to the fall in case numbers and progress in vaccination. Ms Sturgeon said international travel remains a ""significant risk"" It means that people will be allowed to travel across Scotland from Friday of this week, though people are still being urged to stay local for non-essential shopping. In addition, people can meet in groups of up to six adults outdoors from Friday. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow ""long awaited and much-anticipated reunions"" of families and friends. People are currently not allowed to leave their local authority areas for anything other than essential travel, and only four adults from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet up outdoors. However, the first minister urged caution over the possibility of foreign travel. Governments across the UK are attempting to agree on rules for international travel on a four-nations basis, but Ms Sturgeon warned that it ""remains a significant risk"" given the spread of the virus elsewhere in the world. She said a ban on international travel could be ""the price we pay for greater normality here in Scotland"" and necessary to ""protect our progress here"". Scotland recorded just 199 new cases of the virus on Monday - the lowest daily total for seven months - although the figure increased to 221 on Tuesday, with the deaths of a further three people who had previously tested positive also being recorded. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed the move to ease travel restrictions earlier than planned, having previously said the emergence from lockdown was too slow compared to England. He said: ""Scotland's hospitality sector is on its knees and that is compounded by seeing equivalent businesses across the border reopening sooner. Every day that doors stay closed, more jobs are lost. ""This positive direction of travel is possible thanks to the immense sacrifices people continue to make but the game-changer is the UK's extraordinary vaccine programme."" And Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes were a ""welcome announcement for many who have been separated from loved ones for so long"". He added: ""We need to ensure that this lockdown is our last. We need to continue, and improve the pace of, the vaccine roll out and ensure the testing and tracing infrastructure is in place to support a return to normal."" The Scottish Greens welcomed the announcement, but said that caution was needed if the country was to avoid another wave of the virus. The party's Mark Ruskell said: ""We probably don't want to replicate the images of large groups gathering that we saw in London. A surge in gatherings could create a surge in the virus and avoiding that is hugely important to avoid the risk of a third lockdown."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said he was concerned that the Scottish government had ""consistently acted too late on testing and tracing"". He added: ""With hospitality businesses in other parts of the UK now open, the Scottish government must now make sure that financial support is now available to ensure that Scottish businesses don't lose out.""

US seeks China climate deal ahead of summit,"US envoy on climate John Kerry is visiting countries around the world ahead of the summit US envoy John Kerry is heading to Shanghai to woo China in advance of a climate summit President Joe Biden is hosting next week. After a major diplomatic row at the UN, both sides hope to co-operate over plans to drastically cut emissions. The US wants China to cease building coal-fired power stations and to stop financing coal ventures abroad. China wants the US to give more cash to developing countries to obtain clean technology and adapt to climate change. It also wants Washington to announce deep cuts in emissions. Speaking to CNN, Mr Kerry said China's co-operation was ""absolutely critical"" to battle the climate crisis. ""Yes, we have big disagreements with China on some key issues, absolutely. But climate has to stand alone."" Fact-checking the US and China on climate change Bitcoin could derail China's climate change targets Is China set for 'great leap' on climate change? He is hoping to salvage the superpower relationship to allow progress atPresident Bidenâs virtual summit on 22 and 23 April,external. Scientists warn that without an agreement between the worldâs great polluters thereâs little chance of averting dangerous climate change. Bernice Lee, a China expert at the UK think tank Chatham House, said: âThis is good news.  At least theyâre talking in the run-up to the summit. There will be big issues for both sides to resolve. But they must be resolved."" Neither party has formally declared its climate masterplan to the UN, and each is struggling to coax more concessions from the other. Coal-fired power stations are still a major part of China's energy production The US was absent from climate negotiations during President Donald Trumpâs term of office and it is now being urged to cut emissions to between 57%-63% below 2005 levels this decade. President Biden is expected to declare the formal US offer before, or at, next weekâs summit. China, meanwhile, has pledged to peak its emissions by 2030, and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (that means cutting out all carbon emissions from fossil fuels but still allowing farm emissions of methane â another planet-heating gas). It will be pressed to explain the policies that will achieve those targets. Byford Tsang from the think tank E3G told BBC News: âThe US has been pushing Japan and South Korea to end overseas coal finance. It will also be pressing the Chinese to stop constructing coal plants in their Belt and Road initiative. ""It will also want action on Chinaâs domestic coal use. China is operating half the worldâs coal capacity â and itâs still been expanding despite the pandemic.â Xi vows transparency over Belt and Road The Belt and Road initiative is a sweeping Chinese infrastructure project aimed at expanding global trade links. This video can not be played What China's One Belt, One Road really means The US will also hope to persuade President Xi to attend next weekâs virtual summit. Forty world leaders have been invited, including Russiaâs Vladimir Putin. The summit is a key milestone ahead of the UN climate Conference, known asCOP26, in Glasgow this November. Greta Thunberg believes COP26 should be postponed Climate scientists warn that global heating needs to be kept well below 2C above pre-industrial levels, with an aim for an increasingly ambitious 1.5C goal, to avoid the worst of climate breakdown.

'The heart of our family': The lives lost to Covid,"More than 12,500 people have died with coronavirus, since the first reported death in Scotland on 13 March 2020. Here are the stories of some of those who lost their lives. If you would like to pay tribute to a loved one lost to Covid, please use the form below or email newsonline-scotland@bbc.co.uk and ensure you have read ourterms and conditionsandprivacy policy. Jean was born in 1937 Maryhill and spoke often and fondly of her childhood in ""the Butney"". This involved real hardships - including war-time evacuation to Holytown - though Jean's memories were all good and Maryhill became a touchstone when dementia became a factor in recent years. Working at Rolls-Royce Hillington, Jean was transferred to its Derby HQ where, as a young woman, she made small component parts for jet engines. Even in her 80s, Jean could still perform all the machinist actions (with sound effects). She loved to paint landscapes and had a life-long passion for music, especially jazz (with Frankie and Ella being constants). She was a great singer and dancer, always up for fun and laughs, brightening up any party. Her family said Jean was a fabulous mum to two daughters, a brilliant friend, and a warm-hearted women with kindness for everyone and anyone. She died on 27 October 2020. Rashelle Baird's family describe her as ""kind, bubbly, and always the life and soul of the party"". The 27-year-old mother-of-three from Brechin had put off appointments to get the vaccine because she was busy with her children. Her family stressed she was not anti-vaccine. ""She wanted to get her vaccine but she put her kids first,"" her father Stephen said. Rashelle, who had asthma, initially thought she had caught a cold from her children, but her symptoms worsened and she was admitted to hospital. She died in November 2021 after several days in Ninewells Hospital, Dundee, having been placed in an induced coma in the intensive care unit. Family's vaccine plea after 27-year-old's Covid death David Trower worked as a clerical officer in the A&E department of University Hospital Monklands in Airdrie before retiring in 2016. But he was committed to the NHS and even in retirement he chose to continue to work shifts, through NHS Lanarkshire's staff bank, right up until February. He died on 9 March 2021, aged 67. His colleagues thought highly of him, saying: ""We have many happy memories of shifts together, laughs, nights out, and listening to all his stories of his many holidays abroad. We will miss him."" Bernadette White, his sister, said he was a caring, gentle and loving man with a wicked sense of humour. She added: ""The last seven years, I would say, is when David started to live his life, doing the things that made him happy without having to worry about anyone else."" Stephen Stewart met his future wife, Heather, at a youth club when he was just 14. They got engaged on his 17th birthday and he had just turned 20 when they married. The couple, who lived in Motherwell, came from ""very different"" backgrounds but they grew up together during their 25-year marriage while raising their only child. Stephen took pride in his work for concrete manufacturer FP McCann, latterly as a lab technician working out what strength the concrete needed to be for certain projects. Outside work, he loved fishing, computer games, gadgets and during the first lockdown he managed to build a hot tub shelter with the help of a series of YouTube videos. He died of Covid pneumonia at University Hospital Wishaw on 19 February 2021, aged 45. Family of 45-year-old Covid victim warn of dangers Nan Douglas worked her way up from shorthand typist to headteacher during a remarkable career. She was already a mother of three when she left her job as a school secretary at West Calder High School to enrol at Moray House in Edinburgh where she qualified as a primary school teacher. After losing her husband John when she was just 43, she found solace in working with disabled children and went on to be appointed head of Pinewood Special School in Blackburn, West Lothian. Following a spell living in Cornwall during her retirement, she returned to Scotland where she hosted a ""living wake"" with 80 friends and family on her 90th birthday. She lived independently in Milnathort, Kinross, and was admitted to hospital for a minor issue just before Christmas 2020. But she picked up Covid and never left. She died on 19 February 2021, aged 95. Graeme McGrath's greatest passions were rowing and the River Clyde. On the day of his funeral, fellow rowers held oars in a guard of honour at Glasgow Green in a tribute appreciated by his wife Anne and their three sons. For 40 years Graeme volunteered with the Glasgow Humane Society and was often called on to row rescue boats on the Clyde, or to help evacuate families during floods. After undergoing a kidney transplant in his 50s, he was unable to get out on the river as much. He retired from his job as a Thomas Cook travel agent and moved to Prestwick in Ayrshire. But he still felt the pull of the Clyde and regularly returned to the city to meet friends and row safety boats at regattas. He died with Covid on 15 February 2021 at Crosshouse Hospital in Kilmarnock, aged 66, after being admitted for an infection affecting his heart. Tommy Morrow spent most of his life in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, where he met his partner Jackie and raised their children, Demi and Mark. His family described him as a character and not a day went by without them laughing at his jokes. He loved camping and fishing in places like Stornoway with his friends but the most important people in his life were his family, including grandchildren, Lacey and Louden. During his career he worked in various well-known hotels and restaurants in Glasgow but he had not worked for some years due to poor health, including COPD. He died with Covid on 15 February 2021, aged 53. ""It was so cruel - he was so close to getting the vaccine,"" his family said. Tommy Rooney was a bus driver for 36 years and hugely popular with colleagues at First Bus in Larbert. On the day of his funeral they were among dozens of people who lined the streets and applauded as his cortege passed the depot. First Bus operations managerJason Hackett told the Falkirk Herald that Tommy was the ""heart and soul"",externalof the Larbert station. Married to Margaret, the Bonnybridge man had two daughters and a granddaughter who described him as a ""humble but proud family man who put everyone else's needs before his own"". An avid Celtic fan, he spent much of the pandemic driving key workers to their essential duties. He died on 12 February 2021, aged 57. David Gray's first grandchild - a girl called Islay - was born in July 2020. The proud ""papa"" used to say that she was the love of his life and she gave him a reason to wake up in the morning. Tragically, the 62-year-old only got to spend five months with her before falling ill with Covid. He died on 3 February 2021. David lived in Erskine and worked for BAE Systems for 20 years, first as a mechanical fitter then as records manager dealing with secret files for the Ministry of Defence. His family describe him as ""music daft"" - he played guitar and he was performing a gig with his band in Glasgow when he met his wife, Joyce, 40 years ago. They went on to have two children - Darren and Danielle - as well as his beloved Cocker Spaniels, Buster and Shimmer, who he described as his ""bairns"". Harry Osborne was a Dunkirk veteran whose life was full of adventures - his daughter said he was still able to recall stories until just a few days before he died. Mr Osborne was deployed to France months after joining the Territorial Army in Glasgow, served with the 77th Highland Field Regiment of the Royal Artillery and later became a surveyor. Friends recall how upon joining, he promised his mother he would not swear and instead would say ""cricky jings"", which became his nickname in the forces. He was also known as a keen golfer with a ""wicked sense of humour"". Mr Osborne died from Covid-19 on 25 January, nine months after celebrating his 100th birthday. Connie Simpson's grandchildren say she was more like a pal than a granny - she was full of fun and laughter, and was always the first up to dance at a party. Born in Kinning Park, Glasgow, she moved to the east end after marrying John who she met at the Barrowlands when they were teenagers. While John was away with the Merchant Navy, she brought up their four children in a house ""surrounded by love"", before taking work as a curtain consultant. She was fabulous even in her 80s - she loved getting her hair, eyebrows and manicure done, meeting friends at Mecca Bingo in Parkhead and at a local pensioners' club. Connie died on 23 January 2021 at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow, aged 82. Sheila Gartly was as ""bright as a button"" and the ""heart of our family"", her loved ones said. She was born and brought up in Deskford, Moray, before marrying and moving to Keith in 1954. Widowed in 1975, she remarried but lost her second husband in 2005. During her working life she had jobs in a florist and in a fish shop - both of which she thoroughly enjoyed. She loved to watch the birds in her garden, read her daily newspaper, listen to traditional Scottish music, and the spring and summer when the nights were lighter and flowers bloomed. In 2019 she had surgery on a broken leg but she was recovering well.  She died with Covid on 19 January 2021, aged 86. Alex Goldie was an electrical engineer who latterly worked as a lecturer at Stow College in Glasgow before his retirement. His family said he was a gregarious man, always interested in other people, who took great delight and pride in the antics and education of his two great-grandsons, Charlie and Joe. During his long life he enjoyed skiing, tennis, pottery, sailing, golf, holidays in Europe, Australia and North America, single malts and red wine. He had been well cared for by Randolph Hill nursing home in Dunblane for 19 months after developing dementia. Covid restrictions meant he had not seen his family, other than by Skype, for a year. He is thought to have contracted the virus on a trip to A&E after a fall. He died on 14 January, aged 100. Vincent Logan became one of the youngest bishops in the world when he was ordained Bishop of Dunkeld in 1981, aged 39. He served the Roman Catholic diocese for almost 32 years before his retirement in 2012. The Scottish Catholic Church said he was ""dedicated and energetic"" and had ""an energy and zeal in all he did"". Born in Bathgate in 1941, he was ordained a priest in Edinburgh in 1964. He died on 14 January, aged 79, the day after his friend the Archbishop of Glasgow, Philip Tartaglia. ""Both bishops succumbed to the lethal effects of the coronavirus,"" the current Bishop of Dunkeld, Stephen Robson, added. The Archbishop of Glasgow, the Most Reverend Philip Tartaglia, died suddenly at his home in the city on 13 January - the Feast of St Mungo, the Patron Saint of Glasgow. He had been self-isolating after testing positive for Covid shortly after Christmas. Born in Glasgow in 1951, he was ordained a priest in 1975 and had served as leader of Scotland's largest Catholic community since 2012. Scotland's Catholic bishops described Archbishop Tartaglia as a ""gentle, caring and warm-hearted pastor who combined compassion with a piercing intellect"". Among those who paid tribute were First Minister Nicola Sturgeon and Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken, who described the archbishop as ""a true Glaswegian"". Archbishop of Glasgow dies after contracting Covid Liz Shingleston was a well-known figure in the village of Dunragit and her death on 13 January had a big impact on the small community near Stranraer. ""Her hearse passed the bottom of the village and the amount of people who turned out to pay their respects was overwhelming,"" said her daughter, Lisa. Liz spent her early childhood in New Luce but moved to the railway station cottage in Dunragit where her father worked as a signalman. During a varied working life, Liz left school to work in the laboratory of the nearby Nestle factory and later replaced her own mother as the local school's dinner lady. The 73-year-old was devoted to her grandchildren and great-grandson but she also liked to treat herself to afternoon tea (with Prosecco) at Trump Turnberry. Hugh Polland, who was known as Shug to his friends and family, was born and raised in Glasgow's Easterhouse. He was well known in the area where he ran the Casbah Pub for many years during the 1980s and early 90s. A huge Celtic fan, he loved to play golf and took up photography later in life - becoming ""unofficial photographer"" at many friends' weddings, christening and parties. ""Everyone wanted him at their party not just to take photos but because of his personality,"" said his son, Tony McAllister. ""Everyone loved him because what you seen is what you got."" Shug died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 5 January, aged 70. His sudden death has left his family heartbroken. For more than 75 years George Wight lived on his dairy farm in the village of Drumoak in Aberdeenshire. But he had more than one string to his bow - as well as being a dairy farmer, for 25 years he was also the publican of his local, the Irvine Arms. A loyal Aberdeen FC fan, he was one of the lucky ones - he was in Gothenburg in 1983 to see the his beloved Dons lift the European Cup Winners Cup. He was devoted to his family, including wife Claire and their four children, and despite suffering a series of bereavements and health setbacks, he always bounced back. ""He was an inspiration and a hardy soul who kept going no matter what life threw at him,"" they said. George died at a nursing home on 4 January 2021, aged 85. Hugh Bell loved to dance. As a young man, when he doing his national service with the RAF, he was a regular at the dancing at the YMCA in Paisley. It was there he met the love of his life, Margaret.

He was a quiet man who never complained about anything and was happiest around his family - including four children, 11 grandchildren and one great-grandchild. His second great-grandchild was born shortly after he died in Edinburgh Royal Infirmary on 31 December. He was 85. The suburb with Scotland's highest mortality rate Henry Anderson, an SNP councillor on Perth and Kinross Council, died with Covid on 27 December. He had represented the Almond and Earn ward since 2012 and colleagues said he would be ""hugely missed"". Among those who paid tribute to the 68-year-old was Deputy First Minister John Swinney, who described him as ""a good, decent man and a faithful councillor"". Murray Lyle, the leader of Perth and Kinross Council, said Mr Anderson was an excellent advocate for his ward and ""passionate about local issues"". ""I had the pleasure of working with Henry for several years on the Local Review Body and always his enjoyed his company, good humour and sense of fun when we were out visiting planning sites."" Teenage sweethearts Bryson Mitchell and his wife Irene were due to celebrate their diamond wedding anniversary in January, They met when he was an 18-year-old apprentice electrician and was assigned to a contract with the company where Irene, who was 16, was working. After marrying in 1961, Bryson spent his adult life in Paisley and 35 years working as an aircraft electrician with British Airways. The couple had two children and four grandchildren, who described him as a quiet man with a great sense of humour. ""He was kind and generous, very hardworking, and he lived for his family,"" they said. He was in hospital being treated for an acute illness when he contracted Covid. He died on Christmas Eve, aged 82. As a child, Sandy Adam survived pioneering surgery to remove his voice box - an operation that left him unable to speak normally. Instead he learned a different way to communicate - oesophageal speech (swallowing air) - by drinking lots of lemonade. He had a life-long hatred of the fizzy drink after that. After training to be a dentist in Dundee, he returned to his hometown of Aberdeen. In addition to surgeries around the city, at one time he worked at Craiginches Prison one afternoon a week. A father and a grandfather, he loved tinkering with cars, pranking his two children and sitting in the sun with a glass of red wine. The 81-year-old, who had dementia, died on 16 December, shortly after testing positive for Covid. David Barr was born and grew up in Paisley and for more than 40 years he worked in the town's Anchor Mill. As well as being a keen bowler, a church elder, and an active member of Martyrs Church Men's Club, he had a gift for carpentry. The dolls houses and garages that he made for his children and grandchildren were much loved and they are still treasured. His favourite place in the world was the East Neuk of Fife, where he spent many happy holidays. David had an underlying respiratory condition and he was admitted to hospital with shortness of breath in December. He died within days of being diagnosed with Covid on 16 December, aged 86. Ana Lisa Sayson was a nurse who moved from the Philippines to work for the NHS in Scotland. She was a staff nurse at Stobhill Hospital in Glasgow before she moved to Glasgow Royal Infirmary during the Covid crisis. The mother-of-two died on 15 December after testing positive for the virus. ""Ana Lisa was a much-loved member of the team and an incredibly compassionate nurse who was devoted to the care of her patients,"" said John Stuart, the chief nurse at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. ""Ana Lisa came to our country from the Philippines to care for our loved ones and my heart goes out to her family and especially her husband and children. ""My thoughts, and the thoughts of all of her NHS family here in Glasgow, are with them at this terribly sad time."" Billy and May Fannin were married for 62 years after meeting at a ballroom in Glasgow in 1955. May was a bookkeeper who gave up her job to look after her grandchildren in the 1980s. ""Her life revolved around her four grandchildren,"" their younger daughter Jennifer told BBC Scotland. Billy was a joiner by trade but his real passion was singing, performing under the name Scott Allan. And as a member of Equity, he also took on work as an extra on TV programmes like Take the High Road and Taggart. He loved being the centre of attention and ""if he was chocolate he would have eaten himself"", Jennifer joked. When the couple from Barrhead caught Covid, their two daughters also fell ill with the virus and had to self-isolate. They were heartbroken they could not be with their 84-year-old mother when she died in hospital on 6 December. But they chose not tell their 88-year-old father about her death, as he was also in hospital and had dementia. Jennifer was able to visit him to say goodbye before he slipped away just eight days after the passing of his wife. Mridula Nasreen Sarwar was a well-known face among Glasgow's Bangladeshi community. She was president of the city's Bangladesh Association, a civil servant at Glasgow City Council and, according to her family, ""a pillar of the community"". They said she was a ""devoted mother, daughter, aunt and friend [but] she would prefer to be remembered as a social activist, volunteer and community advocate"". Both Mridula and her husband, Sarwar Hassan, were admitted to hospital with Covid in November. He was discharged but Mridula was moved to Aberdeen for specialist treatment. Her husband and two sons were able to spend time with her before she died at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary on 12 December, aged 50. Bridget Turner and her husband Alan worked for years in the window blinds industry before setting up their own business, A&B Window Blinds, in 1992. They lived next door to the shop in Paisley, where Bridget worked in the office and Alan went out to do the measuring. Their years of hard work paid off and the family business remains successful. The mother-of-three ""loved a good gab and a good catch-up with friends"", according to her daughter, Lisa. ""She was amazing, such a good friend to lots of people.""

She was 79 when she died on 9 April, leaving her family devastated and unable to comfort each other during lockdown. They had still not been able to hold a memorial service nine months later. Helen McMillan was 10 days short of her 85th birthday when she died at Almond Court care home in Glasgow's Drumchapel on 9 April. She spent most of her life in Summerston, where she widely known as ""Auntie Ellen"" - even to those she wasn't related to. ""Everybody loved my mum,"" her daughter, Jackie Marlow, told BBC Scotland. ""She knew everybody in the community and was the life and soul of the party."" Helen worked in McLellan's rubber factory in Maryhill until she was in her 50s. A grandmother to Hayley and Josh, she developed dementia in later life but she was still ""pretty agile and loving life"", her daughter said. Mary Martin and her husband, Alex, were keen ballroom dancers. Although their roots were firmly in Glasgow, they spent seven years in Dunblane where they were tasked with encouraging people on to the dancefloor at the Dunblane Hydro. Before that, Mrs Martin brought up her family in Mount Vernon, later moving to Bearsden. She had three children, six grandchildren, three great-grandchildren and a great-great grandchild. Her daughter, Sandra O'Neill, told BBC Scotland she was ""just a wonderful person - gentle and kind"". In her later years she had vascular dementia and she lived at the Almond Court care home in Drumchapel. She died there on 8 April, aged 88. Vic and Maureen Sharp, who were both 74, had been together since they were teenagers. Underlying health conditions meant the couple from Oakley in Fife were both asked to shield themselves during lockdown. But their daughter, Yvonne Sharp, believes the letter came too late and they caught the virus during a weekly trip to the supermarket. Maureen died in hospital on 8 April and then, Yvonne said, her father ""just gave up"". He died the following day. Only six members of the family could attend their funeral but a piper led the funeral cortege through Oakley, where locals lined the streets. Lockdown causing 'acute grief' for bereaved When Ann Tonner left the Nazareth House orphanage in Glasgow as teenager, she was one of the few women of colour in the city, according to her son, Tony McCaffery. She was ""exotic-looking and quite glamourous"" and was soon in demand as a model for local shops and boutiques before working as a celebrated hot-dog girl in an Odeon cinema. Her first husband tragically died and her second was largely absent, leaving her to bring up six children and - at times - hold down five jobs at once. She was a ""remarkable, formidable woman with a strong work ethic"", Mr McCaffery told BBC Scotland, but she was also a ""gentle soul with an incredibly child-like sense of humour"". A grandmother and great-grandmother, Mrs Tonner died at a nursing home in Glasgow where she was living with Alzheimer's, on 8 April. She was 84. Mary Nixon was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when she was just 18 but she was determined to never let it hold her back. Born and raised in Greenock, she was a lone parent to four children who described her as a ""strong, independent woman who lived life to the full"". ""My mum made being a single parent look easy"", her daughter Alexis said. ""We were very happy kids growing up. Everyone loved her and always said she was a 'wee gem'."" When she fell seriously ill in 2014, her family was told to prepare for the worst, but their ""invincible"" mum rallied, though she lost her mobility. She died with Covid on 7 April 2020, aged 66. After everything she had been through in life, her family said they felt ""robbed... that this awful virus has taken her from us"". Janice Graham was the first NHS worker to die with coronavirus in Scotland. The health care support worker and district nurse died at Inverclyde Royal Hospital on 6 April. One colleague said she had a ""bright and engaging personality and razor sharp wit"". Another said the 58-year-old was the ""most kind, caring and compassionate HCA I have had the privilege to work with"". Her son, Craig,told STV News,externalhe would miss everything about her. Nurse remembered for her 'kindness and compassion' Newly-wed Andy Wyness developed a high temperature and a cough following a trip to Wales. When his symptoms worsened the 53-year-old drove himself from his Wishaw home to an appointment at an assessment centre. That was the last time his wife, Sandra, saw him. The grandfather, who was a keen bowler, was taken straight to hospital by ambulance. He died on 6 April. ""Even walking out the house that night, although I knew he wasn't well, I never imagined he would never walk back in,"" Sandra said. My husband went to the doctor and never came back Rita Hawthorn spent the first 35 years of her life in Hamilton, where she was born, grew up and had her own family. But when her husband, Robert, lost his job as a miner the couple and their three children re-located from the west of Scotland to the far north in 1973. While Robert took up a new job at the Scottish Instruments Factory in Wick, she worked as a cleaner at a nearby job centre and became secretary of the Highlands and Islands Civil Service Union. She was sadly widowed at 51 but she was ""fiercely independent"" and went on to fulfil her dreams of travelling - a trip up the Nile, a safari in South Africa, and solo bus tours to Austria and Paris. Rita, who was a mother, grandmother and great-grandmother, fell ill during the first week of lockdown. She died at Caithness General Hospital on 6 April, aged 82. Bill Paul grew up in Giffnock on the south side of Glasgow and did his national service as a radar operator with the RAF in Malta. In his youth he was an extremely accomplished tennis player and it was through the sport that he met his first wife, Frances, who died in 1984. With his second wife, Liz, he loved to play golf and travel - hobbies that he continued after her death in 2012. An extremely active man, he loved to go on cruises with a group of like-minded friends. However his last cruise to the Caribbean was cut short by the pandemic in March. He returned home to Arran and fell ill with Covid within a week. He died at Lamlash Hospital on 5 April, aged 81. Mofizul Islam was beginning a new life in Scotland after relocating from Bangladesh when he fell ill with coronavirus. His family believe the 49-year-old caught the virus on his daily three-hour journeys between their Edinburgh home and his job at a pizza outlet in Midlothian. He died on 5 April and was buried in the Muslim section of a city cemetery but his wife and children were in isolation and unable to attend. His death has left the family ""completely helpless"", according to a family friend as they have no documents, no bank account and they are struggling for money. ""We are very worried about our future because we don't have our father,"" said Mofizul's 19-year-old son, Azahural. ""He was everything for us. And now we are just hopeless."" Family 'helpless' after father's coronavirus death Catherine Sweeney was a ""wonderful mother, sister and beloved aunty"", her family said after her death on 4 April. Born and raised in Dumbarton, she worked as a home carer for more than 20 years. Her family said she would be sorely missed after a ""lifetime of service"" to the community. And they praised the medics at the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley who ""heroically"" looked after her in her final days. Carer was 'dedicated to the most vulnerable' Jimmy Andrews was 17 years old when began his career in Glasgow Corporation's finance department in 1955. By the turn of the century, he had risen to become chief executive of Glasgow City Council and in 2001 he was appointed CBE for services to local government - a ""career highlight"". He was born in Kilsyth but spent much of his life living in Strathblane, Stirlingshire, with his wife of 52 years, Mary. In retirement, he ""enjoyed life to the full"", spending time with his three children and six grandchildren, and visiting horse racing courses throughout the country. A gentle, intelligent man with a great sense of humour, he died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 3 April 2020, aged 81. Lord Gordon of Strathblane was a former political editor of STV and he founded Radio Clyde. He died at Glasgow Royal Infirmary on 31 March after contracting coronavirus, Radio Clyde reported. He was 83. His family paid tribute to his ""generosity, his kindness and his enthusiasm for life"". Former First Minister Jack McConnell said Lord Gordon had ""an outstanding career in business and public service"". Labour peer dies 'after contracting coronavirus' Ryan Storrie was in Scotland to celebrate his 40th birthday with a trip to a Rangers match when he fell ill. The father-of-two was from Ardrossan but lived in Dubai. When he developed symptoms, the asthmatic isolated in his hotel room and waited for the virus to run its course. His condition deteriorated but he wouldn't let his wife, Hilary, phone 999 as he was convinced he would recover and didn't want to bother the NHS. She found him dead in his room on 31 March. 'Ryan was the last person I expected to die' Mary and Andy Leaman began self-isolating at the end of March after falling ill with flu-like symptoms. Their son, Andy, told theGlasgow Evening Times,externalthe couple were married 50 years and doted on their only granddaughter, nine-year-old Anna. Mrs Leaman died at home in Castlemilk on 30 March - four days after the death of Anna's maternal grandfather, Dougie Chambers. The schoolgirl lost her third grandparent almost three weeks later when Mr Leaman died in hospital on 19 April. Her mother, Lynsey Chalmers, told BBC Scotland: ""For a nine-year-old girl whose three grandparents were her world... why does a wee girl need to get punished like that over and over again?"" Earlier lockdown 'could have stopped 2,000 deaths' Robert Tarbet was ""self-opinionated and witty"", according to his daughter, Paula Karoly, but also ""hardworking, loyal and beautiful"". He spent his working life as a plumber with Glasgow City Council before retiring in the early 2000s. In his spare time, the sociable man was a mason who was a keen follower of Rangers FC. He loved country and western music and watching musicals in the theatre. A father and a grandfather-of-three, he was being treated for cancer when he contracted coronavirus. He died on 29 March at Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley, aged 76. School janitor Ian Wilson was at home in Coatbridge for two weeks with a high temperature and delirium before being admitted to hospital. Despite his worsening condition, doctors initially told his wife, Sandra, she would not be able to visit the 72-year-old who had a heart condition and diabetes. Staff eventually granted access provided she wore protective equipment - a decision which meant she could be at her husband's side when he died on 29 March. Although nurses were unable to comfort her with a hug due to social distancing protocols, Mrs Wilson is grateful they allowed her to be with her partner at the end. ""I was able to talk to him and just say goodbye. I've got strength from that,"" she said. The impact my husband's death had on NHS staff Dougie Chambers was one of several people who fell ill after the 40th birthday party of his daughter, Wendy, on 7 March. Within days, the 66-year-old, who had an underlying health condition, went into hospital and tested positive for Covid-19. Mr Chambers, who was from Castlemilk in Glasgow, died two weeks later, on 26 March. Two other members of his extended family - Andy and Mary Leaman - also contracted the virus and later died. Wendy said: ""If we knew then what we know now, we wouldn't have had the party. It wouldn't have happened."" Earlier lockdown 'could have stopped 2,000 deaths' Danny Cairns was a healthy 68-year-old before he fell ill with coronavirus, according to his brother, Hugh. When he developed a cough and sore throat at the end of March, he isolated at home in Greenock. But within days he was so ill he had to be taken to hospital by ambulance. In a video call from his hospital bed, his last words to his brother were: ""I'm on my way out, mate"". He died on 26 March, three days after arriving in hospital. 'I'm on my way out, mate' Margaret Innes lived with her daughter, Sally McNaught, in Edinburgh for four years before her death at the very beginning of the pandemic. She was housebound and very frail but she loved sitting with their pet cat and dog, doing crosswords and watching quiz shows. Her favourite soap was Neighbours and she used to say ""I'm off to Australia now"". Ms McNaught said they stopped visitors coming to the house a week before lockdown, they washed their hands, cleaned everything and thought they would be safe. But Ms Innes woke up on Mother's Day with severe breathing difficulties. She died on 25 March, three days after going into hospital. She was 93. .

Countries pause use of Johnson & Johnson vaccine,"The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was cleared for use in the US in February The US, South Africa and European Union will temporarily stop the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Covid jab, after reports of rare blood clotting. Six cases were detected in more than 6.8 million doses of the vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said. Johnson & Johnson has paused its EU rollout, which started this week. It follows similar cases after doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which prompted curbs to its use. The FDA said it was recommending the temporary pause ""out of an abundance of caution"". It confirmed that one patient died from blood clotting complications, and another is in a critical condition. All six cases were in women aged between 18 and 48, with symptoms appearing six to 13 days after vaccination. Following the advice, all federal sites in the US have stopped using the vaccine until further investigations into its safety are completed. State and private contractors are expected to follow suit. The US has by far the most confirmed cases of Covid-19 - more than 31 million - with more than 562,000 deaths, another world high. Blood clot is 'very rare AstraZeneca side effect' What you need to know about vaccine safety Johnson & Johnson is a US health care company, but the vaccine was developed mainly by  a pharmaceutical branch in Belgium with laboratories in the Netherlands, and is also known as Janssen. Unlike some of the other jabs, it is given as a single shot and can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, making it easier to distribute in hotter climates or more remote areas. While many countries have pre-ordered millions of doses, it has only been approved in a few nations. It was cleared for use in the US on 27 February, but the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been used more widely. The J&J vaccine has been administered to nearly seven million people in the US, which is around 3% of the total immunisations given so far. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's top Covid adviser, said it was too early to comment on whether it could have its authorisation revoked. South Africa, which was the first country to administer the vaccine, has also paused its use, although no cases of blood clots have been reported in the country. The jab became the preferred vaccine there after studies showed it had a higher protection rate againstthe South African variantthan other jabs. Since mid-February, nearly 300,000 healthcare workers have received it. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa receives one of the first Johnson & Johnson vaccines in Cape Town The World Health Organization told Reuters it was monitoring the situation and waiting for reports from the US and European regulators. However deliveries of the vaccine to EU countries started just 24 hours before J&J said it would pause the European rollout. As it has not been administered in the EU yet, experts there will be looking to the United States to see what their next move is. The EU's vaccine roll-out has been criticised by the WHO for being too slow, and and there are concerns this latest delay could throw it into further turmoil. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is yet to be approved in the UK, although 30 million doses are on pre-order. The Department of Health said the rollout delay would not affect vaccine supplies in the UK, or derailthe aim to offer a jab to all adults by the end of July. Canada has pre-ordered 10 million doses of the vaccine, and is ""still on track"" to receive the first shipment by the end of the month, said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""But obviously, we're following closely the developments in the United States,"" he added. In a joint statement,external, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they were ""reviewing data involving six reported US cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine"". It said the clotting was called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). The statement said that this type of blood clot needed a different treatment than usual. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared The common treatment - an anticoagulant drug called heparin - ""may be dangerous"", it said. Pending a further review, the FDA and CDC recommended ""a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution"". Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Why the vaccine alone won't rid us of Covid The joint statement said that ""people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider"". Johnson & Johnsonissued a statement,externalsaying that it shared ""all adverse event reports"" with the health authorities. It added: ""We are aware that thromboembolic events including those with thrombocytopenia have been reported with Covid-19Â vaccines. At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine."" By Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter The US health protection agency has identified a very small number of the same rare form of blood clots seen in people given the AstraZeneca jab. Governments around the world have cautiously begun to link these rare blood clotting incidents to the vaccine because of their unusual presentation - though this link hasn't been definitively proven. People suffering them had very low platelet counts - blood cells that normally help repair damage in the body. The Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines work in very similar ways. so in some respects it's not surprising they may cause similar side effects. And these appear to be comparably rare. The numbers we're talking about are so low that it's difficult to say confidently what the risk of fatal blood clots is, but for the AstraZeneca jab it has been estimated at one-in-a-million. There have been six cases out of 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson jab. In contrast, Covid kills one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms (and this risk is much higher among older people). Once you get into the youngest age groups, who are less likely to die from Covid, that risk calculus shifts, particularly when there aren't too many infections in circulation.

US troops to leave Afghanistan by 11 September,"The announcement means the US will miss a May deadline for a pull-out agreed with the Taliban last year US President Joe Biden is set to announce that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September, officials have told US media. The US would miss a May deadline for a pull-out agreed with the Taliban by the Trump administration last year. The new deadline would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001. Mr Biden had previously said the 1 May deadline would be tough to meet. US and Nato officials have said the Taliban, a hardline Islamist movement, have so far failed to live up to commitments to reduce violence. The president is due to make the announcement himself on Wednesday. Afghans face pivotal moment as US 'closes the book' A 'moonshot' plan for peace in Afghanistan A year of violence on the road to peace The UK is now expected to withdraw 750 British soldiers stationed in Afghanistan by September, with Nato likely to pull its forces out collectively. German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told ARD public television early on Wednesday: ""We always said: we'll go in together, we'll leave together. I am for an orderly withdrawal, and that is why I assume that we (Nato) will agree to that today."" The Taliban have been warned that if they attack US troops during the pull-out phase, they ""will be met with a forceful response"", a senior US official told reporters. Mr Biden had decided a hasty withdrawal that would put US forces at risk was not a viable option, the official added. At the same time, a review of US choices determined that now was the time to close the book on the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan to focus on more acute threats. The Afghan government has not yet responded officially, but the speaker of the Afghan parliament, Mir Rahman Rahmani, warned that the withdrawal of foreign forces in the current circumstances would lead to civil war. By Secunder Kermani, Afghanistan correspondent Many here will see this decision as a boost to the Taliban, despite it being a breach of the 1 May deadline the insurgents have insisted is adhered to. It seems unlikely they would now resume attacks on American forces given the short extension period; nevertheless, the Taliban reaction so far has been hostile. Some in the Afghan government had hoped the new Biden administration would adopt a more ""conditions-based"" approach to the peace process. Instead, that has been explicitly ruled out. The slow pace of talks between Afghan and Taliban negotiators so far suggests it will be difficult to reach a power-sharing arrangement before US troops are withdrawn. Perhaps the Taliban's desire for international legitimacy will lead them to compromise. But many fear the Taliban will be tempted to wait out the withdrawal, and then push for outright victory or at least dominance. The Afghan government has until now remained reliant on US air strikes to help hold the insurgents back. The Taliban said on Tuesday that it will now not attend a summit on Afghanistan's future, due to be held in Turkey later this month, until all foreign forces leave the country. ""Until all foreign forces completely withdraw from our homeland, [we] will not participate in any conference that shall make decisions about Afghanistan,""Mohammad Naeem, spokesman for the Taliban office in Qatar, tweeted,external. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin are expected to brief Nato allies on the decision in the Belgian capital, Brussels, on Wednesday. The United States has spent trillions of dollars and lost more than 2,000 service members since 2001 in what has been its longest war. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? (2019 report) The deal signed in February last yearsaid the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops in 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks. As a condition of starting negotiations with the Afghan government, the Taliban also demanded the release of thousands of their men in a prisoner swap. Direct talks then began in Doha in September 2020, but a breakthrough has still not been reached. Who are the Taliban? The Afghan war: The short and long story Although the group stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government. Last month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops still in the country on 1 May. There are fears that if foreign military forces withdraw before a lasting agreement is reached, the Taliban might seize power.

Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting',"Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital A top civil servant joined financial firm Greensill Capital as an adviser while still working for the government, a lobbying watchdog has revealed. Bill Crothers's part-time position had been ""agreed"" to by the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments added. Its chairman Lord Pickles complained of a ""lack of transparency"" over the situation. But Mr Crothers said he had been taken on by Greensill in a ""transparent"" way. Labour called his dual employment ""extraordinary and shocking"". Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Analysis: Review into lobbying may change little David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? The disclosure about Mr Crothers - who had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill - is the latest of several stories involving the now-collapsed financial firm. It employed former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser from 2018. The Financial Times and the Sunday Times revealed that Mr Cameron had contacted several ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, to push for greater involvement in government loans schemes for the company. Boris Johnson has set up an inquiry into lobbying - attempts to persuade governments to change policy - including Greensill's role. Government sources said this would also now look at the situation surrounding Mr Crothers. Lord Pickles is asking for Whitehall ""guidance"" on possible ""conflicts of interest"" Mr Crothers, who had already left his job as chief procurement officer but remained a Civil Service employee, joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015. The letter from Conservative peer Lord Pickles to leading civil servant Alex Chisholm says: ""This was agreed by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts-of-interest policy."" Lord Pickles asks for ""guidance on the conflicts-of-interest process"" undertaken. The letter adds: ""The lack of transparency around this part-time employment with Greensill may have left the misleading impression that Mr Crothers had wilfully ignored the obligation to seek advice."" Mr Crothers left the Civil Service in November 2015, two months after taking up his role at Greensill. He became a director of the firm in late 2016. A letter from Mr Crothers to Lord Pickles, a former Conservative Party chairman, written earlier this week, has also been published. In it, he says: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" The shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: ""This is an extraordinary and shocking revelation. ""The Conservatives have weakened the rules so much they may as well rip them up and start again."" The government inquiry in to lobbying is expected to report  by the end of June, but Labour says it does not go far enough. It will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote on whether to establish a new Commons select committee to investigate the issue. Unlike regular opposition day votes which are symbolic, this one would be binding if it passes because Parliament would be deciding if it should do something. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said there would be a response to Mr Pickles's letter ""in due course"". They added that the ""review into Greensill Capital and supply-chain finance"" would be ""wide-ranging"".

US troops to leave Afghanistan by 11 SeptemberPresident Biden is to announce on Wednesday US troops will leave by mid-September instead of May.,"The announcement means the US will miss a May deadline for a pull-out agreed with the Taliban last year US President Joe Biden is set to announce that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September, officials have told US media. The US would miss a May deadline for a pull-out agreed with the Taliban by the Trump administration last year. The new deadline would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001. Mr Biden had previously said the 1 May deadline would be tough to meet. US and Nato officials have said the Taliban, a hardline Islamist movement, have so far failed to live up to commitments to reduce violence. The president is due to make the announcement himself on Wednesday. Afghans face pivotal moment as US 'closes the book' A 'moonshot' plan for peace in Afghanistan A year of violence on the road to peace The UK is now expected to withdraw 750 British soldiers stationed in Afghanistan by September, with Nato likely to pull its forces out collectively. German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told ARD public television early on Wednesday: ""We always said: we'll go in together, we'll leave together. I am for an orderly withdrawal, and that is why I assume that we (Nato) will agree to that today."" The Taliban have been warned that if they attack US troops during the pull-out phase, they ""will be met with a forceful response"", a senior US official told reporters. Mr Biden had decided a hasty withdrawal that would put US forces at risk was not a viable option, the official added. At the same time, a review of US choices determined that now was the time to close the book on the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan to focus on more acute threats. The Afghan government has not yet responded officially, but the speaker of the Afghan parliament, Mir Rahman Rahmani, warned that the withdrawal of foreign forces in the current circumstances would lead to civil war. By Secunder Kermani, Afghanistan correspondent Many here will see this decision as a boost to the Taliban, despite it being a breach of the 1 May deadline the insurgents have insisted is adhered to. It seems unlikely they would now resume attacks on American forces given the short extension period; nevertheless, the Taliban reaction so far has been hostile. Some in the Afghan government had hoped the new Biden administration would adopt a more ""conditions-based"" approach to the peace process. Instead, that has been explicitly ruled out. The slow pace of talks between Afghan and Taliban negotiators so far suggests it will be difficult to reach a power-sharing arrangement before US troops are withdrawn. Perhaps the Taliban's desire for international legitimacy will lead them to compromise. But many fear the Taliban will be tempted to wait out the withdrawal, and then push for outright victory or at least dominance. The Afghan government has until now remained reliant on US air strikes to help hold the insurgents back. The Taliban said on Tuesday that it will now not attend a summit on Afghanistan's future, due to be held in Turkey later this month, until all foreign forces leave the country. ""Until all foreign forces completely withdraw from our homeland, [we] will not participate in any conference that shall make decisions about Afghanistan,""Mohammad Naeem, spokesman for the Taliban office in Qatar, tweeted,external. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin are expected to brief Nato allies on the decision in the Belgian capital, Brussels, on Wednesday. The United States has spent trillions of dollars and lost more than 2,000 service members since 2001 in what has been its longest war. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? (2019 report) The deal signed in February last yearsaid the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops in 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks. As a condition of starting negotiations with the Afghan government, the Taliban also demanded the release of thousands of their men in a prisoner swap. Direct talks then began in Doha in September 2020, but a breakthrough has still not been reached. Who are the Taliban? The Afghan war: The short and long story Although the group stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government. Last month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops still in the country on 1 May. There are fears that if foreign military forces withdraw before a lasting agreement is reached, the Taliban might seize power.

Edinburgh's International Festival to be outdoors,"An graphical impression of the temporary structures which will hold the crowds and performers The Edinburgh International Festival will return to the capital this summer with huge outdoor marquees to stage events. Three temporary structures, designed for live performance, will be erected in Edinburgh Park and Edinburgh University's Old College Quad. The shows will be shorter with no intervals at this year's festival, which runs between 7 and 29 August. The programme will be announced on Wednesday 2 June. Organisers are optimistic about the festival's return despite continued cancellations of other events. Later on Tuesday the organisers of the Braemar Gathering said the risk of Covid meantit would be unable to take place this September. Some of the performances for the Edinburgh International Festival will be streamed online for free during each week. Edinburgh International Festival director, Fergus Linehan, said: ""We appreciate that these first steps back to live performances will be for audiences closer to home but are delighted to offer a parallel programme of digital work for those further afield."" The festival offered a digital programme of events during lockdown restrictions last year Edinburgh council officials said it would be ""fantastic"" for audiences to enjoy live performances again. Donald Wilson, City of Edinburgh Council's culture and communities convener, said: ""After the challenging year we've all had and the disappointment of not being able to enjoy the festival in the usual way last year, it will be fantastic for audiences to share in the live performance experience again with an exceptional outdoor pavilions programme for local audiences alongside the festival's online offering."" Iain Munro, Creative Scotland's chief executive, added that that the country's ""art and creative sector had been hit hard by covid and its effects continue to have an impact"", He added: ""However, it has been truly remarkable how artists and creative organisations across Scotland have adapted to continue to deliver creative work for audiences.""

"Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting'Bill Crothers's position was ""agreed"" to by the Cabinet Office, a letter from a lobbying watchdog reveals.","Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital A top civil servant joined financial firm Greensill Capital as an adviser while still working for the government, a lobbying watchdog has revealed. Bill Crothers's part-time position had been ""agreed"" to by the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments added. Its chairman Lord Pickles complained of a ""lack of transparency"" over the situation. But Mr Crothers said he had been taken on by Greensill in a ""transparent"" way. Labour called his dual employment ""extraordinary and shocking"". Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Analysis: Review into lobbying may change little David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? The disclosure about Mr Crothers - who had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill - is the latest of several stories involving the now-collapsed financial firm. It employed former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser from 2018. The Financial Times and the Sunday Times revealed that Mr Cameron had contacted several ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, to push for greater involvement in government loans schemes for the company. Boris Johnson has set up an inquiry into lobbying - attempts to persuade governments to change policy - including Greensill's role. Government sources said this would also now look at the situation surrounding Mr Crothers. Lord Pickles is asking for Whitehall ""guidance"" on possible ""conflicts of interest"" Mr Crothers, who had already left his job as chief procurement officer but remained a Civil Service employee, joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015. The letter from Conservative peer Lord Pickles to leading civil servant Alex Chisholm says: ""This was agreed by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts-of-interest policy."" Lord Pickles asks for ""guidance on the conflicts-of-interest process"" undertaken. The letter adds: ""The lack of transparency around this part-time employment with Greensill may have left the misleading impression that Mr Crothers had wilfully ignored the obligation to seek advice."" Mr Crothers left the Civil Service in November 2015, two months after taking up his role at Greensill. He became a director of the firm in late 2016. A letter from Mr Crothers to Lord Pickles, a former Conservative Party chairman, written earlier this week, has also been published. In it, he says: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" The shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: ""This is an extraordinary and shocking revelation. ""The Conservatives have weakened the rules so much they may as well rip them up and start again."" The government inquiry in to lobbying is expected to report  by the end of June, but Labour says it does not go far enough. It will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote on whether to establish a new Commons select committee to investigate the issue. Unlike regular opposition day votes which are symbolic, this one would be binding if it passes because Parliament would be deciding if it should do something. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said there would be a response to Mr Pickles's letter ""in due course"". They added that the ""review into Greensill Capital and supply-chain finance"" would be ""wide-ranging"". Mr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying and that he welcomes the investigation launched by Mr Johnson.

Italian man admits Â£26m celebrity raidsA series of burglaries targeted the west London homes of multimillionaire celebrities.London,"The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were broken into in December 2019 An Italian man has been convicted over his role in one of the biggest domestic burglaries in English legal history. Watches and jewellery belonging to Frank Lampard, Tamara Ecclestone and the late Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were among the items taken during a series of burglaries in December 2019. Alessandro Donati, 43, from Milan, pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court to conspiracy to burgle. He will be sentenced at a later date. Donati was arrested in Italy under a European Arrest Warrant in October and extradited to the UK the following month. With the assistance of an Italian interpreter, he admitted to conspiring to burgle dwellings between 30 November 2019 and 18 December 2019. The home of the former Chelsea manager and England international Mr Lampard was the first to be raided on 1 December. Tamara Ecclestone's Kensington mansion was raided on 13 December 2019 as she flew out for a Christmas family holiday A diamond watch, cufflinks and a clock worth an estimated Â£60,000 were taken. Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the Srivaddhanaprabha family was targeted. It was duty free billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's home before his death in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium in October 2018. This time, 400,000 euros in cash was taken, as well as expensive watches. The final burglary, on the palatial home near Kensington Palace that socialite Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland, saw about Â£25m worth of valuables stolen. Ms Ecclestone, the daughter of ex-Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, was on a Christmas family holiday in Lapland with Mr Rutland, their daughter and their dog at the time. Judge Martin Edmunds QC remanded Donati in custody ahead of a sentencing date yet to be fixed.

LiveLiveEurope rollout of Johnson & Johnson vaccine delayed8 minutes ago,"US health officials call for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine rollout to be paused Six cases saw women develop a rare disorder involving blood clots after being vaccinated - one died Johnson & Johnson says it's going to delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe and is reviewing the blood clot cases The target of offering all UK over-50s and those in high-risk groups a first dose of a vaccine by 15 April has been met, ministers say People in their late 40s can now book a jab in England, while those aged 40-45 have been making appointments in Wales and Northern Ireland PM Boris Johnson warns that Covid cases and deaths will rise as lockdown lifts, despite the successful rollout In Scotland some lockdown easing is brought forward - from Friday, people can travel outside their local area and six adults can meet up outside The first Moderna vaccine has been given in England - Scotland and Wales began using it last week Surge testing is implemented in two areas of south London, after a cluster of the South African variant was found Edited by James Clarke and Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage for today. It was edited by James Clarke and Holly Wallis, and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Ella Wills, Lauren Turner and Ashitha Nagesh. There have been plenty of coronavirus developments to tell you about today and we are going to be bringing our live page to a close shortly. Here's a recap of what's been going on in the UK:  Here's a reminder of the stories we've been covering from around the world: Closing the UK borders to keep out Covid variants is ânot
a sustainable long-term strategyâ, says former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He told BBC Radio 4âs PM programme that the UK should have
had more border controls last year and introduced them earlier, but the
situation âis more complicated this yearâ. He says the countries which have followed a âzero-Covid
strategyâ, such as New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea, are now faced with the âterrible
dilemmaâ of whether they keep their borders closed or whether they start to
find a way of living with Covid. He says the UK government needs to be flexible and when âyou
have scares like what is happening in south London, you may need to move more
countries onto the red list â you may need to do it more quicklyâ. The lesson from what is happening in south London is that âyou
never know whatâs around the cornerâ, he says, and the government canât just rely on the
vaccine programme, it also needs to make sure other tools work - such as test
and trace. A cluster of cases of the South African variant in
south London is a result of the government failing to protect the UKâs borders
against Covid variants, according to Labour. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told Radio 4âs PM
programme: âThere should have been a comprehensive hotel quarantining system
introduced some months ago â which is what Iâve been calling for.â The UK has a ""red list"" of countries- from which
entry to the UK is banned â but the new outbreak appears to have been triggered
by an individual arriving from a country which wasnât on that list. Thomas-Symonds said it was âprecisely for this reason that
the so-called red list is not adequate to protect our bordersâ. He said he wanted the government to change course and âput it in place nowâ, although he added whether it would remain in place after 17 May â the earliest date international travel could start under Englandâs roadmap - would depend on the data at the time. He said the worst scenario was a variant entering the country
that badly affected the efficacy of the UKâs vaccines, adding that this was why it was âso
vitalâ that the government acted now. A return to normal opening hours for job centres puts users and staff ""in harm's way"", a union is warning. Job centres went back to their pre-lockdown hours yesterday, having previously been cut to 10am to 2pm. The PCS union says it will not rule out strike action, arguing the extension should be put back until Covid vaccines are ""fully rolled out"". It says staff have dealt successfully with benefits claimants via video link during the pandemic and says ""the vast bulk of the interviews now expected to be done face-to-face can still be carried out remotely"". General Secretary Mark Serwotka says: ""This reckless move by ministers is wholly unnecessary and risks putting both claimants and job centre staff in harm's way."" But the government says putting opening hours back to the normal 9am-5pm will help job centres give ""vital support to the most vulnerable"" in society. And a spokesman says Covid safety is taken ""extremely seriously"". Read more here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The UK has seen 150,000 deaths
involving coronavirus, according to figures released today by the Office for
National Statistics. These are different to the deaths
we hear about every day. The government daily figure only
counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This misses deaths that happen,
say, 30 days after a positive test or where there was no test. So the ONS figures are more
comprehensive: they look at death certificates that mention coronavirus as a
factor. But they take longer to arrive â
todayâs figures only include deaths registered up to the week of 2 April.  It has taken two and a half months to go from 100,000 deaths to 150,000. But things look very different compared to mid-January. Back then, things were getting worse quickly. We went from 100,000 to 125,000 in three short weeks. With the decreases we have seen since then, we can hope to see hundreds, rather than thousands of deaths in the coming weeks.  Allow YouTube content?

One of the biggest names in rock music, Sir Mick Jagger, has just released a song about the lockdown. The track, Eazy Sleazy,,externalwas written by Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick, and recorded in collaboration with another rock giant, Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters. The song begins with the lines: ""We took it on the chin, the numbers were so grim"" and the record label says Sir Mick goes on to reflect on Zoom calls, ""home in these prison
walls"" and too much TV. Sir Mick said: ""Itâs a song that I wrote about coming out of lockdown, with some much needed
optimism. ""Thanks to Dave Grohl for jumping on drums, bass and guitar, it was a
lot of fun working with him. Hope you all enjoy Eazy Sleazy.â Grohl added: Itâs
hard to put into words what recording this song with Sir Mick means to me. Itâs
beyond a dream come true. ""Just when I thought life couldnât get any
crazier... and itâs the song of the summer, without a doubt!!â South Africa has suspended the rollout of the Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccine while an investigation into possible blood clots takes place in the United States. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says this is a ""precautionary suspension"". US health authorities are calling for a pause in the use of the jab, after reports of extremely rare blood clotting cases. South Africa was the first country in the world to administer the jab, and nearly 300,000 health workers have received it since mid-February. A total of 40,107,877 vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's 32,250,481 first doses and 7,857,396 second doses. People aged 45 or over in England will now be invited to get a Covid jab,it was announced earlier. If you've not had yours yet,you can use our look-up tool to find out when you will get your vaccine. About half of students have been studying off campus - and all students will now return to a mix of face-to-face and online classes Students on all university courses in England will be able to return from 17 May at the earliest, the government has announced. It means a return to campuses for about a million students, who have only been able to study online since the Christmas holidays. Since the start of the year, only students on practical, hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching. Students will be offered Covid tests when they return for face-to-face classes, ""no earlier than 17 May"". University leaders had been lobbying for an earlier return - saying it was unfair to keep restrictions on campuses when shops were open. Read the latest here. There have been a further 23 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to government data.,external It means a total of 127,123 people have now died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. A total of 2,472 new cases were detected. Members of the public queue for a Covid testing centre in south London As we've reported, health authorities in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth are urging people to get tested, even if they have no symptoms, aftercases of the South African variant were found in the area. Experts are concerned that this variant - along with a few others - may be able to get round some of the protection given by vaccines. Danny Altmann, a professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, said he was worried by the news of the outbreak. ""It was always one of my nightmare scenarios, that just as we were being kind of coaxed to put a toe in the water of unlocking, something like this would come along,"" Prof Altmann toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""That really can scupper our plans if we let it get out of control."" Prof Altmann said he thought the response had been good - but ""there's so, so little margin for error"". ""You only have to miss a handful of cases and have them run riot through London, and then you're back where we were back in January, February 2020 with a whole new outbreak"". Asked whether he thought the UK's borders were too relaxed, the professor said we need to ""be a bit more like the countries like Vietnam and South Korea"" who have very tight border restrictions. And questioned on whether he thought it seemed strange that people in areas such as Lambeth were still going to the pub, he said: ""It does in a way."" This video can not be played Concern is growing in Brazil about the rising number of young people who are critically ill in hospital with Covid-19. Research suggests more than half of patients being treated in intensive care last month were under 40. The BBC's Mark Lowen visited Latin America's largest cemetery, a makeshift hospital and a vaccine hub to find out why the handling of the pandemic in Brazil has become a public health disaster. Jim ReedBBC health reporter A large queue of people lined up waiting to be tested in Brockwell Park, Lambeth Earlier,we brought you the news that surge testinghad begun in Wandsworth and Lambeth after an outbreak of the Covid-19 variant first identified in South Africa. It appears to have been triggered by an individual who travelled from Africa in February, according to documents seen by the BBC. The documents say that in Southwark - which is to the east, the neighbouring borough - they tested sewerage water there and found traces of the South African variant in one particular area. At the moment they don't know if it's related to these other outbreaks but they are sending in targeted surge testing in Southwark. The impression I get is that they are quite confident this is probably under control but not certain yet at this stage, which is why they have done this huge rollout of these tests to make sure that they're going to pick up people who are asymptomatic in particular. Big games at Wembley have been in front of empty stands throughout the pandemic Charities working with disabled people are criticising plans to exclude vulnerable football fans from being able to apply for tickets for the Carabao Cup final. It was announced earlier Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City will both be allowed 2,000 fans at Wembley for the final on 25 April. But under-18s, people who are clinically extremely vulnerable and pregnant women have been asked not to apply. Level Playing Field - a charity that campaigns for inclusive matchday experience and equal access for all disabled sports fans - says it is ""very disappointed"" by the decision. And Louise Rubin, head of policy and campaigns at disability equality charity
Scope, says: ""Disabled people have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic
and, as the UK begins to recover from coronavirus and open up again, they should
be able to access sport and other social events just in the same way as everyone
else. ""Disabled people should be able to make their own choice about what's right
for them, rather than being subject to arbitrary and discriminatory blanket
policies."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been approached
for a response. You can read more here. Portugal is currently in the process of easing out of its lockdown - but, senior officials have been told, this may need to be halted or reversed within two weeks. The country is a week into phase two of the government's roadmap for easing the lockdown imposed on 15 January, with all but the largest on-street shops allowed to open since last Monday, and cafes and restaurants open for outdoor dining. However, officials were told at an expert briefing that case numbers and the R number could soon breach thresholds the government has said would make it necessary to halt or even reverse course, the BBC's Alison Roberts reports. ""With this level of growth and a rate close to 71 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the time to reach the line of 120 is between two weeks and one month,"" Baltazar Nunes, a biostatistician at the National Health Institute (INSA), says. He adds the Algarve, Madeira and Azores regions have already breached this threshold. The R rate, he adds, has also shown a ""systematic increase"" in recent days, with the most recent official figure - for 8 April - being 1.09. The Department for Education (DfE) pledged to provide 1.3 million laptops and tablets to disadvantaged pupils at the start of the pandemic - and is very close to the target, but has not yet reached it, new data suggests. The DfE figures show that a total of 1,295,752 laptops and tablets have been delivered or dispatched to support children to access remote education since the start of the pandemic. Overall, 733,331 devices have been sent to councils, academy trusts, schools and colleges across England since the most recent lockdown began on 4 January. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says: ""The government has been promising for months that it would deliver 1.3 million laptops to schools and we are now tantalisingly close to seeing that target achieved. ""We do not underestimate the scale of the government's logistical operation but the truth is they were slow to react in the first place, slow to get started and progress since has been painfully slow."" The DfE has said it is in contact with local authorities, schools and colleges to encourage them to order their allocated devices if they have not yet done so. A pub landlord says his staff are having to police people who try to bend coronavirus rules by booking extra tables. Covid restrictions mean venues can only serve customers sitting outdoors in groups of up to six people or from two households. James Linder of The Eagle in Norwich says: ""We've had people try to book under different names to try to form large groups - we've had to catch them out, which is not great. ""With the greatest will in the world, they start mingling between the tables after a couple of drinks and forming one group."" He says he has to turn tables away which loses money and upsets staff. ""They don't want to be going in and policing people,"" he says. Trade bodyUK Hospitality,externalsays: ""We need people to stick by the rules."" Read more on this storyhere. From Friday people will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings The latest announcement on Scotland's journey out of lockdown means people will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings fromFriday. People will also be permitted to travel across Scotland as long as they do not stay overnight. All remaining shops and close-contact services such as nail salons are due to reopen on26 April. Pubs, restaurants and bars will be able to serve people outdoors - in groups of up to six from three households - until 22:00 from that date. Alcohol will be permitted, and there will be no requirement for food to be served. There will also be a partial resumption of indoor hospitality - food and non-alcoholic drinks can be served until 20:00 for groups of up to four people from no more than two households. Contact details will still need to be collected. Here are dates for when more of the current rules will be relaxed. Â© 2025 BBC.

"US urged to pause use of Johnson & Johnson vaccineFollowing rare blood clots, the company says it will also delay the vaccine rollout in Europe.","The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was cleared for use in the US in February The US, South Africa and European Union will temporarily stop the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Covid jab, after reports of rare blood clotting. Six cases were detected in more than 6.8 million doses of the vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said. Johnson & Johnson has paused its EU rollout, which started this week. It follows similar cases after doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which prompted curbs to its use. The FDA said it was recommending the temporary pause ""out of an abundance of caution"". It confirmed that one patient died from blood clotting complications, and another is in a critical condition. All six cases were in women aged between 18 and 48, with symptoms appearing six to 13 days after vaccination. Following the advice, all federal sites in the US have stopped using the vaccine until further investigations into its safety are completed. State and private contractors are expected to follow suit. The US has by far the most confirmed cases of Covid-19 - more than 31 million - with more than 562,000 deaths, another world high. Blood clot is 'very rare AstraZeneca side effect' What you need to know about vaccine safety Johnson & Johnson is a US health care company, but the vaccine was developed mainly by  a pharmaceutical branch in Belgium with laboratories in the Netherlands, and is also known as Janssen. Unlike some of the other jabs, it is given as a single shot and can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, making it easier to distribute in hotter climates or more remote areas. While many countries have pre-ordered millions of doses, it has only been approved in a few nations. It was cleared for use in the US on 27 February, but the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been used more widely. The J&J vaccine has been administered to nearly seven million people in the US, which is around 3% of the total immunisations given so far. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's top Covid adviser, said it was too early to comment on whether it could have its authorisation revoked. South Africa, which was the first country to administer the vaccine, has also paused its use, although no cases of blood clots have been reported in the country. The jab became the preferred vaccine there after studies showed it had a higher protection rate againstthe South African variantthan other jabs. Since mid-February, nearly 300,000 healthcare workers have received it. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa receives one of the first Johnson & Johnson vaccines in Cape Town The World Health Organization told Reuters it was monitoring the situation and waiting for reports from the US and European regulators. However deliveries of the vaccine to EU countries started just 24 hours before J&J said it would pause the European rollout. As it has not been administered in the EU yet, experts there will be looking to the United States to see what their next move is. The EU's vaccine roll-out has been criticised by the WHO for being too slow, and and there are concerns this latest delay could throw it into further turmoil. Why is the EU having vaccine problems?

""But obviously, we're following closely the developments in the United States,"" he added. In a joint statement,external, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they were ""reviewing data involving six reported US cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine"".

By Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter The US health protection agency has identified a very small number of the same rare form of blood clots seen in people given the AstraZeneca jab. Governments around the world have cautiously begun to link these rare blood clotting incidents to the vaccine because of their unusual presentation - though this link hasn't been definitively proven. People suffering them had very low platelet counts - blood cells that normally help repair damage in the body. The Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines work in very similar ways. so in some respects it's not surprising they may cause similar side effects. And these appear to be comparably rare. The numbers we're talking about are so low that it's difficult to say confidently what the risk of fatal blood clots is, but for the AstraZeneca jab it has been estimated at one-in-a-million. There have been six cases out of 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson jab. In contrast, Covid kills one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms (and this risk is much higher among older people). Once you get into the youngest age groups, who are less likely to die from Covid, that risk calculus shifts, particularly when there aren't too many infections in circulation.

Covid travel ban in Scotland to be lifted on Friday,"The Covid-19 restriction on travelling around Scotland are to be relaxed from Friday, while people are to be allowed to meet up in larger groups outdoors. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said measures were being eased earlier than planned to help people's mental health. People will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings. And they will be permitted to travel across Scotland to do so, as long as they do not stay overnight. Other restrictions are expected to be eased from 26 April - with premises including shops, gyms, pubs and restaurants due to reopen on a restricted basis. Hospitality businesses will need to close their doors at 20:00 indoors and 22:00 outdoors, with alcohol only allowed to be served outside. Groups of six people from six different households will be allowed to meet in outdoor hospitality. Restrictions on travel from Scotland to other parts of the UK are also expected to be lifted from 26 April. From 17 May, pubs will be able to open indoors until 22:30 and contact sports, cinemas, and some small scale events will be able to take place. Also from that date in May, up to four people from two households will be able to meet indoors. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days Outdoor drinking and diningresumed on Monday in England, with shops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos also opening their doors. And many hospitality and tourism businesses in Scotland havecriticised the more cautious approachnorth of the border. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, said Ms Sturgeon's announcement ""falls short of what is required to make licensed premises viable"". She added: ""We desperately need a return to licensing hours indoors, as well as allowing alcohol to be sold indoors from 26 April. ""The first minister points to indoor reopening being ahead of England, but without alcohol service it is meaningless to licensed hospitality businesses and little comfort to Scottish brewers and other parts of the supply chain who will see no benefit."" However, Ms Sturgeon warned that ""we do still need to be cautious"" to keep case numbers down and to prevent new variants of the virus from being imported. The changes were announced as the first minister confirmed that Scotland has ""effectively met"" its initial vaccination target of offering a first dose to all over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with particular underlying health conditions. Ms Sturgeon said infection rates had been higher in Scotland than other parts of the UK in recent weeks, but were now ""falling more markedly and more consistently"". The first minister said this meant she could confirm a ""very significant re-opening of the economy"" from 26 April, when the whole of Scotland will move into level three of the Covid-19 restrictions system. Scotland's island communities - which have been in level three for some time - will stay in the same level as the mainland in the immediacy, to allow people to travel between areas. Ms Sturgeon insisted that the announcement had nothing to do with the Holyrood election on 6 May Ms Sturgeon said she expected the whole of Scotland to then move to level two on 17 May - allowing people to meet up indoors - and to level one and then zero in June. And she said some changes to the travel restrictions that had not been due to come into force until 26 April would be made earlier than originally planned in an effort to boost people's mental health and wellbeing. The first minister insisted the move had nothing to do with the ongoing Holyrood election campaign, saying there was ""a bit of limited headroom"" to make changes due to the fall in case numbers and progress in vaccination. Ms Sturgeon said international travel remains a ""significant risk"" It means that people will be allowed to travel across Scotland from Friday of this week, though people are still being urged to stay local for non-essential shopping. In addition, people can meet in groups of up to six adults outdoors from Friday. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow ""long awaited and much-anticipated reunions"" of families and friends. People are currently not allowed to leave their local authority areas for anything other than essential travel, and only four adults from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet up outdoors. However, the first minister urged caution over the possibility of foreign travel. Governments across the UK are attempting to agree on rules for international travel on a four-nations basis, but Ms Sturgeon warned that it ""remains a significant risk"" given the spread of the virus elsewhere in the world. She said a ban on international travel could be ""the price we pay for greater normality here in Scotland"" and necessary to ""protect our progress here"". Scotland recorded just 199 new cases of the virus on Monday - the lowest daily total for seven months - although the figure increased to 221 on Tuesday, with the deaths of a further three people who had previously tested positive also being recorded. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed the move to ease travel restrictions earlier than planned, having previously said the emergence from lockdown was too slow compared to England. He said: ""Scotland's hospitality sector is on its knees and that is compounded by seeing equivalent businesses across the border reopening sooner. Every day that doors stay closed, more jobs are lost. ""This positive direction of travel is possible thanks to the immense sacrifices people continue to make but the game-changer is the UK's extraordinary vaccine programme."" And Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes were a ""welcome announcement for many who have been separated from loved ones for so long"". He added: ""We need to ensure that this lockdown is our last. We need to continue, and improve the pace of, the vaccine roll out and ensure the testing and tracing infrastructure is in place to support a return to normal."" The Scottish Greens welcomed the announcement, but said that caution was needed if the country was to avoid another wave of the virus. The party's Mark Ruskell said: ""We probably don't want to replicate the images of large groups gathering that we saw in London. A surge in gatherings could create a surge in the virus and avoiding that is hugely important to avoid the risk of a third lockdown."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said he was concerned that the Scottish government had ""consistently acted too late on testing and tracing"". He added: ""With hospitality businesses in other parts of the UK now open, the Scottish government must now make sure that financial support is now available to ensure that Scottish businesses don't lose out.""

Scotland's Covid travel ban to be lifted on Friday,"The Covid-19 restriction on travelling around Scotland are to be relaxed from Friday, while people are to be allowed to meet up in larger groups outdoors.

LiveLiveEurope rollout of Johnson & Johnson vaccine delayed3 minutes ago,"US health officials call for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine rollout to be paused Six cases saw women develop a rare disorder involving blood clots after being vaccinated - one died Johnson & Johnson says it's going to delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe and is reviewing the blood clot cases The target of offering all UK over-50s and those in high-risk groups a first dose of a vaccine by 15 April has been met, ministers say People in their late 40s can now book a jab in England, while those aged 40-45 have been making appointments in Wales and Northern Ireland PM Boris Johnson warns that Covid cases and deaths will rise as lockdown lifts, despite the successful rollout In Scotland some lockdown easing is brought forward - from Friday, people can travel outside their local area and six adults can meet up outside The first Moderna vaccine has been given in England - Scotland and Wales began using it last week Surge testing is implemented in two areas of south London, after a cluster of the South African variant was found Edited by James Clarke and Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage for today. It was edited by James Clarke and Holly Wallis, and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Ella Wills, Lauren Turner and Ashitha Nagesh. There have been plenty of coronavirus developments to tell you about today and we are going to be bringing our live page to a close shortly. Here's a recap of what's been going on in the UK:  Here's a reminder of the stories we've been covering from around the world: Closing the UK borders to keep out Covid variants is ânot
a sustainable long-term strategyâ, says former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He told BBC Radio 4âs PM programme that the UK should have
had more border controls last year and introduced them earlier, but the
situation âis more complicated this yearâ. He says the countries which have followed a âzero-Covid
strategyâ, such as New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea, are now faced with the âterrible
dilemmaâ of whether they keep their borders closed or whether they start to
find a way of living with Covid. He says the UK government needs to be flexible and when âyou
have scares like what is happening in south London, you may need to move more
countries onto the red list â you may need to do it more quicklyâ. The lesson from what is happening in south London is that âyou
never know whatâs around the cornerâ, he says, and the government canât just rely on the
vaccine programme, it also needs to make sure other tools work - such as test
and trace. A cluster of cases of the South African variant in
south London is a result of the government failing to protect the UKâs borders
against Covid variants, according to Labour. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told Radio 4âs PM
programme: âThere should have been a comprehensive hotel quarantining system
introduced some months ago â which is what Iâve been calling for.â The UK has a ""red list"" of countries- from which
entry to the UK is banned â but the new outbreak appears to have been triggered
by an individual arriving from a country which wasnât on that list. Thomas-Symonds said it was âprecisely for this reason that
the so-called red list is not adequate to protect our bordersâ. He said he wanted the government to change course and âput it in place nowâ, although he added whether it would remain in place after 17 May â the earliest date international travel could start under Englandâs roadmap - would depend on the data at the time. He said the worst scenario was a variant entering the country
that badly affected the efficacy of the UKâs vaccines, adding that this was why it was âso
vitalâ that the government acted now. A return to normal opening hours for job centres puts users and staff ""in harm's way"", a union is warning. Job centres went back to their pre-lockdown hours yesterday, having previously been cut to 10am to 2pm. The PCS union says it will not rule out strike action, arguing the extension should be put back until Covid vaccines are ""fully rolled out"". It says staff have dealt successfully with benefits claimants via video link during the pandemic and says ""the vast bulk of the interviews now expected to be done face-to-face can still be carried out remotely"". General Secretary Mark Serwotka says: ""This reckless move by ministers is wholly unnecessary and risks putting both claimants and job centre staff in harm's way."" But the government says putting opening hours back to the normal 9am-5pm will help job centres give ""vital support to the most vulnerable"" in society. And a spokesman says Covid safety is taken ""extremely seriously"". Read more here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The UK has seen 150,000 deaths
involving coronavirus, according to figures released today by the Office for
National Statistics. These are different to the deaths
we hear about every day. The government daily figure only
counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This misses deaths that happen,
say, 30 days after a positive test or where there was no test. So the ONS figures are more
comprehensive: they look at death certificates that mention coronavirus as a
factor. But they take longer to arrive â
todayâs figures only include deaths registered up to the week of 2 April.  It has taken two and a half months to go from 100,000 deaths to 150,000. But things look very different compared to mid-January. Back then, things were getting worse quickly. We went from 100,000 to 125,000 in three short weeks. With the decreases we have seen since then, we can hope to see hundreds, rather than thousands of deaths in the coming weeks.  Allow YouTube content?

One of the biggest names in rock music, Sir Mick Jagger, has just released a song about the lockdown. The track, Eazy Sleazy,,externalwas written by Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick, and recorded in collaboration with another rock giant, Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters. The song begins with the lines: ""We took it on the chin, the numbers were so grim"" and the record label says Sir Mick goes on to reflect on Zoom calls, ""home in these prison
walls"" and too much TV. Sir Mick said: ""Itâs a song that I wrote about coming out of lockdown, with some much needed
optimism. ""Thanks to Dave Grohl for jumping on drums, bass and guitar, it was a
lot of fun working with him. Hope you all enjoy Eazy Sleazy.â Grohl added: Itâs
hard to put into words what recording this song with Sir Mick means to me. Itâs
beyond a dream come true. ""Just when I thought life couldnât get any
crazier... and itâs the song of the summer, without a doubt!!â South Africa has suspended the rollout of the Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccine while an investigation into possible blood clots takes place in the United States. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says this is a ""precautionary suspension"". US health authorities are calling for a pause in the use of the jab, after reports of extremely rare blood clotting cases. South Africa was the first country in the world to administer the jab, and nearly 300,000 health workers have received it since mid-February. A total of 40,107,877 vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's 32,250,481 first doses and 7,857,396 second doses. People aged 45 or over in England will now be invited to get a Covid jab,it was announced earlier. If you've not had yours yet,you can use our look-up tool to find out when you will get your vaccine. About half of students have been studying off campus - and all students will now return to a mix of face-to-face and online classes Students on all university courses in England will be able to return from 17 May at the earliest, the government has announced. It means a return to campuses for about a million students, who have only been able to study online since the Christmas holidays. Since the start of the year, only students on practical, hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching. Students will be offered Covid tests when they return for face-to-face classes, ""no earlier than 17 May"". University leaders had been lobbying for an earlier return - saying it was unfair to keep restrictions on campuses when shops were open. Read the latest here. There have been a further 23 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to government data.,external It means a total of 127,123 people have now died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. A total of 2,472 new cases were detected. Members of the public queue for a Covid testing centre in south London As we've reported, health authorities in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth are urging people to get tested, even if they have no symptoms, aftercases of the South African variant were found in the area. Experts are concerned that this variant - along with a few others - may be able to get round some of the protection given by vaccines. Danny Altmann, a professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, said he was worried by the news of the outbreak. ""It was always one of my nightmare scenarios, that just as we were being kind of coaxed to put a toe in the water of unlocking, something like this would come along,"" Prof Altmann toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""That really can scupper our plans if we let it get out of control."" Prof Altmann said he thought the response had been good - but ""there's so, so little margin for error"". ""You only have to miss a handful of cases and have them run riot through London, and then you're back where we were back in January, February 2020 with a whole new outbreak"". Asked whether he thought the UK's borders were too relaxed, the professor said we need to ""be a bit more like the countries like Vietnam and South Korea"" who have very tight border restrictions. And questioned on whether he thought it seemed strange that people in areas such as Lambeth were still going to the pub, he said: ""It does in a way."" This video can not be played Concern is growing in Brazil about the rising number of young people who are critically ill in hospital with Covid-19. Research suggests more than half of patients being treated in intensive care last month were under 40. The BBC's Mark Lowen visited Latin America's largest cemetery, a makeshift hospital and a vaccine hub to find out why the handling of the pandemic in Brazil has become a public health disaster. Jim ReedBBC health reporter A large queue of people lined up waiting to be tested in Brockwell Park, Lambeth Earlier,we brought you the news that surge testinghad begun in Wandsworth and Lambeth after an outbreak of the Covid-19 variant first identified in South Africa. It appears to have been triggered by an individual who travelled from Africa in February, according to documents seen by the BBC. The documents say that in Southwark - which is to the east, the neighbouring borough - they tested sewerage water there and found traces of the South African variant in one particular area. At the moment they don't know if it's related to these other outbreaks but they are sending in targeted surge testing in Southwark. The impression I get is that they are quite confident this is probably under control but not certain yet at this stage, which is why they have done this huge rollout of these tests to make sure that they're going to pick up people who are asymptomatic in particular. Big games at Wembley have been in front of empty stands throughout the pandemic Charities working with disabled people are criticising plans to exclude vulnerable football fans from being able to apply for tickets for the Carabao Cup final. It was announced earlier Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City will both be allowed 2,000 fans at Wembley for the final on 25 April. But under-18s, people who are clinically extremely vulnerable and pregnant women have been asked not to apply. Level Playing Field - a charity that campaigns for inclusive matchday experience and equal access for all disabled sports fans - says it is ""very disappointed"" by the decision. And Louise Rubin, head of policy and campaigns at disability equality charity
Scope, says: ""Disabled people have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic
and, as the UK begins to recover from coronavirus and open up again, they should
be able to access sport and other social events just in the same way as everyone
else. ""Disabled people should be able to make their own choice about what's right
for them, rather than being subject to arbitrary and discriminatory blanket
policies."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been approached
for a response. You can read more here. Portugal is currently in the process of easing out of its lockdown - but, senior officials have been told, this may need to be halted or reversed within two weeks. The country is a week into phase two of the government's roadmap for easing the lockdown imposed on 15 January, with all but the largest on-street shops allowed to open since last Monday, and cafes and restaurants open for outdoor dining. However, officials were told at an expert briefing that case numbers and the R number could soon breach thresholds the government has said would make it necessary to halt or even reverse course, the BBC's Alison Roberts reports. ""With this level of growth and a rate close to 71 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the time to reach the line of 120 is between two weeks and one month,"" Baltazar Nunes, a biostatistician at the National Health Institute (INSA), says. He adds the Algarve, Madeira and Azores regions have already breached this threshold. The R rate, he adds, has also shown a ""systematic increase"" in recent days, with the most recent official figure - for 8 April - being 1.09. The Department for Education (DfE) pledged to provide 1.3 million laptops and tablets to disadvantaged pupils at the start of the pandemic - and is very close to the target, but has not yet reached it, new data suggests. The DfE figures show that a total of 1,295,752 laptops and tablets have been delivered or dispatched to support children to access remote education since the start of the pandemic. Overall, 733,331 devices have been sent to councils, academy trusts, schools and colleges across England since the most recent lockdown began on 4 January. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says: ""The government has been promising for months that it would deliver 1.3 million laptops to schools and we are now tantalisingly close to seeing that target achieved. ""We do not underestimate the scale of the government's logistical operation but the truth is they were slow to react in the first place, slow to get started and progress since has been painfully slow."" The DfE has said it is in contact with local authorities, schools and colleges to encourage them to order their allocated devices if they have not yet done so. A pub landlord says his staff are having to police people who try to bend coronavirus rules by booking extra tables. Covid restrictions mean venues can only serve customers sitting outdoors in groups of up to six people or from two households. James Linder of The Eagle in Norwich says: ""We've had people try to book under different names to try to form large groups - we've had to catch them out, which is not great. ""With the greatest will in the world, they start mingling between the tables after a couple of drinks and forming one group."" He says he has to turn tables away which loses money and upsets staff. ""They don't want to be going in and policing people,"" he says. Trade bodyUK Hospitality,externalsays: ""We need people to stick by the rules."" Read more on this storyhere. From Friday people will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings The latest announcement on Scotland's journey out of lockdown means people will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings fromFriday. People will also be permitted to travel across Scotland as long as they do not stay overnight. All remaining shops and close-contact services such as nail salons are due to reopen on26 April. Pubs, restaurants and bars will be able to serve people outdoors - in groups of up to six from three households - until 22:00 from that date. Alcohol will be permitted, and there will be no requirement for food to be served. There will also be a partial resumption of indoor hospitality - food and non-alcoholic drinks can be served until 20:00 for groups of up to four people from no more than two households. Contact details will still need to be collected. Here are dates for when more of the current rules will be relaxed. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Nepal rhino numbers rise in 'exciting' milestoneThe greater one-horned rhino came close to extinction, but a new count gives reasons to be cheerful.Asia","Greater one-horned rhinos are counted every five years in Nepal - and the latest census held some good news The number of one-horned rhinos in Nepal's wildlife sanctuaries has increased by more than a hundred, marking a positive milestone in the Himalayan nation's conservation efforts. According to the results of the latest census, Nepal's rhino population has risen to 752, from 645 in 2015. Nepal is among only a few countries where greater one-horned rhinos are found. The animal was close to extinction in the last century, andits revival in Nepal and India is regarded as one of the greatest conservation success stories in Asia,external. ""We are very excited by the rhino survey's findings. After the tigers, now the rhino population has also gone up,"" Haribhadra Acharya, a senior official at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, told the BBC. Of the total number of rhinos, more than 90% live in the Chitwan National Park, which is also home to tigers, elephants, leopards and Gangetic gharials (fish-eating crocodiles). Following the population increase in recent decades, the rhino's status has improved from endangered to vulnerable. The rhinos share their habitat with several other species Nepali officials said the coronavirus pandemic had helped the animals and their habitat in some ways, as lockdowns gave the rhinos chance to roam freely without tourists following them. On the other hand, poachers have also exploited the situation by killing four rhinos in the past year. The rhino census was due to be conducted in 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic. The counting is held once every five years to monitor their status in the wild. Around 350 experts and forest department officials travelled deep into the forest for about three weeks to tally the rhinos based on a visual headcount. The estimates are based on unique identifying features like sex, size, horn, ear shapes and skin folds. The census certainly wasn't without its difficulties.

""From a biological point of view, the percentage of growth of rhinos has decreased in the last six years if you compare it with the previous census period"" said rhino biologist Naresh Subedi, the spokesperson for the National Trust for Nature Conservation. The annual rhino population growth between 2011 and 2015 was 5%. But the latest survey shows the figure has dropped to around 3%. Experts attribute this mainly to an unprecedented increase in the number of deaths due to natural causes - like old age, territorial fights, drowning during flooding and disease. Around 160 rhinos have died since 2015. Some rhinos were even swept from Nepal to India by flooding in recent years. Rhino swept from Nepal to India goes home Nepal has worked hard to limit the impact of war and human migration on its precious conservation projects. Once the country was home to a thousand rhinos, but due to political unrest and mass settlement of people around the Chitwan National Park in the 1950s and 60s, their numbers dwindled. Poaching, deforestation and encroachment of habitat led to their decline. A decade later, the numbers fell to less than a hundred, triggering alarm. The rhino population started to rise following strict anti-poaching measures and protection of forest areas in the subsequent decades. But the 10-year civil war between Nepal's security forces and local Maoist rebels that ended in 2006 had a devastating impact on the wildlife. Poachers exploited the unrest and killed hundreds of animals for their horns. Rhinos are hunted for their horns - but there is no scientific proof the substance works in medicines The World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) says the rhinos are hunted because their horn is used in traditional East Asian medicines - though there is no scientific proof of its medicinal value. ""We didn't have enough manpower to safeguard the forest and the poachers also had more advanced weapons. Once the civil war ended, we adopted a multi-pronged strategy to curb poaching,"" Ananath Baral, the chief conservation officer at Chitwan Park told the BBC. The government deployed hundreds of Nepali soldiers inside the parks, and local communities were enlisted to disrupt the poaching network. Police also launched a drive against those involved in illegal wildlife trafficking. As rhino numbers increased, tourism also picked up - creating valuable income. The authorities said they had invested up to 40% of the revenue from the park in development projects in nearby villages. Then the wildlife department wanted to create a viable rhino population in other parks. From the mid-1980s, they moved more than 80 rhinos from Chitwan Park to the Bardiya sanctuary, but numbers there fell drastically - mainly due to poaching. Nepal's rhino hunters become the hunted Beyond Chitwan, other sanctuaries have not been so successful in increasing their rhino populations. According to the latest census, Bardiya is now home to 38 rhinos. Shuklaphanta National Park has 17, and Parsa Park has only three. This video can not be played Anbarasan Ethirajan goes on patrol with an anti-poaching team in Nepal protecting the one-horned rhino While the increasing rhino population is a positive conservation story, concerns remain over how to maintain their numbers in limited forest areas. ""It is going to be a huge challenge,"" Gana Gurung, country representative of the WWF for Nepal told the BBC.  ""Both tigers and rhinos need vast areas to roam around as their populations increase.

Nepal rhino numbers rise in 'exciting' milestone,"Greater one-horned rhinos are counted every five years in Nepal - and the latest census held some good news The number of one-horned rhinos in Nepal's wildlife sanctuaries has increased by more than a hundred, marking a positive milestone in the Himalayan nation's conservation efforts. According to the results of the latest census, Nepal's rhino population has risen to 752, from 645 in 2015. Nepal is among only a few countries where greater one-horned rhinos are found. The animal was close to extinction in the last century, andits revival in Nepal and India is regarded as one of the greatest conservation success stories in Asia,external. ""We are very excited by the rhino survey's findings. After the tigers, now the rhino population has also gone up,"" Haribhadra Acharya, a senior official at the Department of National Parks and Wildlife Conservation, told the BBC. Of the total number of rhinos, more than 90% live in the Chitwan National Park, which is also home to tigers, elephants, leopards and Gangetic gharials (fish-eating crocodiles). Following the population increase in recent decades, the rhino's status has improved from endangered to vulnerable. The rhinos share their habitat with several other species Nepali officials said the coronavirus pandemic had helped the animals and their habitat in some ways, as lockdowns gave the rhinos chance to roam freely without tourists following them. On the other hand, poachers have also exploited the situation by killing four rhinos in the past year. The rhino census was due to be conducted in 2020 but was postponed due to the pandemic. The counting is held once every five years to monitor their status in the wild. Around 350 experts and forest department officials travelled deep into the forest for about three weeks to tally the rhinos based on a visual headcount. The estimates are based on unique identifying features like sex, size, horn, ear shapes and skin folds. The census certainly wasn't without its difficulties.

Italian man admits Â£26m celebrity raidsA series of burglaries targeted the west London homes of multimillionaire celebrities.,"The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were broken into in December 2019 An Italian man has been convicted over his role in one of the biggest domestic burglaries in English legal history. Watches and jewellery belonging to Frank Lampard, Tamara Ecclestone and the late Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were among the items taken during a series of burglaries in December 2019. Alessandro Donati, 43, from Milan, pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court to conspiracy to burgle. He will be sentenced at a later date. Donati was arrested in Italy under a European Arrest Warrant in October and extradited to the UK the following month. With the assistance of an Italian interpreter, he admitted to conspiring to burgle dwellings between 30 November 2019 and 18 December 2019. The home of the former Chelsea manager and England international Mr Lampard was the first to be raided on 1 December. Tamara Ecclestone's Kensington mansion was raided on 13 December 2019 as she flew out for a Christmas family holiday A diamond watch, cufflinks and a clock worth an estimated Â£60,000 were taken. Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the Srivaddhanaprabha family was targeted. It was duty free billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's home before his death in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium in October 2018. This time, 400,000 euros in cash was taken, as well as expensive watches. The final burglary, on the palatial home near Kensington Palace that socialite Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland, saw about Â£25m worth of valuables stolen. Ms Ecclestone, the daughter of ex-Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, was on a Christmas family holiday in Lapland with Mr Rutland, their daughter and their dog at the time. Judge Martin Edmunds QC remanded Donati in custody ahead of a sentencing date yet to be fixed.

Breaking|Breaking newsUS troops 'to leave Afghanistan by 11 September'US President Joe Biden set to announce troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September - media reportsUS & Canada,"The announcement means the US will miss a May deadline for a pull-out agreed with the Taliban last year US President Joe Biden is set to announce that American troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September, officials have told US media. The US would miss a May deadline for a pull-out agreed with the Taliban by the Trump administration last year. The new deadline would coincide with the 20th anniversary of the terror attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon in the US in 2001. Mr Biden had previously said the 1 May deadline would be tough to meet. US and Nato officials have said the Taliban, a hardline Islamist movement, have so far failed to live up to commitments to reduce violence. The president is due to make the announcement himself on Wednesday. Afghans face pivotal moment as US 'closes the book' A 'moonshot' plan for peace in Afghanistan A year of violence on the road to peace The UK is now expected to withdraw 750 British soldiers stationed in Afghanistan by September, with Nato likely to pull its forces out collectively. German Defence Minister Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer told ARD public television early on Wednesday: ""We always said: we'll go in together, we'll leave together. I am for an orderly withdrawal, and that is why I assume that we (Nato) will agree to that today."" The Taliban have been warned that if they attack US troops during the pull-out phase, they ""will be met with a forceful response"", a senior US official told reporters. Mr Biden had decided a hasty withdrawal that would put US forces at risk was not a viable option, the official added. At the same time, a review of US choices determined that now was the time to close the book on the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan to focus on more acute threats. The Afghan government has not yet responded officially, but the speaker of the Afghan parliament, Mir Rahman Rahmani, warned that the withdrawal of foreign forces in the current circumstances would lead to civil war. By Secunder Kermani, Afghanistan correspondent Many here will see this decision as a boost to the Taliban, despite it being a breach of the 1 May deadline the insurgents have insisted is adhered to. It seems unlikely they would now resume attacks on American forces given the short extension period; nevertheless, the Taliban reaction so far has been hostile. Some in the Afghan government had hoped the new Biden administration would adopt a more ""conditions-based"" approach to the peace process. Instead, that has been explicitly ruled out. The slow pace of talks between Afghan and Taliban negotiators so far suggests it will be difficult to reach a power-sharing arrangement before US troops are withdrawn. Perhaps the Taliban's desire for international legitimacy will lead them to compromise. But many fear the Taliban will be tempted to wait out the withdrawal, and then push for outright victory or at least dominance. The Afghan government has until now remained reliant on US air strikes to help hold the insurgents back. The Taliban said on Tuesday that it will now not attend a summit on Afghanistan's future, due to be held in Turkey later this month, until all foreign forces leave the country. ""Until all foreign forces completely withdraw from our homeland, [we] will not participate in any conference that shall make decisions about Afghanistan,""Mohammad Naeem, spokesman for the Taliban office in Qatar, tweeted,external. US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin are expected to brief Nato allies on the decision in the Belgian capital, Brussels, on Wednesday. The United States has spent trillions of dollars and lost more than 2,000 service members since 2001 in what has been its longest war. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? (2019 report) The deal signed in February last yearsaid the US and its Nato allies would withdraw all troops in 14 months if the Taliban upheld its promises, including not allowing al-Qaeda or other militants to operate in areas it controlled and proceeding with national peace talks. As a condition of starting negotiations with the Afghan government, the Taliban also demanded the release of thousands of their men in a prisoner swap. Direct talks then began in Doha in September 2020, but a breakthrough has still not been reached. Who are the Taliban? The Afghan war: The short and long story Although the group stopped attacks on international forces as part of the historic agreement, it has continued to fight the Afghan government. Last month, the Taliban threatened to resume hostilities against foreign troops still in the country on 1 May. There are fears that if foreign military forces withdraw before a lasting agreement is reached, the Taliban might seize power.

"Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting'Bill Crothers' position was ""agreed"" to by the Cabinet Office, a letter from a lobbying watchdog reveals.UK Politics","Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital A top civil servant joined financial firm Greensill Capital as an adviser while still working for the government, a lobbying watchdog has revealed. Bill Crothers's part-time position had been ""agreed"" to by the Cabinet Office, the Office of the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments added. Its chairman Lord Pickles complained of a ""lack of transparency"" over the situation. But Mr Crothers said he had been taken on by Greensill in a ""transparent"" way. Labour called his dual employment ""extraordinary and shocking"". Johnson urged to launch 'full' Cameron inquiry Analysis: Review into lobbying may change little David Cameron and Greensill: What's it all about? The disclosure about Mr Crothers - who had been the government's chief procurement officer prior to being taken on by Greensill - is the latest of several stories involving the now-collapsed financial firm. It employed former prime minister David Cameron as an adviser from 2018. The Financial Times and the Sunday Times revealed that Mr Cameron had contacted several ministers, including Chancellor Rishi Sunak, to push for greater involvement in government loans schemes for the company. Boris Johnson has set up an inquiry into lobbying - attempts to persuade governments to change policy - including Greensill's role. Government sources said this would also now look at the situation surrounding Mr Crothers. Lord Pickles is asking for Whitehall ""guidance"" on possible ""conflicts of interest"" Mr Crothers, who had already left his job as chief procurement officer but remained a Civil Service employee, joined Greensill as an adviser to its board in September 2015. The letter from Conservative peer Lord Pickles to leading civil servant Alex Chisholm says: ""This was agreed by the Cabinet Office under its internal conflicts-of-interest policy."" Lord Pickles asks for ""guidance on the conflicts-of-interest process"" undertaken. The letter adds: ""The lack of transparency around this part-time employment with Greensill may have left the misleading impression that Mr Crothers had wilfully ignored the obligation to seek advice."" Mr Crothers left the Civil Service in November 2015, two months after taking up his role at Greensill. He became a director of the firm in late 2016. A letter from Mr Crothers to Lord Pickles, a former Conservative Party chairman, written earlier this week, has also been published. In it, he says: ""I am concerned that there may be a view that I did not follow proper process regarding my role with Greensill Capital. ""I assure you that I completely respect the required process and your office, took steps to comply, and believe that I did so."" He adds: ""I was transparent about the move to Greensill Capital, and it was well known at the time."" The shadow Cabinet Office minister Rachel Reeves said: ""This is an extraordinary and shocking revelation. ""The Conservatives have weakened the rules so much they may as well rip them up and start again."" The government inquiry in to lobbying is expected to report  by the end of June, but Labour says it does not go far enough. It will use an opposition day debate on Wednesday to force a vote on whether to establish a new Commons select committee to investigate the issue. Unlike regular opposition day votes which are symbolic, this one would be binding if it passes because Parliament would be deciding if it should do something. A Cabinet Office spokesperson said there would be a response to Mr Pickles's letter ""in due course"". They added that the ""review into Greensill Capital and supply-chain finance"" would be ""wide-ranging"". Mr Cameron has said he did not break any codes of conduct or rules on lobbying and that he welcomes the investigation launched by Mr Johnson.

Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead.

"Executive to pay for Troubles pension schemeA formal pledge is made to pay for the scheme, which could cost up to Â£1.2bn over 20 years.Northern Ireland","Stormont's Executive Office has formally pledged to pay for a Troubles pension scheme, a court has been told. The Department of Finance will make the necessary funding available to ensure eligible victims and survivors receive compensation. The move was expected after agreement was reached earlier this month on this coming year's budget. The estimated outlay for the scheme, over the next 20 years, could be up to Â£1.2bn. Belfast High Court had been hearing a case brought by Brian Turley, one ofthose known as the Hooded Men, who were detained and subjected to special interrogation methods by the British military in the early 1970s. He brought the case seeking a judgement to ensure a financial package was put in place. In correspondence to the High Court, the Department of Finance has guaranteed payments will be made. The Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives A letter sent on behalf of the Executive Office stated that ""the payment is an entitlement as indicated by the court, and regardless of whether it comes from Westminster or from our block grant, it will be paid when it is due"". It added that First Minister Arlene Foster, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill and Finance Minister Conor Murphy ""undertake on behalf of their respective departments that payments will be made to successful applicants"". When the Department of Justice requests funding, the Executive Office is to be provided with the required money by the Department of Finance ""without delay"". ""The Executive Office will then, on receipt of such funding, make the necessary grants to the Department of Justice in response to its requests for funding,"" the letter stated. Discussions between Stormont and the Northern Ireland Office are continuing over whether there will be any additional funding from London to help foot costs. The letter added: ""Ministers will continue to progress financial discussions with the Northern Ireland Office on the basis that it remains their shared view that the scheme should be funded by the Westminster government as an addition to the block grant, and in a manner consistent with the Statement of Funding Policy."" Lord Chief Justice Sir Declan Morgan agreed that a ""satisfactory"" undertaking had been received by the court. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former NI secretary Julian Smith described the move as ""very good news"" and said the executive ""ultimately took the right decision"". The court undertaking provides certainty to the thousands who will apply for a pension. There was inevitability about what has just happened becauseearlier this year the court ruled that Stormont was liable for the scheme, Political agreement of the 2021-22 Stormont budget also paved the way for Monday's undertaking. But it does not settle a behind-the-scenes dispute between Belfast and London. Some NI ministers have questioned the pension's affordability without extra cash coming from the British government. Negotiations continue over Stormont's request for additional cash outside the block grant to help foot the bill. Thousands of people who were physically or mentally injured on a permanent basis will apply for sums of up to Â£10,000 a year. The Troubles claimed more than 3,500 lives and the Northern Ireland Office has estimated another 40,000 people were injured. The Troubles explained,external The pensions scheme was drawn up in 2019 by the UK government, when the Stormont assembly was not functioning. The scheme aims to provide pension-like payments to victims of the Troubles, every year for the rest of their lives, with payments ranging from Â£2,000 to Â£10,000. Upon their death, a spouse or carer will get the payments for a further 10 years. Victims will be eligible to apply if they were injured in an incident at any point between 1 January 1966 and 12 April 2010 Victims will be eligible to apply if they were injured in an incident at any point between 1 January 1966 and 12 April 2010, the date that responsibility for policing and justice was devolved to Stormont. That can be physical injury, such as a loss of limbs, or psychological, caused by being present at a bombing, for example. The scheme will also be open to those injured in incidents that took place outside Northern Ireland. The pensions will be backdated to 2014 - the date when they were first agreed, in principle, by the Stormont parties under the Fresh Start Agreement. Older victims, over the age of 60, may opt to receive a lump sum rather than annual payments. A judge-led board will decide who qualifies for the scheme, with the government insisting it would only apply to people who were injured ""through no fault of their own"". Alan McBride of the Wave Trauma Centre, whose wife Sharon was killed in the 1993 IRA Shankill bomb, said the campaign for the pension started 13 years ago. ""The uncertainty that surrounded this pension was increasing the trauma for people that have been campaigning for this,"" he said. ""We've lost about four or five members in that time through ill health and old age, so to have this over the line is a really, really good news story."" First Minister Arlene Foster said it was a ""very welcome day"" for those set to benefit from the pension, adding that ""the uncertainty for victims is now over"". ""It has been a deeply frustrating journey towards this point, but I welcome that we have finally achieved agreement to confirm that the pension will be paid when it falls due to recipients,"" she said. Ulster Unionist Doug Beattie said the negotiations for extra cash may continue but ""injured victims should not be punished any longer"". ""The executive must move immediately to provide certainty around application and payment dates, as well as how those who have waited longest might be prioritised within the scheme,"" he said. SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly welcomed the news but said that there would be many victims and survivors who ""will be wary of accepting the words of politicians"". ""People who have suffered severe physical and mental injury over the course of conflict here have waited for far too long for recognition and redress,"" she said, adding that the first and deputy first ministers must now set out what will happen next.

NI Assembly pays tribute to Prince Philip,"The Duke of Edinburgh on a visit to Harland and Wolff in July 1977 Tributes have been paid to Prince Philip during a special sitting of the Northern Ireland Assembly. Assembly members met at midday and put on record their condolences to the Royal Family. The union flag is flying at half mast from Parliament Buildings until the end of this week. Prince Philip, Queen Elizabeth II's husband,died on Friday, aged 99, and his funeralwill take place on Saturday. Speaker Alex Maskey, of Sinn FÃ©in, opened tributes by saying Prince Philip had a record of public service to which few could compare. He also paid tribute to him for establishing the Duke of Edinburgh Awards. ""His priority was on opening the door for young people to participate, whatever their background,"" he said. He also paid tribute to the ""reconciliation efforts"" over the years. Prince Philip's 73-year association with NI Northern Ireland pays tribute to Prince Philip In Pictures: Prince Philip in Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster said Prince Philip's service had been carried out with ""dedication, humanity and humour"". ""A sometimes blunt humour, which we got to appreciate here, on his many occasions when he visited Northern Ireland,"" she said. A gun salute took place at Hillsborough Castle in County Down marking Prince Philip's death Mrs Foster said he ""redefined the role of a royal"" and his work with the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) was ""literally decades ahead of its time"". She said more than two million people had secured a Duke of Edinburgh Award, and more people from Northern Ireland had participated in the scheme than any other part of the UK. ""A true intergenerational legacy to our youth, our United Kingdom and the world's environment,"" Mrs Foster said. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said there had been ""significant interventions"" over the past two decades by the Royal Family to assist in the building of relationships between Britain and Ireland. ""I acknowledge that the Queen and Prince Philip and their family were directly impacted by the conflict and regrettably endured sorrow and pain as a result of their personal loss and their bereavement,"" she said. Michelle O'Neill acknowledges the impact of Northern Ireland's conflict on the Royal Family ""Yet having endured such personal loss, the Royal Family set about working towards advancing peace and reconciliation."" The IRA murdered the Queen's cousin, Lord Louis Mountbatten, in the Republic of Ireland in 1979. Infrastructure Minister and SDLP MLA Nichola Mallon said the prince had a part to play in ""sustaining the new bond of shared endeavour across these islands"". ""We should also reflect on the role that he played alongside Queen Elizabeth in building relationships, setting aside enmity and promoting reconciliation, most visibly during their recent visit to Ireland,"" she said. The Queen and Prince Philip met Martin McGuinness, the then deputy first minister, in Belfast in 2012 Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) leader Steve Aiken said Prince Philip had ""garnered so much respect and affection"" and he ""was a great friend to Northern Ireland"" who was ""greatly saddened by the horrors of the Troubles"". He also paid tribute to Ms O'Neill and the SDLP for their remarks regarding the duke's death. ""While we may disagree on much, those are welcome sentiments,"" he said. ""I appreciate your sympathy and reaching out to those of us who hold the union and monarchy dear."" Justice Minister and Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said Prince Philip demonstrated what it ""means to be a supportive husband to a powerful woman"". ""He was a reformer and moderniser of the Royal Household as he encouraged more informality and less protocol and engagements, and also promoted the use of new technology, particularly television,"" she said. ""His work spanned his patronage of many charities at home and abroad."" The Green Party's Rachael Woods said he would be dearly missed by his grandchildren. ""The duke's passing reminds us to appreciate and treasure our grandparents and families when we can."" Prince Philip at Hillsborough Castle during his last official visit to Northern Ireland in 2017 Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) leader Jim Allister said there would now be ""difficult, tough days for the Queen"". ""I do pray that she finds the strength to carry on in the remarkable era that has been her rule over us,"" he said. The Duke of Edinburgh was the longest-serving royal consort in British history. On Saturday,a 41-gun salute echoed across County Down from Hillsborough Castle, the Queen's official residence in Northern Ireland. Politicians around UK to pay tribute to Philip In Scotland, political parties suspended their campaigning on Friday for the Scottish Parliament election following the announcement of Prince Philip's death. The main political parties in Wales also said they would suspend campaigning for the 6 May Senedd election. Tributes to the duke are to be paid in the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments on Monday. The House of Commons, which was supposed to be on its Easter break until Tuesday, is being recalled a day early, with MPs giving their tributes to the duke from 14:30 BST. A period of national mourning will end after 17 April, when Prince Philip's funeral will take place at St George's Chapel, in the grounds of Windsor Castle. A national minute's silence will be held to coincide with the start of the funeral at 15:00 BST.

Italian man admits Â£26m celebrity raids,"The homes of Frank and Christine Lampard, Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and Tamara Ecclestone and her husband were broken into in December 2019 An Italian man has been convicted over his role in one of the biggest domestic burglaries in English legal history. Watches and jewellery belonging to Frank Lampard, Tamara Ecclestone and the late Leicester City chairman Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha were among the items taken during a series of burglaries in December 2019. Alessandro Donati, 43, from Milan, pleaded guilty at Isleworth Crown Court to conspiracy to burgle. He will be sentenced at a later date. Donati was arrested in Italy under a European Arrest Warrant in October and extradited to the UK the following month. With the assistance of an Italian interpreter, he admitted to conspiring to burgle dwellings between 30 November 2019 and 18 December 2019. The home of the former Chelsea manager and England international Mr Lampard was the first to be raided on 1 December. Tamara Ecclestone's Kensington mansion was raided on 13 December 2019 as she flew out for a Christmas family holiday A diamond watch, cufflinks and a clock worth an estimated Â£60,000 were taken. Then on 10 December, a Knightsbridge property belonging to the Srivaddhanaprabha family was targeted. It was duty free billionaire Leicester City owner Mr Srivaddhanaprabha's home before his death in a helicopter crash outside the King Power Stadium in October 2018. This time, 400,000 euros in cash was taken, as well as expensive watches. The final burglary, on the palatial home near Kensington Palace that socialite Ms Ecclestone shares with her husband Jay Rutland, saw about Â£25m worth of valuables stolen. Ms Ecclestone, the daughter of ex-Formula 1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, was on a Christmas family holiday in Lapland with Mr Rutland, their daughter and their dog at the time. Judge Martin Edmunds QC remanded Donati in custody ahead of a sentencing date yet to be fixed.

"Pub-reopening caution 'isn't a bad thing'In England you can drink outside pubs now, something you cannot do in Wales for another fortnight.WalesComments","Streets in Soho, London, were packed as pubs were allowed to open outdoors in England on Monday Reopening pubs too soon could run the risk of ""undoing all the good"" during lockdown, an infectious disease expert has said. Beer gardens reopened in England on Monday, but in Wales industry experts have expressed frustration they cannot open until 26 April. Dr Mike Tildesley said it was important lockdown was eased gradually to stop a spike in coronavirus cases. The Welsh government said it was taking ""a careful step-by-step approach"". England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days Early queues as Wales' shops reopen after lockdown Q&A: What are the new Covid travel rules in Wales? Dr Tildesley, who is part of a modelling group which advises the UK government on the pandemic, said he understood people were ""frustrated"" at the different timetables out of lockdown. However, he said a cautious approach was needed for the next few weeks to prevent a third wave, in the hope ""we can get back to normal by summer"". ""We need to remember that these are paced at a rate that the vaccinations can keep up with us and can help us along the way,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. More than half the people in Waleshave now had their first Covid-19 vaccination dose, and Covid admissions to hospitals in Wales have hit record low levels. Dr Tildesley said while things were moving in the right direction, scientists needed to monitor the impact of relaxing other restrictions on case rates, before reopening other parts of life. This video can not be played Stores in Wales reopen to queues of eager shoppers On Monday shoppers queued as non-essential shopsreopened in Wales for the first time since they were forced to close in the run-up to Christmas. ""The key thing is we need to take it at a gradual rate so we can ensure that we can reopen safely... we are doing well, but if we go too fast we run the risk of too much mixing, and undoing all the good we have done so far,"" he said. While he said cases could go up as people began mixing again and going back to their daily lives, the progress of the vaccine should help avoid a ""significant resurgence"". Dr Tildesley urged people to be cautious for a few more weeks, adding the biggest concern was that if there was a spoke in cases the virus could mutate. ""We are not quite out of the woods yet, in the not too distant future we will be in a position where we can meet people... and hug our friends and family again, but we are not there yet,"" he said. John Turner is landlord of a pub on the Wales-England border which means he is just a few minutes away from an open pub One landlord, whose pub is on the border said it was ""frustrating"" remaining closed until 26 April when outdoorhospitality opened on Monday in England. John Turner said two other pubs in his village - that are technically in England - had now reopened. But Mr Turner, who runs the Dolphin Inn, in Llanymynech, on the Powys-Shropshire border, said Wales was ""always two weeks behind England"" and he was anxious to open again. On Monday,the border reopened between Wales and Englandand people are now allowed to travel in both directions. Once in England, you can visit a pub or cafe garden with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households. However, some people have agreed with Dr Tildesley's view and expressed relief pubs remain closed in Wales. Garfield Doc Oakleeffe posted on Facebook: ""After seeing the footage of the lack of social distancing when drinking in Soho, I think slow and cautious is better."" Sian Louise said: ""I know it's horrible to not be open and I feel for businesses, I really do as I was getting annoyed with it all, but by looking how this last lockdown went and how it started I actually understand why [Mark Drakeford is] doing it slowly, because we don't want another lockdown and we don't want anymore people getting seriously ill either. ""Hopefully, in time we will come out better and safer by doing it gradually."" Michelle Murphy commented: ""I am so glad they are still closed. If this is what it is going to be like, no wonder they predict a third wave."" Kerry Lea Edwards did not understand the ""urgency to be back in the pub"", adding: ""If it's the social side you can meet outdoors in your garden with your friends and have a drink. ""Surely it's not worth the risk - we will be in another lockdown before we know it, very sad."" John Turner said he was looking forward to pubs opening after ""a year of being two weeks behind England"" Mr Turner said: ""The firebreak [lockdown] was going to be the saviour for Christmas and then I didn't even imagine we would miss out on Easter as well. ""An extra two weeks' trade will be lost once again to England."" He added that even when pubs in Wales can reopen, it could be a struggle only being able to serve outside because of ""the weather element"". While he has used some of his government support to put up a marquee, and purchase heaters and furniture, he said other pubs might not be able to keep up. He said he was anxious to make the money back to make the new equipment worthwhile. ""People are desperate to get to the pub. I am hopeful we will be full and I'm looking forward to being busy again because otherwise it will be harder and more disappointing,"" he said. Emma McClarkin said a lack of outdoor space was already a barrier to many pubs and bars Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association (WBPA), said pubs across Wales were ""hugely disappointed"" to not open on Monday alongside England. She said pubs in Wales having to wait another two weeks while pubs in England were trading outdoors was ""a bitter pill to swallow"". Ms McClarkin said: ""Vaccination rates continue to climb while case rates are falling week on week. Even when they will be allowed to open, we still think about 60% of pubs in Wales will be unable to because of a lack of usable outside space. ""The Welsh government need to recognise that and bring forward a package of funding as soon as possible that will prevent hundreds of Welsh pubs being lost for good."" In England, you can meet in a pub or cafe gardens with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households The Welsh government said it had provided more than Â£2bn of funding to support businesses impacted by the pandemic, safeguarding 165,000 Welsh jobs. A spokesperson said tourism and hospitality businesses would continue to receive cash grants this month to help them through until the reopening date in May. ""Businesses will therefore see no interruption in the flow of financial support, as we move cautiously to relax public health restrictions,"" they said. ""Another Â£200m in additional support for business has already been earmarked in the Final Budget 2021-22. ""Ministers have had a constructive meeting with representatives from the hospitality sector and Welsh government officials will work with them on options for a further support package to be put to the new government following May's Senedd election."" A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said many would question the decision not to move forward the reopening of beer gardens after scenes like those seen inCardiff Bay, where crowds gathered to drink over the bank holiday weekend. ""A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option,"" the spokesperson said. ""Likewise, the lack of clear date on indoor hospitality remains a major problem and at the very least the government should urgently revisit its decision to delay any additional financial support until after election."" Leader of the Welsh Conservative group Andrew RT Davies, said the Welsh government's decision was about politics not science, and lost trade meant ""lost livelihoods in Wales"". ""After a crippling 12 months for businesses, Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay seem to have a tin ear to these concerns. Welsh Conservatives would cut the border games, end the confusion, and get Wales on the road to recovery with a safe, consistent and one-nation approach,"" he said. The Welsh Liberal Democrats said: ""Lockdown is frustrating but we all need to stay safe and follow the regulations. ""If we do, we will not need to enter a lockdown again and that is the the most important thing. We've seen before what happened when lockdowns were eased too quickly.""

UK exports to EU rebound after January's slump,"Trade between the UK and EU partially recovered in February, after a steep drop in January following Brexit. Official figures,externalshow exports to the EU jumped by 46.6%, Â£3.7bn, to Â£11.6bn, following January's 42% slump when firms struggled with new trade rules. However, the Office for National Statistics said exports were still below last year's levels and imports from the EU had seen a weaker recovery. Other figures from the ONS,externalshowed the UK economy grew by 0.4% in February. The UK's statistics body said the economy was still 7.8% smaller than a year earlier, before the impact of the pandemic. Last month's trade figures were the first since new trading rules came into force as a result of Brexit trade rule changes. Both the ONS and business analysts said the drop in trade flows was partly caused by stockpiling in December 2020, as businesses tried to get ahead of the introduction of the new rules, depressing trade in January. In addition, the end of the temporary trading arrangement between the UK and the EU coincided with the discovery of a new strain of Covid-19 in the UK, which caused further complications and delays, after lorry drivers were required to take tests before crossing the border at the English Channel. This video can not be played Brexit: The impact on Dutch food exports to the UK An ONS spokesperson said: ""Exports to the EU recovered significantly from their January fall, though still remain below 2020 levels. However, imports from the EU are yet to significantly rebound, with a number of issues hampering trade."" The Federation of Small Businesses said overall sales had dropped by Â£2.5bn and its members needed more help. Chairman Mike Cherry said: ""UK exports have tumbled since the end of the [Brexit] transition period. ""International sales are way down on where they were at this time last year. A fifth of small exporters have halted sales to the EU temporarily and some have already given up on selling into the bloc on a permanent basis."" But a government spokesperson said the statistics showed ""welcome growth"" in the value of trade with the EU in February. ""This is in line with our predictions last month as we saw increasing volumes of freight traffic to and from the EU. ""The vast majority of traders and hauliers have adapted well, and our focus now is on making sure that any business that is still facing challenges gets the support they need to trade effectively with the EU."" UK imports from the EU rose by 7.3%, or Â£1.2bn in February to Â£17.1bn, after dropping 29.7% the month before. The ONS said the export increases were driven by machinery, transport equipment and chemicals. The ONS said it was too early to make any conclusions about the impact of the new trading arrangements with Europe. Total imports of goods from non-EU countries rose by 10.2% to Â£17.9bn in February, while exports fell by 10.5% to Â£12.7bn. Mark Callaghan is the chief executive of British Corner Shop, an exporter of British food and drink brands. British Corner Shop chief executive Mark Callaghan says his firm has seen a huge disruption to exports from Brexit He says his firm ""battled"" to find a solution to continue to export its products, particularly on the consumer channel into the EU. British Corner Shop had to cut its product range down from 10,000 to 1,400, and is planning to open its own distribution centre in the EU. This means the loss of 40 jobs in the UK, and the new centre will see 60 new jobs in the EU. ""We were jumping with joy when Boris announced in late December that there was a deal with the EU and it would be trade as normal, so we were very excited about that,"" he told the BBC. ""[It would mean] minimal disruption for the business, but that hasn't been the case. ""We've seen huge disruption, we've seen a massive drop in sales, we've had to reduce our workforce by 40 people and we're moving those jobs into the EU, so I wouldn't say that it's been successful at all."" After a 42% plunge in January in sales to the EU, February's bounce back of 46.6% is more the kind of figure the government would like associated with Global Britain's new trading era. But just as the earlier figures weren't conclusive evidence that the new arrangements for trading with Europe posed a widespread sustained problem, the latest ones don't mean it's back to business as usual either. Many companies avoided sending goods across the border in the previous month, for fear of disruption or delay, having shipped orders ahead of time where they could. Both January's fall and February's rebound were led by non-perishable items - chemicals, machinery - which are easily stockpiled . That trade resumed in February, while many other exporters managed to get to grips with the new formalities. But export levels remain below where they were for much of 2020, and anecdotal evidence suggests some exporters - particularly those of fresh foods - remain overwhelmed by the new checks and forms. They are urging the government to help simplify processes. Meanwhile the pandemic continues to weigh on demand. With the EU typically buying more than two-fifths of British exports, tackling remaining issues will be instrumental to getting the economy back on its feet. Covid restrictions remained in place to varying degrees across all four nations of the UK during January and February. ""The economy showed some improvement in February after the large falls seen at the start of the year but remains around 8% below its pre-pandemic level,"" an ONS spokesperson said. Sarah Hewin, from Standard Chartered Bank, told the BBC's Today programme the outlook for the UK economy was improving. ""Confidence does seem to be picking up as vaccinations are spreading. We know households have built up their savings in many cases during lockdown. As lockdown restrictions are eased people are going to be able to go out and spend those savings and that will be a big boost to the economy. ""As we saw from the scenes yesterday people are keen to get out and spend when they can. There will be more opportunities for travelling and going on holiday and spending in restaurants and pubs will see people spending to go out and enjoy themselves."" The latest ONS data also indicated that the economy did not shrink by as much as initially estimated in January. The statistics body said gross domestic product (GDP) fell by 2.2% in January, an upward revision from its original estimate of a 2.9% drop. ""A slightly improved January data could mark the final contraction in the current crisis, with the economy beginning to gather strength even before the end of the lockdown,"" said Yaelâ¯Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK. Rory Macqueen, principal economist at the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, said: ""Clearly much of the economy has adapted to cope with Covid-19 restrictions... if the vaccine programme and lifting of restrictions continue on schedule this provides a firm basis for continuing growth in the second quarter and 2021 overall.""

This includes staff, but not the couple or the person officiating Weddings held in outdoors private settings - such as gardens - require a risk assessment to determine how many guests can be hosted safely. A marquee or other structure in a private garden must have at least half of its walled area open to be classed as ""outdoors"".

England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days,"This video can not be played Lockdown lifting in Liverpool: 'Today feels like New Year's Day' ""Exciting"", ""slightly scary"" and ""an absolute riot"" were some of the verdicts from drinkers enjoying their first night out in months as England reopened outdoor hospitality. In London's Soho, locals welcomed seeing the West End ""buzzing again"" with life. The streets were packed, with roads closed to give more space for al fresco drinking and dining. In Newcastle, people said it was ""worth it"" to brave freezing pub terraces. Outdoor drinking and dining resumed on Monday for the first time since England's lockdown began on 5 January - although for millions of people who lived under tier 4 restrictions in December, the wait had been even longer. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos were among the other businesses reopening in England, whileNorthern Ireland's ""stay-at-home"" order was liftedand some rules were eased inScotlandandWales. Despite flurries of snow in parts of the country, people flocked to pubs and restaurants to celebrate the return of some of their freedoms. Celebrations as pub gardens, shops and zoos reopen 'Light at the end of the tunnel' What can I do now... and what comes next? ""It's full everywhere, It feels like a celebration, basically,"" one drinker told the BBC. ""Honestly it feels so good, it feels like we're out of prison. We're celebrating a birthday, so it's the best gift, I guess,"" said another. A woman, who has lived in Soho for 15 years, said it was ""amazing, it's lovely just to see people out, to have life around us, I've missed it so much"". ""Just to see it buzzing again is beautiful and to see all the local businesses come alive again, it's great,"" she said. Attila Kulcsar, a media communications manager, said the atmosphere was ""like a return to the 'real' Soho of the 1990s"" - or alternatively ""like how I imagine VE Day"", referring to the scenes of jubilation at the end of World War Two. ""There is a wonderfully raucous hysteria everywhere. It's very celebratory. There is very little social distancing. A distinct sense that people feel the Covid restrictions have ended,"" he said. Police and Covid marshalls were present, he said, but they were not intervening to try to enforce social distancing. Drinkers in Soho said the atmosphere was celebratory The pints kept coming late into the night In the Northern Quarter of central Manchester, groups enjoyed drinks as the night drew in Westminster Council said it was aware of ""isolated incidents of crowding"" but said it had been working with businesses to help them operate safely, including having Covid marshalls offering support with social distancing. Some described a few anxious moments at the prospect of crowded places for the first time in months. ""But as soon as you sit down to have a beer, it's an absolute riot,"" said one man. ""It's quite overwhelming, but in a good way,"" added his companion. Many people said they welcomed the crowds and were not concerned about the risk of Covid spreading. Some said they had already been vaccinated, while one group said they had taken rapid lateral flow tests beforehand as a precaution and that being outside reduced the risk of infection. Professor Adam Finn, a paediatrician on the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation, said people should continue to practise social distancing despite the success of the vaccine programme. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether he would go to a beer garden in the current circumstances, he said: ""If I did, I would certainly avoid close contact with other people. ""The risks of transmission outside are relatively low, but not if you start coming into very close contact with people. It's not like it's all over, we can all go back to normal."" Police patrolled the streets in Soho Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had urged people to ""continue to behave responsibly"" as the restrictions were eased. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist and medical oncologist, said the drop in infections in the UK was not only due to the progress in vaccinations, but also because of lockdown restrictions. That meant it was important to remain cautious, even on a ""joyous day"" like this, he said. ""We can't ignore what's going on in the rest of the world - every other day new variants are being reported and infection is rife,"" he said. In Newcastle-upon-Tyne, some revellers shrugged off the ""Arctic"" temperatures. ""To be honest, it's quite nice, it's quite cosy,"" said one man sitting in a sheltered terrace. ""We're from the north so we're used to it."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? A group of women said they had layered up to brave the elements. ""It was really snowing earlier. But I think it's worth it,"" one said. Robby Scott, managing director of Babucho, an Italian restaurant and bar, said: ""It just sums up 2020 and 2021 that we finally get to open our doors for outdoor dining and we get an Arctic storm. But I don't think people would care at the moment."" But some business owners warned that they cannot survive on the takings from outdoor hospitality alone. Jeremy Joseph, owner of G-A-Y in Soho, said the reopening was ""bittersweet"" as even with the streets crowded, they could only operate at just over 10% of their usual indoor capacity. ""It's not making money, all we are doing is reducing our losses,"" he told the BBC. He said the nightclub had lost about Â£1.3m in the pandemic and bills were ""continually coming in"". ""Outside hospitality is not going to cover it,"" he said, adding that the recovery would begin for him on 17 May, when indoor hospitality is expected to resume.

Scotland's Covid travel ban to be lifted on FridayPeople will be allowed to meet in larger groups outdoors and take day trips across Scotland from Friday.,"The Covid-19 restriction on travelling around Scotland are to be relaxed from Friday, while people are to be allowed to meet up in larger groups outdoors. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said measures were being eased earlier than planned to help people's mental health. People will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings. And they will be permitted to travel across Scotland to do so, as long as they do not stay overnight. Other restrictions are expected to be eased from 26 April - with premises including shops, gyms, pubs and restaurants due to reopen on a restricted basis. Hospitality businesses will need to close their doors at 20:00 indoors and 22:00 outdoors, with alcohol only allowed to be served outside. Groups of six people from six different households will be allowed to meet in outdoor hospitality. Restrictions on travel from Scotland to other parts of the UK are also expected to be lifted from 26 April. From 17 May, pubs will be able to open indoors until 22:30 and contact sports, cinemas, and some small scale events will be able to take place. Also from that date in May, up to four people from two households will be able to meet indoors. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days Outdoor drinking and diningresumed on Monday in England, with shops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos also opening their doors. And many hospitality and tourism businesses in Scotland havecriticised the more cautious approachnorth of the border. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, said Ms Sturgeon's announcement ""falls short of what is required to make licensed premises viable"". She added: ""We desperately need a return to licensing hours indoors, as well as allowing alcohol to be sold indoors from 26 April. ""The first minister points to indoor reopening being ahead of England, but without alcohol service it is meaningless to licensed hospitality businesses and little comfort to Scottish brewers and other parts of the supply chain who will see no benefit."" However, Ms Sturgeon warned that ""we do still need to be cautious"" to keep case numbers down and to prevent new variants of the virus from being imported. The changes were announced as the first minister confirmed that Scotland has ""effectively met"" its initial vaccination target of offering a first dose to all over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with particular underlying health conditions. Ms Sturgeon said infection rates had been higher in Scotland than other parts of the UK in recent weeks, but were now ""falling more markedly and more consistently"". The first minister said this meant she could confirm a ""very significant re-opening of the economy"" from 26 April, when the whole of Scotland will move into level three of the Covid-19 restrictions system. Scotland's island communities - which have been in level three for some time - will stay in the same level as the mainland in the immediacy, to allow people to travel between areas. Ms Sturgeon insisted that the announcement had nothing to do with the Holyrood election on 6 May Ms Sturgeon said she expected the whole of Scotland to then move to level two on 17 May - allowing people to meet up indoors - and to level one and then zero in June. And she said some changes to the travel restrictions that had not been due to come into force until 26 April would be made earlier than originally planned in an effort to boost people's mental health and wellbeing. The first minister insisted the move had nothing to do with the ongoing Holyrood election campaign, saying there was ""a bit of limited headroom"" to make changes due to the fall in case numbers and progress in vaccination. Ms Sturgeon said international travel remains a ""significant risk"" It means that people will be allowed to travel across Scotland from Friday of this week, though people are still being urged to stay local for non-essential shopping. In addition, people can meet in groups of up to six adults outdoors from Friday. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow ""long awaited and much-anticipated reunions"" of families and friends. People are currently not allowed to leave their local authority areas for anything other than essential travel, and only four adults from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet up outdoors. However, the first minister urged caution over the possibility of foreign travel. Governments across the UK are attempting to agree on rules for international travel on a four-nations basis, but Ms Sturgeon warned that it ""remains a significant risk"" given the spread of the virus elsewhere in the world. She said a ban on international travel could be ""the price we pay for greater normality here in Scotland"" and necessary to ""protect our progress here"". Scotland recorded just 199 new cases of the virus on Monday - the lowest daily total for seven months - although the figure increased to 221 on Tuesday, with the deaths of a further three people who had previously tested positive also being recorded. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed the move to ease travel restrictions earlier than planned, having previously said the emergence from lockdown was too slow compared to England. He said: ""Scotland's hospitality sector is on its knees and that is compounded by seeing equivalent businesses across the border reopening sooner. Every day that doors stay closed, more jobs are lost. ""This positive direction of travel is possible thanks to the immense sacrifices people continue to make but the game-changer is the UK's extraordinary vaccine programme."" And Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes were a ""welcome announcement for many who have been separated from loved ones for so long"". He added: ""We need to ensure that this lockdown is our last. We need to continue, and improve the pace of, the vaccine roll out and ensure the testing and tracing infrastructure is in place to support a return to normal."" The Scottish Greens welcomed the announcement, but said that caution was needed if the country was to avoid another wave of the virus. The party's Mark Ruskell said: ""We probably don't want to replicate the images of large groups gathering that we saw in London. A surge in gatherings could create a surge in the virus and avoiding that is hugely important to avoid the risk of a third lockdown."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said he was concerned that the Scottish government had ""consistently acted too late on testing and tracing"". He added: ""With hospitality businesses in other parts of the UK now open, the Scottish government must now make sure that financial support is now available to ensure that Scottish businesses don't lose out.""

Scotland recorded just 199 new cases of the virus on Monday - the lowest daily total for seven months - although the figure increased to 221 on Tuesday, with the deaths of a further three people who had previously tested positive also being recorded. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross welcomed the move to ease travel restrictions earlier than planned, having previously said the emergence from lockdown was too slow compared to England. He said: ""Scotland's hospitality sector is on its knees and that is compounded by seeing equivalent businesses across the border reopening sooner. Every day that doors stay closed, more jobs are lost. ""This positive direction of travel is possible thanks to the immense sacrifices people continue to make but the game-changer is the UK's extraordinary vaccine programme."" And Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar said the changes were a ""welcome announcement for many who have been separated from loved ones for so long"". He added: ""We need to ensure that this lockdown is our last. We need to continue, and improve the pace of, the vaccine roll out and ensure the testing and tracing infrastructure is in place to support a return to normal."" The Scottish Greens welcomed the announcement, but said that caution was needed if the country was to avoid another wave of the virus. The party's Mark Ruskell said: ""We probably don't want to replicate the images of large groups gathering that we saw in London. A surge in gatherings could create a surge in the virus and avoiding that is hugely important to avoid the risk of a third lockdown."" Scottish Liberal Democrat health spokesman Alex Cole-Hamilton said he was concerned that the Scottish government had ""consistently acted too late on testing and tracing"". He added: ""With hospitality businesses in other parts of the UK now open, the Scottish government must now make sure that financial support is now available to ensure that Scottish businesses don't lose out.""

Call for US to pause use of J&J Covid vaccine,"The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was cleared for use in the US in February The US, South Africa and European Union will temporarily stop the rollout of the Johnson & Johnson (J&J) Covid jab, after reports of rare blood clotting. Six cases were detected in more than 6.8 million doses of the vaccine, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said. Johnson & Johnson has paused its EU rollout, which started this week. It follows similar cases after doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, which prompted curbs to its use. The FDA said it was recommending the temporary pause ""out of an abundance of caution"". It confirmed that one patient died from blood clotting complications, and another is in a critical condition. All six cases were in women aged between 18 and 48, with symptoms appearing six to 13 days after vaccination. Following the advice, all federal sites in the US have stopped using the vaccine until further investigations into its safety are completed. State and private contractors are expected to follow suit. The US has by far the most confirmed cases of Covid-19 - more than 31 million - with more than 562,000 deaths, another world high. Blood clot is 'very rare AstraZeneca side effect' What you need to know about vaccine safety Johnson & Johnson is a US health care company, but the vaccine was developed mainly by  a pharmaceutical branch in Belgium with laboratories in the Netherlands, and is also known as Janssen. Unlike some of the other jabs, it is given as a single shot and can be stored at normal refrigerator temperatures, making it easier to distribute in hotter climates or more remote areas. While many countries have pre-ordered millions of doses, it has only been approved in a few nations. It was cleared for use in the US on 27 February, but the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines have been used more widely. The J&J vaccine has been administered to nearly seven million people in the US, which is around 3% of the total immunisations given so far. Dr Anthony Fauci, the country's top Covid adviser, said it was too early to comment on whether it could have its authorisation revoked. South Africa, which was the first country to administer the vaccine, has also paused its use, although no cases of blood clots have been reported in the country. The jab became the preferred vaccine there after studies showed it had a higher protection rate againstthe South African variantthan other jabs. Since mid-February, nearly 300,000 healthcare workers have received it. South African President Cyril Ramaphosa receives one of the first Johnson & Johnson vaccines in Cape Town The World Health Organization told Reuters it was monitoring the situation and waiting for reports from the US and European regulators. However deliveries of the vaccine to EU countries started just 24 hours before J&J said it would pause the European rollout. As it has not been administered in the EU yet, experts there will be looking to the United States to see what their next move is. The EU's vaccine roll-out has been criticised by the WHO for being too slow, and and there are concerns this latest delay could throw it into further turmoil. Why is the EU having vaccine problems? How many people have been vaccinated so far? Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Johnson & Johnson vaccine is yet to be approved in the UK, although 30 million doses are on pre-order. The Department of Health said the rollout delay would not affect vaccine supplies in the UK, or derailthe aim to offer a jab to all adults by the end of July. Canada has pre-ordered 10 million doses of the vaccine, and is ""still on track"" to receive the first shipment by the end of the month, said Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. ""But obviously, we're following closely the developments in the United States,"" he added. In a joint statement,external, the FDA and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) said they were ""reviewing data involving six reported US cases of a rare and severe type of blood clot in individuals after receiving the J&J vaccine"". It said the clotting was called cerebral venous sinus thrombosis (CVST). The statement said that this type of blood clot needed a different treatment than usual. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared The common treatment - an anticoagulant drug called heparin - ""may be dangerous"", it said. Pending a further review, the FDA and CDC recommended ""a pause in the use of this vaccine out of an abundance of caution"". Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Why the vaccine alone won't rid us of Covid The joint statement said that ""people who have received the Johnson & Johnson vaccine who develop severe headache, abdominal pain, leg pain, or shortness of breath within three weeks after vaccination should contact their health care provider"". Johnson & Johnsonissued a statement,externalsaying that it shared ""all adverse event reports"" with the health authorities. It added: ""We are aware that thromboembolic events including those with thrombocytopenia have been reported with Covid-19Â vaccines. At present, no clear causal relationship has been established between these rare events and the Janssen (J&J) Covid-19 vaccine."" By Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter The US health protection agency has identified a very small number of the same rare form of blood clots seen in people given the AstraZeneca jab. Governments around the world have cautiously begun to link these rare blood clotting incidents to the vaccine because of their unusual presentation - though this link hasn't been definitively proven. People suffering them had very low platelet counts - blood cells that normally help repair damage in the body. The Johnson & Johnson and AstraZeneca vaccines work in very similar ways. so in some respects it's not surprising they may cause similar side effects. And these appear to be comparably rare. The numbers we're talking about are so low that it's difficult to say confidently what the risk of fatal blood clots is, but for the AstraZeneca jab it has been estimated at one-in-a-million. There have been six cases out of 6.8 million doses of the Johnson & Johnson jab. In contrast, Covid kills one in 1,000 infected in their 40s among those who develop symptoms (and this risk is much higher among older people). Once you get into the youngest age groups, who are less likely to die from Covid, that risk calculus shifts, particularly when there aren't too many infections in circulation.

Breaking|Breaking newsScotland's Covid-19 travel ban to be lifted earlyPeople will be allowed to meet in larger groups outdoors and take day trips across Scotland from Friday.Scotland,"The Covid-19 restriction on travelling around Scotland are to be relaxed from Friday, while people are to be allowed to meet up in larger groups outdoors. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said measures were being eased earlier than planned to help people's mental health. People will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings. And they will be permitted to travel across Scotland to do so, as long as they do not stay overnight. Other restrictions are expected to be eased from 26 April - with premises including shops, gyms, pubs and restaurants due to reopen on a restricted basis. Hospitality businesses will need to close their doors at 20:00 indoors and 22:00 outdoors, with alcohol only allowed to be served outside. Groups of six people from six different households will be allowed to meet in outdoor hospitality. Restrictions on travel from Scotland to other parts of the UK are also expected to be lifted from 26 April. From 17 May, pubs will be able to open indoors until 22:30 and contact sports, cinemas, and some small scale events will be able to take place. Also from that date in May, up to four people from two households will be able to meet indoors. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days Outdoor drinking and diningresumed on Monday in England, with shops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos also opening their doors. And many hospitality and tourism businesses in Scotland havecriticised the more cautious approachnorth of the border. Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the Scottish Beer and Pub Association, said Ms Sturgeon's announcement ""falls short of what is required to make licensed premises viable"". She added: ""We desperately need a return to licensing hours indoors, as well as allowing alcohol to be sold indoors from 26 April. ""The first minister points to indoor reopening being ahead of England, but without alcohol service it is meaningless to licensed hospitality businesses and little comfort to Scottish brewers and other parts of the supply chain who will see no benefit."" However, Ms Sturgeon warned that ""we do still need to be cautious"" to keep case numbers down and to prevent new variants of the virus from being imported. The changes were announced as the first minister confirmed that Scotland has ""effectively met"" its initial vaccination target of offering a first dose to all over-50s, unpaid carers and adults with particular underlying health conditions. Ms Sturgeon said infection rates had been higher in Scotland than other parts of the UK in recent weeks, but were now ""falling more markedly and more consistently"". The first minister said this meant she could confirm a ""very significant re-opening of the economy"" from 26 April, when the whole of Scotland will move into level three of the Covid-19 restrictions system. Scotland's island communities - which have been in level three for some time - will stay in the same level as the mainland in the immediacy, to allow people to travel between areas. Ms Sturgeon insisted that the announcement had nothing to do with the Holyrood election on 6 May Ms Sturgeon said she expected the whole of Scotland to then move to level two on 17 May - allowing people to meet up indoors - and to level one and then zero in June. And she said some changes to the travel restrictions that had not been due to come into force until 26 April would be made earlier than originally planned in an effort to boost people's mental health and wellbeing. The first minister insisted the move had nothing to do with the ongoing Holyrood election campaign, saying there was ""a bit of limited headroom"" to make changes due to the fall in case numbers and progress in vaccination. Ms Sturgeon said international travel remains a ""significant risk"" It means that people will be allowed to travel across Scotland from Friday of this week, though people are still being urged to stay local for non-essential shopping. In addition, people can meet in groups of up to six adults outdoors from Friday. Ms Sturgeon said this would allow ""long awaited and much-anticipated reunions"" of families and friends. People are currently not allowed to leave their local authority areas for anything other than essential travel, and only four adults from a maximum of two households are allowed to meet up outdoors. However, the first minister urged caution over the possibility of foreign travel. Governments across the UK are attempting to agree on rules for international travel on a four-nations basis, but Ms Sturgeon warned that it ""remains a significant risk"" given the spread of the virus elsewhere in the world. She said a ban on international travel could be ""the price we pay for greater normality here in Scotland"" and necessary to ""protect our progress here"". Scotland recorded just 199 new cases of the virus on Monday - the lowest daily total for seven months - although the figure increased to 221 on Tuesday, with the deaths of a further three people who had previously tested positive also being recorded.

"World's wealthiest 'at heart of climate problem'The so-called âpolluter eliteâ must change their lifestyles to tackle climate change, a report says.Science & EnvironmentComments","The worldâs wealthy must radically change their lifestyles to tackle climate change, a report says. It says the world's wealthiest 1% produce double the combined carbon emissions of the poorest 50%, according to the UN. The wealthiest 5% alone â the so-called âpolluter eliteâ - contributed 37% of emissions growth between 1990 and 2015. The authors want todeter SUV driversandfrequent fliersâ and persuade the wealthy to insulate their homes well. The report urges the UK government to reverse its decision to scrap air passenger duty on UK return flights. And it wants ministers to re-instate the Green Homes Grant scheme they also scrapped recently. City drivers 'should think twice' before SUV buys Tax fliers and get rid of SUVs, government told The document has come from the UK-based Cambridge Sustainability Commission on Scaling Behaviour Change. Itâs a panel of 31 individuals who study peopleâs behaviour relating to the environment. They were tasked to find the most effective way of scaling up action to tackle carbon emissions. Their critics say the best way to cut emissions faster is through technological improvements - not through measures that would prove unpopular. But the lead author of the report, Prof Peter Newell, from Sussex University, told BBC News: âWe are totally in favour of technology improvements and more efficient products - but itâs clear that more drastic action is needed because emissions keep going up. âWe have got to cut over-consumption and the best place to start is over-consumption among the polluting elites who contribute by far more than their share of carbon emissions. âThese are people who fly most, drive the biggest cars most and live in the biggest homes which they can easily afford to heat, so they tend not to worry if theyâre well insulated or not. âTheyâre also the sort of people who could really afford good insulation and solar panels if they wanted to.â Prof Newell said that to tackle climate change, everyone needs to feel part of a collective effort â so that means the rich consuming less to set an example to poorer people. He continued: âRich people who fly a lot may think they can offset their emissions by tree-planting schemes or projects to capture carbon from the air. But these schemes are highly contentious and theyâre not proven over time. The wealthy, he said, âsimply must fly less and drive less. Even if they own an electric SUV thatâs still a drain on the energy system and all the emissions created making the vehicle in the first placeâ. Sam Hall, from the Conservative Environment Network, told BBC News: ""Itâs right to emphasise the importance of fairness in delivering (emissions cuts) - and policy could make it easier for people and businesses to go green - through incentives, targeted regulation and nudges. âBut encouraging clean technologies is likely to be more effective, and more likely to enjoy public consent, than hefty penalties or lifestyle restrictions."" But Prof Newell said existing political structures allowed wealthy firms and individuals to lobby against necessary changes in society that might erode the lifestyles of the rich. The recent report of the UK Climate Assembly, for example, proposed a series of measures targeting carbon-intensive behaviours such as shifting away from meat and dairy produce; banning the most polluting SUVs; and imposing frequent flyer levies. The Treasury told BBC News that a frequent flyer levy might require the government to collect and store personal information on each passenger. This could raise issues of data processing, handling and privacy issues. It would also be hard to keep track of people with multiple passports. But the commissionâs report said: âThe goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change cannot be achieved without radical changes to lifestyles and shifts in behaviour, especially among the wealthiest members of society. âIf change across society is to be brought about at the speed and scale required to meet agreed climate targets, we need to shrink and share: reduce carbon budgets and share more equally.â The report is the latest in a long-running dialogue over what it means to be âfairâ while tackling climate change. Poorer nations such as India have consistently argued that they should be allowed to increase their pollution because itâs so much lower per person than emissions from rich nations. The issue forms part of the tangled tapestry of negotiations behind next weekâs climate summit organised by President Biden and the COP climate summit in the UK scheduled for  November.

Pub-reopening caution 'isn't a bad thing',"Streets in Soho, London, were packed as pubs were allowed to open outdoors in England on Monday Reopening pubs too soon could run the risk of ""undoing all the good"" during lockdown, an infectious disease expert has said. Beer gardens reopened in England on Monday, but in Wales industry experts have expressed frustration they cannot open until 26 April. Dr Mike Tildesley said it was important lockdown was eased gradually to stop a spike in coronavirus cases. The Welsh government said it was taking ""a careful step-by-step approach"". England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days Early queues as Wales' shops reopen after lockdown Q&A: What are the new Covid travel rules in Wales? Dr Tildesley, who is part of a modelling group which advises the UK government on the pandemic, said he understood people were ""frustrated"" at the different timetables out of lockdown. However, he said a cautious approach was needed for the next few weeks to prevent a third wave, in the hope ""we can get back to normal by summer"". ""We need to remember that these are paced at a rate that the vaccinations can keep up with us and can help us along the way,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. More than half the people in Waleshave now had their first Covid-19 vaccination dose, and Covid admissions to hospitals in Wales have hit record low levels. Dr Tildesley said while things were moving in the right direction, scientists needed to monitor the impact of relaxing other restrictions on case rates, before reopening other parts of life. This video can not be played Stores in Wales reopen to queues of eager shoppers On Monday shoppers queued as non-essential shopsreopened in Wales for the first time since they were forced to close in the run-up to Christmas. ""The key thing is we need to take it at a gradual rate so we can ensure that we can reopen safely... we are doing well, but if we go too fast we run the risk of too much mixing, and undoing all the good we have done so far,"" he said. While he said cases could go up as people began mixing again and going back to their daily lives, the progress of the vaccine should help avoid a ""significant resurgence"". Dr Tildesley urged people to be cautious for a few more weeks, adding the biggest concern was that if there was a spoke in cases the virus could mutate. ""We are not quite out of the woods yet, in the not too distant future we will be in a position where we can meet people... and hug our friends and family again, but we are not there yet,"" he said. John Turner is landlord of a pub on the Wales-England border which means he is just a few minutes away from an open pub One landlord, whose pub is on the border said it was ""frustrating"" remaining closed until 26 April when outdoorhospitality opened on Monday in England. John Turner said two other pubs in his village - that are technically in England - had now reopened. But Mr Turner, who runs the Dolphin Inn, in Llanymynech, on the Powys-Shropshire border, said Wales was ""always two weeks behind England"" and he was anxious to open again. On Monday,the border reopened between Wales and Englandand people are now allowed to travel in both directions. Once in England, you can visit a pub or cafe garden with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households. However, some people have agreed with Dr Tildesley's view and expressed relief pubs remain closed in Wales. Garfield Doc Oakleeffe posted on Facebook: ""After seeing the footage of the lack of social distancing when drinking in Soho, I think slow and cautious is better."" Sian Louise said: ""I know it's horrible to not be open and I feel for businesses, I really do as I was getting annoyed with it all, but by looking how this last lockdown went and how it started I actually understand why [Mark Drakeford is] doing it slowly, because we don't want another lockdown and we don't want anymore people getting seriously ill either. ""Hopefully, in time we will come out better and safer by doing it gradually."" Michelle Murphy commented: ""I am so glad they are still closed. If this is what it is going to be like, no wonder they predict a third wave."" Kerry Lea Edwards did not understand the ""urgency to be back in the pub"", adding: ""If it's the social side you can meet outdoors in your garden with your friends and have a drink. ""Surely it's not worth the risk - we will be in another lockdown before we know it, very sad."" John Turner said he was looking forward to pubs opening after ""a year of being two weeks behind England"" Mr Turner said: ""The firebreak [lockdown] was going to be the saviour for Christmas and then I didn't even imagine we would miss out on Easter as well. ""An extra two weeks' trade will be lost once again to England."" He added that even when pubs in Wales can reopen, it could be a struggle only being able to serve outside because of ""the weather element"". While he has used some of his government support to put up a marquee, and purchase heaters and furniture, he said other pubs might not be able to keep up. He said he was anxious to make the money back to make the new equipment worthwhile. ""People are desperate to get to the pub. I am hopeful we will be full and I'm looking forward to being busy again because otherwise it will be harder and more disappointing,"" he said. Emma McClarkin said a lack of outdoor space was already a barrier to many pubs and bars Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association (WBPA), said pubs across Wales were ""hugely disappointed"" to not open on Monday alongside England. She said pubs in Wales having to wait another two weeks while pubs in England were trading outdoors was ""a bitter pill to swallow"". Ms McClarkin said: ""Vaccination rates continue to climb while case rates are falling week on week. Even when they will be allowed to open, we still think about 60% of pubs in Wales will be unable to because of a lack of usable outside space. ""The Welsh government need to recognise that and bring forward a package of funding as soon as possible that will prevent hundreds of Welsh pubs being lost for good."" In England, you can meet in a pub or cafe gardens with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households The Welsh government said it had provided more than Â£2bn of funding to support businesses impacted by the pandemic, safeguarding 165,000 Welsh jobs. A spokesperson said tourism and hospitality businesses would continue to receive cash grants this month to help them through until the reopening date in May. ""Businesses will therefore see no interruption in the flow of financial support, as we move cautiously to relax public health restrictions,"" they said. ""Another Â£200m in additional support for business has already been earmarked in the Final Budget 2021-22. ""Ministers have had a constructive meeting with representatives from the hospitality sector and Welsh government officials will work with them on options for a further support package to be put to the new government following May's Senedd election."" A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said many would question the decision not to move forward the reopening of beer gardens after scenes like those seen inCardiff Bay, where crowds gathered to drink over the bank holiday weekend. ""A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option,"" the spokesperson said. ""Likewise, the lack of clear date on indoor hospitality remains a major problem and at the very least the government should urgently revisit its decision to delay any additional financial support until after election."" Leader of the Welsh Conservative group Andrew RT Davies, said the Welsh government's decision was about politics not science, and lost trade meant ""lost livelihoods in Wales"". ""After a crippling 12 months for businesses, Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay seem to have a tin ear to these concerns. Welsh Conservatives would cut the border games, end the confusion, and get Wales on the road to recovery with a safe, consistent and one-nation approach,"" he said. The Welsh Liberal Democrats said: ""Lockdown is frustrating but we all need to stay safe and follow the regulations. ""If we do, we will not need to enter a lockdown again and that is the the most important thing. We've seen before what happened when lockdowns were eased too quickly.""

Edinburgh's International Festival returns outdoors,"An graphical impression of the temporary structures which will hold the crowds and performers The Edinburgh International Festival will return to the capital this summer with huge outdoor marquees to stage events. Three temporary structures, designed for live performance, will be erected in Edinburgh Park and Edinburgh University's Old College Quad. The shows will be shorter with no intervals at this year's festival, which runs between 7 and 29 August. The programme will be announced on Wednesday 2 June. Organisers are optimistic about the festival's return despite continued cancellations of other events. Later on Tuesday the organisers of the Braemar Gathering said the risk of Covid meantit would be unable to take place this September. Some of the performances for the Edinburgh International Festival will be streamed online for free during each week. Edinburgh International Festival director, Fergus Linehan, said: ""We appreciate that these first steps back to live performances will be for audiences closer to home but are delighted to offer a parallel programme of digital work for those further afield."" The festival offered a digital programme of events during lockdown restrictions last year Edinburgh council officials said it would be ""fantastic"" for audiences to enjoy live performances again. Donald Wilson, City of Edinburgh Council's culture and communities convener, said: ""After the challenging year we've all had and the disappointment of not being able to enjoy the festival in the usual way last year, it will be fantastic for audiences to share in the live performance experience again with an exceptional outdoor pavilions programme for local audiences alongside the festival's online offering."" Iain Munro, Creative Scotland's chief executive, added that that the country's ""art and creative sector had been hit hard by covid and its effects continue to have an impact"", He added: ""However, it has been truly remarkable how artists and creative organisations across Scotland have adapted to continue to deliver creative work for audiences.""

LiveLiveVaccine rollout moves on to people in late 40s3 minutes ago,"US health officials call for the Johnson & Johnson vaccine rollout to be paused Six cases saw women develop a rare disorder involving blood clots after being vaccinated - one died Johnson & Johnson says it's going to delay the rollout of its vaccine in Europe and is reviewing the blood clot cases The target of offering all UK over-50s and those in high-risk groups a first dose of a vaccine by 15 April has been met, ministers say People in their late 40s can now book a jab in England, while those aged 40-45 have been making appointments in Wales and Northern Ireland PM Boris Johnson warns that Covid cases and deaths will rise as lockdown lifts, despite the successful rollout In Scotland some lockdown easing is brought forward - from Friday, people can travel outside their local area and six adults can meet up outside The first Moderna vaccine has been given in England - Scotland and Wales began using it last week Surge testing is implemented in two areas of south London, after a cluster of the South African variant was found Edited by James Clarke and Holly Wallis That's it for our live coverage for today. It was edited by James Clarke and Holly Wallis, and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Ella Wills, Lauren Turner and Ashitha Nagesh. There have been plenty of coronavirus developments to tell you about today and we are going to be bringing our live page to a close shortly. Here's a recap of what's been going on in the UK:  Here's a reminder of the stories we've been covering from around the world: Closing the UK borders to keep out Covid variants is ânot
a sustainable long-term strategyâ, says former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He told BBC Radio 4âs PM programme that the UK should have
had more border controls last year and introduced them earlier, but the
situation âis more complicated this yearâ. He says the countries which have followed a âzero-Covid
strategyâ, such as New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea, are now faced with the âterrible
dilemmaâ of whether they keep their borders closed or whether they start to
find a way of living with Covid. He says the UK government needs to be flexible and when âyou
have scares like what is happening in south London, you may need to move more
countries onto the red list â you may need to do it more quicklyâ. The lesson from what is happening in south London is that âyou
never know whatâs around the cornerâ, he says, and the government canât just rely on the
vaccine programme, it also needs to make sure other tools work - such as test
and trace. A cluster of cases of the South African variant in
south London is a result of the government failing to protect the UKâs borders
against Covid variants, according to Labour. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told Radio 4âs PM
programme: âThere should have been a comprehensive hotel quarantining system
introduced some months ago â which is what Iâve been calling for.â The UK has a ""red list"" of countries- from which
entry to the UK is banned â but the new outbreak appears to have been triggered
by an individual arriving from a country which wasnât on that list. Thomas-Symonds said it was âprecisely for this reason that
the so-called red list is not adequate to protect our bordersâ. He said he wanted the government to change course and âput it in place nowâ, although he added whether it would remain in place after 17 May â the earliest date international travel could start under Englandâs roadmap - would depend on the data at the time. He said the worst scenario was a variant entering the country
that badly affected the efficacy of the UKâs vaccines, adding that this was why it was âso
vitalâ that the government acted now. A return to normal opening hours for job centres puts users and staff ""in harm's way"", a union is warning. Job centres went back to their pre-lockdown hours yesterday, having previously been cut to 10am to 2pm. The PCS union says it will not rule out strike action, arguing the extension should be put back until Covid vaccines are ""fully rolled out"". It says staff have dealt successfully with benefits claimants via video link during the pandemic and says ""the vast bulk of the interviews now expected to be done face-to-face can still be carried out remotely"". General Secretary Mark Serwotka says: ""This reckless move by ministers is wholly unnecessary and risks putting both claimants and job centre staff in harm's way."" But the government says putting opening hours back to the normal 9am-5pm will help job centres give ""vital support to the most vulnerable"" in society. And a spokesman says Covid safety is taken ""extremely seriously"". Read more here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The UK has seen 150,000 deaths
involving coronavirus, according to figures released today by the Office for
National Statistics. These are different to the deaths
we hear about every day. The government daily figure only
counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This misses deaths that happen,
say, 30 days after a positive test or where there was no test. So the ONS figures are more
comprehensive: they look at death certificates that mention coronavirus as a
factor. But they take longer to arrive â
todayâs figures only include deaths registered up to the week of 2 April.  It has taken two and a half months to go from 100,000 deaths to 150,000. But things look very different compared to mid-January. Back then, things were getting worse quickly. We went from 100,000 to 125,000 in three short weeks. With the decreases we have seen since then, we can hope to see hundreds, rather than thousands of deaths in the coming weeks.  Allow YouTube content?

One of the biggest names in rock music, Sir Mick Jagger, has just released a song about the lockdown. The track, Eazy Sleazy,,externalwas written by Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick, and recorded in collaboration with another rock giant, Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters. The song begins with the lines: ""We took it on the chin, the numbers were so grim"" and the record label says Sir Mick goes on to reflect on Zoom calls, ""home in these prison
walls"" and too much TV. Sir Mick said: ""Itâs a song that I wrote about coming out of lockdown, with some much needed
optimism. ""Thanks to Dave Grohl for jumping on drums, bass and guitar, it was a
lot of fun working with him. Hope you all enjoy Eazy Sleazy.â Grohl added: Itâs
hard to put into words what recording this song with Sir Mick means to me. Itâs
beyond a dream come true. ""Just when I thought life couldnât get any
crazier... and itâs the song of the summer, without a doubt!!â South Africa has suspended the rollout of the Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccine while an investigation into possible blood clots takes place in the United States. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says this is a ""precautionary suspension"". US health authorities are calling for a pause in the use of the jab, after reports of extremely rare blood clotting cases. South Africa was the first country in the world to administer the jab, and nearly 300,000 health workers have received it since mid-February. A total of 40,107,877 vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's 32,250,481 first doses and 7,857,396 second doses. People aged 45 or over in England will now be invited to get a Covid jab,it was announced earlier. If you've not had yours yet,you can use our look-up tool to find out when you will get your vaccine. About half of students have been studying off campus - and all students will now return to a mix of face-to-face and online classes Students on all university courses in England will be able to return from 17 May at the earliest, the government has announced. It means a return to campuses for about a million students, who have only been able to study online since the Christmas holidays. Since the start of the year, only students on practical, hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching. Students will be offered Covid tests when they return for face-to-face classes, ""no earlier than 17 May"". University leaders had been lobbying for an earlier return - saying it was unfair to keep restrictions on campuses when shops were open. Read the latest here. There have been a further 23 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to government data.,external It means a total of 127,123 people have now died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. A total of 2,472 new cases were detected. Members of the public queue for a Covid testing centre in south London As we've reported, health authorities in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth are urging people to get tested, even if they have no symptoms, aftercases of the South African variant were found in the area. Experts are concerned that this variant - along with a few others - may be able to get round some of the protection given by vaccines. Danny Altmann, a professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, said he was worried by the news of the outbreak. ""It was always one of my nightmare scenarios, that just as we were being kind of coaxed to put a toe in the water of unlocking, something like this would come along,"" Prof Altmann toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""That really can scupper our plans if we let it get out of control."" Prof Altmann said he thought the response had been good - but ""there's so, so little margin for error"". ""You only have to miss a handful of cases and have them run riot through London, and then you're back where we were back in January, February 2020 with a whole new outbreak"". Asked whether he thought the UK's borders were too relaxed, the professor said we need to ""be a bit more like the countries like Vietnam and South Korea"" who have very tight border restrictions. And questioned on whether he thought it seemed strange that people in areas such as Lambeth were still going to the pub, he said: ""It does in a way."" This video can not be played Concern is growing in Brazil about the rising number of young people who are critically ill in hospital with Covid-19. Research suggests more than half of patients being treated in intensive care last month were under 40. The BBC's Mark Lowen visited Latin America's largest cemetery, a makeshift hospital and a vaccine hub to find out why the handling of the pandemic in Brazil has become a public health disaster. Jim ReedBBC health reporter A large queue of people lined up waiting to be tested in Brockwell Park, Lambeth Earlier,we brought you the news that surge testinghad begun in Wandsworth and Lambeth after an outbreak of the Covid-19 variant first identified in South Africa. It appears to have been triggered by an individual who travelled from Africa in February, according to documents seen by the BBC. The documents say that in Southwark - which is to the east, the neighbouring borough - they tested sewerage water there and found traces of the South African variant in one particular area. At the moment they don't know if it's related to these other outbreaks but they are sending in targeted surge testing in Southwark. The impression I get is that they are quite confident this is probably under control but not certain yet at this stage, which is why they have done this huge rollout of these tests to make sure that they're going to pick up people who are asymptomatic in particular. Big games at Wembley have been in front of empty stands throughout the pandemic Charities working with disabled people are criticising plans to exclude vulnerable football fans from being able to apply for tickets for the Carabao Cup final. It was announced earlier Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City will both be allowed 2,000 fans at Wembley for the final on 25 April. But under-18s, people who are clinically extremely vulnerable and pregnant women have been asked not to apply. Level Playing Field - a charity that campaigns for inclusive matchday experience and equal access for all disabled sports fans - says it is ""very disappointed"" by the decision. And Louise Rubin, head of policy and campaigns at disability equality charity
Scope, says: ""Disabled people have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic
and, as the UK begins to recover from coronavirus and open up again, they should
be able to access sport and other social events just in the same way as everyone
else. ""Disabled people should be able to make their own choice about what's right
for them, rather than being subject to arbitrary and discriminatory blanket
policies."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been approached
for a response. You can read more here. Portugal is currently in the process of easing out of its lockdown - but, senior officials have been told, this may need to be halted or reversed within two weeks. The country is a week into phase two of the government's roadmap for easing the lockdown imposed on 15 January, with all but the largest on-street shops allowed to open since last Monday, and cafes and restaurants open for outdoor dining. However, officials were told at an expert briefing that case numbers and the R number could soon breach thresholds the government has said would make it necessary to halt or even reverse course, the BBC's Alison Roberts reports. ""With this level of growth and a rate close to 71 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the time to reach the line of 120 is between two weeks and one month,"" Baltazar Nunes, a biostatistician at the National Health Institute (INSA), says. He adds the Algarve, Madeira and Azores regions have already breached this threshold. The R rate, he adds, has also shown a ""systematic increase"" in recent days, with the most recent official figure - for 8 April - being 1.09. The Department for Education (DfE) pledged to provide 1.3 million laptops and tablets to disadvantaged pupils at the start of the pandemic - and is very close to the target, but has not yet reached it, new data suggests. The DfE figures show that a total of 1,295,752 laptops and tablets have been delivered or dispatched to support children to access remote education since the start of the pandemic. Overall, 733,331 devices have been sent to councils, academy trusts, schools and colleges across England since the most recent lockdown began on 4 January. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says: ""The government has been promising for months that it would deliver 1.3 million laptops to schools and we are now tantalisingly close to seeing that target achieved. ""We do not underestimate the scale of the government's logistical operation but the truth is they were slow to react in the first place, slow to get started and progress since has been painfully slow."" The DfE has said it is in contact with local authorities, schools and colleges to encourage them to order their allocated devices if they have not yet done so. A pub landlord says his staff are having to police people who try to bend coronavirus rules by booking extra tables. Covid restrictions mean venues can only serve customers sitting outdoors in groups of up to six people or from two households. James Linder of The Eagle in Norwich says: ""We've had people try to book under different names to try to form large groups - we've had to catch them out, which is not great. ""With the greatest will in the world, they start mingling between the tables after a couple of drinks and forming one group."" He says he has to turn tables away which loses money and upsets staff. ""They don't want to be going in and policing people,"" he says. Trade bodyUK Hospitality,externalsays: ""We need people to stick by the rules."" Read more on this storyhere. From Friday people will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings The latest announcement on Scotland's journey out of lockdown means people will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings fromFriday. People will also be permitted to travel across Scotland as long as they do not stay overnight. All remaining shops and close-contact services such as nail salons are due to reopen on26 April. Pubs, restaurants and bars will be able to serve people outdoors - in groups of up to six from three households - until 22:00 from that date. Alcohol will be permitted, and there will be no requirement for food to be served. There will also be a partial resumption of indoor hospitality - food and non-alcoholic drinks can be served until 20:00 for groups of up to four people from no more than two households. Contact details will still need to be collected. Here are dates for when more of the current rules will be relaxed. Â© 2025 BBC.

"England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 daysAs outdoor hospitality reopens, revellers find a ""celebratory"" atmosphere despite the cold weather.","This video can not be played Lockdown lifting in Liverpool: 'Today feels like New Year's Day' ""Exciting"", ""slightly scary"" and ""an absolute riot"" were some of the verdicts from drinkers enjoying their first night out in months as England reopened outdoor hospitality. In London's Soho, locals welcomed seeing the West End ""buzzing again"" with life. The streets were packed, with roads closed to give more space for al fresco drinking and dining. In Newcastle, people said it was ""worth it"" to brave freezing pub terraces. Outdoor drinking and dining resumed on Monday for the first time since England's lockdown began on 5 January - although for millions of people who lived under tier 4 restrictions in December, the wait had been even longer. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and zoos were among the other businesses reopening in England, whileNorthern Ireland's ""stay-at-home"" order was liftedand some rules were eased inScotlandandWales. Despite flurries of snow in parts of the country, people flocked to pubs and restaurants to celebrate the return of some of their freedoms. Celebrations as pub gardens, shops and zoos reopen 'Light at the end of the tunnel' What can I do now... and what comes next? ""It's full everywhere, It feels like a celebration, basically,"" one drinker told the BBC. ""Honestly it feels so good, it feels like we're out of prison. We're celebrating a birthday, so it's the best gift, I guess,"" said another. A woman, who has lived in Soho for 15 years, said it was ""amazing, it's lovely just to see people out, to have life around us, I've missed it so much"". ""Just to see it buzzing again is beautiful and to see all the local businesses come alive again, it's great,"" she said. Attila Kulcsar, a media communications manager, said the atmosphere was ""like a return to the 'real' Soho of the 1990s"" - or alternatively ""like how I imagine VE Day"", referring to the scenes of jubilation at the end of World War Two. ""There is a wonderfully raucous hysteria everywhere. It's very celebratory. There is very little social distancing. A distinct sense that people feel the Covid restrictions have ended,"" he said. Police and Covid marshalls were present, he said, but they were not intervening to try to enforce social distancing. Drinkers in Soho said the atmosphere was celebratory The pints kept coming late into the night In the Northern Quarter of central Manchester, groups enjoyed drinks as the night drew in Westminster Council said it was aware of ""isolated incidents of crowding"" but said it had been working with businesses to help them operate safely, including having Covid marshalls offering support with social distancing. Some described a few anxious moments at the prospect of crowded places for the first time in months. ""But as soon as you sit down to have a beer, it's an absolute riot,"" said one man. ""It's quite overwhelming, but in a good way,"" added his companion. Many people said they welcomed the crowds and were not concerned about the risk of Covid spreading. Some said they had already been vaccinated, while one group said they had taken rapid lateral flow tests beforehand as a precaution and that being outside reduced the risk of infection. Professor Adam Finn, a paediatrician on the Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation, said people should continue to practise social distancing despite the success of the vaccine programme. Asked on BBC Breakfast whether he would go to a beer garden in the current circumstances, he said: ""If I did, I would certainly avoid close contact with other people. ""The risks of transmission outside are relatively low, but not if you start coming into very close contact with people. It's not like it's all over, we can all go back to normal."" Police patrolled the streets in Soho Earlier on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had urged people to ""continue to behave responsibly"" as the restrictions were eased. Prof Lawrence Young, a virologist and medical oncologist, said the drop in infections in the UK was not only due to the progress in vaccinations, but also because of lockdown restrictions. That meant it was important to remain cautious, even on a ""joyous day"" like this, he said. ""We can't ignore what's going on in the rest of the world - every other day new variants are being reported and infection is rife,"" he said. In Newcastle-upon-Tyne, some revellers shrugged off the ""Arctic"" temperatures. ""To be honest, it's quite nice, it's quite cosy,"" said one man sitting in a sheltered terrace. ""We're from the north so we're used to it."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? A group of women said they had layered up to brave the elements. ""It was really snowing earlier. But I think it's worth it,"" one said. Robby Scott, managing director of Babucho, an Italian restaurant and bar, said: ""It just sums up 2020 and 2021 that we finally get to open our doors for outdoor dining and we get an Arctic storm. But I don't think people would care at the moment."" But some business owners warned that they cannot survive on the takings from outdoor hospitality alone. Jeremy Joseph, owner of G-A-Y in Soho, said the reopening was ""bittersweet"" as even with the streets crowded, they could only operate at just over 10% of their usual indoor capacity. ""It's not making money, all we are doing is reducing our losses,"" he told the BBC. He said the nightclub had lost about Â£1.3m in the pandemic and bills were ""continually coming in"". ""Outside hospitality is not going to cover it,"" he said, adding that the recovery would begin for him on 17 May, when indoor hospitality is expected to resume.

It was edited by James Clarke and Holly Wallis, and written by Jennifer Meierhans, Ella Wills, Lauren Turner and Ashitha Nagesh. There have been plenty of coronavirus developments to tell you about today and we are going to be bringing our live page to a close shortly. Here's a recap of what's been going on in the UK:  Here's a reminder of the stories we've been covering from around the world: Closing the UK borders to keep out Covid variants is ânot
a sustainable long-term strategyâ, says former Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt. He told BBC Radio 4âs PM programme that the UK should have
had more border controls last year and introduced them earlier, but the
situation âis more complicated this yearâ. He says the countries which have followed a âzero-Covid
strategyâ, such as New Zealand, Taiwan and South Korea, are now faced with the âterrible
dilemmaâ of whether they keep their borders closed or whether they start to
find a way of living with Covid. He says the UK government needs to be flexible and when âyou
have scares like what is happening in south London, you may need to move more
countries onto the red list â you may need to do it more quicklyâ. The lesson from what is happening in south London is that âyou
never know whatâs around the cornerâ, he says, and the government canât just rely on the
vaccine programme, it also needs to make sure other tools work - such as test
and trace. A cluster of cases of the South African variant in
south London is a result of the government failing to protect the UKâs borders
against Covid variants, according to Labour. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds told Radio 4âs PM
programme: âThere should have been a comprehensive hotel quarantining system
introduced some months ago â which is what Iâve been calling for.â The UK has a ""red list"" of countries- from which
entry to the UK is banned â but the new outbreak appears to have been triggered
by an individual arriving from a country which wasnât on that list. Thomas-Symonds said it was âprecisely for this reason that
the so-called red list is not adequate to protect our bordersâ. He said he wanted the government to change course and âput it in place nowâ, although he added whether it would remain in place after 17 May â the earliest date international travel could start under Englandâs roadmap - would depend on the data at the time. He said the worst scenario was a variant entering the country
that badly affected the efficacy of the UKâs vaccines, adding that this was why it was âso
vitalâ that the government acted now. A return to normal opening hours for job centres puts users and staff ""in harm's way"", a union is warning. Job centres went back to their pre-lockdown hours yesterday, having previously been cut to 10am to 2pm. The PCS union says it will not rule out strike action, arguing the extension should be put back until Covid vaccines are ""fully rolled out"". It says staff have dealt successfully with benefits claimants via video link during the pandemic and says ""the vast bulk of the interviews now expected to be done face-to-face can still be carried out remotely"". General Secretary Mark Serwotka says: ""This reckless move by ministers is wholly unnecessary and risks putting both claimants and job centre staff in harm's way."" But the government says putting opening hours back to the normal 9am-5pm will help job centres give ""vital support to the most vulnerable"" in society. And a spokesman says Covid safety is taken ""extremely seriously"". Read more here. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The UK has seen 150,000 deaths
involving coronavirus, according to figures released today by the Office for
National Statistics. These are different to the deaths
we hear about every day. The government daily figure only
counts deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This misses deaths that happen,
say, 30 days after a positive test or where there was no test. So the ONS figures are more
comprehensive: they look at death certificates that mention coronavirus as a
factor. But they take longer to arrive â
todayâs figures only include deaths registered up to the week of 2 April.  It has taken two and a half months to go from 100,000 deaths to 150,000. But things look very different compared to mid-January. Back then, things were getting worse quickly. We went from 100,000 to 125,000 in three short weeks. With the decreases we have seen since then, we can hope to see hundreds, rather than thousands of deaths in the coming weeks.  Allow YouTube content?

One of the biggest names in rock music, Sir Mick Jagger, has just released a song about the lockdown. The track, Eazy Sleazy,,externalwas written by Rolling Stones singer Sir Mick, and recorded in collaboration with another rock giant, Dave Grohl from Foo Fighters. The song begins with the lines: ""We took it on the chin, the numbers were so grim"" and the record label says Sir Mick goes on to reflect on Zoom calls, ""home in these prison
walls"" and too much TV. Sir Mick said: ""Itâs a song that I wrote about coming out of lockdown, with some much needed
optimism. ""Thanks to Dave Grohl for jumping on drums, bass and guitar, it was a
lot of fun working with him. Hope you all enjoy Eazy Sleazy.â Grohl added: Itâs
hard to put into words what recording this song with Sir Mick means to me. Itâs
beyond a dream come true. ""Just when I thought life couldnât get any
crazier... and itâs the song of the summer, without a doubt!!â South Africa has suspended the rollout of the Johnson and Johnson Covid-19 vaccine while an investigation into possible blood clots takes place in the United States. Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says this is a ""precautionary suspension"". US health authorities are calling for a pause in the use of the jab, after reports of extremely rare blood clotting cases. South Africa was the first country in the world to administer the jab, and nearly 300,000 health workers have received it since mid-February. A total of 40,107,877 vaccinations have been given in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external That's 32,250,481 first doses and 7,857,396 second doses. People aged 45 or over in England will now be invited to get a Covid jab,it was announced earlier. If you've not had yours yet,you can use our look-up tool to find out when you will get your vaccine. About half of students have been studying off campus - and all students will now return to a mix of face-to-face and online classes Students on all university courses in England will be able to return from 17 May at the earliest, the government has announced. It means a return to campuses for about a million students, who have only been able to study online since the Christmas holidays. Since the start of the year, only students on practical, hands-on courses have been allowed in-person teaching. Students will be offered Covid tests when they return for face-to-face classes, ""no earlier than 17 May"". University leaders had been lobbying for an earlier return - saying it was unfair to keep restrictions on campuses when shops were open. Read the latest here. There have been a further 23 coronavirus-related deaths in the UK,according to government data.,external It means a total of 127,123 people have now died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. A total of 2,472 new cases were detected. Members of the public queue for a Covid testing centre in south London As we've reported, health authorities in the London boroughs of Wandsworth and Lambeth are urging people to get tested, even if they have no symptoms, aftercases of the South African variant were found in the area. Experts are concerned that this variant - along with a few others - may be able to get round some of the protection given by vaccines. Danny Altmann, a professor of Immunology at Imperial College London, said he was worried by the news of the outbreak. ""It was always one of my nightmare scenarios, that just as we were being kind of coaxed to put a toe in the water of unlocking, something like this would come along,"" Prof Altmann toldBBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""That really can scupper our plans if we let it get out of control."" Prof Altmann said he thought the response had been good - but ""there's so, so little margin for error"". ""You only have to miss a handful of cases and have them run riot through London, and then you're back where we were back in January, February 2020 with a whole new outbreak"". Asked whether he thought the UK's borders were too relaxed, the professor said we need to ""be a bit more like the countries like Vietnam and South Korea"" who have very tight border restrictions. And questioned on whether he thought it seemed strange that people in areas such as Lambeth were still going to the pub, he said: ""It does in a way."" This video can not be played Concern is growing in Brazil about the rising number of young people who are critically ill in hospital with Covid-19. Research suggests more than half of patients being treated in intensive care last month were under 40. The BBC's Mark Lowen visited Latin America's largest cemetery, a makeshift hospital and a vaccine hub to find out why the handling of the pandemic in Brazil has become a public health disaster. Jim ReedBBC health reporter A large queue of people lined up waiting to be tested in Brockwell Park, Lambeth Earlier,we brought you the news that surge testinghad begun in Wandsworth and Lambeth after an outbreak of the Covid-19 variant first identified in South Africa. It appears to have been triggered by an individual who travelled from Africa in February, according to documents seen by the BBC. The documents say that in Southwark - which is to the east, the neighbouring borough - they tested sewerage water there and found traces of the South African variant in one particular area. At the moment they don't know if it's related to these other outbreaks but they are sending in targeted surge testing in Southwark. The impression I get is that they are quite confident this is probably under control but not certain yet at this stage, which is why they have done this huge rollout of these tests to make sure that they're going to pick up people who are asymptomatic in particular. Big games at Wembley have been in front of empty stands throughout the pandemic Charities working with disabled people are criticising plans to exclude vulnerable football fans from being able to apply for tickets for the Carabao Cup final. It was announced earlier Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester City will both be allowed 2,000 fans at Wembley for the final on 25 April. But under-18s, people who are clinically extremely vulnerable and pregnant women have been asked not to apply. Level Playing Field - a charity that campaigns for inclusive matchday experience and equal access for all disabled sports fans - says it is ""very disappointed"" by the decision. And Louise Rubin, head of policy and campaigns at disability equality charity
Scope, says: ""Disabled people have been among the hardest hit by the pandemic
and, as the UK begins to recover from coronavirus and open up again, they should
be able to access sport and other social events just in the same way as everyone
else. ""Disabled people should be able to make their own choice about what's right
for them, rather than being subject to arbitrary and discriminatory blanket
policies."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport has been approached
for a response. You can read more here. Portugal is currently in the process of easing out of its lockdown - but, senior officials have been told, this may need to be halted or reversed within two weeks. The country is a week into phase two of the government's roadmap for easing the lockdown imposed on 15 January, with all but the largest on-street shops allowed to open since last Monday, and cafes and restaurants open for outdoor dining. However, officials were told at an expert briefing that case numbers and the R number could soon breach thresholds the government has said would make it necessary to halt or even reverse course, the BBC's Alison Roberts reports. ""With this level of growth and a rate close to 71 cases per 100,000 inhabitants, the time to reach the line of 120 is between two weeks and one month,"" Baltazar Nunes, a biostatistician at the National Health Institute (INSA), says. He adds the Algarve, Madeira and Azores regions have already breached this threshold. The R rate, he adds, has also shown a ""systematic increase"" in recent days, with the most recent official figure - for 8 April - being 1.09. The Department for Education (DfE) pledged to provide 1.3 million laptops and tablets to disadvantaged pupils at the start of the pandemic - and is very close to the target, but has not yet reached it, new data suggests. The DfE figures show that a total of 1,295,752 laptops and tablets have been delivered or dispatched to support children to access remote education since the start of the pandemic. Overall, 733,331 devices have been sent to councils, academy trusts, schools and colleges across England since the most recent lockdown began on 4 January. Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, says: ""The government has been promising for months that it would deliver 1.3 million laptops to schools and we are now tantalisingly close to seeing that target achieved. ""We do not underestimate the scale of the government's logistical operation but the truth is they were slow to react in the first place, slow to get started and progress since has been painfully slow."" The DfE has said it is in contact with local authorities, schools and colleges to encourage them to order their allocated devices if they have not yet done so. A pub landlord says his staff are having to police people who try to bend coronavirus rules by booking extra tables. Covid restrictions mean venues can only serve customers sitting outdoors in groups of up to six people or from two households. James Linder of The Eagle in Norwich says: ""We've had people try to book under different names to try to form large groups - we've had to catch them out, which is not great. ""With the greatest will in the world, they start mingling between the tables after a couple of drinks and forming one group."" He says he has to turn tables away which loses money and upsets staff. ""They don't want to be going in and policing people,"" he says. Trade bodyUK Hospitality,externalsays: ""We need people to stick by the rules."" Read more on this storyhere. From Friday people will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings The latest announcement on Scotland's journey out of lockdown means people will be allowed to meet in groups of up to six adults from six households in outdoor settings fromFriday. People will also be permitted to travel across Scotland as long as they do not stay overnight. All remaining shops and close-contact services such as nail salons are due to reopen on26 April. Pubs, restaurants and bars will be able to serve people outdoors - in groups of up to six from three households - until 22:00 from that date. Alcohol will be permitted, and there will be no requirement for food to be served. There will also be a partial resumption of indoor hospitality - food and non-alcoholic drinks can be served until 20:00 for groups of up to four people from no more than two households. Contact details will still need to be collected. Here are dates for when more of the current rules will be relaxed. Â© 2025 BBC.

Different pub rules 'a bitter pill to swallow',"Streets in Soho, London, were packed as pubs were allowed to open outdoors in England on Monday Reopening pubs too soon could run the risk of ""undoing all the good"" during lockdown, an infectious disease expert has said. Beer gardens reopened in England on Monday, but in Wales industry experts have expressed frustration they cannot open until 26 April. Dr Mike Tildesley said it was important lockdown was eased gradually to stop a spike in coronavirus cases. The Welsh government said it was taking ""a careful step-by-step approach"". England 'buzzing' after first night out in 97 days Early queues as Wales' shops reopen after lockdown Q&A: What are the new Covid travel rules in Wales? Dr Tildesley, who is part of a modelling group which advises the UK government on the pandemic, said he understood people were ""frustrated"" at the different timetables out of lockdown. However, he said a cautious approach was needed for the next few weeks to prevent a third wave, in the hope ""we can get back to normal by summer"". ""We need to remember that these are paced at a rate that the vaccinations can keep up with us and can help us along the way,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. More than half the people in Waleshave now had their first Covid-19 vaccination dose, and Covid admissions to hospitals in Wales have hit record low levels. Dr Tildesley said while things were moving in the right direction, scientists needed to monitor the impact of relaxing other restrictions on case rates, before reopening other parts of life. This video can not be played Stores in Wales reopen to queues of eager shoppers On Monday shoppers queued as non-essential shopsreopened in Wales for the first time since they were forced to close in the run-up to Christmas. ""The key thing is we need to take it at a gradual rate so we can ensure that we can reopen safely... we are doing well, but if we go too fast we run the risk of too much mixing, and undoing all the good we have done so far,"" he said. While he said cases could go up as people began mixing again and going back to their daily lives, the progress of the vaccine should help avoid a ""significant resurgence"". Dr Tildesley urged people to be cautious for a few more weeks, adding the biggest concern was that if there was a spoke in cases the virus could mutate. ""We are not quite out of the woods yet, in the not too distant future we will be in a position where we can meet people... and hug our friends and family again, but we are not there yet,"" he said. John Turner is landlord of a pub on the Wales-England border which means he is just a few minutes away from an open pub One landlord, whose pub is on the border said it was ""frustrating"" remaining closed until 26 April when outdoorhospitality opened on Monday in England. John Turner said two other pubs in his village - that are technically in England - had now reopened. But Mr Turner, who runs the Dolphin Inn, in Llanymynech, on the Powys-Shropshire border, said Wales was ""always two weeks behind England"" and he was anxious to open again. On Monday,the border reopened between Wales and Englandand people are now allowed to travel in both directions. Once in England, you can visit a pub or cafe garden with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households. However, some people have agreed with Dr Tildesley's view and expressed relief pubs remain closed in Wales. Garfield Doc Oakleeffe posted on Facebook: ""After seeing the footage of the lack of social distancing when drinking in Soho, I think slow and cautious is better."" Sian Louise said: ""I know it's horrible to not be open and I feel for businesses, I really do as I was getting annoyed with it all, but by looking how this last lockdown went and how it started I actually understand why [Mark Drakeford is] doing it slowly, because we don't want another lockdown and we don't want anymore people getting seriously ill either. ""Hopefully, in time we will come out better and safer by doing it gradually."" Michelle Murphy commented: ""I am so glad they are still closed. If this is what it is going to be like, no wonder they predict a third wave."" Kerry Lea Edwards did not understand the ""urgency to be back in the pub"", adding: ""If it's the social side you can meet outdoors in your garden with your friends and have a drink. ""Surely it's not worth the risk - we will be in another lockdown before we know it, very sad."" John Turner said he was looking forward to pubs opening after ""a year of being two weeks behind England"" Mr Turner said: ""The firebreak [lockdown] was going to be the saviour for Christmas and then I didn't even imagine we would miss out on Easter as well. ""An extra two weeks' trade will be lost once again to England."" He added that even when pubs in Wales can reopen, it could be a struggle only being able to serve outside because of ""the weather element"". While he has used some of his government support to put up a marquee, and purchase heaters and furniture, he said other pubs might not be able to keep up. He said he was anxious to make the money back to make the new equipment worthwhile. ""People are desperate to get to the pub. I am hopeful we will be full and I'm looking forward to being busy again because otherwise it will be harder and more disappointing,"" he said. Emma McClarkin said a lack of outdoor space was already a barrier to many pubs and bars Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the Welsh Beer and Pub Association (WBPA), said pubs across Wales were ""hugely disappointed"" to not open on Monday alongside England. She said pubs in Wales having to wait another two weeks while pubs in England were trading outdoors was ""a bitter pill to swallow"". Ms McClarkin said: ""Vaccination rates continue to climb while case rates are falling week on week. Even when they will be allowed to open, we still think about 60% of pubs in Wales will be unable to because of a lack of usable outside space. ""The Welsh government need to recognise that and bring forward a package of funding as soon as possible that will prevent hundreds of Welsh pubs being lost for good."" In England, you can meet in a pub or cafe gardens with up to six people from individual households, or any number from two households The Welsh government said it had provided more than Â£2bn of funding to support businesses impacted by the pandemic, safeguarding 165,000 Welsh jobs. A spokesperson said tourism and hospitality businesses would continue to receive cash grants this month to help them through until the reopening date in May. ""Businesses will therefore see no interruption in the flow of financial support, as we move cautiously to relax public health restrictions,"" they said. ""Another Â£200m in additional support for business has already been earmarked in the Final Budget 2021-22. ""Ministers have had a constructive meeting with representatives from the hospitality sector and Welsh government officials will work with them on options for a further support package to be put to the new government following May's Senedd election."" A Plaid Cymru spokesperson said many would question the decision not to move forward the reopening of beer gardens after scenes like those seen inCardiff Bay, where crowds gathered to drink over the bank holiday weekend. ""A regulated drinking environment is, after all, a better and safer option,"" the spokesperson said. ""Likewise, the lack of clear date on indoor hospitality remains a major problem and at the very least the government should urgently revisit its decision to delay any additional financial support until after election."" Leader of the Welsh Conservative group Andrew RT Davies, said the Welsh government's decision was about politics not science, and lost trade meant ""lost livelihoods in Wales"". ""After a crippling 12 months for businesses, Labour ministers in Cardiff Bay seem to have a tin ear to these concerns. Welsh Conservatives would cut the border games, end the confusion, and get Wales on the road to recovery with a safe, consistent and one-nation approach,"" he said. The Welsh Liberal Democrats said: ""Lockdown is frustrating but we all need to stay safe and follow the regulations. ""If we do, we will not need to enter a lockdown again and that is the the most important thing. We've seen before what happened when lockdowns were eased too quickly.""
