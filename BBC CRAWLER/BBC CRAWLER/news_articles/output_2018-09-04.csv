Chequers plan explained,"The marathon cabinet meeting at Chequers lasted nearly 12 hours The cabinet has reached an agreement on the UK's future relationship with the EU after Brexit. Here are the key points fromthe three page deal published by the government.,external The UK will ""maintain a common rulebook for all goods"" with the EU, including agricultural products, after Brexit. A treaty will be signed committing the UK to ""continued harmonisation"" with EU rules - avoiding friction at the UK-EU border, including Northern Ireland. Parliament will oversee the UK's trade policy and have the ability to ""choose"" to diverge from the EU rules, ""recognising that this would have consequences"". ""Co-operative arrangements"" will be established between EU and UK competition regulators. ""Different arrangements"" will be organised for services ""where it is in our interests to have regulatory flexibility"". A ""joint institutional framework"" will be established to interpret UK-EU agreements. This would be done in the UK by UK courts, and in the EU by EU courts But, decisions by UK courts would involve ""due regard paid to EU case law in areas where the UK continued to apply a common rulebook"". Cases will still be referred to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) as the interpreter of EU rules, but ""cannot resolve disputes between the two"". The borders between the UK and EU will be treated as a ""combined customs territory"". The UK would apply domestic tariffs and trade policies for goods intended for the UK, but charge  EU tariffs and their equivalents for goods which will end up heading into the EU. A post-Brexit UK would be able to ""control its own tariffs for trade with the rest of the world"" without causing border disruption. This avoids a hard Irish border, and removes the need for ""backstop"" arrangements to be put in place before the UK's withdrawal from the EU, the government says. The agreement says it will end free movement of people ""giving the UK back control over how many people enter the country"". A ""mobility framework"" will be set up to allow UK and EU citizens to travel to each other's territories, and apply for study and work. These proposals represent ""a precise and responsible approach to the final stage of the negotiations"", the government says. According to the government the plan: Gives the UK an independent trade policy, with the ability to set its own non-EU tariffs and to reach separate trade deals Ends the role of the ECJ in UK affairs Ends annual payments to the EU budget with ""appropriate contributions for joint action in specific areas"" The early reaction from Brexiteers has been that they need to see the full 100-plus page plan  to see whether or not they agree with the government's claims. Full details will be released in a white paper next week. This is not a final Brexit deal. This is an agreement on the UK's preferred way forward as negotiations with the European Union about the future relationship reach a crucial stage.

Labour adopts anti-Semitism definition,"The UK Labour Party's ruling body has agreed to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism, after months of rows. It will incorporate all the 11 examples of anti-Semitism cited by theInternational Holocaust Remembrance Alliance,externalinto its code of conduct. But Jewish groups have attacked an accompanying statement agreed by the NEC aimed at protecting free speech. One warned it risked giving ""racists a get-out-of-jail card"". After a three hour meeting in London, Labour said its National Executive Committee had adopted all of the IHRA examples of anti-Semitism, including four it left out in July, alongside a statement ensuring ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Labour can 'end anti-Semitism row quickly' A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims The party, which has struggled to contain a long-running row over claims of anti-Semitism within its ranks, said it ""welcomed Jeremy Corbyn's statement to the meeting about action against anti-Semitism, solidarity with the Jewish community and protection of Palestinian rights"". Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey said the NEC decision was a ""clear indication of our direction of travel"" and Labour would now hold a consultation on changing the wording of its code of conduct. She said the party needed ""a comprehensive and legally robust document"" with which to implement action against our members who might breach the IHRA examples and definition. ""We need to have a code in place and what we want to do now is re-invite those organisations that we have sought to work with over the last year or so and get their views and really make that code watertight so that it's crystal clear to all of our members what is acceptable and what isn't."" Way out of the mess? By the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg Perhaps this marks the beginning of the end of this sorry mess. But what makes an early resolution tricky is the caveat that Labour has included alongside. It will be important to many of Mr Corbyn's supporters who want the right to criticise Israel. But for those campaigning against anti-Semitism, it still sends a message that Labour might want to make exceptions, that the party is saying ""yes, but"", rather than ""yes, of course"", to loud demands from the Jewish community that they take the strongest action possible against those who would foment tension. Read full Laura's blog Rival protesters gathered outside Labour's headquarters as its senior officials discussed the issue. Some activists wrapped in Israeli flags condemned Labour as being ""for the many, not the Jew"" while others urged the NEC to resist calls to adopt the IHRA definition, one carrying a banner stating ""criticism of Israel is not anti-Semitism"". As well as urging the party to adopt the IHRA definition in full with all examples, Mr Corbyn set out some of the concerns Labour members had raised about limitations on freedom of speech in his comments at the NEC meeting. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said she understood the Labour leader suggested a more extensive accompanying statement stating that ""it should not be considered anti-Semitic to describe Israel, its policies or the circumstances around its foundation as racist because of their discriminatory impact, or to support another settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict"" but that this was rejected. The BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said this followed a split among left-wing members of the NEC, with Momentum founder Jon Lansman and a Jewish colleague Rhea Wolfson making it clear they did not support their leader's position. The Jewish Leadership Council criticised Mr Corbyn's actions and said the free speech caveats would ""drive a coach and horses"" through the anti-Semitism definition. ""It is clearly more important to the Labour leader to protect the free speech of those who hate Israel than it is to protect the Jewish community from the real threats that it faces,"" its chief executive Simon Johnson said. Campaign group Labour Against anti-Semitism said it was disappointed by ""the attachment of a ""clarification"" that risks giving racists in the party a get-out-of-jail card"". And the Board of Deputies of British Jews said ""firm action"" was now needed against anti-Semites in the party and Mr Corbyn should apologise for ""past anti-Semitic comments and affiliations"". There was a mixed response from MPs who have been critical of the leadership over what they say is its failure to get to grips with the problem. Allow Twitter content?

Supporters of Mr Corbyn had argued that adopting the IHRA definition with all examples would restrict freedom to criticise Israel's actions against Palestinians. Labour MP Chris Williamson, an ally of Mr Corbyn, said Jewish opinion was not ""homogenous"" when it came to backing the definition and the party's decision to adopt it was a ""pragmatic"" one. ""I don't think Jeremy was isolated in any way, shape or form,"" he told the BBC. ""He set out the position and said it was important, in view of the pressure, the party needed to adopt all the examples not withstanding the criticisms by the original author of them."" He said the development would not prevent Labour activists from criticising the actions of the ""apartheid"" Israeli government led by Benjamin Netanyahu and he urged the ""small element obsessed with the issue"" of anti-Semitism within the party to now get behind their leader.

"Brexit approach incompetent, says Lord King","This video can not be played Lord King laments Brexit 'incompetence' Former Bank of England governor Lord King has blasted Brexit preparations as ""incompetent"". The Brexit supportersaid it ""beggared belief"" that the world's sixth-biggest economy should be talking of stockpiling food and medicines. This left the government without a credible bargaining position, he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Exiting the European Union (DExEU) said that getting a good deal with the EU was ""by far, the most likely outcome"". Lord King said that ""a government that cannot take action to prevent some of these catastrophic outcomes illustrates a whole lack of preparation"". ""It doesn't tell us anything about whether the policy of staying in the EU is good or bad, it tells us everything about the incompetence of the preparation for it."" The 'Chequers' Brexit plan explained What do the Brexit 'no deal' papers reveal? Raab says Chequers EU feedback positive Lord King: Brexit brings real opportunities In a BBC interview to discuss the 10 years since the economic crisis - due to be aired next week - Lord King spent a significant amount of time saying the 11th hour preparation for a no-deal Brexit has undermined the government's negotiating position. He added: ""We haven't had a credible bargaining position, because we hadn't put in place measures where we could say to our colleagues in Europe, 'Look, we'd like a free-trade deal, we think that you would probably like one too, but if we can't agree, don't be under any misapprehension, we have put in place the measures that would enable us to leave without one.'"" In response, the government said it was ""focused on negotiating a deal of unprecedented scope and ambition"". ""We have already made significant progress,"" the DExEU spokesperson added. ""The vast majority of the Withdrawal Agreement has now been agreed, and we are making further progress on the outstanding separation issues"". But Lord King predicts that we will find ourselves with what's been dubbed as Brino - Brexit in name only - which he said was the worst of all worlds. It's also a state of affairs that he fears could drag on for years. ""I think the biggest risk to the UK, and this is what worries me most, is that this issue isn't going to go away, you know the referendum hasn't decided it, because both camps feel that they haven't got what they wanted."" Lord King expressed regret and surprise that it was more difficult for a single country to present a united front than the other 27 EU members. He said: ""They must have been really worried that they had 27 countries to try to corral, how could they have a united negotiating position, they were dealing with a country that was one country, made a clear decision, voted to leave, it knew what it wanted to do, how on earth could the EU manage to negotiate against this one decisive group on the other side of the Channel? ""Well, the reality's been completely the opposite. The EU has been united, has been clear, has been patient and it's the UK that's been divided without any clear strategy at all for how to get to where we want to go."" Please upgrade your browser He also said he found the current level of debate around Brexit ""depressing"" and said it obscured the real challenges ahead. ""The biggest economic problems facing the UK are, we save too little, we haven't worked out how to save for retirement, the pension system is facing I think a real challenge, we haven't worked out how to save enough for the NHS and finance it, we haven't worked out how we're going to save enough to provide care for the elderly. Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options ""These are the big economic challenges we face, but are they being discussed at present in an open way? ""No, because the political debate has been completely taken up by Brexit,"" he said. ""It's a discussion where both sides seem to be throwing insults at each other."" Lord King might argue he is being much more even-handed, with stinging criticism for all involved. His comments come as Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham calls for Brexit to be postponed, if a no-deal scenario seems likely. In a speech on Wednesday, the former Labour minister will say that although ""a price would undoubtedly be paid in terms of social cohesion,"" a suspension of the process would be necessary to avoid damaging jobs.

Guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims,"The Campaign Against anti-Semitism stages a protest in 2018 The internal Labour row over anti-Semitism has dragged on for several years. Here's a guide to what's been going on. In October 2020, a report bythe UK's human rights watchdog found Labourto be responsible for ""unlawful"" acts of harassment and discrimination during Jeremy Corbyn's four-and a-half years as party leader. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) investigation identified serious failings in leadership and an inadequate process of handling anti-Semitism complaints. Its report said the party was responsible for three breaches of the Equality Act: political interference in anti-Semitism complaints, failure to provide adequate training to those handling anti-Semitism complaints and harassment. In a statement, it said: ""The equality body's analysis points to a culture within the party which, at best, did not do enough to prevent anti-Semitism and, at worst, could be seen to accept it."" The commission served an unlawful act notice on the party, meaning it has to produce an action plan within six weeks, which is legally enforceable by the courts if not acted upon. The inquiry was launched in May 2019 after ""receiving a number of complaints about allegations of anti-Semitism in the party"". Responding to the report, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was ""a day of shame for the Labour Party"" and apologised to the Jewish community. He said the party would implement all the report's recommendations in full and promised a ""culture change"" in Labour. He added: ""Under my leadership, zero-tolerance of anti-Semitism will mean precisely that. If you're anti-Semitic, you should be nowhere near this Party. And we'll make sure you're not. ""And if - after all the pain, all the grief, and all the evidence in this report, there are still those who think there's no problem with anti-Semitism in the Labour Party, that it's all exaggerated, or a factional attack, then, frankly, you are part of the problem too. And you should be nowhere near the Labour Party either."" Sir Keir's predecessor as leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said he did not accept all of the report's findings but expressed the hope that the recommendations would be ""swiftly implemented"". He said ""anyone claiming there is no anti-Semitism in the Labour Party is wrong"" but added that ""the scale of the problem was also dramatically overstated for political reasons by our opponents inside and outside the party, as well as by much of the media"". Labour suspended Mr Corbyn from the party and removed the whip, meaning he would no longer be part of the Parliamentary Labour Party. In a statement, the party said: ""In light of his comments made today and his failure to retract them subsequently, the Labour Party has suspended Jeremy Corbyn pending investigation."" Three weeks later, Labour's ruling body - the National Executive Committee (NEC) - decided to readmit Mr Corbyn as a party member. But this did not mean he would automatically be reinstated as a Labour MP, and Sir Keir decided not to restore the whip to his predecessor - meaning Mr Corbyn will continue to sit in the House of Commons as an independent. Sir Keir promised to keep the situation under review, but allies of Mr Corbyn have urged him to change his mind immediately, saying the former leader is being ""persecuted"". Bring back 'persecuted' Corbyn, allies demand Jewish people have faced prejudice and hostility for centuries. During World War II, six million Jews were murdered by the Nazis or their accomplices in what is known as the Holocaust. Modern-day anti-Semitism can take many forms including, but not limited to, conspiracy theories about Jewish control of the global financial system and the media, to attacks on synagogues, verbal abuse or hate speech and abusive memes on social media. In 2018, anti-Semitic hate incidents in the UK reached a record high,according to the Community Security Trust,external, which monitors them. In 2016, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) adopteda working definition of anti-Semitism,externalwhich described it as ""a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews"". The UK and a number of other IHRA members haveadopted or endorsed the working definition,external, as well as a series of accompanying ""contemporary"" examples of how anti-Semitism manifests itself in public life. These include Holocaust denial, denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination (through the existence of a State of Israel), and holding Jews collectively responsible for the actions of that state. Labour got itself into trouble over the definition - as we'll explain later. Debates about anti-Semitism in Labour often involve Israel and the term ""Zionism"". In its modern sense, Zionism refers to support for Israel's existence and prosperity. It began as a political movement in Europe in the late 19th Century which sought to develop Jewish nationhood in the land known as Palestine - also known to Jews as the ancient Land of Israel. The movement evolved and eventually led to the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Some say ""Zionist"" can be used as a coded attack on Jewish people, while others say the Israeli government and its supporters are deliberately confusing anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism to avoid criticism. Attitudes to Israel in the UK, and on the left in particular, are influenced by its troubled relationship with its Arab neighbours and its long conflict with the Palestinians. A 2016 report by the Home Affairs Committee of MPs backed the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism but said it should include an additional statement to maintain freedom of speech ""in the context of discourse about Israel and Palestine"". This, it said, should read ""it is not anti-Semitic to criticise the Israeli government without additional evidence to suggest anti-Semitic intent"" or to hold Israel ""to the same standards as other liberal democracies or to take a particular interest in the Israeli government's policies or actions, without additional evidence to suggest ant-Semitic intent"". Read more about the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The anti-Semitism row was a constant backdrop to Jeremy Corbyn's leadership Anti-Semitism was generally not regarded as a big problem in the Labour Party before Jeremy Corbyn's election as leader in September 2015. Mr Corbyn and his allies on the left had spent decades campaigning for Palestinian statehood, in contrast with the more nuanced position taken by many of his predecessors. Under his leadership, there was an influx of new members, many of whom were vocal critics of Israel and who believed the UK, along with the US, should be tougher towards Israel, especially regarding its policies towards the Palestinians and its building of settlements in the occupied territories. As the balance of power within Labour changed after Mr Corbyn's election as leader, attention quickly focused on what activists and elected representatives were saying - and had said in the past - on social media and elsewhere about Israel and Jewish people. There were claims that anti-Semitic tropes were being widely propagated and a number of incidents attracted a great deal of attention. There were a string of high-profile suspensions over alleged anti-Semitic comments - and constant accusations, from Jewish groups and some of his own MPs, that Mr Corbyn and his team were failing to take the issue seriously enough. The row threatened to the tear the party apart, with several high-profile MPs walking out over abuse they received. Mr Corbyn repeatedly insisted that anti-Jewish hate would not be tolerated in the party, but critics said he was not doing enough to root out the problem. In April 2018, Jennie Formby, an ally of Mr Corbyn, took over as Labour's general secretary and set about tightening up the party's disciplinary procedures and recruiting more staff to deal with anti-Semitism cases. The full story of the controversies over Mr Corbyn's position on anti-Semitism in the Labour Party are set out below. But let's now look at efforts by the man elected to replace him as leader in March 2020, Sir Keir Starmer, to draw a line under the issue. When Sir Keir Starmer was elected Labour leader in April, he made tackling anti-Semitism a top priority, promising to ""tear out this poison by its roots"" in his acceptance speech. In a video conference with Jewish leaders, the new Labour leader and his deputy, Angela Rayner, said they would set up an independent complaints procedure and review all outstanding cases. This was welcomed by Jewish leaders, whosaid in a joint statementthat Sir Keir had ""achieved more in four days"" than Mr Corbyn did ""in four years"". Shortly afterwards, an internal report into the party's handling of anti-Semitism cases, written in the final month of Mr Corbyn's tenure, was leaked. The 860 page dossiersaid that factional hostilitytowards Mr Corbyn's leadership among senior party staff had led to a ""litany of mistakes"" that hindered the handling of anti-Semitism allegations. Opponents of Mr Corbyn claimed the report was leaked in an attempt to ""smear whistleblowers"", who had spoken to the Equalities and Human Rights Commission investigation. But supporters of the former leader are incensed about alleged evidence that senior former staff members ""openly worked against the aims and objectives"" of the party leadership. The report included thousands of emails and private WhatsApp messages, by named individuals, which allegedly show hostility towards Mr Corbyn, party members and policies. Sir Keir has ordered an inquiry into the contents of the report and how it was leaked to the media, which is still ongoing. In July this year, the Labour Partyagreed to pay ""substantial"" damagesto seven former employees who spoke out about anti-Semitism, in a BBC Panorama programme. The party issued an unreserved apology in the High Court for making ""false and defamatory"" comments about the seven whistleblowers. Labour to report on anti-Semitism leak in July Labour names head of leaked report investigation Sir Keirsacked his shadow education secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey in June 2020, saying she had shared an article containing an anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. Mrs Long-Bailey had retweeted an interview with actor and Labour supporter Maxine Peake, later saying she had not meant to endorse all aspects of the article. In the article, Ms Peake discussed the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, saying: ""The tactics used by the police in America, kneeling on George Floyd's neck, that was learnt from seminars with Israeli secret services."" The Independent article also quoted the Israeli police denying Ms Peake's claim saying: ""There is no tactic or protocol that calls to put pressure on the neck or airway."" Ms Peake later tweeted that she had been ""inaccurate in my assumption of American police training and its sources"". Allegations of anti-Semitism against party members and supporters dogged Jeremy Corbyn's four-and-half years as Labour leader. Among those suspended by the party for alleged anti-Semitism were MP Naz Shah, the ex-London Mayor Ken Livingstone and MP Chris Williamson, an ally and friend of Mr Corbyn. Chris Williamson was one of a number of prominent figures to be suspended Ms Shah apologisedfor a string of comments on Facebook, including one suggesting Israel should be moved to the United States, although she was subsequently re-instated. She has since gone on to play a leading role in the fight against anti-Semitism in the party. Mr Livingstone quit the partyafter a long-running row over claims Adolf Hitler had once supported Zionism while Mr Williamson was stripped of his membership for saying the problem of anti-Semitism had been over-stated and Labourhad been ""too apologetic""over the issue. Mr Williamsonwas allowed back into the partyseveral months after his suspension, but wassuspended again two days later.pending further consideration of his future. In October 2019, he lost a High Court bid to be reinstated and was unable to stand for re-election as a Labour candidate in Derby North, He stood as an independent but lost his seat. In 2016, Jeremy Corbyn asked the barrister and human rights campaigner Shami Chakrabarti - who was appointed a Labour peer soon after her report was published - to look into the extent of anti-Semitism and other forms of racism within the party. The report concluded that while Labour was not ""overrun by anti-Semitism or other forms of racism"", there was an ""occasionally toxic atmosphere"". It made a series of recommendations to tackle what it said was the ""clear evidence of ignorant attitudes"" within sections of the party. The report's launch was marred, though, by averbal confrontation which led to the expulsion of activist Marc Wadsworthfrom the party after he criticised a Jewish MP. The time it has taken to implement the Chakrabarti report has been criticised Labour's former general secretary Jennie Formbysaid she had strengthened and speeded up,externalthe party's disciplinary procedures, with more staff to handle investigations but Baroness Chakrabarti - then Labour's shadow attorney general - criticised the pace of progress. A 2016 Home Affairs Committee report said the leadership's lack of action ""risks lending force to allegations that elements of the Labour movement are institutionally anti-Semitic"". In early 2019, Labour approachedformer Lord Chancellor Lord Falconer, who replaced Baroness Chakrabarti as the shadow attorney general, about leading a review into its complaints process, which critics said had become politicised. This, in turn, led to complaints from prominent Jewish MPs that he was too close to the party for any review to be independent. But in a politically damaging move, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) announced its own investigation into anti-Semitism in the party. It is only the second time the EHRC has investigated a political party - in 2010, it ordered the BNP to re-write its constitution to comply with race relation laws. A Labour spokesman rejected ""any suggestion that the party does not handle ant-Semitism complaints fairly and robustly, or that the party has acted unlawfully"". Labour 'not overrun by anti-Semitism' The party faced further criticism following a BBC Panorama calledIs Labour Anti-Semitic? The programme spoke to a number of party officials who alleged that senior Labour figures - namely Ms Formby and communications chief Seumas Milne, who stood down when Mr Corbyn departed -had interfered in the processof dealing with anti-Semitism complaints. The disputes team is supposed to operate independently from the party's political structures, including the leader's office. The whistleblowers also claimed they had faced a huge increase in anti-Semitism complaints since Mr Corbyn became leader in 2015. Seumas Milne and Jennie Formby were accused of interfering in Labour's disciplinary process Labour strenuously disputed the claims, insisting there was no interference and the former staff were ""disaffected"" individuals with ""personal and political axes to grind"". It also said the programme was ""heavily slanted and inaccurate"" - a suggestion Panorama has rejected. The party's then deputy leader, Tom Watson, saidhe ""deplored"" the official responseto the documentary, and other senior figures joined him tocall on the leadership to listen to the concerns it raised. MPs and peers are nowpushing for a fully independent complaints process. In July 2018, Labour adopted a new anti-Semitism code which critics, including Jewish leaders and some Labour MPs, said fell unacceptably short of the IHRA definition. Labour's version did not include a number of its examples of anti-Semitism, including: accusing Jewish people of being more loyal to Israel than their home country requiring higher standards of behaviour from Israel than other nations Following a consultation - and widespread criticism - Labour subsequently adopted the fullIHRA definition and examples,external, along with an accompanying statement that ""this will not in any way undermine freedom of expression on Israel or the rights of Palestinians"". Critics have said the addition of a ""caveat"" undermines the IHRA definition - but Labour says it is intended to reassure members they can be critical of Israel without being anti-Semitic. Mr Corbyn proposed a longer additional statement - which would have allowed criticism of the foundation of the state of Israel as a racist endeavour - but this was not accepted by the party's ruling executive. Throughout his time as Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn insisted there was no place in the party for anti-Semitism. Some of his supporters said the problem had been exaggerated and was being used as a stick to beat him by people who didn't like his leadership of the party or his views on the Middle East. The former Labour leader comes from a different political tradition than virtually every other post-war Labour leader, having campaigned for 40 years against Western imperialism and aggression. Mr Corbyn's opponents accused him of being too close to Hamas, a militant Islamist group, and Hezbollah, a Lebanese paramilitary group. Both groups are widely viewed in the West as terrorist organisations. He described representatives of Hamas as his ""friends"" after inviting them to a controversial meeting in Parliament in 2009. He later said he regretted his use of language, but insisted his motivation in talking to enemies of Israel was the promotion of peace in the Middle East. But his critics argued his views created the space for anti-Semitism to flourish in the party and he had condoned anti-Jewish prejudice through several of his own actions. Mr Corbyn faced criticism in August 2018 after a video emergedon the Daily Mail website,externalof a 2013 clip in which he said a group of British Zionists ""don't understand English irony"". Former chief rabbi Lord Sacks brandedthe comments ""the most offensive statement"" by a politician since Enoch Powell's ""Rivers of Blood"" speech and accused the Labour leader of being an anti-Semite. Mr Corbyn said he had used the term ""Zionist"" in an ""accurate political sense and not as a euphemism for Jewish people"". He added: ""I am now more careful with how I might use the term 'Zionist' because a once self-identifying political term has been increasingly hijacked by anti-Semites as code for Jews."" In August 2018, the then Labour leader also came under fire over his presence at a ceremony in Tunisia in 2014 which is said to have honoured the perpetrators of the 1972 Munich massacre, during which 11 members of the Israeli Olympic team were taken hostage by Palestinian militants and killed. The Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Mr Corbyn deserved ""unequivocal condemnation"" for laying a wreath on the grave of one of those behind the atrocity. Mr Corbyntweeted,externalthat Mr Netanyahu's claims about his ""actions and words are false"", adding: ""What deserves unequivocal condemnation is the killing of over 160 Palestinian protesters in Gaza by Israeli forces since March, including dozens of children."" Mr Corbyn said he had attended the event in Tunis as part of a wider event about the search for peace. Corbyn wreath row explained Earlier in August 2018, Jeremy Corbyn apologised over an event he hosted as a backbench MP in 2010 where a Holocaust survivor compared Israel to Nazism. Afterthe Times published details of the event,external, the then Labour leader said he had ""on occasion appeared on platforms with people whose views I completely reject"" and was sorry for the ""concerns and anxiety that this has caused"". Corbyn apologises over 2010 event Mr Corbyn apologised for not condemning an anti-Semitic mural in London In March 2018, Mr Corbyn was criticised for sending an apparently supportive message to the creator of an allegedly anti-Semitic mural in 2012. In a message sent via Facebook, he had appeared to question a decision to remove the artist's controversial work from a wall in east London. He later said he had not looked at it properly, calling it ""deeply disturbing and anti-Semitic"". The artist, called Mear One, denied this, saying the mural was about ""class and privilege"". Following the row, Mr Corbyn said he was ""sincerely sorry for the pain"" caused and conceded there were ""pockets"" of anti-Semitism within the party. Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Luciana Berger said she had become ashamed of the party she joined as a teenager Unease within Labour ranks in Parliament intensified in 2017 and 2018 amid concerns the leadership was not doing enough to defend Jewish MPs, such as Luciana Berger, who were themselves the targets of anti-Semitic abuse and death threats. In March 2018, scores of Labour MPs joined Jewish groups, including the Jewish Leadership Council and the Board of Deputies of British Jews, and other anti-racism campaigners to demand action in an unprecedented ""Enough is Enough"" rally outside Parliament. In a further sign of the breakdown in trust between Labour and the Jewish community, the Jewish Labour Movement considered severing its century-old affiliation to the party. While deciding to retain its ties, the organisation of 2,000 members did pass a motion of no confidence in Mr Corbyn and voted to describe the party as ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism In February 2019, nine MPs quit Labour, many of them citing the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism as their reason for leaving. Ms Berger, who had a police escort at the 2018 Labour Party conference, said she had come to the ""sickening conclusion"" that the party had become institutionally anti-Semitic and that she was ""embarrassed and ashamed"" to stay. Ms Berger's supporters, including then deputy leader Tom Watson, claimed she has been ""bullied out of her own party by racist thugs"". Among the other defectors, Joan Ryan claimed the party had ""become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism"" while Ian Austin blamed Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"". Eight of the defectors joined the newly formed Independent Group, which became Change UK, but three, including Luciana Berger, went on to join the Liberal Democrats, and failed to get elected at the 2019 general election. The two that remained in Change UK lost their seats, while Gavin Shuker, who stood as an independent, also lost his seat. Joan Ryan and Ann Coffey decided not to stand for re-election. Ian Austin did not join The Independent Group and stood down at the 2019 general election, advising his constituents to vote Conservative to stop Jeremy Corbyn. In March 2018, the head of the Labour Party's disputes panel quit after it emerged she had opposed the suspension of a council candidate accused of Holocaust denial. Christine Shawcroft said she had not not been aware of the ""abhorrent"" Facebook post that had led to his suspension In July 2018, the UK's three main Jewish newspapers published the same front page, warning that a government led by Mr Corbyn would pose an ""existential threat to Jewish life"". Earlier that month the party brought disciplinary action against the Labour MP Margaret Hodge, after she reportedly called Mr Corbyn an ""anti-Semite"" and a ""racist"". Ms Hodge refused to apologise and the action was later dropped. Frank Field, the MP for Birkenhead since 1979, quit the party's group in Parliament in August 2018, saying the leadership had become ""a force for anti-Semitism in British politics"". He stood as an independent at the 2019 general election but lost his seat to the Labour candidate. In May 2019, a member of Labour's ruling National Executive Committee - Peter Willsman - was suspended afterLBC radio reported,externalhe had been recorded as saying that the Israeli embassy was ""almost certainly"" behind the anti-Semitism row. And Labour's successful candidate in the Peterborough by-election, Lisa Forbes, was engulfed in a row after it emerged she had liked a social media post suggesting Theresa May had a ""Zionist slave masters agenda"". She apologised and calls for her to be suspended were rejected but the controversy led to fresh ructions and claims racism had become ""institutionalised"" within the party.

Raab: Chequers EU feedback positive,"The UK government says it has received ""positive and constructive feedback"" from the rest of the EU on its Brexit proposals. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the Chequers plan had proved ""challenging"" for some in Brussels - but that European counterparts were ""engaging seriously"". The EU's chief negotiator has said he ""strongly"" opposes parts of the plan. It has also come under fire from some Tory MPs. After updating MPs on his latest meeting with the EU's Michel Barnier, Mr Raab was urged by a number of his own Brexiteer colleagues to ""chuck Chequers"". Christopher Chope told him that persisting with Theresa May's blueprint for future relations was an act of ""self-delusion"" given what he said was the EU's unwillingness to accept it. Meanwhile, campaigners for the public to have the final say on the outcome of the Brexit negotiations have welcomedthe GMB union's decisionto come out in favour of a new referendum. At-a-glance: The 'Chequers' Brexit plan 'No new ideas' in Johnson Brexit criticism Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options The UK will leave the EU on 29 March and negotiations are taking place on the terms of its departure and its future relationship with the remaining members. In July, the UK governmentpublished proposals,externalfor how trade with the EU could be managed in years to come. It includes a ""common rulebook"" for goods and treating the UK and the EU as a ""combined customs territory"" in an attempt to minimise red tape for businesses and avoid a hard border in Northern Ireland. But Brexiteer critics - including former foreign secretary Boris Johnson - say this will leave the UK too closely tied to the EU in years to come, and are campaigning for it to be ""ditched"". Addressing MPs, Mr Raab was urged by one Tory backbencher to ""chuck Chequers"" in the face of recent criticism from EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Mr Raab said the European Commission had indeed ""raised concerns"" but that positive feedback had been received from member states. Since the government published its proposals in a White Paper, ministers have held more than 60 meetings with EU counterparts, he said. Mr Raab said the ""scope and contours"" of the agreement covering the UK's withdrawal were clear. This would protect citizens' rights and put in place a temporary transition period after the UK leaves, he added. He also defended the UK's plans for the possibility of no deal being reached, which included publishing 25 notices last month offering advice on how best to prepare for such a scenario, saying: ""The UK will be ready for Brexit, deal or no deal."" Labour's Brexit spokesman Sir Keir Starmer said his statement would ""reassure nobody"", dismissed the Chequers plan as a ""fudge"" and said there were ""huge gaps"" in the government's plans for no deal, notably on the Irish border. Writing in theDaily Telegraph,external, former Tory leader Lord Hague warned that disunity in the party could trigger a ""terrible chain of events over the next seven months"". If there is no agreement that can win the backing of the House of Commons, the UK could face a choice of leaving with no deal or deferring Brexit and holding a new referendum, he said. ""Either of those outcomes could variously involve more serious economic consequences than anything seen so far, the fall of the Conservative government, a general election, and either the election of the dysfunctional Labour Party or another hung Parliament."" Mr Barnier's objections to the plan were underlined during a meeting with the Brexit committee of UK MPs on Monday. One member of the committee, former Conservative minister John Whittingdale, said it had become clear in the meeting that the EU ""just can't accept"" the Chequers plan, because it thinks it goes against the principles of the single market. Mr Whittingdale, who said he was personally ""very unhappy"" about the PM's plan, said Mr Barnier had instead been open to a free trade deal of ""unprecedented closeness"".

Football abuse survivor helps HollyoaksA victim of football coach Barry Bennell has advised Hollyoaks on its football abuse storyline.Entertainment & Arts,"Buster Smith, played by Nathan Sussex (left) with Ollie Morgan, played by Aedan Duckworth One of the victims of football coach Barry Bennell has been advising Hollyoaks on its current football abuse storyline. Steve Walters said the plot, which sees coach Buster groom Ollie, is ""very difficult to watch"" but ""spot on"". Walters was among those who spoke out about Bennell, leading to himbeing jailed in Februaryfor abusing boys. ""We all know it's still going on today, and worse than ever, so this is such an important issue,"" Walters said. Once regarded as one of England's most promising young players, Walters was abused from the age of 12 when he would stay at Bennell's house during the school holidays. Along with Duncan Craig, chief executive of male abuse charity Survivors Manchester, he has been working with Hollyoaks to make sure their scripts are realistic - within the limits of what can be shown in its 18.30 timeslot. Steve Walters (centre) with Duncan Craig (left) and actors Aedan Duckworth, Nathan Sussex and Adam Woodward Viewers of the Channel 4 show have seen Buster Smith, played by Nathan Sussex, prey on teenage aspiring footballer Ollie Morgan, played by Aedan Duckworth. The plot reaches a climax this week and Walters, who now runs The Offside Trust, joined the cast at a Royal Television Society preview screening in Salford on Monday. ""It was very difficult to watch,"" he said afterwards. He praised the cast but said it had been ""uncomfortable"" to meet Sussex because certain things about Buster reminded him of Bennell. He added: ""Watching that tonight was certainly very realistic. I know you've got the timeslot, which can be quite frustrating, but the way the grooming process by Buster was [shown was] spot on, to be fair."" This video can not be played Steve Walters speaking in 2016: 'I was inconsolable' Walters and Craig suggested changes to scripts in an attempt to ensure they were true to life. Craig said he believed Hollyoaks had contributed to an increase in survivors of abuse contacting his charity since the storyline had been on air, while Walters said people had contacted him directly. ""I've had somebody in their 20s contact me - they've watched Hollyoaks and that's been the trigger for them to come forward,"" he said. ""So even if nobody else comes forward, there's one more person who has."" In February, Barry Bennell was jailed for 31 years for 50 counts of child sexual abuse. Described as the ""devil incarnate"" by the judge at Liverpool Crown Court, he was convicted of abusing 12 boys aged eight to 15 between 1979 and 1991.

Amazon's market value tops $1tn,"Amazon has briefly become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of more than $1 trillion (Â£779bn). Shares in the e-commerce giant rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. Founded in 1994, Amazon is now the world's largest online retailer. Its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is the world's richest man, with a net worth of more than $160bn. How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said: ""To reach a market capitalisation of over $1tn is impressive. To do it in a little over 24 years is extraordinary. ""That Amazon has achieved this demonstrates its dramatic advancement in both the retail and technology sectors, as well as the influence it now wields over large parts of the consumer landscape."" Analysis: Kim Gittleson, New York business correspondent Like a pesky younger sibling, Amazon might be second to the symbolic trillion-dollar milestone - but when it comes to its rivalry with Apple, it's been quicker to hit nearly every hundred-billion dollar valuation hurdle. For instance, it took Amazon just 16 days, compared to Apple's 622 days, to go from a market value of $600bn to $700bn, according to the Wall Street Journal. This acceleration makes sense in a way, because Amazon spent most of its time as a public company reporting losses or negligible profits. Founder Jeff Bezos consistently said he would rather reinvest sales revenue into the company to give it a better, more profitable future. It's a strategy that seems to have paid off: Amazon reported $2.5bn in profit last quarter, making it one of Wall Street's most profitable companies. And the future seems bright. Even more so than Apple, Amazon is in the business of how we'll live in the future. Although nearly half of every dollar spent online by an American goes to Amazon, e-commerce still makes up just 9% of total retail sales here. And Amazon has also become the market leader in cloud computing, with its Web Services business line consistently beating expectations. All of this suggests that when it comes to Amazon's growing market value, the best word to describe it might in fact be the name Mr Bezos reportedly initially had planned for the company: relentless. Amazon reported nearly $53bn in sales in the three months ended in June, with record quarterly profit of $2.5bn. The firm is expected to account for roughly half of all online shopping sales in the US this year - and nearly 5% of the country's overall retail market, according to research firm eMarketer. It employs more than 575,000 people, a force nearly the size of Luxembourg's population. It provides logistics, storage, loans and a selling platform to hundreds of thousands of third-party merchants. Its profitable cloud computing division, which hosts huge swathes of the corporate world on its data servers, is the industry's global leader.

Experts confirm Novichok caused poisoning,"Dawn Sturgess died on 8 July The substance that killed a woman in Amesbury was the same Novichok nerve agent that poisoned Sergei and Yulia Skripal, experts have confirmed. The independent Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons report backs up the UK government's findings. Dawn Sturgess, 44, died in hospital on 8 July after handling a contaminated container, months after the Skripals were poisoned in Salisbury. The foreign secretary said Russia's recklessness was ""appalling"". Russia has denied any involvement in the poisonings. The international chemical weapons experts reached their conclusions havingcollected samples from the UK. It was not possible to conclude whether the nerve agent used in the two incidents was from the same batch, the OPCW said. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt thanked the OPCW and paid tribute to the ""high standards set by our world-leading scientists"". He said it was a reminder of the importance of upholding the the global ban on all use of chemical weapons. ""The recklessness of the Russian state in bringing a nerve agent in to the UK, and total disregard for the safety of the public, is appalling and irresponsible,"" he added. ""Our thoughts are with the family of Dawn Sturgess, and with Charlie Rowley."" Mr Rowley - a friend of Ms Sturgess - fell ill but survived the poisoning. Novichok bottle 'was found in branded box' Why Novichok stays deadly for so long Novichok 999 vehicles buried in landfill On 30 June, the couple collapsed in a house in Amesbury, about eight miles from Salisbury. Police said they were exposed after handling what they believed to be perfume. Mr Rowley was discharged from hospital on 20 July. The Foreign Office said police investigations into the Amesbury and Salisbury poisonings were continuing.

MP tries to make misogyny a hate crime,"Stella Creasy is urging other MPs to support her changes to the upskirting ban A Labour MP is trying to change the law so that misogynistic behaviour is treated as a hate crime. Stella Creasy wants to amend new legislation that would ban taking unsolicited pictures under someone's clothing. Her changes would mean someone convicted of the crime could get a tougher sentence if it was ""motivated by misogyny"". MPs are currently debating the draft legislation. May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block 'Upskirting': It happened to me Misogyny hate crime pilot 'shocking' The government legislation seeks to ban what is known as upskirting, because there is not currently a specific law against this in England and Wales. It has been an offence in Scotland since 2010, when it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism. Ms Creasy's amendment to the draft law has been backed by MPs including former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. Writing forthe Metro,external, Ms Creasy called for an extension of a pilot project by Nottinghamshire Police, which has been recording misogynistic behaviour as either hate crime or hate incidents, depending on whether or not it is criminal. ""Crimes like upskirting don't happen in a vacuum,"" she said. ""They happen in a world where we don't see violence against women as a priority for action; where we tell young women to not walk around late at night as a way of staying safe, rather than those who hassle them that their behaviour is unacceptable."" Misogyny involves showing dislike, contempt or ingrained prejudice against women. The amended law would allow a sentencing judge to take into account if the offender ""demonstrated towards the victim of the offence hostility based on the victim having (or being presumed to have) a particular sex characteristic"". A Ministry of Justice spokesman said of Ms Creasy's amendment: ""We already have robust legislation that can be used to protect women from a range of crimes. ""We are determined to see the upskirting bill passed as soon as possible, to better protect victims and bring offenders to justice.""

Firefighter backs Grenfell stay-put advice,"Alan Moore told the inquiry: ""We did more than our best."" Advice given to residents to stay-put during the Grenfell Tower fire was ""good"" and ""should have worked"", a firefighter has told an inquiry. Alan Moore said there would have been more casualties had people on higher floors been told to evacuate. The stay-put policy is based on the theory buildings can be designed to prevent fire spreading between flats. But reports submitted to the inquiry have suggested that major changes to the tower destroyed that protection. The advice was in place until 02:47 BST - nearly two hours after the fire started at the west London tower block on 14 June last year. Why was 'stay put' advice so disastrous? What happened at Grenfell Tower? Listen: The Grenfell Tower Inquiry with Eddie Mair Mr Moore, who recently retired after 30 years in the fire service, was watch manager on the night of the fire, guiding crews and residents out of the tower. He said the stay-put policy should have worked at Grenfell Tower, ""should the building have done what it was supposed to have done"". ""I don't think any training could have prepared us to deal with what happened at Grenfell Tower that night,"" he said. ""It was a situation that developed and went way beyond the process we were trained to."" ""We did more than our best,"" he added. Asked about the advantages and disadvantages of advising those on higher floors to evacuate, he said: ""In hindsight I think there would have been a lot more casualties. ""People would have been overcome with smoke much more quickly. It would have blocked the stairwell and it would have made rescues more difficult."" In his written statement, Mr Moore also criticised a police helicopter near the tower for giving people ""false hope"" they would be rescued from the building's roof. ""You could hear people and see people shouting and pointing at the helicopter behind me and to my right,"" he said. The inquiry also heard that firefighters were not given enough oxygen to reach the higher floors of the tower. Another retired firefighter, Gary Moore, told the inquiry crews ""desperately needed"" more oxygen. ""The [breathing] sets were running out too early. As soon as the FF (firefighters) were getting up the floors they were having to come straight back down, unable to carry out any rescues or fire-fighting,"" Mr Moore said in his statement. On the night of the fire, Mr Moore was responsible for deploying breathing apparatus. Mr Moore said there should have been more extended breathing apparatus available. ""We had a vast amount of standard BA (breathing apparatus) units. ""However, we stopped using them after about an hour of me being there as they didn't provide an adequate amount of breathing time."" The public inquiry continues.

Myanmar military must face justice - Hunt,"The plight of hundreds of thousands of Rohingya people is said to be the world's fastest growing refugee crisis The UK is to ""take a stand"" and push for military leaders in Myanmar to be ""brought to justice"" over claims of genocide, the foreign secretary says. Jeremy Hunt told MPs the perpetrators of appalling crimes against Royingya Muslims ""must be brought to justice"". He said he would urge foreign ministers at the UN to refer the leadership to the International Criminal Court. More than 700,000 Rohingya have fled violence in Myanmar in the last year. Last week, a UN reportsaid top military figures in the country must be investigated for genocide. Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Mr Hunt said the UK had a ""special responsibility to act"" and confirmed he would be launching a diplomatic effort on the matter later this month. ""Ethnic cleansing in whatever shape or form, wherever it happens, should never go unpunished and the perpetrators of these appalling crimes must be brought to justice,"" Mr Hunt told MPs. ""There was gang rape, assaults on children, villages razed, and, in northern Rakhine, mass extermination and mass deportations. ""This is the kind of issue where countries that believe in civilised values have to take a stand and make sure that justice is done."" Blow by blow: How a 'genocide' was investigated What next for Myanmar after damning report? Who are the Rohingya Muslims? Mr Hunt said he intended to host a ""high-level meeting of ministers"" at the UN General Assembly but acknowledged a referral to the ICC had to come from the UN Security Council, with the backing of the five permanent members. ""At the moment it is not clear that there would be consensus on the Security Council to deliver that."" China, which has a close economic and diplomatic relationship with Myanmar, is expected to try to veto any attempt. Mr Hunt also said he wanted to visit Myanmar and raise the matter with authorities there, including the country's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi who has faced criticism for failing to stop the violence. This video can not be played Rohingya girls in danger: The stories of three young women Last week, the UK urged the Security Council to take ""concerted action"" over crimes committed against Rohingya Muslims, after the UN report called for the country's military leaders to be prosecuted. The report is the strongest condemnation from the UN so far and calls for the case to be referred to the ICC. It names six senior military figures it believes should go on trial and sharply criticises Nobel Peace Prize laureate Aung San Suu Kyi. Myanmar has rejected the report and has consistently said its operations targeted militant or insurgent threats. The Rohingya are one of many ethnic minorities in Myanmar but the government sees them as illegal immigrants from neighbouring Bangladesh and denies them citizenship.

Viagogo sues Ed Sheeran's promoter,"Ed Sheeran's promoter is being sued by ticket reseller Viagogo for allegedly defrauding music fans. Viagogo claims that Stuart Galbraith's firm, Kilimanjaro Live, set up fake Viagogo stalls during Mr Sheeran's 2017 tour where it voided genuine tickets and told fans to buy new ones. Mr Galbraith described Viagogo's allegations as ""totally false"". Viagogo's move is the latest in a long-running feud between artists and their promoters and ticket resellers. Viagogo taken to High Court by competition regulator Ed Sheeran fans fume over invalid tickets as stadium tour begins How Ed Sheeran is tackling ticket touts Mr Sheeran himself has been vocal in criticising secondary ticketing sites for snapping up thousands of tickets only to resell them above their face value. Swiss-based Viagogo filed the lawsuit against Mr Galbraith and Kilimanjaro Live a day before both companies are due to appear in front of the Department for Media, Culture and Sport select committee. Christopher Miller, head of business development at Viagogo, will face questions from MPs, including about the firm's conduct. Analysis: Simon Jack, business editor This is the latest move in a long-running and bitter feud. Both sides accuse the other of ripping off fans. The Competition and Markets Authority issued court proceedings last month against Viagogo, accusing the company of giving customers misleading information about the availability and popularity of tickets, thus pressuring fans into needlessly hasty purchases of expensive tickets. It also got into hot water with the Advertising Standards Authority for failing to publish the full price of tickets including booking fees and VAT - although the company has since satisfied those concerns. The timing of the filing of this lawsuit looks tactical, given that Stuart Galbraith and other senior executives from the ticket reselling industry will be facing a committee of MPs on Wednesday. Proceedings are at an early stage and the BBC has not seen the evidence on which Viagogo's allegations are based. But the latest allegations, that Stuart Galbraith's campaign against Viagogo involved unlawful and fraudulent behaviour, seem to have ensured that this nasty dispute just got a lot nastier. Last week,the Competition and Markets Authority filed a lawsuit against Viagogo,externalover concerns it is breaking consumer protection law. The competition watchdog took action against the big four secondary ticket sites last November. However, while StubHub, Get Me In and Seatwave promised to change their business model, Viagogo failed to make the changes required resulting in the High Court legal action. At the time, Viagogo failed to respond to a request for comment about the lawsuit. Mr Galbraith will also appear in front of the select committee alongside Ticketmaster UK's managing director Andrew Parsons and Wayne Grierson, UK managing director of StubHub. Mr Galbraith issued a statement describing Viagogo's allegations as ""ludicrous, laughable and most importantly, totally false"". He said his firm would ""defend against this action vigorously and look forward to doing so in court"".

Pallett quits radio show amid punch row,"Roxanne Pallett has apologised to Ryan Thomas Roxanne Pallett has quit her job on a local radio station in the wake of her appearance on Celebrity Big Brother. The soap star, who has branded herself ""the most hated girl in Britain"" after she accused fellow housemate Ryan Thomas of assault, stepped down from York-based Minster FM. She previously presented the station's breakfast show. Minster FM said she was leaving ""to take some time out and reflect on recent events"". It said the 35-year-old had quit with ""immediate effect"" after discussions with her representatives, and would not be returning to her role alongside co-host Ben Fry. The former Emmerdale star also pulled out of playing Cinderella in a pantomime in Chesterfield. Roxanne Pallett: 'I apologise to Ryan' Pallett leaves CBB house after 'punch' 11,000 complaints over CBB 'punching' episode Pallett faced a huge backlash from the public after accusing Thomas of punching her repeatedly, ""like a boxer punches a bag"", inside the Celebrity Big Brother House. He was given a formal warning, and Pallett was seen repeating her claims to other housemates. She also called the ex-Coronation Street actor a liar when he disputed her version of events. It prompted a wave of criticism, with many, including Thomas' girlfriend Lucy Mecklenburgh, branding Pallett's accusation ""a complete lie"". The actress walked out of the Channel 5 show on Friday night after hearing a chorus of boos and chants of ""Get Roxanne out"" from the crowd. Prior to the live eviction, viewers saw Thomas break down in the house's diary room, saying the accusations had ""broken"" him. Pallett has since apologised, saying she overreacted. Ryan Thomas was accused of punching Roxanne Speaking on Channel 5's Jeremy Vine programmea day after her eviction from the house, she said: ""I massively apologise to Ryan, his friends and fans and every single person who watched that. ""[It was] an overreaction to what wasn't a malicious act. ""I was sensitive and emotional and mistook what was playful - I apologise for it, I shouldn't have questioned his motivation."" In a second interview, Pallett was grilled by Celebrity Big Brother host Emma Willis, who questioned her apparent u-turn. The incident hasattracted more than 11,000 complaintsto media watchdog Ofcom.

Kuenssberg: Way out of the mess?,"When Parliament packed up for its summer break, the Labour Party was already knee deep in a fierce fight about whether to accept in full what so many other organisations agree is how to describe anti-Semitism. It wasn't entirely surprising they ended up there, given that under Mr Corbyn's leadership fears about anti-Semitism have been raised on many, many occasions. But over the summer the mess got deeper and deeper, with new allegations about Mr Corbyn's own views and associations emerging. The definition itself became a totem of whether the party was serious about stamping out prejudice. Finally today, Labour's ruling body agreed they would adopt the whole version, despite the clamour from some protestors outside its meeting. Labour adopts anti-Semitism definition A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims Perhaps this marks the beginning of the end of this sorry mess. But what makes an early resolution tricky is the caveat that Labour has included alongside. It will be important to many of Mr Corbyn's supporters who want the right to criticise Israel. But for those campaigning against anti-Semitism, it still sends a message that Labour might want to make exceptions, that the party is saying ""yes, but"", rather than ""yes, of course"", to loud demands from the Jewish community that they take the strongest action possible against those who would foment tension. And secondly, detractors will point to the statement I'm told Mr Corbyn himself suggested should be included alongside, which incorporated the following line -  ""It should not be considered anti-Semitic to describe Israel, its policies or the circumstances around its foundation as racist because of their discriminatory impact, or to support another settlement of the Israel-Palestine conflict."" That's not so different to one of the clauses that has been at the heart of the summer's dispute. And after hours of argument it was clear that the NEC, the ruling body, simply would not accept it. It's a measure of how serious the problem has become that even with his tight grip on the party, Mr Corbyn didn't get his own way. But his personal desire to preserve that element in the Labour definition will be seen by many of his critics as a sign that he still doesn't get it. There will also still be a consultation on the NEC's decision, as well as many cases of alleged anti-Semitism to resolve. There is still some way to go before the party has a hope of drawing a final line.

TSB boss to step down after IT fiasco,"TSB chief Paul Pester is to step down after seven years in charge, in the wake of a major IT failure at the bank. In April this year, customers were left without access to online banking services for several weeks when an attempt to move data to a new computer system went wrong. The bank is still struggling to get its IT systems to work properly. On Monday, it apologised to customerswho faced disruption to their online and mobile banking over the weekend. Following Mr Pester's departure, TSB chairman Richard Meddings will take on the role of executive chairman until a new chief executive is appointed. Mr Meddings said: ""Although there is more to do to achieve full stability for customers, the bank's IT systems and services are much improved since the IT migration. Paul and the Board have therefore agreed that this is the right time to appoint a new CEO for TSB."" Nicky Morgan, chair of the Treasury Committee, said she felt Mr Pester's decision was the correct one. ""Since the IT problems at TSB began, Paul Pester set the tone for TSB's complacent and misleading public communications,"" she said. ""In this light, it is right that he is stepping down, but the committee remains concerned about the continuing problems at TSB, including unacceptable delays in compensating customers who have been badly let down."" Mr Pester walks away with a payout worth nearly Â£1.7m, made up of Â£1.2m severance pay and a ""historical"" bonus of around Â£480,000 from before TSB's takeover by Sabadell in 2015. All other performance-related pay - including a bonus linked to the customer migration  - was frozen amid investigations into the IT fiasco. Analysis by Simon Jack, BBC business editor After April's IT meltdown at TSB, many people thought Paul Pester was a dead man walking. Although he toughed it out after that - he'd used all of his nine lives. Problems flared up briefly in August and more problems over the last 24 hours drove the final nail into the coffin. Some will feel that he was a victim of circumstances beyond his control. The new system was built, designed and tested on the watch of Sabadell, TSB's Spanish owners who were convinced the system was ready. However, IBM - who were drafted in to help with the crisis - said in a report that the system had not been tested sufficiently, and Mr Pester himself came across as complacent to many MPs. The IT debacle cost TSB Â£176m and 26,000 customers closed their accounts (although 20,000 new accounts were opened offsetting some of the damage). The bank and Mr Pester's reputation took a heavy knock. Ultimately the buck stops with the chief executive and on Tuesday morning he paid the perhaps inevitable personal price. Read more from Simon Paul Pester joined Lloyds Banking Group in 2010 and was appointed to lead the launch of TSB and its separation from Lloyds in 2011. TSB was launched in 2013 and was floated off in 2014 before being bought by Spanish bank Sabadell in 2015. Part of the transfer involved migrating customer records from the Lloyds Banking Group platform to the Sabadell Proteo platform which started on 20 April 2018. That proved a disasterwith many customers being locked out of their accounts and some customers being given access to the confidential records of others. The problems continued for many weeks and TSB came under fierce criticism for the IT failings. MPs on the Treasury Committee called on Mr Pester to resign. But he remained in his post, and said: ""I'm focused 100% on putting things right for our customers."" In June, the Financial Conduct Authority launched a formal investigation into the meltdown. Its chief executive, Andrew Bailey, took the unusual step of making the probe public, ""given the level of public interest"". In July, TSB said the IT meltdown had cost Â£176.4m and pushed it to a half-year loss. The happy couple unhappy with TSB Being unable to get access to their TSB account at the height of the computer crisis earlier this year left many customers with big problems. Lorna McHale's marriage to Ben Connolly in May was hit as the couple had their wedding savings in a TSB account they couldn't access. She said she had to ""ring to grovel"" with suppliers for their wedding, including the DJ, the wedding car provider, and those doing her hair and make-up, all of which were small businesses. Their case was raised by MPs grilling TSB chiefs during a Treasury Committee hearing. The good news is that the wedding day went well despite the financial stress beforehand. In fact TSB called her the day before the big event to apologise and offer her Â£100 compensation for all the distress the bank had caused. Lorna accepted the offer despite feeling it was a little low. She said: ""They told me they'd read my story on the BBC and so knew it was the day before my wedding. I felt they took advantage of my stressed situation to offer low compensation."" She said she's now planning to switch banks.

Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes,"A Bob Woodward expose book has been a rite of passage for presidential administrations since the storied investigative reporter first made a name for himself by breaking Richard Nixon's Watergate scandal. Now it's Donald Trump's turn under the microscope. The picture revealed - of an administration having a ""nervous breakdown of executive power"" - is unflattering in the extreme. Donald Trump's supporters will say, not without cause, that Woodward epitomises the Washington establishment their man is fighting against. It's also true, however, that the reporter has unrivalled access to the corridors of power, and the general Washington consensus is that it's better to talk to him than not, since your colleagues - and enemies - are certainly giving him their side of the story. While the accounts inFear: Trump in the White House,externalare provided on ""deep background"" - i.e. without attribution - the episodes Woodward recounts and the quotes he uses come from those in the room - and often, in fact, from the people who were doing the speaking. The White House, and the president himself, have since responded to the book, calling it ""fabricated stories"" by ""former disgruntled employees"". ""It's just another bad book,"" Mr Trump told the Daily Caller during an interview, adding that Woodward ""has a a lot of credibility problems"". Here's a look at some of the blockbuster revelations that have emerged so far from early excerpts of Woodward's book. Woodward describes several instances where Trump administration officials - chief economic adviser Gary Cohn and White House Staff Secretary Rob Porter, in particular - removed documents from the president's desk to keep Mr Trump from signing them. It was all part of a larger effort to insulate the administration, and the nation, from what they saw as Mr Trump's more dangerous impulses. Documents that would have allowed the president to withdraw the nation from the North American Free Trade Agreement and a trade deal with South Korea were hidden - and the US has since committed to renegotiating the pacts. Woodward describes these acts as ""no less than an administrative coup d'etat"". 'Don't testify. It's either that or an orange jumpsuit' - John Dowd On 27 January, according to Woodward, the president's personal attorney John Dowd staged a mock interview session with the president to demonstrate what he feared would be the disastrous results if Mr Trump were to sit down with Robert Mueller's special counsel team investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia. It didn't go well, as the president grew increasingly frustrated with the intensity of the questioning, at one point angrily calling the investigation ""a goddamn hoax"". Dowd would go on to meet Mr Mueller and reportedly tell him that he couldn't agree to the interview because he didn't want to let the president ""look like an idiot"" and embarrass the nation on the world stage. When it later appeared that the president had changed his mind and was going to testify after all, Mr Dowd resigned. One of the sources of considerable consternation for the president's staff, per Woodward, was what they viewed as his dangerous impulses on foreign policy. After the US believed the Syrian government had launched another chemical attack in April 2017, Mr Trump told Defence Secretary James Mattis to assassinate President Bashar Assad. ""Let's kill the [expletive] lot of them,"" the president reportedly said. Mr Mattis acknowledged Mr Trump's request then, after the conversation, told an aide he wouldn't do ""any of that"". Woodward says administration officials were also concerned when the president asked for plans for a pre-emptive military strike on North Korea during the height of his feud with Kim Jong-un. The president also dressed down top generals over their handling of the war in Afghanistan, saying that soldiers ""on the ground"" could do a better job. ""How many more deaths?"" he asked. ""How many more lost limbs? How much longer are we going to be there?"" Woodward paints a picture of a White House staff constantly beaten down and belittled by a temperamental president. When White House economic adviser Cohn tried to resign after the president offered sympathetic comments about white nationalists who engaged in a violent August 2017 rally in Charlottesville, Mr Trump accused him of ""treason"". Cohn, according to Woodward, views the president as a ""professional liar"". Mr Trump also told Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross he didn't trust him. ""I don't want you doing any more negotiations,"" the president reportedly said. ""You're past your prime."" He compared his first chief of staff, Reince Priebus, to a rat. ""He just scurries around."" As for Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who the president has publicly berated, privately he was even more disparaging. ""This guy is mentally retarded,"" Mr Trump reportedly told staff secretary Porter. ""He's this dumb Southerner. He couldn't even be a one-person country lawyer down in Alabama"". Trump attacks Sessions over prosecutions If the president was abusive toward his staff, it appears they have got some measure of revenge in the Woodward book, which is chock full of caustic quotes about the president attributed to the aides and advisers who serve him. Chief of Staff Kelly repeatedly calls Mr Trump an ""idiot"" and said that ""it's pointless to try to convince him of anything"". Defence Secretary Mattis told an aide that the president has the foreign policy understanding of a ""fifth- or sixth-grader"" (an 11 or 12-year-old). Mr Kelly's predecessor, Reince Priebus, describes the presidential bedroom suite as ""the devil's workshop"", where Mr Trump fires off intemperate tweets early in the morning and on weekends. Mr Trump's relationship with Rex Tillerson reportedly never recovered after news accounts that the former secretary of state once called the president ""a [expletive] moron"". If that's the case, Woodward's book could cause serious damage within the White House in the coming days. In a pre-emptive strike against what is sure to be a furious White House pushback against the book,the Washington Post released an audio recording and transcript,externalof a call the president made to Woodward in early August. In it, the president claims he was never contacted for an interview or informed of Woodward's soon-to-be-published work - an assertion the reporter successfully rebuts. Mr Trump makes several attempts to steer conversation toward his foreign policy achievements and economic record as president. ""Nobody's ever done a better job than I'm doing as president,"" he says. ""That I can tell you."" Woodward says through his interviews he ""gained a lot of insight and documentation"" - and that his book would be a ""tough look at the world and your administration and you."" ""I assume that means it's going to be a negative book,"" the president replies. Woodward concludes the call by saying ""I believe in our country, and because you're our president, I wish you good luck"". If his book is any indication, Woodward probably thinks Mr Trump will need all the luck he can get.

'Mob rule' rocks Senate hearing for judge,"This video can not be played Kavanaugh hearing 'according to mob rule' The confirmation hearing for US President Donald Trump's Supreme Court nominee has descended into ""mob rule"", a Republican senator said. John Cornyn of Texas spoke out as Democrats demanded an adjournment. Seventy people were arrested as protesters interrupted the proceedings. Brett Kavanaugh faces four days before the Senate Judiciary Committee. If approved, the conservative appeals court judge would be expected to tilt the court's balance to the right. Minutes after Mr Kavanaugh, 53, entered the committee rooms on Tuesday, the hearing was disrupted by angry shouts from members of the public and lawmakers alike. Key questions for Kavanaugh to answer Brett Kavanaugh (R) faces four days before the Senate Judiciary Committee The mostly female demonstrators shouted out that Mr Kavanaugh would allow President Trump to pardon himself. Others claimed the judge would let people with pre-existing medical conditions be stripped of medical coverage. ""This is a travesty of justice!"" shouted one. Another cried: ""Our democracy is broken!"" Amid the almost continuous disruption, Texas Republican John Cornyn said it was ""the first confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court justice I've seen basically according to mob rule"". Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley of Iowa bridled at the suggestion he had lost control of the proceedings. The US Capitol Police said 61 people were removed from the committee room and arrested for disorderly conduct. A further nine were charged with crowding, obstructing or incommoding in the building. Protesters dressed as characters from The Handmaid's Tale The Trump administration has refused to release thousands of documents about the judge's work for President George W Bush. The White House cited ""constitutional privilege"". Democrats are demanding they be allowed to review the 100,000 documents about Mr Kavanaugh's record. At least 20 protesters were removed from the hearing room They are also up in arms that some 42,000 documents were released to the committee just on the eve of the hearing. Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey said they would have had to read 7,000 pages an hour overnight just to review the files shared on Monday evening. But the panel chairman refused to delay the process. Vermont's Democrat Patrick Leahy said it was the ""least transparent vetting for any Supreme Court nominee I have ever seen"". But Republican Senator Orrin Hatch dismissed the concerns raised about the judge as ""ridiculous"". This man was protesting when Mr Kavanaugh arrived Democrats have warned that Mr Trump's choice will usher in a more socially conservative approach to abortion, gay rights and gun control. Senior Democrat Dianne Feinstein questioned in her opening remarks on Tuesday whether the nominee would leave the landmark Roe v Wade abortion law untouched if confirmed. The nine-justice court has until now been balanced between conservatives and liberals, with Anthony Kennedy considered the ""swing vote"". He retired in July. They are also concerned about his argument in a 2009 legal article that a sitting president should be immune to prosecution. President Trump said the judge's critics were ""despicable"".

Woodward on Trump - the explosive quotes In his opening statement, Mr Kavanaugh pledged to be a neutral arbiter of the law. ""The Supreme Court must never be viewed as a partisan institution,"" he said. ""The justices on the Supreme Court do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle."" He said: ""If confirmed to the Supreme Court, I will keep an open mind in every case. I will do equal right to the poor and to the rich."" Mr Kavanaugh also told senators: ""My judicial philosophy is straightforward. A judge must be independent and must interpret the law and not make the law."" This video can not be played Supreme Court nominee Kavanaugh: 'I'm a team player' Republicans have a slim majority in the 100-seat upper house. They can confirm Mr Kavanaugh if they stay united. So far, there are no signs of Republican defections. Not all Democrats have said they will oppose Mr Kavanaugh, and several may even support his nomination. The Senate is likely to vote on confirmation by the end of the month. The court begins its next term in October. More than 20 witnesses are being called for the coming days of hearings. Democrat Cory Booker pleaded for the hearing to be delayed How could Kavanaugh impact the Supreme Court? A resident of the wealthy Washington suburb of Chevy Chase, Mr Kavanaugh studied law at Yale. He worked under special counsel Kenneth Starr in his investigation into President Bill Clinton's relationship with intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s. Under George W Bush, he served as deputy White House counsel and, from 2003-06, as Mr Bush's staff secretary. A Catholic, he has been a US Court of Appeals judge in Washington for the past 11 years.

Mourinho 'gets suspended jail sentence',"Manchester United manager JosÃ© Mourinho is reported to have reached a deal with the Spanish state over a long-running tax dispute. He was accused of owing nearly â¬3.3m in undeclared image rights revenue for 2011 and 2012, when he was Real Madrid manager - an allegation he disputed. Spain's El Mundo newspaper reported he had agreed to pay a fine of â¬2m (Â£1.8m; $2.3m). Mr Mourinho said earlier he had paid all the taxes he owed. El Mundo also reported that he had accepted a one-year suspended jail sentence. But sources close to the manager said no prison term had been imposed or accepted. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? Spanish authorities launched the image rights case against Mr Mourinho in June last year. His representatives, Gestifute Media, said at the time that he had paid more than â¬26m in tax at an average rate of more than 41% while living in Spain from 2010 to 2013. In 2015, Gestifute said, he accepted a settlement agreement regarding previous years. Spanish courts recently cracked down on tax evasion among footballers: In June,Real Madrid and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo accepted a â¬18.8m fine and was given a suspended jail termto settle charges against him In July 2017,Barcelona player Lionel Messi avoided a 21-month prison sentenceby agreeing to pay â¬252,000, equating to â¬400 for each day of the sentence Mourinho denies Spain tax fraud New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Do you know your heart age?,"Public Health England is urging people over 30 to take anonline test,externalto find out their heart age, which indicates if they are at increased risk of suffering a heart attack or a stroke. They predict about 80% of heart attacks and strokes in people under 75 could be prevented if heart health was improved. Unhealthy lifestyles put four in five adults at risk of early death, they estimate. People should quit smoking, eat a healthy diet and get enough exercise. The test is not diagnostic - it will not tell you whether you are going to have a heart attack - but it can be a wake-up call to make healthy changes. David Green, who is 59,took the test,external. ""The worst moment was being told my heart is 10 years older than me and that my life expectancy was shortened,"" he told the BBC. ""That took some digesting for sure, but I flipped it to a positive statement to do something to reverse that scenario."" David took the test after he struggled to keep up with rehearsals for his role in The Full Monty with his local theatre company in Plymouth. He had never heard of heart age, but said he would have guessed he was only a few years off. ""I'm 59 now so I thought 'oh maybe it'll be 62 or 63', so a whole 10 years - that was a real shocker. ""They told me that 'you really need to do something otherwise you're not going to see that much of your pension'. ""I think that was the main thing for me, I'd just retired, I'd like to live a bit longer thank you very much."" Obesity, poor diet, a lack of exercise and high blood pressure are significant risk factors for the heart that can be changed. This video can not be played The first date that ended with a heart attack Give up smoking Get active Manage your weight Eat more fibre Cut down on saturated fat Get your five a day fruit and vegetables Cut down on salt Eat fish Drink less alcohol Read labels on food and drink packaging Source:NHS Choices,external Almost two million people have taken the heart age test and 78% of participants have a heart age higher than their actual age, putting them at greater risk of an early death. Of those, 34% were more than five years over their actual age and 14% at least 10 years higher. More than 84,000 people die from a heart attack or stroke each year in England. Dr Matt Kearney, from NHS England, said the test has the ""potential to help millions of people"". The test is being backed by the British Heart Foundation and the Stroke Association. Juliet Bouverie, chief executive at the Stroke Association, said: ""We believe that across the UK there are around six million people who are undiagnosed and untreated for high blood pressure or atrial fibrillation, two of the biggest risk factors for stroke. ""However, treatment for these conditions can significantly reduce your risk of stroke and the devastation it causes."" The test asks 16 simple physical and lifestyle questions and gives an estimation of your heart age, and a prediction of the risk of having a heart attack or stroke by a certain age. It also gives suggestions on lifestyle changes to help people reduce their heart age. One year after quitting smoking, a person's risk of heart disease is about half that of a smoker's Doing the recommended amount ofweekly exercise,external- at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic exercise, such as cycling or brisk walking - can reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke Increasing the amount of fruit and veg from three portions daily to more than five can lower the risk of heart disease or stroke You can do the testhere.,external David joined the gym, cut down on his alcohol intake and is eating much more healthily. He says taking control of his health and knowing what he's dealing with is very satisfying and empowering. So far David has lost two stone and his BMI has come down by six points. ""I want to have a long and happy and healthy retirement and that's what it's about now - I've worked for 40 years continuously and I want to be enjoying things, I don't want to be hobbling around on a stick, which I could have easily been doing by now. ""I know when I've had those temptations to have an extra pint of beer or glass of wine I know I've got to do something about that as a forfeit - it's good, it's an empowering thing to do."" Maureen Talbot, Senior Cardiac Nurse at British Heart Foundation, said: ""The goal of the Heart Age Tool is not to diagnose any heart conditions but to make people more aware of risks to their heart health and give them the incentive to make simple lifestyle changes. ""If you are concerned about your heart age, you should speak to your GP.""

Football abuse survivor helps Hollyoaks,"Buster Smith, played by Nathan Sussex (left) with Ollie Morgan, played by Aedan Duckworth One of the victims of football coach Barry Bennell has been advising Hollyoaks on its current football abuse storyline. Steve Walters said the plot, which sees coach Buster groom Ollie, is ""very difficult to watch"" but ""spot on"". Walters was among those who spoke out about Bennell, leading to himbeing jailed in Februaryfor abusing boys. ""We all know it's still going on today, and worse than ever, so this is such an important issue,"" Walters said. Once regarded as one of England's most promising young players, Walters was abused from the age of 12 when he would stay at Bennell's house during the school holidays. Along with Duncan Craig, chief executive of male abuse charity Survivors Manchester, he has been working with Hollyoaks to make sure their scripts are realistic - within the limits of what can be shown in its 18.30 timeslot. Steve Walters (centre) with Duncan Craig (left) and actors Aedan Duckworth, Nathan Sussex and Adam Woodward Viewers of the Channel 4 show have seen Buster Smith, played by Nathan Sussex, prey on teenage aspiring footballer Ollie Morgan, played by Aedan Duckworth. The plot reaches a climax this week and Walters, who now runs The Offside Trust, joined the cast at a Royal Television Society preview screening in Salford on Monday. ""It was very difficult to watch,"" he said afterwards. He praised the cast but said it had been ""uncomfortable"" to meet Sussex because certain things about Buster reminded him of Bennell. He added: ""Watching that tonight was certainly very realistic. I know you've got the timeslot, which can be quite frustrating, but the way the grooming process by Buster was [shown was] spot on, to be fair."" This video can not be played Steve Walters speaking in 2016: 'I was inconsolable' Walters and Craig suggested changes to scripts in an attempt to ensure they were true to life. Craig said he believed Hollyoaks had contributed to an increase in survivors of abuse contacting his charity since the storyline had been on air, while Walters said people had contacted him directly. ""I've had somebody in their 20s contact me - they've watched Hollyoaks and that's been the trigger for them to come forward,"" he said. ""So even if nobody else comes forward, there's one more person who has."" In February, Barry Bennell was jailed for 31 years for 50 counts of child sexual abuse. Described as the ""devil incarnate"" by the judge at Liverpool Crown Court, he was convicted of abusing 12 boys aged eight to 15 between 1979 and 1991.

Carney willing to stay on as Bank governor,"This video can not be played Mark Carney said an announcement on his future would be made in ""due course"" Mark Carney has said he is willing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England if it will help the government ""smooth"" the Brexit transition. Mr Carney is due to step down from the role in June 2019 and told the Treasury Committee that he has been talking to the chancellor about his future. He said he was happy to do whatever he could ""to promote a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank"". Mr Carney added that an announcement on his future would be made soon. However, he added that it was not down to him to make that announcement. ""We (the Bank) have a very important supportive role to make sure whatever Brexit the government negotiates, that Parliament decides, that that is as much of a success as possible,"" he said. ""I made them aware of my willingness to do what I can to support the process. ""It's an important time and we have an important supporting role to make sure that, whatever Brexit the government negotiates and Parliament decides, that it is as much of a success as possible. Providing a measure of continuity during this period should help that."" After the hearing, Treasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan said: ""Stability is vital during this important period. The sooner the government provides clarity, the better."" Carney: No-deal Brexit highly undesirable Mark Carney upbeat on UK growth Mark Carney: The 'film star' Bank of England governor There has been speculation about the future of Mr Carney, who replaced Mervyn King in 2013 to become the first non-Briton to be appointed in the Bank of England's 300-year history. He previously announced that he would step down on 30 June 2019 - two years short of the usual eight-year term that governors tend to serve. But there has been a lot of talk in recent days that the government would like him to remain in post for longer. It is thought the Treasury would like to allow more time to recruit his successor, amid concern that few candidates would want to take on the role during an unpredictable stage of the Brexit process. The pound edged up slightly against both the dollar and the euro after Mr Carney's comments. Former Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance toldBBC Radio 4's World at Onethat the speculation about Mr Carney's position was ""not very good for the credibility and independence of the Bank of England"". He said the process of appointing a successor should proceed in line with the timetable initially agreed with the governor and added: ""It seems an awful lot is happening in this appointment process behind the scenes and that is not good in terms of the independence of the Bank of England."" Mr Carney has overseen two rate rises at the Bank of England Mr Carney has divided opinion, receiving both praise and criticism. He is credited with deftly handling the UK economy as it emerged from the upheaval of the 2008 global financial crisis. But pro-Brexit campaigners accuse him of ""crying wolf"" before the 2016 referendum, when he predicted voting to leave the EU could trigger a recession. Some, like former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, have called on him to resign. Last month,he was labelled the ""high priest of Project Fear""by the leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. His comments came after Mr Carney warned that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". He told the BBC's Today programme that such an outcome was ""highly undesirable"". Mr Carney has also faced criticism of his so-called use of ""forward guidance"". Under his leadership, the Bank had originally said it would not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate fell to 7% or below. But when that seemed likely to happen much sooner than anticipated, the Bank altered its stance, saying it would focus on a range of economic variables instead. Interest rates have now risen twice - to 0.75% - since he took over.

Amazon market value tops $1tn,"Amazon has briefly become the second US-listed firm to have a market value of more than $1 trillion (Â£779bn). Shares in the e-commerce giant rose nearly 2% to a high of $2,050.50 in morning trade before slipping back. Apple reached the same milestone in early August. Founded in 1994, Amazon is now the world's largest online retailer. Its chief executive, Jeff Bezos, is the world's richest man, with a net worth of more than $160bn. How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData Retail, said: ""To reach a market capitalisation of over $1tn is impressive. To do it in a little over 24 years is extraordinary. ""That Amazon has achieved this demonstrates its dramatic advancement in both the retail and technology sectors, as well as the influence it now wields over large parts of the consumer landscape."" Analysis: Kim Gittleson, New York business correspondent Like a pesky younger sibling, Amazon might be second to the symbolic trillion-dollar milestone - but when it comes to its rivalry with Apple, it's been quicker to hit nearly every hundred-billion dollar valuation hurdle. For instance, it took Amazon just 16 days, compared to Apple's 622 days, to go from a market value of $600bn to $700bn, according to the Wall Street Journal. This acceleration makes sense in a way, because Amazon spent most of its time as a public company reporting losses or negligible profits. Founder Jeff Bezos consistently said he would rather reinvest sales revenue into the company to give it a better, more profitable future. It's a strategy that seems to have paid off: Amazon reported $2.5bn in profit last quarter, making it one of Wall Street's most profitable companies. And the future seems bright. Even more so than Apple, Amazon is in the business of how we'll live in the future. Although nearly half of every dollar spent online by an American goes to Amazon, e-commerce still makes up just 9% of total retail sales here. And Amazon has also become the market leader in cloud computing, with its Web Services business line consistently beating expectations. All of this suggests that when it comes to Amazon's growing market value, the best word to describe it might in fact be the name Mr Bezos reportedly initially had planned for the company: relentless. Amazon reported nearly $53bn in sales in the three months ended in June, with record quarterly profit of $2.5bn. The firm is expected to account for roughly half of all online shopping sales in the US this year - and nearly 5% of the country's overall retail market, according to research firm eMarketer. It employs more than 575,000 people, a force nearly the size of Luxembourg's population. It provides logistics, storage, loans and a selling platform to hundreds of thousands of third-party merchants. Its profitable cloud computing division, which hosts huge swathes of the corporate world on its data servers, is the industry's global leader.

Russian warplanes 'bomb Syria's Idlib',"The rebel-held town of Jadraya was among those hit on Tuesday Russian planes have reportedly bombed rebel-held targets in the Syrian province of Idlib, as government troops mass before an expected offensive. If confirmed, they would be the first such air strikes there in three weeks. Earlier, US President Donald Trump warned Syria's Bashar al-Assad against launching a ""reckless attack"" on Idlib. But Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov rejected the warning and said the Syrian army was ""getting ready"" to clear a ""cradle of terrorism"" there. Five reasons why the battle for Idlib matters Why is there a war in Syria? Mr Peskov said the al Qaeda-linked jihadists dominating in the north-western province of Idlib were threatening Russian military bases in Syria and blocking a political solution to the civil war. The UN has warned of a humanitarian catastrophe if an all-out assault takes place. The UN envoy to Syria, Staffan de Mistura, called on Russia and Turkey to act urgently to avert ""a bloodbath"" in Idlib. He said telephone talks between Russian President Vladimir Putin and his Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan ""would make a big difference"". Mr de Mistura also welcomed Mr Trump's comments on the issue, saying it was sending ""the right message"". The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that Russian jets had carried out about 30 strikes on about 16 rebel-held areas in western Idlib, the mountains of Latakia province, and the Sahl al-Ghab plain.

The pro-opposition Step News Agency reported Russian strikes on the villages of Inab, al-Janudiya, Tal Aawar, Sririf, Jadraya and al-Bariya. A news outlet affiliated to the al-Qaeda-linked jihadist alliance Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) posted photographs showing plumes of smoke rising from several villages. The Syria Civil Defence, whose rescue workers are commonly known as the White Helmets, reported that three civilians had been killed in the strikes on Jisr al-Shughour. The Syrian Observatory said the Russian air strikes were the first for 22 days and had come hours after three pro-government fighters were killed by rebel rocket fire in the Jabal Turkmen area of Latakia. Syrian army soldiers and allied militiamen have been gearing up for what has been described as a phased offensive on Idlib, the rebels' last remaining stronghold. Allow Twitter content?

HTS, which is designated by the UN as a terrorist organisation and has an estimated 10,000 fighters in Idlib, and rival rebel factions backed by neighbouring Turkey have said they will fight back. On Monday night, Mr Trump warned Russia and Iran, which has sent military advisers and thousands of militiamen to Syria, that they ""would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy"". On Tuesday, Mr Peskov questioned the US president's approach to solving the problem of HTS and other jihadists operating in Idlib. Rebel fighters in Idlib are preparing for an attack by pro-government forces ""To just make some warnings, not taking into account a very dangerous negative potential of the whole situation in Syria, is probably an incomplete, not all-encompassing approach,"" he was quoted as saying by Interfax news agency. The Kremlin spokesman said the situation in Idlib would top the agenda at a summit of the presidents of Russia, Iran and Turkey in Iran on Friday. Mr de Mistura has warned of a ""perfect storm"" if the government goes ahead with a full-scale offensive. The jihadists must be defeated but not at the expense of thousands of civilian lives, the UN envoy said last week. Hundreds of thousands of people in Idlib are already experiencing dire conditions He called for further talks on a political solution, or for humanitarian corridors to be set up to allow civilians to be evacuated temporarily to a safer area, most likely one under government control. The UN says Idlib is home to some 2.9 million people, including a million children. More than half of the civilians have already been displaced at least once from elsewhere in Syria and have nowhere left to go. UN officials say as many as 800,000 people could be displaced and that the already high number of people in need of aid could increase dramatically. ""A worst-case scenario in Idlib will overwhelm capacities and has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency at a scale not yet seen through this crisis,"" John Ging of the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned.

The challenge of accessing Facebook data,"CCTV footage showed Lucy McHugh half a mile away from the Southampton sports centre where she was found stabbed to death Police investigating the murder of 13-year-old Lucy McHugh have called for social media companies to respond to requests for information more quickly. But is this always possible - or desirable? I spoke to a detective recently, deeply frustrated by his dealings with one social media company. He specialises in combating child sexual exploitation online and as part of an investigation had found the profiles of a number of people - several were offenders who were grooming, abusing and blackmailing children - several more were the children themselves, victims of the grooming. None of them used their real names - they were effectively anonymous.  All he knew was that there were children at risk and offenders at liberty. He urgently requested information about these users from the tech company - it didn't even reply to his request. His example may be an isolated one, but it highlights the problem at the heart of this issue. How do police investigate a crime committed against a child in one country, by an offender living in another, using a platform based in a third? Met chief calls for quick Facebook access Facebook reveals rise in official data requests Facebook is a US company and so has to abide by US laws on data protection and due process - which means they have no duty to hand any information over to a foreign police force - only a request via the US Department of Justice using something called the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty will oblige disclosure.  But this is cumbersome, expensive and can take months. That said Facebook does have a choice in the matter - as a matter of policy it will hand over information if there's an immediate threat to life or the safety of a child.  If that's the case why not in the case of a murder inquiry? Last week, Stephen Nicholson, a suspect in the murder of Lucy McHugh, was jailed for 14 months having admitted failing to comply with an order under the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act requiring him to disclose a Facebook password. Detectives investigating the teenager's murder said it was taking an ""inordinate amount of time"" to access evidence from Facebook and Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick has called for detectives to have access to material from social media companies ""within minutes"". On its part Facebook says it already has a team that works with law enforcement and it has been co-operating with Hampshire Police on the Lucy McHugh case. A suspect in Lucy McHugh's murder has been jailed for refusing to disclose a Facebook password But there are other issues at play.  Some critics say the platform has just got too big and cannot effectively be policed. It now claims to have two billion users. In the first six months of last year it received almost 80,000 requests from police forces around the world.  That figure had risen by 20% since the year before. But tech companies do have a very fine line to tread. It would seem hard to object to a request made by a police officer in the UK investigating the murder of a child - but what if law enforcement in a repressive regime approaches Facebook wanting information on a blogger critical of the government? The convoluted legal process has a purpose - acting both as sword and shield.

Labour holds crunch anti-Semitism talks,"Jeremy Corbyn arrives at Labour HQ for the NEC meeting Labour's ruling body is meeting to discuss whether to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism following months of acrimony. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition was incorporated into Labour's code of conduct in July - but not all its examples were included. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he hoped the party's National Executive Committee would adopt all the examples. Rival protest groups are outside Labour HQ, where the NEC is meeting. Groups including Jewish Voice for Labour called on the committee to resist calls to adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. They argue that it would restrict freedom to criticise Israel's actions against Palestinians. Rival protesters, wrapped in Israeli flags, condemned Labour as ""for the many, not the Jew"" and chanted ""Labour fascists off our streets"". A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? The meeting comes as Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick told LBC radio she would review a leaked internal Labour dossier obtained by the radio station detailing 45 cases of alleged anti-Semitism, amid claims that as many as 17 might require reporting to the police. Labour's Deputy Leader Tom Watson said he hoped the NEC would adopt the full IHRA definition and that it would be the ""start of a new conversation with the Jewish community in Britain"". Labour MP Stephen Kinnock described the row as a ""battle for the soul"" of Labour. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the NEC should adopt the IHRA definition and all its examples - and that to add caveats, as some have suggested, would be ""like pouring more fuel on the fire"". Labour activist and journalist Michael Segalov agreed that the NEC should adopt all the IHRA examples but with some ""clarifications"" because, he told Today, some of them have the potential to ""veer off into restricting the right of Palestinians to describe their own experiences of oppression"". And he added: ""There are some people within the Labour Party who are using this as an opportunity to have digs at Jeremy Corbyn and have digs at the Labour Party more broadly."" A protest against changing the code has gathered outside the NEC meeting Rival protesters accused Labour of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn has insisted there is no place for prejudice of any kind within the party, amid accusations that he has not done enough to crack down on anti-Semitic comments by members and activists. The Labour leader says he is committed to protecting Jewish members from abuse while allowing vigorous debate about the role of Israel in the search for peace in the Middle East and justice for the Palestinians - issues he has campaigned on for decades. The party endorsedthe full IHRA definitionof anti-Semitism when it revised its code of conduct earlier this year after protests by Jewish groups against the party's handling of the issue. ""Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. ""Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."" But Labour left out these four of the IHRA's 11 examples of what is anti-Semitism: Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than to the interests of their own nations Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, for instance by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour Requiring of Israel a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis Labour argued that it had ""expanded and contextualised"" these examples to provide ""legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"" and in some cases had gone further than the IHRA. In anarticle for the Guardian last month,external, Mr Corbyn said: ""Our actual differences are in fact very small - they really amount to half of one example out of 11, touching on free speech in relation to Israel. ""It is unfortunately the case that this particular example, dealing with Israel and racism, has sometimes been used by those wanting to restrict criticism of Israel that is not anti-Semitic. The Commons Home Affairs Committee acknowledged this risk when it looked at the IHRA examples."" This video can not be played Stephen Kinnock says Jeremy Corbyn should ""show remorse"" in his conference speech The row has seen Mr Corbyn accused of anti-Semitism by former Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks and veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge - charges which he has strongly denied. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has said full adherence to the IHRA definition should be the first step in ""turning the tide"" of anti-Semitism within the party. But Jewish Voice for Labour, which backs Mr Corbyn's leadership, said support for the definition was not universal. It said it could not support it as it fell short of providing ""a clear and unambiguous statement based on attitudes to Jews as Jews, not attitudes to a country, Israel"". It comes amid a row overactivist Peter Willsman's re-electionto the NEC. Earlier this year, he suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks - remarks which were widely condemned and saw him disowned by the pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum. Mr Willsman was cheered by supporters as he arrived at Labour HQ for the NEC meeting but opponents shouted ""shame on you"" at him.

Franklin family found eulogy 'distasteful',"The pastor said his comments had been misunderstood Aretha Franklin's family have said that they found the closing eulogy at her funeral offensive and distasteful. The Rev. Jasper Williams Jr. said black America was losing ""its soul"" and described children raised without a father as ""abortion after birth"". ""He spoke for 50 minutes and at no time did he properly eulogise her,"" said Vaughn Franklin, the singer's nephew, speaking on behalf of the family. He added that his aunt did not choose the pastor to speak at her funeral. Instead, the family selected Williams because he had spoken at other family memorials, including the funeral of Franklin's father, the minister and civil rights activist CL Franklin. ""We feel that Rev. Jasper Williams, Jr. used this platform to push his negative agenda, which as a family, we do not agree with,"" the family said. Aretha bishop sorry after 'groping' Ariana Grande Stars and fans say goodbye to Aretha The funeral as it happened The pastor's fiery, old-school sermon received a mixed response in the church on Friday. Some of the congregation could be heard whispering: ""Talk about Aretha!"" but others gave the speech a standing ovation. Many felt his comments about single parent families were offensive, especially as Franklin raised four children by herself. Others were incensed by his assertion that: ""Black lives must not matter until black people start respecting black lives and stop killing ourselves."" Aretha Franklin died last month of pancreatic cancer. She was 76. Stevie Wonder, who played immediately after Rev. Williams' eulogy, seemed to address those comments, saying: ""We need to make love great again because black lives do matter. Because all lives do matter."" The pastor has not backed down from anything he said at the funeral, and said he respects the family's opinion. ""I understand it,"" he said. ""I regret it. But I'm sorry they feel that way."" Responding to criticism of his eulogy at the weekend, he said some of his comments had been misunderstood. Aretha Franklin's funeral in quotes In pictures: Aretha Franklin's funeral ""I'm sure much of the negativity is due to the fact that they don't understand what I'm talking about,"" he said. ""Anybody who thinks black America is all right as we are now is crazy. We're not all right. It's a lot of change that needs to occur. This change must come from within us. This video can not be played 'Thank you, Lord, for Aretha' ""It is ludicrous for the church not to be involved. The church is the only viable institution we have in the African-American community. We must step up and turn our race around."" Vaughn Franklin said the speech had ""caught the entire family off guard,"" as they had not discussed the content of the eulogy in advance. ""It has been very, very distasteful,"" he said. It was unfortunate, he added, because all the other speakers and performers had been respectful.

Male suicide rates at new UK low,"Suicide rates among men in the UK are at their lowest for more than 30 years, official figures show. In 2017, there were 4,383 male suicides and the rate was 15.5 per 100,000 men - down from 20 in the late 1980s, data from the Office for National Statistics reveals. Although the male rate is falling, men still account for three-quarters of suicides in the UK. The Samaritans said recent efforts to prevent suicides had helped. The female suicide rate has remained stable for the past 10 years. Ruth Sutherland, head of the Samaritans charity, saidthe figures,externalwere ""encouraging"" but ""every death was still one too many"". ""We believe that the focus in recent years on suicide prevention to tackle the higher rates in men has contributed to this,"" she said. ""Added to this, reducing stigma around men's mental health and encouraging men to open up and seek help when they are struggling has been beneficial."" The charity said suicide affected the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in society. Men aged 45 to 49 are the age group with the highest suicide rate, of 24.8 deaths per 100,000, the ONS figures show. Ruth Sutherland said: ""We must all continue to target expertise and resources at preventing men from taking their own lives and to reduce suicide across the board. ""We need to work harder at understanding who is taking their own lives and why, and what support and interventions work to save lives."" The data summarising deaths registered in 2017 also found: among women, 50- to 54-year-olds had the highest suicide rate - 6.8 deaths per 100,000 there had been 5,821 suicides in the UK last year, 1,439 among women - a rate of 4.9 per 100,000 the English region with the highest suicide rate was the North East and the region with the lowest rate was London Scotland had a overall suicide rate of 13.9 per 100,000 population - higher than England (9.2) and Wales (around 12) in 2017. Northern Ireland figures for 2017 are published later this year Scotland had its lowest suicide rate in 2017 since 1981 and, in recent years, it has seen one of the largest decreases in the male suicide rate If you are struggling to cope, you can call Samaritans free on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit theSamaritans website,externalto find details of the nearest branch.

Mourinho 'gets suspended jail sentence'The Manchester United manager is reported to have reached a plea deal in Spain in a tax fraud case.Europe,"Manchester United manager JosÃ© Mourinho is reported to have reached a deal with the Spanish state over a long-running tax dispute. He was accused of owing nearly â¬3.3m in undeclared image rights revenue for 2011 and 2012, when he was Real Madrid manager - an allegation he disputed. Spain's El Mundo newspaper reported he had agreed to pay a fine of â¬2m (Â£1.8m; $2.3m). Mr Mourinho said earlier he had paid all the taxes he owed. El Mundo also reported that he had accepted a one-year suspended jail sentence. But sources close to the manager said no prison term had been imposed or accepted. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? Spanish authorities launched the image rights case against Mr Mourinho in June last year. His representatives, Gestifute Media, said at the time that he had paid more than â¬26m in tax at an average rate of more than 41% while living in Spain from 2010 to 2013. In 2015, Gestifute said, he accepted a settlement agreement regarding previous years. Spanish courts recently cracked down on tax evasion among footballers: In June,Real Madrid and Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo accepted a â¬18.8m fine and was given a suspended jail termto settle charges against him In July 2017,Barcelona player Lionel Messi avoided a 21-month prison sentenceby agreeing to pay â¬252,000, equating to â¬400 for each day of the sentence Mourinho denies Spain tax fraud New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

"Carney willing to stay on as Bank governorMr Carney is due to step down in June 2019 but wants to help with a ""smooth"" Brexit transition.Business","This video can not be played Mark Carney said an announcement on his future would be made in ""due course"" Mark Carney has said he is willing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England if it will help the government ""smooth"" the Brexit transition. Mr Carney is due to step down from the role in June 2019 and told the Treasury Committee that he has been talking to the chancellor about his future. He said he was happy to do whatever he could ""to promote a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank"". Mr Carney added that an announcement on his future would be made soon. However, he added that it was not down to him to make that announcement. ""We (the Bank) have a very important supportive role to make sure whatever Brexit the government negotiates, that Parliament decides, that that is as much of a success as possible,"" he said. ""I made them aware of my willingness to do what I can to support the process. ""It's an important time and we have an important supporting role to make sure that, whatever Brexit the government negotiates and Parliament decides, that it is as much of a success as possible. Providing a measure of continuity during this period should help that."" After the hearing, Treasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan said: ""Stability is vital during this important period. The sooner the government provides clarity, the better."" Carney: No-deal Brexit highly undesirable Mark Carney upbeat on UK growth Mark Carney: The 'film star' Bank of England governor There has been speculation about the future of Mr Carney, who replaced Mervyn King in 2013 to become the first non-Briton to be appointed in the Bank of England's 300-year history. He previously announced that he would step down on 30 June 2019 - two years short of the usual eight-year term that governors tend to serve. But there has been a lot of talk in recent days that the government would like him to remain in post for longer. It is thought the Treasury would like to allow more time to recruit his successor, amid concern that few candidates would want to take on the role during an unpredictable stage of the Brexit process. The pound edged up slightly against both the dollar and the euro after Mr Carney's comments. Former Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance toldBBC Radio 4's World at Onethat the speculation about Mr Carney's position was ""not very good for the credibility and independence of the Bank of England"". He said the process of appointing a successor should proceed in line with the timetable initially agreed with the governor and added: ""It seems an awful lot is happening in this appointment process behind the scenes and that is not good in terms of the independence of the Bank of England."" Mr Carney has overseen two rate rises at the Bank of England Mr Carney has divided opinion, receiving both praise and criticism. He is credited with deftly handling the UK economy as it emerged from the upheaval of the 2008 global financial crisis. But pro-Brexit campaigners accuse him of ""crying wolf"" before the 2016 referendum, when he predicted voting to leave the EU could trigger a recession. Some, like former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, have called on him to resign. Last month,he was labelled the ""high priest of Project Fear""by the leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. His comments came after Mr Carney warned that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". He told the BBC's Today programme that such an outcome was ""highly undesirable"". Mr Carney has also faced criticism of his so-called use of ""forward guidance"". Under his leadership, the Bank had originally said it would not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate fell to 7% or below. But when that seemed likely to happen much sooner than anticipated, the Bank altered its stance, saying it would focus on a range of economic variables instead. Interest rates have now risen twice - to 0.75% - since he took over.

Fire breaks out at large primary school,"Twelve fire engines and about 80 firefighters were called to Roding Primary School, Dagenham, shortly before 05:00 BST Dozens of firefighters spent hours tackling a blaze at a large primary school in east London. Twelve fire engines and about 80 firefighters were called to Roding Primary School, Dagenham, shortly before 05:00 BST and had the fire under control by 07:49. The Metropolitan Police said there were no reported injuries. About half of the school building has been damaged. The cause of the fire is not yet known. According to the school, it is ""one of the biggest primary schools in the country"". Pupils were due to return on Wednesday following the summer holidays. The school,which has just under 1,300 pupils,external, has two sites - one on Hewett Road, where the fire was, and another on nearby Cannington Road. In a statement, the school said the Cannington Road site will open as usual on Wednesday but the Hewett site had been deemed not safe and would remain closed for the rest of the week. ""We will update Hewett parents as soon as we can about a re-opening date when we have a better idea,"" they said. Earlier, Barking and Dagenham Council said it was ""working with local schools and Roding Primary School"" to accommodate the 378 pupils who attend the Hewett Road site. Several fire crews were called to the school shortly before 05:00 BST The Metropolitan Police said there were no reported injuries Nearby St Teresa school was due to reopen but has remained closed as a precaution, following the advice from the London Fire Brigade (LFB). It will open as usual tomorrow. LFB said crews from Dagenham, Barking, Ilford and surrounding stations made ""steady"" progress in tackling the fire throughout the morning after being called at 04:50. The blaze is under control but LFB expect firefigthters to remain at the school for the rest of the day. LFB station manager Rod Wainwright said the brigade was alerted by an automatic fire alarm. ""When we arrived crews were met with a significant fire,"" he said. ""We have had no reported injuries at this time and believe the school was empty. ""It is unfortunate timing that this fire has occurred just before the start of term."" Mr Wainwright added: ""It is too soon to speculate on the cause of the fire but as soon as they're able to, fire investigators will enter the site to start their work."" Firefighters were faced with a ""significant fire"" The brigade's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Lee Drawbridge, said the building may have been saved had it been fitted with sprinklers. ""London's firefighters are called to more than 80 fires in schools every year and in most cases, sprinklers are not fitted - meaning millions of pounds are wasted repairing fire and water damage,"" he said. At the scene:Greg McKenzie, BBC London As I got closer to Dagenham you could see the huge plumes of smoke billowing into the air. The front of the school was on fire and firefighters told people to move back. People living nearby were advised to shut their windows as the smoke was quite thick. However, some neighbours - in their dressing gowns and slippers - still looked on. Although there was a sense of calm, I have spoken with some schoolchildren and parents who were really worried. Some of those who worked at Roding Primary were in a state of shock.

Pester was 'dead man walking',"On Thursday 19 April I received a bubbly email from TSB reminding me that this was the weekend when it would finally make the switchover from the Lloyds IT platform to its very own ""state of the art IT platform"". TSB was carved out of Lloyds after the merger between Lloyds and HBOS to satisfy competition concerns. I replied: ""A few sweaty palms in the IT department?"". ""Absolutely not"" - came the reply - ""we are cool as cucumbers"". Cue total IT meltdown, leaving customers locked out of their accounts, some customers' money going missing for days or even weeks and a grilling for the boss in front of MPs, who took the unusual step of declaring the chief executive had ""lost the confidence"" of the Treasury Select Committee. Many people thought Paul Pester was a dead man walking at that point but although he toughed it out - he'd used all of his nine lives. Problems flared up briefly in August and the problems over the past 24 hours drove the final nail into the coffin. TSB admits customers face 'intermittent issues' MPs have 'lost confidence' in TSB chief TSB boss Paul Pester to give up Â£2m bonus amid IT mess Some will feel that he was a victim of circumstances beyond his control. The new system was built, designed and tested on the watch of Sabadell, TSB's Spanish owners, who were convinced the system was ready. However, IBM - who were drafted in to help with the crisis - said in a report that the system had not been tested sufficiently, and Mr Pester himself came across as complacent to many MPs. The IT debacle cost TSB Â£176m and 26,000 customers closed their accounts (although 20,000 new accounts were opened offsetting some of the damage). The bank and Mr Pester's reputation took a heavy knock. Ultimately the buck stops with the chief executive and on Tuesday morning he paid the perhaps inevitable personal price.

TSB hit by more IT problems,"TSB has apologised to customers who faced disruption to their online and mobile banking over the weekend. The bank did not say how many customers were affected, but 1.9 million use its digital banking services. TSB is still recovering from an IT fiasco in April, when customers were left without access to online banking services for several weeks. The bank said that its systems seemed to have returned to normal by mid-morning on Monday. A spokesperson added: ""We continue to monitor the situation and will continue to update our customers."" After planned maintenance on Friday and Saturday, TSB users reported that they were having trouble accessing their banking services on Sunday. The bank tweeted on Monday morning that some customers were facing problems. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Consumer body Which? said this was a ""real blow"" to consumers who had stuck with the bank since April's meltdown. The IT problem in April was caused when customer data was migrated from an IT system operated by Lloyds Banking Group, which used to own the bank, to a new one one managed by its new Spanish owner, Sabadell. Gareth Shaw, Which? money expert, said: ""Customers can incur fines, penalties and fees when they're not able to access their finances, so the bank must offer compensation to all those affected. ""For TSB customers at their wits' end with the bank - there has never been an easier time to switch, and the current account switch Service makes the process as painless as possible,"" he added. In July TSBsaid the IT meltdown had cost Â£176.4mand pushed it to a half-year loss. At the time it said about 26,000 customers closed their TSB account in the second quarter of the year but that more than 20,000 customers opened a new bank account or switched their account to TSB in the same period. The bank has about five million customers.

US NFL protest player appears in Nike ad,"Colin Kaepernick was a quarterback for the San Francisco 49ers for six years An American football star who sparked a furore by kneeling during the national anthem has been unveiled as one of the faces in a major advertising campaign. Former San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick is appearing in Nike's ""Just Do It"" 30th anniversary campaign. In 2016 Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem in protest at police violence against African-Americans.

"Franklin family found eulogy 'distasteful'A fire and brimstone sermon ""did not properly eulogise"" the Queen of Soul, her family says.Entertainment & Arts","The pastor said his comments had been misunderstood Aretha Franklin's family have said that they found the closing eulogy at her funeral offensive and distasteful. The Rev. Jasper Williams Jr. said black America was losing ""its soul"" and described children raised without a father as ""abortion after birth"". ""He spoke for 50 minutes and at no time did he properly eulogise her,"" said Vaughn Franklin, the singer's nephew, speaking on behalf of the family. He added that his aunt did not choose the pastor to speak at her funeral. Instead, the family selected Williams because he had spoken at other family memorials, including the funeral of Franklin's father, the minister and civil rights activist CL Franklin. ""We feel that Rev. Jasper Williams, Jr. used this platform to push his negative agenda, which as a family, we do not agree with,"" the family said. Aretha bishop sorry after 'groping' Ariana Grande Stars and fans say goodbye to Aretha The funeral as it happened The pastor's fiery, old-school sermon received a mixed response in the church on Friday. Some of the congregation could be heard whispering: ""Talk about Aretha!"" but others gave the speech a standing ovation. Many felt his comments about single parent families were offensive, especially as Franklin raised four children by herself. Others were incensed by his assertion that: ""Black lives must not matter until black people start respecting black lives and stop killing ourselves."" Aretha Franklin died last month of pancreatic cancer. She was 76. Stevie Wonder, who played immediately after Rev. Williams' eulogy, seemed to address those comments, saying: ""We need to make love great again because black lives do matter. Because all lives do matter."" The pastor has not backed down from anything he said at the funeral, and said he respects the family's opinion. ""I understand it,"" he said. ""I regret it. But I'm sorry they feel that way."" Responding to criticism of his eulogy at the weekend, he said some of his comments had been misunderstood. Aretha Franklin's funeral in quotes In pictures: Aretha Franklin's funeral ""I'm sure much of the negativity is due to the fact that they don't understand what I'm talking about,"" he said.

Abu Dhabi Louvre delays da Vinci unveiling,"The painting was cleaned and restored from the image on the left to the one on the right The Louvre in Abu Dhabi has postponed indefinitely the unveiling of Salvator Mundi - the world's most expensive painting and believed to be the work of Leonardo da Vinci. The museum has not given a reason for the delay. The portrait of Jesus Christ was bought last November in New York for a record $450m (Â£341m) after a fierce bidding war. The mystery buyer was later revealed to be a Saudi prince. The Louvre Abu Dhabi opened last year and the painting had been due to go on display on 18 September. UAE state-linked newspaper The National said no new date had been announced, quoting Abu Dhabi's Department of Culture and Tourism. The newspaper suggested the museum might wait for its one year anniversary, on 11 November. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Male suicide rates at new UK lowAlthough the male rate is falling, men still account for three-quarters of suicides in the UK.Health","Suicide rates among men in the UK are at their lowest for more than 30 years, official figures show. In 2017, there were 4,383 male suicides and the rate was 15.5 per 100,000 men - down from 20 in the late 1980s, data from the Office for National Statistics reveals. Although the male rate is falling, men still account for three-quarters of suicides in the UK. The Samaritans said recent efforts to prevent suicides had helped. The female suicide rate has remained stable for the past 10 years. Ruth Sutherland, head of the Samaritans charity, saidthe figures,externalwere ""encouraging"" but ""every death was still one too many"". ""We believe that the focus in recent years on suicide prevention to tackle the higher rates in men has contributed to this,"" she said. ""Added to this, reducing stigma around men's mental health and encouraging men to open up and seek help when they are struggling has been beneficial."" The charity said suicide affected the most vulnerable and disadvantaged people in society. Men aged 45 to 49 are the age group with the highest suicide rate, of 24.8 deaths per 100,000, the ONS figures show. Ruth Sutherland said: ""We must all continue to target expertise and resources at preventing men from taking their own lives and to reduce suicide across the board. ""We need to work harder at understanding who is taking their own lives and why, and what support and interventions work to save lives."" The data summarising deaths registered in 2017 also found: among women, 50- to 54-year-olds had the highest suicide rate - 6.8 deaths per 100,000 there had been 5,821 suicides in the UK last year, 1,439 among women - a rate of 4.9 per 100,000 the English region with the highest suicide rate was the North East and the region with the lowest rate was London Scotland had a overall suicide rate of 13.9 per 100,000 population - higher than England (9.2) and Wales (around 12) in 2017. Northern Ireland figures for 2017 are published later this year Scotland had its lowest suicide rate in 2017 since 1981 and, in recent years, it has seen one of the largest decreases in the male suicide rate If you are struggling to cope, you can call Samaritans free on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit theSamaritans website,externalto find details of the nearest branch.

Trump warns Syria against Idlib offensive,"Rebel fighters in Idlib are preparing for an attack by pro-government forces US President Donald Trump has warned the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies against ""recklessly"" attacking rebel-held Idlib province. In a tweet he warned of ""a grave humanitarian mistake"" in which hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Syrian government forces are said to be preparing a huge offensive on the last major rebel stronghold in the country. The UN says such a campaign could have disastrous consequences for the almost three million civilians living there. The US state department also warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies. Allow Twitter content?

US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley tweeted: ""All eyes on the actions of Assad, Russia, and Iran in Idlib. #NoChemicalWeapons"" The government has repeatedly denied ever using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said they are confident government forces were behindan attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017that killed more than 80 people. With rebel forces defeated in most of Syria, the offensive in the north-western province could prove to be the last major battle of the seven-year civil war. There are believed to be up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters in Idlib. An estimated 10,000 are under the command of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda that was once known as al-Nusra Front and is designated as a terrorist group by the UN. Five reasons why Idlib matters Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has declared that the government's priority is to ""liberate"" Idlib. He has said it wants to avoid civilian casualties and regain territory through ""reconciliation agreements"", but that it was determined to defeat HTS ""no matter the sacrifices"". His Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, has said Syria's government has every right to ""liquidate the terrorist threat on its territory"", accusing jihadists of using civilians as human shields. Mr Lavrov has also claimed that fighters in Idlib are preparing to stage chemical weapons attacks in order to blame the Syrian government. Turkey, which has troops in Idlib monitoring a previous agreement aimed at lessening fighting in Idlib, has also warned against an assault. Why is there a war in Syria? UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura has warned of a ""perfect storm"",externalif the government went ahead with a full-scale offensive. The jihadists must be defeated but not at the expense of thousands of civilian lives, Mr de Mistura told reporters. Thousands of displaced people are already sheltering in Idlib province He called for further talks on a political solution, or for humanitarian corridors to be set up to allow civilians to be evacuated temporarily to a safer area, most likely one under government control. UN officials say as many as 800,000 people could be displaced by an all-out assault and that the already high number of people in need of aid could increase dramatically. ""A worst-case scenario in Idlib will overwhelm capacities and has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency at a scale not yet seen through this crisis,"" John Ging of the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned. Russia's military role in Syria grows Downed Russian pilot 'detonated grenade' The UN is desperate to avoid the deaths of civilians seen in battles for other parts of Syria, such as Aleppo, Raqqa and the Eastern Ghouta. After more than seven years of fighting, more than 400,000 people have been killed or are missing, and more than half the population have fled their homes. Idlib has been a haven for rebels and their families evacuated from others areas won back by the government, but there is no obvious place for them to move to within Syria if they abandon the province now. Turkey, which is already home to more than three million Syrian refugees, fears a major offensive could create a new wave heading towards its border. Iran is to host a summit on Friday at which the leaders of Iran, Russia and Turkey will discuss the situation in Idlib.

Labour set for crunch anti-Semitism talks,"Jeremy Corbyn arrives at Labour HQ for the NEC meeting Labour's ruling body is meeting to discuss whether to adopt in full an international definition of anti-Semitism following months of acrimony. The International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition was incorporated into Labour's code of conduct in July - but not all its examples were included. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he hoped the party's National Executive Committee would adopt all the examples. Rival protest groups are outside Labour HQ, where the NEC is meeting. Groups including Jewish Voice for Labour called on the committee to resist calls to adopt the IHRA definition of anti-Semitism. They argue that it would restrict freedom to criticise Israel's actions against Palestinians. Rival protesters, wrapped in Israeli flags, condemned Labour as ""for the many, not the Jew"" and chanted ""Labour fascists off our streets"". A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims What's the difference between anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism? The meeting comes as Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick told LBC radio she would review a leaked internal Labour dossier obtained by the radio station detailing 45 cases of alleged anti-Semitism, amid claims that as many as 17 might require reporting to the police. Labour's Deputy Leader Tom Watson said he hoped the NEC would adopt the full IHRA definition and that it would be the ""start of a new conversation with the Jewish community in Britain"". Labour MP Stephen Kinnock described the row as a ""battle for the soul"" of Labour. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the NEC should adopt the IHRA definition and all its examples - and that to add caveats, as some have suggested, would be ""like pouring more fuel on the fire"". Labour activist and journalist Michael Segalov agreed that the NEC should adopt all the IHRA examples but with some ""clarifications"" because, he told Today, some of them have the potential to ""veer off into restricting the right of Palestinians to describe their own experiences of oppression"". And he added: ""There are some people within the Labour Party who are using this as an opportunity to have digs at Jeremy Corbyn and have digs at the Labour Party more broadly."" A protest against changing the code has gathered outside the NEC meeting Rival protesters accused Labour of anti-Semitism Mr Corbyn has insisted there is no place for prejudice of any kind within the party, amid accusations that he has not done enough to crack down on anti-Semitic comments by members and activists. The Labour leader says he is committed to protecting Jewish members from abuse while allowing vigorous debate about the role of Israel in the search for peace in the Middle East and justice for the Palestinians - issues he has campaigned on for decades. The party endorsedthe full IHRA definitionof anti-Semitism when it revised its code of conduct earlier this year after protests by Jewish groups against the party's handling of the issue. ""Anti-Semitism is a certain perception of Jews, which may be expressed as hatred toward Jews. ""Rhetorical and physical manifestations of anti-Semitism are directed toward Jewish or non-Jewish individuals and/or their property, toward Jewish community institutions and religious facilities."" But Labour left out these four of the IHRA's 11 examples of what is anti-Semitism: Accusing Jewish citizens of being more loyal to Israel than to the interests of their own nations Denying the Jewish people their right to self-determination, for instance by claiming that the existence of a state of Israel is a racist endeavour Requiring of Israel a behaviour not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation Drawing comparisons of contemporary Israeli policy to that of the Nazis Labour argued that it had ""expanded and contextualised"" these examples to provide ""legally sound guidelines that a political party can apply to disciplinary cases"" and in some cases had gone further than the IHRA. In anarticle for the Guardian last month,external, Mr Corbyn said: ""Our actual differences are in fact very small - they really amount to half of one example out of 11, touching on free speech in relation to Israel. ""It is unfortunately the case that this particular example, dealing with Israel and racism, has sometimes been used by those wanting to restrict criticism of Israel that is not anti-Semitic. The Commons Home Affairs Committee acknowledged this risk when it looked at the IHRA examples."" This video can not be played Stephen Kinnock says Jeremy Corbyn should ""show remorse"" in his conference speech The row has seen Mr Corbyn accused of anti-Semitism by former Chief Rabbi Lord Sacks and veteran Labour MP Margaret Hodge - charges which he has strongly denied. The Board of Deputies of British Jews has said full adherence to the IHRA definition should be the first step in ""turning the tide"" of anti-Semitism within the party. But Jewish Voice for Labour, which backs Mr Corbyn's leadership, said support for the definition was not universal. It said it could not support it as it fell short of providing ""a clear and unambiguous statement based on attitudes to Jews as Jews, not attitudes to a country, Israel"". It comes amid a row overactivist Peter Willsman's re-electionto the NEC. Earlier this year, he suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks - remarks which were widely condemned and saw him disowned by the pro-Jeremy Corbyn campaign group Momentum.

UK 'missing out' on overseas students,"Universities say that the UK is slipping behind in attracting overseas students University leaders are calling for changes to the UK visa system to allow international students to stay and work for two years after they graduate. Universities UK says otherwise overseas students, worth Â£26bn to the UK economy, will opt for countries such as the US, Canada and Australia. Research has shownAustralia is already overtaking the UK as the second biggest destination for overseas students. The government has said there is no cap on legitimate overseas student numbers. This month, the Migration Advisory Committee, which gives the government independent advice on immigration, is to report on the impact of international students - currently counted as those from outside the UK and the European Union. The government has previously rejected calls to take international students out of migration targets. The university group is arguing for a more ""welcoming"" message, by giving international students the right to stay and work in the UK when they complete their courses - as they could before the rules were changed in 2012. The US, Australia and Canada allow international students to work after graduation - and Universities UK says that their research in countries such as India has shown this to be an important attraction. It is possible for students to stay after graduating in the UK. But there are thresholds on how much graduates must be earning, time limits for moving into work and requirements for sponsorship - and the universities want a less restricted approach. Overseas students are worth almost Â£26bn to the economy, say university leaders Prof Sir Steve Smith, of Universities UK, said the UK was ""missing out"" on the global growth in overseas students. The UK removed the right to work after claims that overseas students were over-staying and using student visas as a back-door route for migration. But Sir Steve said such claims had proved to be ""factually incorrect"" and the latest data showed that 98% of overseas students complied with their visa requirements. As well as the financial loss from deterring overseas students, he said, there was a risk of ""extraordinary long-term damage"" in terms of losing international influence and failing to recruit international talent for UK research. After Brexit, Sir Steve said there would be even greater demand for skilled workers and the UK needed to show it was ""open for business"". Overall international student numbers to the UK have increased by only 3% in the past decade - while the US has increased by 40%, Australia by 45% and Canada 57%. A study from University College London in July showed that the UK's longstanding position as the second biggest recruiter, behind the US, was being lost to Australia. China is the biggest source of international students for the UK, with about 95,000 students. There are about 17,000 students from India - but Universities UK says this number has halved over the past five years. Universities UK says the spending of overseas students supports more than 200,000 jobs - with an economic impact, across fees, travel and living costs worth Â£25.8bn, including Â£1bn in tax revenues. Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, said that almost a third of their students were from overseas. ""We support the call to give more international graduates the opportunity to work in the UK for a set period, once they finish their studies. This move would help preserve the UK's status as a magnet for global talent,"" said Mr Bradshaw. A Home Office spokeswoman said: ""There is no limit on the number of genuine international students who can come to study in the UK. ""We recognise the cultural and financial contribution which international students make to the UK, which is why we have developed an excellent post-study offer. ""Graduates can stay if they get a graduate level job, get an internship or apply to set up a business in the UK. ""Completing PhD students are also able to stay for an additional year to gain work experience or set up as an entrepreneur.""

Fire breaks out at large primary schoolThe Metropolitan Police said it was called to Dagenham shortly before 05:00 BST.,"Twelve fire engines and about 80 firefighters were called to Roding Primary School, Dagenham, shortly before 05:00 BST Dozens of firefighters spent hours tackling a blaze at a large primary school in east London. Twelve fire engines and about 80 firefighters were called to Roding Primary School, Dagenham, shortly before 05:00 BST and had the fire under control by 07:49. The Metropolitan Police said there were no reported injuries. About half of the school building has been damaged. The cause of the fire is not yet known. According to the school, it is ""one of the biggest primary schools in the country"". Pupils were due to return on Wednesday following the summer holidays. The school,which has just under 1,300 pupils,external, has two sites - one on Hewett Road, where the fire was, and another on nearby Cannington Road. In a statement, the school said the Cannington Road site will open as usual on Wednesday but the Hewett site had been deemed not safe and would remain closed for the rest of the week. ""We will update Hewett parents as soon as we can about a re-opening date when we have a better idea,"" they said. Earlier, Barking and Dagenham Council said it was ""working with local schools and Roding Primary School"" to accommodate the 378 pupils who attend the Hewett Road site. Several fire crews were called to the school shortly before 05:00 BST The Metropolitan Police said there were no reported injuries Nearby St Teresa school was due to reopen but has remained closed as a precaution, following the advice from the London Fire Brigade (LFB). It will open as usual tomorrow. LFB said crews from Dagenham, Barking, Ilford and surrounding stations made ""steady"" progress in tackling the fire throughout the morning after being called at 04:50. The blaze is under control but LFB expect firefigthters to remain at the school for the rest of the day. LFB station manager Rod Wainwright said the brigade was alerted by an automatic fire alarm. ""When we arrived crews were met with a significant fire,"" he said. ""We have had no reported injuries at this time and believe the school was empty. ""It is unfortunate timing that this fire has occurred just before the start of term."" Mr Wainwright added: ""It is too soon to speculate on the cause of the fire but as soon as they're able to, fire investigators will enter the site to start their work."" Firefighters were faced with a ""significant fire"" The brigade's Deputy Assistant Commissioner, Lee Drawbridge, said the building may have been saved had it been fitted with sprinklers. ""London's firefighters are called to more than 80 fires in schools every year and in most cases, sprinklers are not fitted - meaning millions of pounds are wasted repairing fire and water damage,"" he said.

"Franklin family found eulogy 'distasteful'The ""distasteful"" funeral sermon ""did not properly eulogise"" the Queen of Soul, her family says.Entertainment & Arts","The pastor said his comments had been misunderstood Aretha Franklin's family have said that they found the closing eulogy at her funeral offensive and distasteful. The Rev. Jasper Williams Jr. said black America was losing ""its soul"" and described children raised without a father as ""abortion after birth"". ""He spoke for 50 minutes and at no time did he properly eulogise her,"" said Vaughn Franklin, the singer's nephew, speaking on behalf of the family. He added that his aunt did not choose the pastor to speak at her funeral. Instead, the family selected Williams because he had spoken at other family memorials, including the funeral of Franklin's father, the minister and civil rights activist CL Franklin. ""We feel that Rev. Jasper Williams, Jr. used this platform to push his negative agenda, which as a family, we do not agree with,"" the family said. Aretha bishop sorry after 'groping' Ariana Grande Stars and fans say goodbye to Aretha The funeral as it happened The pastor's fiery, old-school sermon received a mixed response in the church on Friday. Some of the congregation could be heard whispering: ""Talk about Aretha!"" but others gave the speech a standing ovation. Many felt his comments about single parent families were offensive, especially as Franklin raised four children by herself. Others were incensed by his assertion that: ""Black lives must not matter until black people start respecting black lives and stop killing ourselves."" Aretha Franklin died last month of pancreatic cancer. She was 76. Stevie Wonder, who played immediately after Rev. Williams' eulogy, seemed to address those comments, saying: ""We need to make love great again because black lives do matter. Because all lives do matter."" The pastor has not backed down from anything he said at the funeral, and said he respects the family's opinion. ""I understand it,"" he said. ""I regret it. But I'm sorry they feel that way."" Responding to criticism of his eulogy at the weekend, he said some of his comments had been misunderstood. Aretha Franklin's funeral in quotes In pictures: Aretha Franklin's funeral ""I'm sure much of the negativity is due to the fact that they don't understand what I'm talking about,"" he said. ""Anybody who thinks black America is all right as we are now is crazy. We're not all right. It's a lot of change that needs to occur. This change must come from within us. This video can not be played 'Thank you, Lord, for Aretha' ""It is ludicrous for the church not to be involved. The church is the only viable institution we have in the African-American community. We must step up and turn our race around."" Vaughn Franklin said the speech had ""caught the entire family off guard,"" as they had not discussed the content of the eulogy in advance. ""It has been very, very distasteful,"" he said. It was unfortunate, he added, because all the other speakers and performers had been respectful.

Free childcare scheme 'closing' nurseries,"The parents of more than 340,000 children aged between three and four have benefitted from the free childcare scheme since it started 12 months ago A scheme offering 30 hours of free childcare a week has had a financial impact on providers, a charity says. Since 1 September 2017, most working parents in England have been entitled to the free care for children aged three to four during term time. But the Pre-School Learning Alliance (PSLA) said some childcare providers were struggling to remain open because of increased running costs. The government said it would ""continue to monitor delivery costs"". According to the Department for Education (DfE), the parents of more than 340,000 three and four-year-olds have benefitted from the initiative since it started 12 months ago. The government pays a national average of Â£4.98 per hour for places to local authorities, of which a minimum of 94% is passed on to providers. The PSLA charity surveyed 8,000 nurseries and childminder firms between 17 July and 23 August. It received answers from 1,662 providers and found 46% of them felt the scheme ""had a negative financial impact on their business"", while two-thirds said funding for child places did not ""cover the full hourly cost of delivering the places"". Nursery manager Gillian Simpson-Morris said costs were increasing for her business, which would ""disappear"" if it was ""not viable"" Gillian Simpson-Morris, managing director of The Acorns in Eldwick day nursery, in Bradford, said she was ""feeling squeezed"" because funding for child places there had dropped by 66 pence to Â£4.10 an hour while the cost for ""everything is going up"". ""We have to pass the cost on to parents - we've nowhere else to go with it,"" she said. ""Because of price hikes everywhere else, everything we buy is going up, the salaries are going up, we've got living wages going up, minimum wages going up, it's not a very highly paid sector but we try and pay what we can. ""We have to be viable. If we're not viable then we would disappear and lots of providers nationally have disappeared."" Mother Jennifer McCanna said the scheme had saved her Â£400 a month Jennifer McCanna, a mother of two children from Sheffield, said despite the scheme not being ""completely free"" for her she had made a saving of Â£400 a month. ""I completely see the point of view of the childcare providers because they have to make their business work,"" she added. Are you eligible for 30 hours' free childcare? Toddlers' parents 'pay most for childcare' Half of parents apply for free childcare PSLA chief executive Neil Leitch said the scheme had to be adequately funded. ""It's a great thing for the parents. It is not a great thing for the industry, in fact we're seeing nurseries close specifically because of the introduction of this 30 hours policy. ""For the thing to be a success it has to be balanced... It won't be a great offer long term if providers are going by the wayside."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Alliance, said the scheme should be adequately funded if it was to be a success In a statement, the DfE said it had provided ""Â£1bn extra funding a year to deliver all of this government's free childcare offers"". ""We continue to monitor delivery costs and we have commissioned new research to provide further information on the costs around childcare,"" it added. The DfE said parents were saving up to Â£5,000 a year on childcare costs. Toddlers' parents 'pay most for childcare' Reality Check: Do UK parents pay the most for childcare?

Neighbours shows first same-sex weddingThe long-running soap is marking marriage equality in the country with its latest episode.Entertainment & Arts,"Neighbours' Matt Wilson and Takaya Honda play David and Aaron Neighbours has shown the first ever TV same-sex wedding in Australia. The soap is reflecting on marriage equality, aftersame-sex marriage was legalised in December. Executive producer Jason Herbison said representation of the LGBT community is ""a priority"". He told The Huffington Post,externalthat the marriage of David and Aaron is a ""defining moment"" in the show's history. Back in 1987, Neighbours showed the wedding of Scott and Charlene, which remains one of the most famous soap weddings of all time. David and Aaron's wedding aired in the UK on Monday on Channel 5. Herbison said: ""It's no secret that the arts are filled with members of the LGBTQ community. ""As storytellers, we have played a strong hand in creating love stories like Scott and Charlene's for the masses to enjoy. ""But until recently, our own love stories haven't been told, out of fear of offending some of the viewing audience."" The wedding marks the culmination of a long-standing relationship between David and Aaron, who got  back together after David's fling with Rafael Humphreys, played by former Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas. Neighbours has always had gay and bisexual characters in the soap, featuring storylines about coming out and exploring love, but has never followed a relationship to the wedding stage until now. Herbison said UK soaps have always been ""first to prove that television has the power to overcome prejudice and promote love and acceptance."" The Archers on BBC Radio 4 was the first soap opera to feature a gay civil ceremony in 2006, Channel 4's Hollyoaks was the firstÂ soapÂ to feature aÂ gay wedding.

Pester had been 'dead man walking',"On Thursday 19 April I received a bubbly email from TSB reminding me that this was the weekend when it would finally make the switchover from the Lloyds IT platform to its very own ""state of the art IT platform"". TSB was carved out of Lloyds after the merger between Lloyds and HBOS to satisfy competition concerns. I replied: ""A few sweaty palms in the IT department?"". ""Absolutely not"" - came the reply - ""we are cool as cucumbers"". Cue total IT meltdown, leaving customers locked out of their accounts, some customers' money going missing for days or even weeks and a grilling for the boss in front of MPs, who took the unusual step of declaring the chief executive had ""lost the confidence"" of the Treasury Select Committee. Many people thought Paul Pester was a dead man walking at that point but although he toughed it out - he'd used all of his nine lives. Problems flared up briefly in August and the problems over the past 24 hours drove the final nail into the coffin. TSB admits customers face 'intermittent issues' MPs have 'lost confidence' in TSB chief TSB boss Paul Pester to give up Â£2m bonus amid IT mess Some will feel that he was a victim of circumstances beyond his control. The new system was built, designed and tested on the watch of Sabadell, TSB's Spanish owners, who were convinced the system was ready. However, IBM - who were drafted in to help with the crisis - said in a report that the system had not been tested sufficiently, and Mr Pester himself came across as complacent to many MPs. The IT debacle cost TSB Â£176m and 26,000 customers closed their accounts (although 20,000 new accounts were opened offsetting some of the damage). The bank and Mr Pester's reputation took a heavy knock. Ultimately the buck stops with the chief executive and on Tuesday morning he paid the perhaps inevitable personal price.

"Doctors told to use 'plain English'Doctors must learn a new skill - writing letters that are easier for patients to understand, guidelines say.Health","This video can not be played Public vs Doctor talk Doctors are being told to adopt a new policy of writing letters that are easier for patients to understand. The Academy of Medical Royal Colleges says too often correspondence contains complex medical jargon rather than plain and simple English. Using the phrase ""twice daily"" to explain the dosing of a medicine is better than the Latin abbreviation ""bd"", for example. Patients should ask their local hospital to comply, the academy says. The Please Write to Me initiative is aimed mainly at doctors working in outpatient clinics, although it is best practice for all clinicians who need to write clinical letters. Doctors are being asked to write directly to patients, rather than sending them a copy of a letter penned to their GP. The academy says this should help avoid blunders or offence caused by writing about patients in the third person. It cites the example,externalof a surgeon branded sexist after praising a father for ""manfully stepping in"" to take his daughter to a hospital appointment when his wife was too ill. Another consideration is the tone of the letter. A familiar style, such as: ""It was a pleasure to meet you and your husband for the first time,"" might sometimes be appropriate - but at other times a more distant or formal style might be appreciated, say the guidelines. Doctors are asked to avoid potentially stigmatising words: ""'You have diabetes,' is better than 'You are diabetic.'"" They should think about softening the impact of potentially sensitive information by using a more non-committal style, as with: ""During the examination, the tremor and stiffness in your right arm suggest that you have Parkinson's disease."" And any medical words should be translated in plain English. For example: ""Dyspnoea"" should instead be ""breathlessness"" oedema = swelling or fluid seizure = fit syncope = faint acute = sudden or short-term chronic = long-term or persistent cerebral = brain coronary = heart hepatic = liver pulmonary = lung renal = kidney paediatric = children Hospital doctors should also consider telephoning the patients rather than breaking bad news in the letter if test results are potentially upsetting, the academy says. The initiative is being led by Dr Hugh Rayner, a kidney specialist, who first started writing directly to patients in 2005. He said: ""The change may seem small but it has a big effect. ""Writing to patients rather than about them changes the relationship between doctor and patient. ""It involves them more in their care and leads to all sorts of benefits. ""Millions of clinic letters are written every month in the NHS so this change could have a big impact."" The Royal College of GPs is also on board. Vice-chair Prof Kamila Hawthorne said: ""I have seen a number of patients who have asked me to 'translate' the letter they have received from the hospital, which has been little more than a medical summary. ""By hospital doctors writing any letters directly to patients, with their GP copied in so we are always aware of what is happening regarding our patient's care, it should make the process more patient-centred, and make them feel more involved in their care, which will be beneficial for everyone.""

Jewish row activist re-elected,"Peter Willsman's election to Labour's ruling body has provoked controversy A Labour Party official who suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks has been re-elected to the party's ruling body. Peter Willsman was criticised when a recording of his remarks emerged in July, and the pro-Corbyn Momentum group withdrew its backing for him. But he is one of nine people elected to Labour's National Executive Committee. The remaining eight members of Momentum's slate were also elected. Labour pressure over Corbyn ally's remarks Momentum backs Labour candidate shake-up A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims In his recorded remarks, made during a Labour NEC meeting, Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He later apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported and that he would be referring himself for equalities training. Momentum founder Jon Lansman has also been re-elected to the executive committee. Comedian and longstanding Labour activist Eddie Izzard missed out, finishing in 10th place. This video can not be played Listen: Norman Smith on what Mr Willsman said and why it matters The centrist Progress group put forward nine candidates but they finished well behind the Momentum slate, who were referred to by supporters on Twitter as the #JC9. Labour MP Wes Streeting, a critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said Mr Willsman's past comments should disqualify him from having any say over internal party rules regarding anti-Semitism. He told Channel 4 News that Mr Willsman should ""do the decent thing"" and refuse to take up the seat and, if he did not, the party should take action. While he acknowledged the left of the party had control over Labour's machinery, he said its ""paranoia"" was preventing the party from dealing with issues which were doing ""extraordinary harm"" to its reputation. But his fellow Labour MP, Chris Williamson, hailed the outcome as a victory over ""the haters and the smearers"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And Momentum said it showed the power of ""ordinary members"" to shape the direction of a ""reinvigorated, democratic"" party. Labour's NEC is expected to vote on Tuesday on whether to adopt, in full, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's anti-Semitism guidelines. Labour's code of conduct, which does not include all of the IHRA examples of anti-Semitism, has caused a drawn-out row within the party. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Mr Willsman had been ""let off the hook"" by Labour officials and Mr Corbyn should have personally intervened to rebuke him. ""The election of Peter Willsman to Labour's NEC following his reprehensible comments about Jews is deeply concerning,"" said its vice-president, Amanda Bowman. Speaking ahead of Tuesday's meeting, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he backed accepting the IHRA definition in full, including all examples. But he said the right of Labour members to criticise the actions of the Israeli government and to advocate the rights of Palestinians must be protected, as long they used acceptable language. ""I am hoping we can resolve it both in terms of the Labour Party but more importantly that we can then unite and work with community organisations - particularly from the Jewish community - to tackle anti-Semitism within our wider society,"" he said.

TSB customers hit by more IT problems,"TSB has apologised to customers who faced disruption to their online and mobile banking over the weekend. The bank did not say how many customers were affected, but 1.9 million use its digital banking services. TSB is still recovering from an IT fiasco in April, when customers were left without access to online banking services for several weeks. The bank said that its systems seemed to have returned to normal by mid-morning on Monday. A spokesperson added: ""We continue to monitor the situation and will continue to update our customers."" After planned maintenance on Friday and Saturday, TSB users reported that they were having trouble accessing their banking services on Sunday. The bank tweeted on Monday morning that some customers were facing problems. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Consumer body Which? said this was a ""real blow"" to consumers who had stuck with the bank since April's meltdown. The IT problem in April was caused when customer data was migrated from an IT system operated by Lloyds Banking Group, which used to own the bank, to a new one one managed by its new Spanish owner, Sabadell. Gareth Shaw, Which? money expert, said: ""Customers can incur fines, penalties and fees when they're not able to access their finances, so the bank must offer compensation to all those affected. ""For TSB customers at their wits' end with the bank - there has never been an easier time to switch, and the current account switch Service makes the process as painless as possible,"" he added. In July TSBsaid the IT meltdown had cost Â£176.4mand pushed it to a half-year loss. At the time it said about 26,000 customers closed their TSB account in the second quarter of the year but that more than 20,000 customers opened a new bank account or switched their account to TSB in the same period.

Anti-Semitism v anti-Zionism,"The UK Labour Party has been at the centre of a row over anti-Semitism, including its relationship to anti-Zionism. What do these terms actually mean? Anti-Semitism is ""hostility and prejudice directed against Jewish people"" (OED). Zionism refers to the movement to create a Jewish state in the Middle East, roughly corresponding to the historical land of Israel, and thus support for the modern state of Israel. Anti-Zionism opposes that. But some say ""Zionist"" can be used as a coded attack on Jews, while others say the Israeli government and its supporters are deliberately confusing anti-Zionism with anti-Semitism to avoid criticism. Former London Mayor Ken Livingstone was suspended from Labour following a series of remarks about Israel, including the suggestion that Hitler supported Zionism before the Holocaust. It follows the suspension of Bradford West MP Naz Shah after it emerged she had once suggested, among other things, that Israel should be moved to the United States. The new president of the National Union of Students, Malia Bouattia, has also been heavily criticised for remarks she made about Zionists. Many in the Jewish community say the use of ""Zionist"" as a term of abuse reflects a rising tide of bigotry and racism directed at Jews. Suspended Labour MP Naz Shah The Labour peer Lord Levytoldthe BBC's Newsnight: ""There can be criticism of the state of Israel, but anti-Semitism - using the word 'Zionist' as another form of anti-Semitism - frankly can no longer be tolerated."" Others - including Livingstone - argue anti-Zionism is not the same as anti-Semitism, and that it's wrong to mix up anti-Jewish prejudice with legitimate disagreement with the actions of the Israeli state. However, critics of anti-Zionists point out that sometimes particularly harsh criticism of Israel goes further than disagreement with policies, but rather denies the right of the Jewish state to exist. Speaking on The Daily Politics, the former London Mayor said: ""Don't confuse anti-Semitism with criticism of the Israeli government policy and treatment of the Palestinians."" It's a debate around which emotions run high. It's also obviously true that being a Zionist and being Jewish are not the same thing. Neturei Karta believes the true Jewish state will be established with the coming of the Messiah There are Zionist critics of Israeli government policies, such as the occupation of the West Bank, the route of the separation barrier (which Israel is building in and around the West Bank and which it says is for security against Palestinian attackers, though Palestinian supporters see it as a device to grab land) and the building of settlements. Equally, there was Jewish opposition to the Zionist movement, which sought to establish a Jewish homeland, long before the state of Israel was declared in 1948. Today fringe ultra-Orthodox groups such as Neturei Karta oppose the state of Israel because they believe the true Jewish state will only be established with the coming of the Messiah. Likewise, somemake the point,externalthat Zionism is a political project supported by plenty of non-Jews, including Western governments and many US evangelical Christians. But it's been widely argued that the term ""Zionist"" has, in some circles, become a code word for ""Jew"" and that bigotry against Jewish people has been expressed using the language of anti-Zionism. Political movement which emerged in 19th Century Europe aimed at countering anti-Semitism, and establishing a Jewish homeland In the Hebrew Bible the word ""Zion"" refers to Jerusalem, hence the movement's identification with the city and the land that surrounds it Balfour Declaration of 1917 gave British support to the establishment of a Jewish national home in Palestine Chaim Weizmann, the president of the Zionist Organisation, was elected the first president of Israel in 1949 Khadim Hussain, a former Lord Mayor of Bradford, was suspended from Labour after he shared a Facebook post thatreferred to,external""the six million Zionists that were killed by Hitler"". Alex Chalmers, a former co-chair of Oxford University Labour Club,said,externalsome members regularly used the word ""zio"" - despite it being regarded as an ethnic slur. Bouattia was attacked after it emerged that in 2011, sheco-wrote a blog,externalfor a Friends of Palestine campaign group saying that ""the University of Birmingham is something of a Zionist outpost in British Higher Education"". She has also attacked ""Zionist-led media outlets"" - which critics said reflects anti-Semitic myths about Jewish conspiracies to control the media. Malia Bouattia, new head of the NUS On the other hand, it's regularly claimed that accusations of anti-Semitism are deployed to silence criticism of the Israeli government or to further other political ends. Pia Feig, of Manchester Jews for Justice for Palestinians, told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine programme that ""anti-Semitism has been used to quieten down and suppress my concern and the concern of other people for Palestinians"". In a statement after Livingstone's suspension, the Jewish Socialists' Groupsaid,externalaccusations of anti-Semitism were being ""weaponised"" to attack the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn. On the other hand, supporters of Israel ask why it's the Jewish state that is so widely singled out for criticism and not Iran, Russia, China or any other state attacked for their human rights record. Baroness Julia Neuberger told the BBC's Jeremy Vine show that anti-Zionism implies ""Jews have no right to self-determination, unlike other people"". Mark Wallace,writing for Conservative Home,external, said in practice it would mean either allowing Israel to be wiped out by its enemies or ""denying millions of Israeli Jews their home and deporting them"". Some anti-Zionists say Zionism itself is a racist ideology, because of how, in their view, the Palestinian people have been treated by the Israeli state. The Palestine Solidarity Campaignsays,externalit opposes all racism, including anti-Jewish prejudice and the ""the apartheid and Zionist nature of the Israeli state"" - although the PSC has itself been accused of racism for its anti-Zionist stance. Bouattia said she rejected claims of prejudice, adding that ""for me to take issue with Zionist politics is not me taking issue with being Jewish"" and that ""Zionist politics are held by people from a variety of different faiths, as are anti-Zionist politics"". This video can not be played Labour MP John Mann confronts Ken Livingstone as tensions rise over anti-Semitic claims. Accusations of anti-Semitism continue to dog Labour. Vicki Kirby was forced to stand down as a parliamentary candidate after tweeting that Hitler was a ""Zionist God"". She was re-instated and then suspended again. Gerry Downing, who was expelled from the party,described,external""Zionist politicians within the ruling classes of America and Europe"". Livingstone was accused of ""rewriting history"" over his remarks about Hitler supporting Zionism by Labour MP John Mann, chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group against Anti-Semitism. Few would deny there are anti-Semites who call themselves anti-Zionists, or that it's possible to criticise Israel without being a racist or a bigot. But agreement on how exactly the two relate appears elusive.

Neighbours shows first same-sex wedding,"Neighbours' Matt Wilson and Takaya Honda play David and Aaron Neighbours has shown the first ever TV same-sex wedding in Australia. The soap is reflecting on marriage equality, aftersame-sex marriage was legalised in December. Executive producer Jason Herbison said representation of the LGBT community is ""a priority"". He told The Huffington Post,externalthat the marriage of David and Aaron is a ""defining moment"" in the show's history. Back in 1987, Neighbours showed the wedding of Scott and Charlene, which remains one of the most famous soap weddings of all time. David and Aaron's wedding aired in the UK on Monday on Channel 5. Herbison said: ""It's no secret that the arts are filled with members of the LGBTQ community. ""As storytellers, we have played a strong hand in creating love stories like Scott and Charlene's for the masses to enjoy. ""But until recently, our own love stories haven't been told, out of fear of offending some of the viewing audience."" The wedding marks the culmination of a long-standing relationship between David and Aaron, who got  back together after David's fling with Rafael Humphreys, played by former Coronation Street star Ryan Thomas. Neighbours has always had gay and bisexual characters in the soap, featuring storylines about coming out and exploring love, but has never followed a relationship to the wedding stage until now. Herbison said UK soaps have always been ""first to prove that television has the power to overcome prejudice and promote love and acceptance."" The Archers on BBC Radio 4 was the first soap opera to feature a gay civil ceremony in 2006, Channel 4's Hollyoaks was the firstÂ soapÂ to feature aÂ gay wedding.

The initiative is being led by Dr Hugh Rayner, a kidney specialist, who first started writing directly to patients in 2005. He said: ""The change may seem small but it has a big effect. ""Writing to patients rather than about them changes the relationship between doctor and patient. ""It involves them more in their care and leads to all sorts of benefits. ""Millions of clinic letters are written every month in the NHS so this change could have a big impact."" The Royal College of GPs is also on board. Vice-chair Prof Kamila Hawthorne said: ""I have seen a number of patients who have asked me to 'translate' the letter they have received from the hospital, which has been little more than a medical summary. ""By hospital doctors writing any letters directly to patients, with their GP copied in so we are always aware of what is happening regarding our patient's care, it should make the process more patient-centred, and make them feel more involved in their care, which will be beneficial for everyone.""

Cuts blamed for Rio museum inferno,"This video can not be played Footage shows the huge scale of the blaze Officials in Brazil have blamed lack of funding for a huge fire that has ravaged the country's National Museum. One of the largest anthropology and natural history collections in the Americas was almost totally destroyed in Sunday's fire in Rio de Janeiro. This included the 12,000-year-old remains of a woman known as ""Luzia"" - the oldest discovered in Latin America. There had also been a string of complaints about the dilapidated state of the 200-year-old museum. ""We never had adequate support,"" its deputy director said after the fire. Experts had warned for years of a serious fire risk to the building. The museum director said ""Luzia is a priceless loss for everyone interested in civilization"" Presidential candidate Marina Silva criticised lack of investment. ""Given the financial straits of the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and all the other public universities the last three years, this was a tragedy that could be seen coming,"" Ms Silva, a left-wing politician standing in next month's election, tweeted. The fire started on Sunday evening, after the building - a 19th Century former royal palace - closed for the day. The cause is not known, but Culture Minister Sergio Sa Leitao was quoted in Brazilian media as saying it may have been ignited by a small paper hot air balloon landing on the roof. No injuries have been reported but most of the 20 million items the museum contained went up in flames. In pictures: Rio museum destroyed in huge blaze Treasure-trove museum - from a meteorite to a 12,000-year-old skeleton Brazil's President Michel Temer said in a tweet that it was a ""sad day for all Brazilians"",externalas ""200 years of work, research and knowledge were lost"". Mr Sa Leitao said it was a ""tragedy that could have been avoided"" but a reconstruction effort would begin. Prof Paulo Buckup, an expert in fish science at the museum, arrived at 19:30 (22:30 GMT) local time to find parts of the building where animal specimens were kept still intact. ""It's unfortunate but the firefighters were not in a position to do anything, to fight anything,"" he told BBC Brasil's Julia Carneiro. ""They had no water, no ladders, no equipment. ""So we took the initiative to get in to try and save what we could. We had to break down doors. The soldiers helped us carry things."" Employees are distraught at the loss of so many artefacts Prof Buckup rushed into the burning building to save its extensive collection of molluscs rescuing ""a few thousand"" specimens, a ""tiny"" part of the collection. ""I don't know how many tens of thousands of insects and crustaceans were lost,"" he says. ""I feel very sorry for my colleagues, some of whom have worked here for 30 or 40 years. Now all evidence of their work is lost, their lives have lost meaning, too."" A deputy director at the museum, Luiz Fernando Dias Duarte, expressed ""immense anger"", and accused Brazilian authorities of a ""lack of attention"". ""We fought years ago, in different governments, to obtain resources to adequately preserve everything that was destroyed today."" Demonstrators gathered at the gates of the museum on Monday morning, protesting against the budget cuts that they blame for the fire. Police were seen firing tear gas. Protesters gathered at the museum gates One issue appears to be the lack of a sprinkler system. Mr Dias Duarte told Globo TV that a $5.3m (Â£4.1m) modernisation plan agreed in June would have included the installation of modern fire prevention equipment, but only after October's elections. A major dinosaur exhibition, which was forced to shut following a termite attack five months ago, had recently reopened only thanks to a crowdfunding campaign. Museum librarian Edson Vargas da Silva told local media that the building had wooden floors and contained ""a lot of things that burn very fast"", such as paper documents. The museum, Brazil's oldest, is managed by the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and the federal government has been struggling with huge budget imbalances in recent years. The deficit was about 8% of GDP in 2017, only slightly down from a record 10% two years earlier. But Rio de Janeiro state is also facing a budget crisis. Firefighters were able to retrieve a number of items from the burning building Roberto Robadey, a spokesman for the Rio fire department, is quoted by the Associated Press news agency as saying that the hydrants closest to the museum were not working and that firefighters had to get water from a nearby lake. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent The pale yellow building is still standing - but the windows are burned out, the roof has gone and its insides are black. Throughout the day, firefighters, investigators and even museum staff have been going into the building and every so often they have brought out bits of artefacts or anything they think they can salvage from the rubble. Hundreds of people gathered outside, watching the developments - many of them in tears. Some researchers and academics I spoke to said they were still hopeful that some material on the ground floor could be saved - that is if it hadn't been crushed by the force of the upper floors collapsing on top of it. With their knowledge of where the archives were kept, they've been tipping off firefighters on where to go to rescue material in the hope that at least some of Brazil's most important history can be saved. Its 20 million artefacts included fossils and dinosaur bones. The jewel in the crown for many visitors was ""Luzia"". ""Luzia is a priceless loss for everyone interested in civilization,"" museum director Paulo Knauss told the AFP news agency. Using her skull, experts had produced a digital image of her face, which was used as the base for a sculpture that was also gutted by the fire. Another popular exhibit was the BendegÃ³ meteorite, weighing more than five tonnes and discovered in BahÃ­a state in the 18th Century. Images taken in the aftermath suggest it is still intact. The National Museum's BendegÃ³ meteorite, after the fire The building was also home to items covering the centuries from the arrival of the Portuguese in the 1500s to the declaration of a republic in 1889. The ethnology collection had unique pieces from the pre-Columbian era and artefacts from indigenous cultures. Portugal's royal family transferred the court to the building in 1808, when the country faced the threat of invasion from Napoleon. The museum was established in 1818, with the aim of promoting scientific research by making its collection available to specialists.

"Trump warns Syria against Idlib offensiveA ""reckless"" attack could mean the deaths of hundreds of thousands of civilians, the US leader says.Middle East","Rebel fighters in Idlib are preparing for an attack by pro-government forces US President Donald Trump has warned the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies against ""recklessly"" attacking rebel-held Idlib province. In a tweet he warned of ""a grave humanitarian mistake"" in which hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. Syrian government forces are said to be preparing a huge offensive on the last major rebel stronghold in the country. The UN says such a campaign could have disastrous consequences for the almost three million civilians living there. The US state department also warned on Monday that Washington would respond to any chemical attacks by the Syrian government or its allies. Allow Twitter content?

US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley tweeted: ""All eyes on the actions of Assad, Russia, and Iran in Idlib. #NoChemicalWeapons"" The government has repeatedly denied ever using chemical weapons. However, experts from the UN and the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) have said they are confident government forces were behindan attack involving the nerve agent Sarin on a rebel-held town in southern Idlib in April 2017that killed more than 80 people. With rebel forces defeated in most of Syria, the offensive in the north-western province could prove to be the last major battle of the seven-year civil war. There are believed to be up to 30,000 rebel and jihadist fighters in Idlib. An estimated 10,000 are under the command of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), a jihadist alliance linked to al-Qaeda that was once known as al-Nusra Front and is designated as a terrorist group by the UN. Five reasons why Idlib matters Syrian Foreign Minister Walid Muallem has declared that the government's priority is to ""liberate"" Idlib. He has said it wants to avoid civilian casualties and regain territory through ""reconciliation agreements"", but that it was determined to defeat HTS ""no matter the sacrifices"". His Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, has said Syria's government has every right to ""liquidate the terrorist threat on its territory"", accusing jihadists of using civilians as human shields. Mr Lavrov has also claimed that fighters in Idlib are preparing to stage chemical weapons attacks in order to blame the Syrian government. Turkey, which has troops in Idlib monitoring a previous agreement aimed at lessening fighting in Idlib, has also warned against an assault. Why is there a war in Syria? UN special envoy Staffan de Mistura has warned of a ""perfect storm"",externalif the government went ahead with a full-scale offensive. The jihadists must be defeated but not at the expense of thousands of civilian lives, Mr de Mistura told reporters. Thousands of displaced people are already sheltering in Idlib province He called for further talks on a political solution, or for humanitarian corridors to be set up to allow civilians to be evacuated temporarily to a safer area, most likely one under government control. UN officials say as many as 800,000 people could be displaced by an all-out assault and that the already high number of people in need of aid could increase dramatically. ""A worst-case scenario in Idlib will overwhelm capacities and has the potential to create a humanitarian emergency at a scale not yet seen through this crisis,"" John Ging of the Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs warned. Russia's military role in Syria grows Downed Russian pilot 'detonated grenade' The UN is desperate to avoid the deaths of civilians seen in battles for other parts of Syria, such as Aleppo, Raqqa and the Eastern Ghouta. After more than seven years of fighting, more than 400,000 people have been killed or are missing, and more than half the population have fled their homes. Idlib has been a haven for rebels and their families evacuated from others areas won back by the government, but there is no obvious place for them to move to within Syria if they abandon the province now. Turkey, which is already home to more than three million Syrian refugees, fears a major offensive could create a new wave heading towards its border. Iran is to host a summit on Friday at which the leaders of Iran, Russia and Turkey will discuss the situation in Idlib.

MPs to probe Carney over role extension,"This video can not be played Mark Carney said an announcement on his future would be made in ""due course"" Mark Carney has said he is willing to stay on as governor of the Bank of England if it will help the government ""smooth"" the Brexit transition. Mr Carney is due to step down from the role in June 2019 and told the Treasury Committee that he has been talking to the chancellor about his future. He said he was happy to do whatever he could ""to promote a smooth Brexit and an effective transition at the Bank"". Mr Carney added that an announcement on his future would be made soon. However, he added that it was not down to him to make that announcement. ""We (the Bank) have a very important supportive role to make sure whatever Brexit the government negotiates, that Parliament decides, that that is as much of a success as possible,"" he said. ""I made them aware of my willingness to do what I can to support the process. ""It's an important time and we have an important supporting role to make sure that, whatever Brexit the government negotiates and Parliament decides, that it is as much of a success as possible. Providing a measure of continuity during this period should help that."" After the hearing, Treasury Committee chair Nicky Morgan said: ""Stability is vital during this important period. The sooner the government provides clarity, the better."" Carney: No-deal Brexit highly undesirable Mark Carney upbeat on UK growth Mark Carney: The 'film star' Bank of England governor There has been speculation about the future of Mr Carney, who replaced Mervyn King in 2013 to become the first non-Briton to be appointed in the Bank of England's 300-year history. He previously announced that he would step down on 30 June 2019 - two years short of the usual eight-year term that governors tend to serve. But there has been a lot of talk in recent days that the government would like him to remain in post for longer. It is thought the Treasury would like to allow more time to recruit his successor, amid concern that few candidates would want to take on the role during an unpredictable stage of the Brexit process. The pound edged up slightly against both the dollar and the euro after Mr Carney's comments. Former Monetary Policy Committee member Andrew Sentance toldBBC Radio 4's World at Onethat the speculation about Mr Carney's position was ""not very good for the credibility and independence of the Bank of England"". He said the process of appointing a successor should proceed in line with the timetable initially agreed with the governor and added: ""It seems an awful lot is happening in this appointment process behind the scenes and that is not good in terms of the independence of the Bank of England."" Mr Carney has overseen two rate rises at the Bank of England Mr Carney has divided opinion, receiving both praise and criticism. He is credited with deftly handling the UK economy as it emerged from the upheaval of the 2008 global financial crisis. But pro-Brexit campaigners accuse him of ""crying wolf"" before the 2016 referendum, when he predicted voting to leave the EU could trigger a recession. Some, like former UKIP leader Nigel Farage, have called on him to resign. Last month,he was labelled the ""high priest of Project Fear""by the leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg. His comments came after Mr Carney warned that the prospect of a no-deal Brexit was ""uncomfortably high"". He told the BBC's Today programme that such an outcome was ""highly undesirable"". Mr Carney has also faced criticism of his so-called use of ""forward guidance"". Under his leadership, the Bank had originally said it would not consider raising interest rates until the unemployment rate fell to 7% or below. But when that seemed likely to happen much sooner than anticipated, the Bank altered its stance, saying it would focus on a range of economic variables instead. Interest rates have now risen twice - to 0.75% - since he took over.

"UN takes first steps to protect high seasOver the next two years, the UN hopes to secure a treaty to protect two-thirds of the world's oceans.Science & Environment","The first significant steps towards legally protecting the high seas are to take place at the UN in New York. These waters, defined as the open ocean far from coastlines, are threatened by deep-sea mining, over-fishing and the patenting of marine genetic resources. Over the next two years, government representatives aim to hammer out a binding agreement to protect them against over-exploitation. But several nations, including the US, are lukewarm towards the proposals. Experts believe that the oceans of the world are vital for a number of reasons. Scientists say they capture around 90% of the extra heat and about 26% of the excess carbon dioxide created by humans through the burning of fossil fuels and other activities. Marvels of the deep and their superpowers Renewables' deep-sea mining conundrum Why are countries laying claim to the deep-sea floor? ""The half of our planet which is high seas is protecting terrestrial life from the worst impacts of climate change,"" said Prof Alex Rogers from Oxford University, UK, who has provided evidence to inform the UN treaty process getting under way on Tuesday. Scientists are very interested in rare and exotic creatures often found in international waters ""Yet we do too little to safeguard that or to protect the life within the ocean which is intrinsic to our collective survival. Protecting the biodiversity of the high seas by bringing good governance and law to the whole ocean is the single most important thing we can do to turn the tide for the blue heart of our planet."" The high seas are defined as the oceans that lie beyond exclusive economic zones. These zones are usually within 370km (200 nautical miles) of a country's coastline. These waters cover one and a half times the total land area of the planet and are home to some of the rarest and most charismatic species - but all countries have the right to navigate, fly over, carry out scientific research and fish on the high seas without restriction. In 1982, the UN adopted the Convention of the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) which, when it became active in 1994, regulated sea-bed mining and cable-laying to some extent. There are also a host of other international groups, including the International Whaling Commission that look after aspects of the seas, but there is no overarching treaty that would protect biodiversity or limit exploitation. Deep-sea mining machines Researchers believe the high seas may be a major source of mineral resources in years to come. Justlast year, a team of British scientists exploring an underwater mountain in the Atlantic Ocean discovered high concentrations of a rare and valuable substance used to build solar panels. They're not the only ones - companies are also targeting deep-sea hydrothermal vents,home to a range of extremely rare and often exotic species. The undersea world far from shore is also of growing interest because the strange and wonderful creatures that live there may lead to new pharmaceuticals - certainly a select group of research bodies believe this to be the case with 84% of patents related to marine species filed by just 30 institutions over the past 30 years. It's the same story when it comes to fishing. Ships from 10 rich countries - among them Japan, Korea and Spain - take around 70% of the catch. Several studies using satellite data have shown the scale of fishing taking place away from national waters, including the practice of unloading catches on to other ships in international waters, something that allows boats to evade monitoring and enforcement. Many fishing fleets operate on the high seas as they are unregulated compared with domestic waters There would be three likely elements to any new treaty. Firstly, it would allow the setting up of Marine Protected Areas in international waters - something many countries have already done in their own jurisdictions.  A new pact would also allow the carrying out of environmental impact assessments to guard against potential harm from activities on the high seas. In addition, a new, legally binding deal would allow poorer countries to benefit from any discoveries developed from marine genetic resources. ""A strong global ocean treaty would allow us to create a network of ocean sanctuaries to protect wildlife, ensure food security for billions of people and help us to tackle climate change,"" Sandra Schoettner, a marine biologist with Greenpeace, told news agencies. The US rejected the UNCLOS treaty back in 1994 and is reticent about these new proposals. Some whale-hunting countries, such as Japan, Iceland and Norway, are said to be cautious about the idea because they fear it will restrict their fishing operations. Russia is also said to be dragging its feet. Campaigners, though, are optimistic that eventually a deal will be reached. ""The current high seas governance system is weak, fragmented and unfit to address the threats we now face in the 21st Century from climate change, illegal and over-fishing, plastics pollution and habitat loss,"" said Peggy Kalas, from the High Seas Alliance, ""This is a historic opportunity to protect the biodiversity and functions of the high seas through legally binding commitments.""

Several studies using satellite data have shown the scale of fishing taking place away from national waters, including the practice of unloading catches on to other ships in international waters, something that allows boats to evade monitoring and enforcement. Many fishing fleets operate on the high seas as they are unregulated compared with domestic waters There would be three likely elements to any new treaty. Firstly, it would allow the setting up of Marine Protected Areas in international waters - something many countries have already done in their own jurisdictions.  A new pact would also allow the carrying out of environmental impact assessments to guard against potential harm from activities on the high seas. In addition, a new, legally binding deal would allow poorer countries to benefit from any discoveries developed from marine genetic resources. ""A strong global ocean treaty would allow us to create a network of ocean sanctuaries to protect wildlife, ensure food security for billions of people and help us to tackle climate change,"" Sandra Schoettner, a marine biologist with Greenpeace, told news agencies. The US rejected the UNCLOS treaty back in 1994 and is reticent about these new proposals. Some whale-hunting countries, such as Japan, Iceland and Norway, are said to be cautious about the idea because they fear it will restrict their fishing operations. Russia is also said to be dragging its feet. Campaigners, though, are optimistic that eventually a deal will be reached. ""The current high seas governance system is weak, fragmented and unfit to address the threats we now face in the 21st Century from climate change, illegal and over-fishing, plastics pollution and habitat loss,"" said Peggy Kalas, from the High Seas Alliance, ""This is a historic opportunity to protect the biodiversity and functions of the high seas through legally binding commitments.""

Jewish row activist re-elected to NEC,"Peter Willsman's election to Labour's ruling body has provoked controversy A Labour Party official who suggested Jewish ""Trump fanatics"" were behind accusations of anti-Semitism in Labour ranks has been re-elected to the party's ruling body. Peter Willsman was criticised when a recording of his remarks emerged in July, and the pro-Corbyn Momentum group withdrew its backing for him. But he is one of nine people elected to Labour's National Executive Committee. The remaining eight members of Momentum's slate were also elected. Labour pressure over Corbyn ally's remarks Momentum backs Labour candidate shake-up A guide to Labour anti-Semitism claims In his recorded remarks, made during a Labour NEC meeting, Mr Willsman also said he had never seen anti-Semitism in the party. He later apologised and said not all his remarks were accurately reported and that he would be referring himself for equalities training. Momentum founder Jon Lansman has also been re-elected to the executive committee. Comedian and longstanding Labour activist Eddie Izzard missed out, finishing in 10th place. This video can not be played Listen: Norman Smith on what Mr Willsman said and why it matters The centrist Progress group put forward nine candidates but they finished well behind the Momentum slate, who were referred to by supporters on Twitter as the #JC9. Labour MP Wes Streeting, a critic of Mr Corbyn's leadership, said Mr Willsman's past comments should disqualify him from having any say over internal party rules regarding anti-Semitism. He told Channel 4 News that Mr Willsman should ""do the decent thing"" and refuse to take up the seat and, if he did not, the party should take action. While he acknowledged the left of the party had control over Labour's machinery, he said its ""paranoia"" was preventing the party from dealing with issues which were doing ""extraordinary harm"" to its reputation. But his fellow Labour MP, Chris Williamson, hailed the outcome as a victory over ""the haters and the smearers"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And Momentum said it showed the power of ""ordinary members"" to shape the direction of a ""reinvigorated, democratic"" party. Labour's NEC is expected to vote on Tuesday on whether to adopt, in full, the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's anti-Semitism guidelines. Labour's code of conduct, which does not include all of the IHRA examples of anti-Semitism, has caused a drawn-out row within the party. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said Mr Willsman had been ""let off the hook"" by Labour officials and Mr Corbyn should have personally intervened to rebuke him. ""The election of Peter Willsman to Labour's NEC following his reprehensible comments about Jews is deeply concerning,"" said its vice-president, Amanda Bowman. Speaking ahead of Tuesday's meeting, shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he backed accepting the IHRA definition in full, including all examples. But he said the right of Labour members to criticise the actions of the Israeli government and to advocate the rights of Palestinians must be protected, as long they used acceptable language. ""I am hoping we can resolve it both in terms of the Labour Party but more importantly that we can then unite and work with community organisations - particularly from the Jewish community - to tackle anti-Semitism within our wider society,"" he said.
