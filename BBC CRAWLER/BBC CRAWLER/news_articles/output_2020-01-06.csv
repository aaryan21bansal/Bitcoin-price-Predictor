Huge crowds at funeral for Iranian commander,"This video can not be played Mourners packed the streets in Tehran - and Iran's supreme leader wept as he led prayers Huge crowds have packed the streets of the Iranian capital Tehran for the funeral of military commander Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was assassinated in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday on the orders of President Donald Trump. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei led prayers and at one point was seen weeping. Iran has vowed ""severe revenge"" for the death of Soleimani and on Sunday pulled back from the 2015 nuclear accord. Soleimani, 62, headed Iran's elite Quds Force, and was tasked with protecting and boosting Iran's influence in the Middle East. In pictures: Tehran mourns Qasem Soleimani Trump under fire for threat to Iran cultural sites Voices from Iran: 'Soleimani did not deserve such a fate' He supported Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil conflict, aided the Shia militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, and guided Iraqi militia groups against the Islamic State group. The US saw him as a terrorist, and President Trump said Soleimani was plotting ""imminent"" attacks on US diplomats and military personnel. In Iran, Soleimani was hailed as a national hero and widely considered the second most powerful man in the country behind Supreme Leader Khamenei. But not all Iranians are as distressed about the general's death as the mourners who lined Tehran's streets, says BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen. Soleimani was a hardliner and a dominant force in a regime that shot dead scores of protesters at the end of 2019. He also spent vast sums building up alliances and militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria at a time when US sanctions are impoverishing many Iranians, our correspondent says. State television showed huge crowds in Tehran for the event. It put the number who turned out as ""millions"" although this is yet to be verified. Some people cried, while others clutched pictures of the late commander. Mourners passed Soleimani's coffin over their heads and ""death to America"" chants were heard. His daughter Zeinab Soleimani warned the US that it faced a ""dark day"". ""Crazy Trump, don't think that everything is over with my father's martyrdom,"" she said. Many in Iran saw Soleimani as a hero Among those there was Esmail Ghaani, the new head of Quds Soleimani's remains were then taken to Qom, one of the centres of Shia Islam, where massive crowds also gathered for a ceremony. The general will be buried in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday. On Sunday Iran declared it would no longer abide by any of the restrictionsimposed by the 2015 nuclear deal. The deal limited Iranian nuclear capacities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Three European parties to the deal - Germany, France and the UK - urged Iran to abide by its terms. Who was Qasem Soleimani? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? Also on Sunday, Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave. US forces had been invited back to Iraq in 2014 to help defeat the Islamic State group, and there are about 5,000 in the country. This video can not be played Jeremy Bowen in Baghdad: ""There will be consequences"" over death of Qasem Soleimani The new head of Iran's Quds force has vowed to expel the US from the Middle East. Meanwhile, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says an Iranian official told him he backed a claim by Iraq's PM that Soleimani was carrying an Iranian response to a Saudi peace overture. Following warnings from Iran, Mr Trump said that the US would respond in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"". This video can not be played Who was Qasem Soleimani? He repeated a threat to target Iranian cultural sites, saying the US would ""strike very fast and very hard"" if Tehran attacked Americans or US assets. President Trump also threatened severe sanctions against Iraq if US troops left. ""We have a very extraordinarily expensive airbase that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it,"" he told reporters. The president on Monday also responded to Iran's decision to no longer abide by the nuclear deal, tweeting: ""Iran will never have a nuclear weapon!"" A number of political leaders across the world have called for restraint, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a joint statement. Nato's ruling council met on Monday to discuss the crisis and made a similar call. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Nato had suspended its training operations within Iraq as a precautionary measure to protect personnel. US federal site hacked with pro-Iranian message Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words A brief history of US-Iran relations He said the decision to kill Soleimani had been made by the US alone, but that all Nato members had shown ""very strong unity"" and expressed concerned about Iran's ""destabilising actions in the region"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged restraint, saying: ""Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century."" Mrs Merkel will travel to Russia later this week for talks with President Vladimir Putin. Markets have remained turbulent. Brent crude oil topped $70 (Â£53) a barrel on Monday for the first time since September. The BBC's Persian service has been seeking the views of Iranians on Soleimani's killing. ""I believe Soleimani did not deserve such a fate. He did a lot for Iran, to protect this country. Our enemies have been attacking us for the past four decades and he tried to save the country,"" - Paniz (f) ""Soleimani was not a hero, in my opinion he was a soldier and overrated by the establishment. People are being too emotional about him,"" - Erfan (m) Read more Voices from Iran The suggestion that the US could target Iranian cultural sites sparked alarm in Iran and beyond. Such action could be considered a war crime under international law. Iran is home to two dozen Unesco World Heritage sites. These are sites that the UN's cultural organisation believes need preserving for their cultural, historic or scientific significance. These include: Persepolis, the sprawling ancient ruins which date back to 518 BC and were the site of the capital of the ancient Persian Achaemenid empire Naqsh-e Jahan Square in the city of Isfahan, which was built in the early 17th Century and is is one of the largest city squares in the world Golestan Palace in Tehran, the residence and seat of power for the Qajar dynasty which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925 In pictures - Iran's sites of cultural importance Do you have any questions about the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the circumstances preceding it and the consequences?

Long-Bailey becomes sixth candidate in Labour race,"This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? Rebecca Long Bailey has become the sixth candidate to join the race to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. In an article for the Tribune magazine,external, she said Labour needed a ""socialist leader who can work with our movement, rebuild our communities and fight for the policies we believe in"". She joins Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Thornberry, Clive Lewis, Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips in the contest. Labour's new leader, and deputy leader, will be announced on 4 April. The six leadership contenders are facing questions from Labour MPs at a hustings in Westminster, as the three-month contest officially gets under way. Who will be Labour's next leader? New Labour leader to be announced on 4 April Labour's only Scottish MP to run for deputy leader In her article, Mrs Long Bailey said Labour had a ""mountain to climb"" to get back to power, but there was a ""path to victory"" if the party stayed true to its socialist values. The Salford and Eccles MP, who has been shadow business secretary since 2016, is backed by her flatmate and deputy leadership contender Angela Rayner. She also has the support of key figures within Mr Corbyn's inner circle, including shadow chancellor John McDonnell. Mr McDonnell said he was also backing the shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, to be his party's deputy leader. Mr Corbyn, though, said he would not be publicly backing anyone - although he commented that Mrs Long Bailey was a ""wonderful colleague"". Asked what he thought of her telling ITV she rated his leadership at ""10 out of 10,"" he commented: ""I never mark my own homework."" This video can not be played Rebecca Long Bailey joins Labour leadership contest Labour chairman Ian Lavery has ruled out a bid for the leadership and also thrown his weight behind Mrs Long Bailey, saying she ""has the intellect, drive and determination to take forward and develop the popular, common sense socialist policies that Jeremy Corbyn has championed"". Barnsley Central MP Dan Jarvis, who hadpreviously indicatedhe might stand for the leader post, also ruled himself out of the contest on Tuesday, saying he wanted to concentrate on his role as mayor for the Sheffield City region. Rebecca Long Bailey is pitching herself as the ""carry on Corbyn"" candidate. It's no big surprise - she has long been a stalwart of Camp Corbyn. She's been ultra loyal to the Labour leader in the shadow cabinet and in the NEC (the party's ruling body). In her launch article in the Tribune, she makes absolutely clear that she stands by the Corbyn policies that the party put before the electorate. Interestingly, though, in a subsequent interview with the BBC, she adopted a slightly more nuanced approach. She acknowledged that Brexit harmed the party in the election. She also conceded on anti-Semitism - saying that behind the scenes she was pressing for tougher action on this. Mrs Long Bailey said Labour's election defeat last month, its fourth in a row, was due to a failure of campaign strategy and the ""lack of a coherent narrative"", rather than a rejection of its policies. If elected leader, she said there would be no return to the ""Tory lite"" agenda which she said had held the party back for many years. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was ""not your typical politician"" and could be trusted to ""fight the establishment tooth and nail"". She also said that she had argued against Labour's Brexit policy in shadow cabinet, suggesting the focus at the election should have been on getting a ""good deal"" rather than another referendum. Meanwhile, Ian Murray, Scotland's only remaining Labour MP, and MP for Tooting Rosena Allin-Khan are the latest to join the race to replace Tom Watson as deputy leader. Announcing his candidature,Mr Murray - a long-time critic of Jeremy Corbyn - said the architects of the party's ''catastrophic failure"" in 2019 could not be allowed to lead the response. Labour MP for Tooting Rosena Allin-Khan has announced she will run for deputy leader And Dr Allin-Khan, in her pitch, told Today the party had to ""learn from mistakes from the past"" and ""listen to those who have lost faith"". Under the timetable agreed by Labour's ruling body on Monday, the contenders have until 13 January to show they have the support of the 22 MPs and MEPs required to get on the ballot paper. They must also demonstrate they have the backing of 5% of local Labour parties and three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions.

New Labour leader to be announced on 4 April,"The contest for the new Labour leader will formally begin on Tuesday with the winner announced on 4 April, the party's ruling body has decided. Those who join the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote. Registered supporters - who are not full party members - will have 48 hours from 14-16 January to secure a vote by paying Â£25. Five MPs have so far entered the running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Clive Lewis, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry are all in contention. A sixth contender,shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, is also expected to throw her hat into the ring.She is close to Mr Corbyn's inner circle and represented Labour in an election TV debate. However Yvette Cooper - a minister under former Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - hasruled herself out of the contest,external. Ms Cooper, who came third behind Jeremy Corbyn in 2015, had previously said she was considering standing. A party spokeswoman said: ""We want as many of our members and supporters to take part, so it has been designed to be open, fair and democratic."" The first parliamentary Labour Party hustings will be held on Tuesday with a similar event for deputy leadership candidates on Wednesday. 7-13 January: Nomination period for MPs and MEPs 14-16 January: Application period for registered supporters 15 January - 14 February: Second stage of nominations from Constituency Labour Parties (CLP) and affiliates, including unions 20 January: Freeze date for voting eligibility for new members and affiliated supporters 21 February: Ballot opens 2 April: Ballot closes 4 April: Special conference to announce results More than 500,000 people took part in the last leadership contest, when Mr Corbyn was re-elected in 2016. He signalled his intention to stand down last month after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row and his second as leader. His successor will be in place before council and mayoral elections at the start of May. Labour hopefuls address trust and Brexit issues Who will be Labour's next leader? Today's meeting was being closely watched to see whether the rules or the timetable for this contest might end up working in favour of any particular candidate. In fact, the NEC's decision today doesn't seem to have caused great surprise. Labour's ruling body has kept the rules for registered supporters the same as last time round. While some might claim the Â£25 fee is high and the 48-hour window small, others will argue they didn't prevent thousands taking part previously. In contrast to 2016, there will be more time for new members to join the party and be eligible to vote in the contest; a two-week window which is the minimum Labour's current rules allow. There is still some discussion about who gets access to party data and when - which might aid campaigning. But on the whole this timetable seems - so far - to have avoided significant controversy in the early stages of this crucial contest. A new deputy leader also has to be elected after Tom Watson stepped down in December and Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) also set the rules for that contest. Shadow education secretary Angela Raynerlaunched her candidacy for deputy in Stockport earlier. She said she would be backing friend and flat-mate Ms Long Bailey if she chose to run for the top job. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and shadow Europe minister Khalid Mahmood have also confirmed they intend to run for the post of deputy. Rebecca Long Bailey is yet to formally enter the leadership race In order to take part, leadership candidates need the support of at least 22 MPs and MEPs, as well as the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. One of the key issues decided during the meeting was the cut-off period for membership. In 2016, the cut-off date was set retrospectively, but this time the NEC voted to stick with the time frame set out in Labour's rulebook, meaning those who want to join and vote now have two weeks to sign up. This is potentially helpful to Birmingham Yardley MP Ms Phillips and Ms Nandy, MP for Wigan. Both are looking to attract new members to join and vote for them, and to persuade former supporters - who became disillusioned about the party's direction under Mr Corbyn - to return to the fold. In contrast, those contenders who appear to be more popular with the current left-wing and pro-Remain membership, such as shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir, were likely to have benefitted from a more restricted timetable. MEPs will still be able to nominate candidates event though by the end of the race they are likely to be out of a job given the UK looks set to leave the EU on 31 January. The NEC also decided the rules around the participation of registered supporters. Since 2015, non-party members have been able to sign up temporarily at a reduced cost to cast a vote. When Mr Corbyn first became leader in 2015, people were given two months to sign up for a small fee of Â£3. A year later - when he was challenged by Owen Smith - the NEC gave them just two days and the fee went up to Â£25. However, more people signed up in 2016, with about 120,000 registered supporters ultimately taking part. The NEC is an elected body made of up parliamentarians, councillors, trade unionists and constituency party members.

"Let British troops stay in Iraq, UK urges","No 10 has urged Iraq to allow UK troops to stay in the country following the US assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, saying their work is vital. Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday on the orders of President Donald Trump. Iraqi MPs responded to the strike by passing a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the foreign military presence in their country. European leaders have called for all sides to show restraint. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper hasdenied US troops are pulling out of Iraq,after a letter from a US general there suggested a withdrawal. The letter said the US would be ""repositioning forces in the coming days and weeks"" - but Mr Esper said there had been ""no decision whatsoever to leave"". Earlier, Boris Johnson spoke to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi by phone, and a Downing Street spokesman said the leaders had ""agreed to work together to find a diplomatic way forward"". ""The prime minister underlined the UK's unwavering commitment to Iraq's stability and sovereignty and emphasised the importance of the continued fight against the shared threat from Daesh [the Islamic State group]"". Mr Johnson then chaired a meeting of senior ministers to discuss the deepening crisis. Afterwards, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government's key message was the ""importance of de-escalating the tensions and finding a diplomatic way through this crisis"". He also distanced the UK from the US president's threat that cultural sites in Iran could be targeted, saying: ""We have been clear cultural sites are protected under international law and we would expect that to be respected."" Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Your questions: Will Soleimani killing spark war? About 400 British troops are stationed in Iraq, while the US has 5,200. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on Monday that the alliance's forces had suspended training in Iraq. Only a small number of the UK troops in Iraq are involved in that operation. The Army says that British troops are in the country toprovide training and equipment,externalto Iraqi and Kurdish security forces - rather than in a combat role - and have trained more than 25,000 Iraqi forces. Caretaker Iraqi Prime Minister Mr Abdul Mahdi spoke in favour of US and other foreign forces leaving the country, although most Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote. A UK government spokesman said that coalition forces were in Iraq to protect its people and others from the Islamic State group, at the request of the Iraqi government. Meanwhile, Iran's ambassador to the UK has strongly deniedreports in the Times,externalthat his country had threatened to kill British troops following the assassination of Soleimani. The paper quotes an unnamed senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard as saying that its forces would ""target US troops in the Middle East without any concern about killing its allies, including UK troops"". But Hamid Baeidinejad described the story as ""provocative"" and a ""vicious lie""in a Twitter post,external. ""I will ask the concerned UK authorities to take swift action to stop such malicious false propaganda in this very sensitive time,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

An Iranian Embassy official also told the BBC there were no plans to attack British targets and said any suggestion that an attack could take place in Britain was laughable, adding ""we are not idiots"". Retired army officer Sir Simon Vincent Mayall warned on Radio 4's Today programme that British troops serving in the Middle East could ""possibly"" be killed in retaliation attacks on US soldiers. The Ministry of Defence adviser said western allied troops stationed in neighbouring Iraq were ""joined at the hip"" and that casualties could be shared in Iraq if Iran hits back. In a joint statement issued on Sunday night, Mr Johnson, Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron said the current cycle of violence ""must be stopped"" and called on Iran to refrain from further violent action and proliferation. The three leaders said they were concerned by the ""negative"" role Iran has played in the region but called on ""all parties to exercise utmost restraint and responsibility"". With tensions rising in the region, Iran has responded by vowing revenge and announcing it will no longer abide by the restrictions in its 2015 nuclear deal. The deal limited Iranian nuclear capacities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. A No 10 spokesman said Iran's announcement was ""extremely concerning"". ""It's in everyone's interest that the deal remains in place,"" he said, adding that ""it makes the world safer"". ""We've always said the nuclear deal is a reciprocal deal and in light of Iran's announcement we are urgently speaking to partners about next steps,"" the spokesman said. In their statement, the three European leaders urged the country to ""reverse all measures inconsistent with"" the deal. Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Mr Johnson said he spoke to President Trump on Sunday about the assassination of the Iranian general, who spearheaded the country's military operations in the Middle East as head of the elite Quds Force. The White House said the two leaders had ""reaffirmed the close alliance between the two countries"". Following warnings from Iran, Mr Trump said that the US would respond in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"". He repeated a threat to target Iranian cultural sites, saying the US would ""strike very fast and very hard"" if Tehran attacked Americans or US assets. Mr Johnson accused Soleimani of ""destabilising"" the region On Monday, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Breakfast one ""heartbreaking"" result of the crisis was that it was now going to be ""much harder"" to secure the release of British-Iranian womanNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. She was jailed in Iran over spying allegations that she denies. Meanwhile, a British frigate and destroyer - HMS Montrose and HMS Defender - are to start accompanying UK-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, where a tanker was seized by Iran last July.

Burger King's plant-based Whopper 'not for vegans'Vegans and vegetarians may find the fast food chain's new meat-free burger an acquired taste.BusinessComments,"Burger King has launched its first plant-based burger in the UK - but it is not suitable for vegans and vegetarians. The soy-based version of its Whopper burger is cooked on the same grill as meat burgers. The fast food chain says the Rebel Whopper is aimed at those who want to cut meat consumption. But a spokesperson for the Vegan Society called the launch a ""missed opportunity"". Burger King says that the burger ""patty"" itself is plant-based, but because of how it is cooked it will not be labelled as suitable for vegans or vegetarians. It will also be served with mayonnaise, unless the customer asks otherwise. Katie Evans, marketing director for the chain, said the burger was aimed at ""flexitarians"". She added it wanted the burger to replicate the ""flame-grilled taste"" as closely as possible. Burger King did confirm, though, that its vegetarian bean burger and its vegetarian option on the children's menu are cooked separately. Why are vegan diets on the rise? How to date a vegan Tablets to smart speakers: The 2010s in spending Sam Calvert, head of communications at the Vegan Society, said that not making the new burger fully vegan ""seems a missed opportunity"". She added that vegan mayonnaise was ""readily available"" and used by other well-known chains, which would also make the burger suitable for some religious groups that avoid eating certain animals and eggs. The Rebel Whopper launch on Monday also saw a backlash on social media. One Twitter user called it ""a case of big corporations jumping on the bandwagon of a trend"". Lifestyle blogger Donna Wishart criticised Burger King for failing to deliver ""actual vegan products"", when other fast food companies do so. Allow Twitter content?

However, Toni Vernelli, international head of communications and marketing at Veganuary, dismissed claims that Burger King was trying to ""capitalise on the vegan pound"". She said that ""increasing the availability of plant-based options"" was the best way to encourage the reduction of meat consumption. ""Don't let perfection be the enemy of good,"" she said. The Vegan Society describes veganism as a ""lifestyle"" that avoids all animal foods such as meat, dairy, eggs and honey, as well as animal-based products like leather.  600,000According to a Vegan Society survey of 2,000 people in 2018 Â£740mEstimated sales of meat-free foods in 2018 87%Most Veganuary participants in 2019 were female According to thelatest research by the Vegan Society,external, conducted in 2018, there are about 600,000 vegans in Great Britain. Flexitarianism, part-time vegetarianism or veganism, is becoming more popular. In 2020, at least300,000 people pledged to go vegan,externalfor the first month of the year, under the Veganuary campaign, the organisation said.

What is killer drug GHB?,"When Reynhard Sinaga took a victim back to his flat, he woulddrug them unconscious before launching his assault. Following his conviction for 159 sex offences, Home Secretary Priti Patel called for a review of controls for drugs like GHB. Although it is sometimes referred to as a date rape drug, GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate) is actually used recreationally and consensually. It is fairly common for gay men to use it during chemsex - when drugs are used to enhance sex between two or more partners - but it is also used by heterosexuals as a party drug. But rapists use GHB as a weapon - one recent survey estimated more than a quarter of those polled were sexually assaulted whilst unconscious. 'Evil sexual predator' jailed for 136 rapes The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs GHB is a separate but almost identical drug to GBL (gamma-butyrolactone), a substance sold legally as an industrial solvent but which becomes GHB once it enters the body. Together the drugs are known as ""G"", and both come in the form of a clear, odourless, oily liquid that is diluted in soft drinks and swallowed. Jurors were shown CCTV footage of Sinaga leaving his flat on the hunt for victims G can give users a feeling of euphoria and can increase their sex drive. But increasing the dose by a fraction, even less than a millilitre, can be fatal. Overdosing on G - which is particularly easy when it is mixed with alcohol or other drugs, and when the strength in bottles varies - can make people incoherent, suffer convulsions, lose consciousness and stop breathing altogether. Professor Adam Winstock, consultant psychiatrist and founder of the Global Drug Survey, warns: ""It's a drug that poses huge risks when people are out there trying to use it for fun."" ""If you take one drop extra of GHB, then 20 minutes later you're unconscious,"" he says. According to official figures from the Office for National Statistics, there were 120 deaths in England and Wales between 2014 and 2018 that involved GHB. But the total number could be much higher - GHB is not part of routine toxicology tests after sudden deaths. According to Professor Winstock, the drug can be difficult and expensive to detect. It is also difficult to know for sure how many sexual assaults are connected to GHB. Before Sinaga's conviction, perhaps the highest profile case was that of convicted serial killer Stephen Port, who was given a life sentence in 2016 for poisoning four young men with lethal doses of the drug. Anthony Walgate (L) and Gabriel Kovari (R) were Stephen Port's first victims Of the 2,700 gay and bisexual menwho have used G that responded to a survey conducted by BuzzFeed News,externaland Channel 4 Dispatches last year, 28% said they had been assaulted. Patrick Strudwick, BuzzFeed News' LGBT editor and presenter of the Channel 4 documentary Sex, Drugs and Murder, calls G ""a rapist's weapon of choice in 2020"". ""Because... it can be slipped into someone's drink without them knowing and because it can very easily lead to unconsciousness, it is therefore ripe for use by predators,"" he says. An additional obstacle to knowing the scale of the problem is that victims often don't report it to the police, says Professor Winstock. People can feel uncertain about what happened, and whether a crime occurred, he says, as well as shame, guilt and fear ""of having to disclose information that they may find very embarrassing"", he says. Some also fear they could be investigated for drugs offences. A dependence on G can develop quickly, and Professor Winstock warns that anyone who has taken it daily should not try to stop without medical help. ""People can become physically dependent, and withdrawal can be life-threatening,"" he says. The long term effects of taking G repeatedly are not yet known. Like many illicit drugs, the prevalence of G is hard to track as it does not feature in national drug use surveys. But Strudwick says G is ""very easy to find and to buy if you know where to look"" because of the ""legal loophole"" that means GBL can be sold for industrial use - as a paint stripper, among other things. ""Companies are shipping it to people in Britain, advertising it online... Once sold in large quantities, it can then be distributed and supplied by dealers in smaller quantities through dating apps such as Grindr,"" he says. Evidence given in Sinaga's trial suggested he drugged the men by giving them spiked drinks GHB was developed in the 1960s as an anaesthetic, but was discontinued because of its side effects. During the 1980s, it was used as a sleep aid and a supplement for body building. GHB has been a Class C drug since 2003, when it was brought under the Misuse of Drugs Act. Although GBL is used legally in industry, it has also been a Class C drug since 2009, and anyone who supplies or possesses it, believing that it will be consumed, is breaking the law. Possessing either drug can warrant up to two years in prison with or without an unlimited fine, and supplying can result in up to 14 years with or without such a fine. Dr Winstock says that increasing the class would make ""absolutely no difference"" to its usage, and would discourage people from seeking help. Instead he says the government should focus on educating people so that drugs can be used more safely, and on promoting ""honest conversations"" about their use. Sam Michels' father Eric died after he was given a fatal dose of GHB The family of Eric Michels, who wasmurdered with an overdose of GHB in 2018,have been campaigning for the drug to be reclassified as Class A. His son Sam told the BBC it was ""a really, really dangerous drug"" which had killed multiple people, including his dad.

New car registrations at lowest level since 2013,"New car registrations in the UK last year fell to their lowest level since 2013, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It was the third consecutive year of decline, and the SMMT expects that trend to continue in 2020. Those expectations are largely due to weak consumer confidence and confusion over clean-air legislation. The organisation also says the industry is facing serious challenges adapting to new emissions legislation. It says new rules will require a huge expansion in the use of electric and hybrid cars. But according to the SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, the fallout from Brexit remains the biggest ""clear and present danger"" to the sector in the UK. The SMMT's figures,externalshow a total of 2.31 million new cars were registered in 2019, down 2.4% from the year before. Since reaching a record high of 2.69 million vehicles in 2016, the market has been steadily contracting, in response to what Mr Hawes describes as a ""perfect storm"" for the industry. A key factor has been the collapse in demand for diesel-powered cars, which fell by 22% compared with 2018. Where once they accounted for half of all new cars sold, now they make up just a quarter of the market. The SMMT says uncertainty over future air quality rules, and in particular over potential restrictions on diesel vehicles entering city centres, has left consumers confused. That, combined with political uncertainty and a general fall in consumer confidence, has meant many potential buyers have decided to hang on to their old cars rather than investing in new ones. Five reasons the car industry is struggling ""You can never put it down to one single factor. It has been a perfect storm over the past few years"", says Mr Hawes. ""It's really no surprise the market has been declining. That's why we need a return of confidence and strong economic conditions"". The situation is not expected to improve this year, however, with the SMMT forecasting a further 1.6 % fall in registrations in 2020. One area in which sales have increased dramatically over the past year is the market for ""alternatively fuelled vehicles"", in other words electric cars and hybrids. They rose by more than a fifth. Registrations of pure-electric cars were up 144%, albeit from a very low level. The problem for the industry is that this increase is not happening nearly fast enough. New EU rules which are being phased in this year, and which enter fully into force in 2021, oblige manufacturers to cut the average CO2 emissions of their new car fleets dramatically - or face swingeing fines. These targets are expected to remain in force, even after the UK has left the EU. But they imply a cut of more than a third in overall CO2 output, and the industry believes that meeting them will be extremely challenging. In fact, the SMMT calculates that without other changes, the market share of electric vehicles would have to rise from the current 1.6% to 27% - or the combined share of electric vehicles and hybrids would have to increase from 7.4% to 56%. In reality, manufacturers will not rely solely on selling more low- or zero-emission vehicles in order to meet the targets. They will also be able to withdraw their most-polluting models and sell more efficient petrol and diesel vehicles, for example. But sales of electric and hybrid vehicles will still need to rise very substantially, and Mr Hawes insists government must play a role. ""These are still expensive technologies. They carry a price premium,"" he says. ""That's why incentives are so significant in determining the uptake."" But of all the clouds hanging over the industry, one remains darker than the rest in the eyes of the SMMT: the aftermath of Brexit. Although the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January, what happens after the transition period remains uncertain. The government insists it will be able to conclude a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year. But if that doesn't happen, there remains the possibility that the movement of cars and car parts across the channel could be subject to steep tariffs or disruptive border checks and delays. ""That is probably the clear and present danger,"" says Mr Hawes ""Yes, we will always sell cars in the UK and buy cars in the UK. Where they come from will be affected by Brexit. How much you pay will be affected by Brexit."" ""That is right before us now.""

New Labour leader to be announced on 4 AprilThe party's top body has agreed the timetable for the contest and who is eligible to vote.UK PoliticsComments,"The contest for the new Labour leader will formally begin on Tuesday with the winner announced on 4 April, the party's ruling body has decided. Those who join the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote. Registered supporters - who are not full party members - will have 48 hours from 14-16 January to secure a vote by paying Â£25. Five MPs have so far entered the running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Clive Lewis, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry are all in contention. A sixth contender,shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, is also expected to throw her hat into the ring.She is close to Mr Corbyn's inner circle and represented Labour in an election TV debate. However Yvette Cooper - a minister under former Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - hasruled herself out of the contest,external. Ms Cooper, who came third behind Jeremy Corbyn in 2015, had previously said she was considering standing. A party spokeswoman said: ""We want as many of our members and supporters to take part, so it has been designed to be open, fair and democratic."" The first parliamentary Labour Party hustings will be held on Tuesday with a similar event for deputy leadership candidates on Wednesday. 7-13 January: Nomination period for MPs and MEPs 14-16 January: Application period for registered supporters 15 January - 14 February: Second stage of nominations from Constituency Labour Parties (CLP) and affiliates, including unions 20 January: Freeze date for voting eligibility for new members and affiliated supporters 21 February: Ballot opens 2 April: Ballot closes 4 April: Special conference to announce results More than 500,000 people took part in the last leadership contest, when Mr Corbyn was re-elected in 2016. He signalled his intention to stand down last month after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row and his second as leader. His successor will be in place before council and mayoral elections at the start of May. Labour hopefuls address trust and Brexit issues Who will be Labour's next leader? Today's meeting was being closely watched to see whether the rules or the timetable for this contest might end up working in favour of any particular candidate. In fact, the NEC's decision today doesn't seem to have caused great surprise. Labour's ruling body has kept the rules for registered supporters the same as last time round. While some might claim the Â£25 fee is high and the 48-hour window small, others will argue they didn't prevent thousands taking part previously. In contrast to 2016, there will be more time for new members to join the party and be eligible to vote in the contest; a two-week window which is the minimum Labour's current rules allow. There is still some discussion about who gets access to party data and when - which might aid campaigning. But on the whole this timetable seems - so far - to have avoided significant controversy in the early stages of this crucial contest. A new deputy leader also has to be elected after Tom Watson stepped down in December and Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) also set the rules for that contest. Shadow education secretary Angela Raynerlaunched her candidacy for deputy in Stockport earlier. She said she would be backing friend and flat-mate Ms Long Bailey if she chose to run for the top job. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and shadow Europe minister Khalid Mahmood have also confirmed they intend to run for the post of deputy. Rebecca Long Bailey is yet to formally enter the leadership race In order to take part, leadership candidates need the support of at least 22 MPs and MEPs, as well as the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. One of the key issues decided during the meeting was the cut-off period for membership. In 2016, the cut-off date was set retrospectively, but this time the NEC voted to stick with the time frame set out in Labour's rulebook, meaning those who want to join and vote now have two weeks to sign up. This is potentially helpful to Birmingham Yardley MP Ms Phillips and Ms Nandy, MP for Wigan. Both are looking to attract new members to join and vote for them, and to persuade former supporters - who became disillusioned about the party's direction under Mr Corbyn - to return to the fold. In contrast, those contenders who appear to be more popular with the current left-wing and pro-Remain membership, such as shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir, were likely to have benefitted from a more restricted timetable. MEPs will still be able to nominate candidates event though by the end of the race they are likely to be out of a job given the UK looks set to leave the EU on 31 January. The NEC also decided the rules around the participation of registered supporters. Since 2015, non-party members have been able to sign up temporarily at a reduced cost to cast a vote. When Mr Corbyn first became leader in 2015, people were given two months to sign up for a small fee of Â£3. A year later - when he was challenged by Owen Smith - the NEC gave them just two days and the fee went up to Â£25. However, more people signed up in 2016, with about 120,000 registered supporters ultimately taking part. The NEC is an elected body made of up parliamentarians, councillors, trade unionists and constituency party members.

"Angela Rayner joins Labour deputy leadership raceLaunching her bid, the shadow education secretary says Labour faces a stark choice - ""win or die"".UK Politics","Angela Rayner became MP for Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester in 2015 Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner has announced she is joining the contest to replace Tom Watson as Labour's deputy leader. She is the fourth Labour MP to declare her intention to run, alongside Richard Burgon, Dawn Butler and Khalid Mahmood. Ms Rayner said Labour now faced a stark choice following December's heavy election defeat - ""win or die"". Both the new leader and deputy leader will be announced on 4 April, the party's ruling body has decided. Clive Lewis, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry have formally entered the race to replace outgoing leader Jeremy Corbyn. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, who is a friend and flatmate of Ms Rayner, is also expected to join the main contest soon. Labour to decide rules for leadership battle Who will be Labour's next leader? Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down Launching her deputy leadership bid in Stockport, Ms Rayner said Labour's defeat last month had left the party facing its ""biggest challenge in our history"". She said Labour needed to find a ""new kind of coalition"" to regain power, and needed to ""win back"" former supporters who had deserted the party. She said Mr Corbyn's leadership had been a factor in the party's poor performance, but also blamed the election strategy, saying its list of target seats had proved to be ""wide of the mark"". ""Seats where we suffered catastrophic defeats were seen as secure, while we tried to fight 'target' seats we had effectively already lost. It cannot happen again."" And she continued: ""The quick fix of a new leader will not be enough. We must rethink and renew our purpose and how we convince the people to share it. ""Either we face up to these new times or we become irrelevant. The next five years will be the fight of our lives."" Ms Rayner said she would back Ms Long Bailey if she stood for the top job, adding that she wanted the leadership of the party to be a ""team effort"". After the launch, Ms Long Baileytweeted,externalthat she would be lending her ""full support"" to her ""good friend"" Ms Rayner in her pitch for the deputy's post. Ms Rayner also unveiled a list of other Labour MPs backing her candidacy, including shadow trade secretary Barry Gardiner - seen as a potential contender himself - and senior colleagues Louise Haigh and Jonathan Reynolds. Rebecca Long Bailey and Angela Rayner are friends and political allies Ms Rayner became shadow education secretary in June 2016, just over a year after she became MP for Ashton-under-Lyne in Greater Manchester. After leaving school aged 16, she became a care worker and representative for the Unison union before entering Parliament. She has previouslydescribed herself,externalas being on the ""soft left"" of the party. At her launch she also called for the party to draw a ""line in the sand"" over the issue of anti-Semitism within its ranks, so it could ""regain the moral authority"" to unite the country against racism. The party, she added, needed to ""educate where there is ignorance"" and ""remove bigotry wherever it is found"". Under party rules decided by the party's ruling National Executive Committee (NEC) on Monday, deputy leader and leader candidates must be nominated by at least 22 Labour MPs or MEPs. They must also secure nominations from at least 5% of Labour's constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. New members will have until 20 January to join and be eligible to vote in both contests, with voting to begin on 21 February. There will also be a 48-hour window from 14-16 January for registered supporters - who are not full members - to pay Â£25 in order to secure a vote. The 4 April announcement date means the winners will take their posts before English council elections in May. Former deputy Tom Watson announced he was stepping down from his role and would not stand as an MP before last month's general election. Mr Watson was elected deputy leader in 2015, on the same day that Mr Corbyn won his own ballot to run the party.

The sexual predator who waited outside nightclubs,"Reynhard Sinaga is thought to be the UK's ""most prolific rapist"" ever. For several years, until he was caught in 2017, he preyed on young men enjoying a night out. Princess Street, in the heart of Manchester's city centre, is rarely quiet. If you follow it down from the impressive Victorian town hall on Albert Square, past bars, shops, restaurants, and converted textile warehouses, you reach the borders of two of the city's most popular destinations - Chinatown and the Gay Village. Beyond that, you come to a stretch of road bordered by nightclubs - Factory, Fifth, Joshua Brooks - a big part of the city's vibrant nightlife. With its close proximity to two of the city's universities, the road is also a popular area for student accommodation. Reynhard Sinaga, a 36-year-old postgraduate student, had made this his home for more than seven years, living in a rented flat just a few moments' walk from Factory Nightclub. Sinaga, originally from Indonesia, was a perpetual student. He already had four degrees and was studying for a doctorate. By night he was a serial sex offender. Serial rapists receive longer minimum jail terms 'Evil sexual predator' jailed for 136 rapes What is GHB? He has been found guilty of drugging, raping and sexually assaulting 48 men, but police believe they are among at least 190 victims. They are able to be so precise about these numbers because Sinaga filmed his attacks and collected what detectives call ""trophies"" - items or information stolen from his victims. This video can not be played Who is Reynhard Sinaga? The BBC's Judith Moritz reports on the case Sinaga typically approached his victims in the street. The rapist operated in a small area surrounding his flat. His targets were men mostly in their late teens or early 20s who had been out drinking, often in the nearby nightclubs. Some were on their way home, others had become separated from friends. Many were too drunk to remember their conversation with Sinaga, but for those who did there was no indication of a sexual motive. Sinaga used various pretexts to entice each to his flat. Some victims could recall being provided with a drink and then blacking out. BBC Action Linehas support and more information on emotional distress Greater Manchester Police said anyone who believes they might have been attacked by Sinaga canreport information online,externalor call its police line on 0800 092 0410 from inside the UK or 0207 158 0124 from abroad. The force said anyone in need of support from specialist agencies could call 0800 056 0154 from within the UK or 0207 158 0011 from abroad. Sinaga presented himself as a flamboyant, churchgoing academic who used the nickname ""posh spice"". A thin man of slight build and short stature, physically he appeared unthreatening. Several victims recall him smiling a lot. It was this apparent harmlessness that enabled Sinaga to pose as a ""good Samaritan"", coaxing men he approached back to the flat. We know about the benign impression Sinaga created because dozens of victims gave testimony to police, with 48 of them appearing in court over the course of four trials. Of the victims who went to court, the vast majority were heterosexual. Ian Rushton, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said he thought Sinaga took ""a particular pleasure in preying on heterosexual men"". Most of his victims were living in Manchester at the time and, in all, 26 were students when they were attacked. Their accounts explain how Sinaga operated. One was waiting for his girlfriend outside Fifth Avenue nightclub - since renamed Fifth Manchester - when he was approached by a ""small Asian guy"" who seemed harmless. The man was invited back to Sinaga's flat to wait for his girlfriend, but recalled nothing further after being given a shot of clear liquid to drink. Reynhard Sinaga Another man described being ""approached by a young Asian gentleman"". He said he had a ""vague recollection of explaining that my phone was dead and that I was trying to get a taxi but the taxis were passing me"". He added: ""I think I can recall a conversation along the lines of, 'Would you like to come inside and charge your phone and have a quick chat,'"" he told the court. To him, Sinaga ""didn't seem like an imposing character"" and during their conversations in the apartment, he appeared to be ""an honest, motivated person"" with an interest in academic research. The man told the court that soon after being offered a drink, he couldn't remember ""a single thing until the next morning"". After waking, confused and disoriented, he left within five minutes. Like almost every victim, he had no idea he had been raped until being approached by police. Another victim remembered his friends putting him in a cab outside a club. His next recollection was waking up in a strange apartment. When he asked Sinaga what had happened, he described providing care and shelter after finding him lying in the street. Another victim believed Sinaga had been ""really nice and had looked after him"". One victim, a teenage university student, managed to get Sinaga's mobile number as a precaution after waking up in the flat, and then having concerns that something might have been stolen from him. When he rang to ask for more information about what happened, Sinaga described himself as a ""good Samaritan"" who had found him unconscious on the pavement. Reynhard Sinaga's flat Another man remembered waking up on the floor, covered in a blanket, before thanking the flat's occupier for letting him stay over. He suspected nothing, even though the person ""refused to give me personal details"" in order to assist with an insurance claim for a lost mobile phone. The phone, like many others stolen from their owners, was later recovered from Sinaga's home by police. Some victims felt incredibly unwell after regaining consciousness, sometimes naked and covered in vomit. Unknown to them at the time, Sinaga had given his victims a drug - almost certainly GHB - which rendered them unconscious before he assaulted them. Class C prohibited drug - colourless and odourless liquid or powder, usually dissolved in water Generates feelings of euphoria in very small doses; in only slightly larger amounts can cause unconsciousness and death Used by clubbers and in so-called ""chemsex""; also frequently implicated in sexual offences Thought to account for thousands of hospital admissions each year, but statistics on its misuse remain sketchy Between 2007 and 2017 more than 200 deaths were linked to the drug; since 2014 it has been named as a  murder weapon in five cases Closely related to GBL, a colourless liquid that sold is an industrial cleaner and converts to GHB in the body. GBL is only classed as Class C prohibited drug when knowingly intended for human consumption One victim, who woke up naked on Sinaga's floor feeling nauseous and panic-stricken, came to the conclusion he had been drugged, telling his fiancÃ© about that suspicion but not about the condition in which he awoke. Another man, who was told he could sleep on the floor, recalled waking twice during the night, on one occasion to be sick. He remembered that on one of the occasions he was unable to move his arms and could feel himself being penetrated, before passing out again. In the morning, he briefly spoke with Sinaga before leaving. He did not report what happened to police, until being approached by them. It was the largest rape investigation in UK history. Police found more than 100 of the men from clues in Sinaga's flat. But the identities of 70 men have not been established and police are now appealing for anyone who believes they may been abused by Sinaga to come forward. The CPS's Ian Rushton says that Sinaga is probably the most prolific known rapist ""anywhere in the world"". Depok, Indonesia One of four children, Sinaga comes from a wealthy Indonesian family who live in Depok, a city within the Jakarta metropolitan area. His father is a banker and also a prominent businessman in the palm oil sector. After obtaining a degree in architecture at the University of Indonesia in Depok, he moved to the UK in 2007 to study urban planning at the University of Manchester. He went on to gain three degrees there before embarking on a doctorate in human geography at the University of Leeds - travelling there from Manchester when required. His family wealth meant that he rarely worked, although he claims to have had stints in employment in hospitality at both Manchester football clubs and in a clothes shop. Manchester United have since said they have no record of him working at the club. He worked for a period at a bar in the city's Gay Village, the area where he spent much of his time socialising. He was also a regular at a local church. After originally living in student accommodation, Sinaga moved to a rented flat in Montana House on Princess Street in 2011. While his convictions cover a period of two and a half years, police believe his offences predate 2015. But they say they may never know the true extent of his crimes. It came to an end in the summer of 2017. CCTV footage of Sinaga near his flat Sinaga was offending with abandon, sometimes night after night. In footage recovered from CCTV cameras covering his block of flats, he is seen leaving one evening only to return with a man 60 seconds later. It was just after midnight on 2 June 2017, when he approached his final victim. A teenager, who left The Factory nightclub to get some fresh air after becoming separated from friends, agreed to go to Sinaga's flat after it was suggested he could try to contact them from there. The man recalled nothing further until waking several hours later being sexually attacked by Sinaga. He immediately pushed Sinaga away, who responded by screaming ""intruder"" and ""help"", before repeatedly biting the teenager. The man hit Sinaga several times, escaped from the flat, and then called police, who arrived to a chaotic scene. Sinaga, who was discovered semi-conscious with serious injuries, was at first viewed sympathetically, and the teenager was arrested for assault. CCTV footage of Sinaga near his flat But Sinaga's behaviour in hospital began to arouse suspicion. He kept asking officers to have a mobile phone brought to him from his flat. Police asked him to confirm the pin number before they would hand it over. However Sinaga gave a series of false numbers, then tried to grab the phone after providing the correct one. The officer became so suspicious that he seized the phone as potential evidence and, when it was checked, a video recording was found of Sinaga raping the arrested teenager. It was the start of what the officer overseeing the investigation, Assistant Chief Constable Mabs Hussain, calls ""an absolutely unprecedented case"". He says the inquiry has been like ""piecing a jigsaw together without the picture"". Another of Sinaga's mobiles had somehow ended up in the pocket of the final victim. Between them, the two phones had been used to capture about 800 videos of Sinaga raping or sexually assaulting unconscious men. The victims, usually snoring loudly, were often repeatedly raped over several hours. In some of the films, Sinaga is seen to forcibly hold men down who, though unconscious, were visibly distressed or made attempts to push him away. In others, victims are seen to vomit while being attacked. To find the men, detectives used both the films and ""trophies"" collected by Sinaga - phones, watches, ID cards from their wallets, images that Sinaga had downloaded from their social media profiles, searches about them he conducted online. When they lacked identifying information, investigators tried facial recognition technology, approached local universities, and asked other police forces around the UK if they knew any of the men. Officers also considered whether Sinaga might have killed any of his victims with fatal drug overdoses, examining potential links to unsolved deaths or missing people, but there was no evidence to suggest this was the case. When officers made a positive identification, that person would be approached and told he had been a victim of sexual offences. Stock image of GHB Lisa Waters, of the St Mary's Sexual Assault Referral Centre, says their crisis workers accompanied detectives on these visits in order to ""offer immediate emotional and practical support"". She says that being told what happened ""can be quite overwhelming, very confusing"". ""What we didn't want to do was to drop the bombshell and then just disappear and leave these men with no support,"" she says. A large programme was put in place to provide ongoing support. Waters says many of the men have chosen not to tell anybody else about what happened to them. ""That might be because they might want to protect their own psychological health; it might be because they're ashamed to tell other people; it might be because they're fearful of other people's responses,"" she says. Dozens of those approached did not want to go through the court process. Sinaga was found to have told unsuspecting friends about some of the rapes, passing them off as consensual sexual conquests. In messages about the first victim who went to court, Sinaga boasted about the attack on New Year's Eve in 2014. ""I didn't get my new year kiss, but I've had my first sex in 2015 already,"" he wrote, adding that the man was ""straight in 2014. 2015 is his breakthrough to the gay world hahaha"". During another boast about what he presented as his prowess with ""straight"" men, Sinaga wrote: ""Take a sip of my secret poison, I'll make you fall in love."" Police officers have spoken to other men, tracked down as a result of still images discovered in the flat that date from before 2015. These men recall being there, but not what happened. There is no other evidence available to show that they were sexually assaulted. Only one previous report to police was linked to Sinaga after his arrest, dating from April 2017, when the victim had woken disorientated and unwell in a strange room with an Asian male. Princess Street He quickly left, but later that day had flashbacks of being sexually assaulted and - two days afterwards - he called the police. However, the man was unsure of the property in which he had been assaulted, meaning inquiries focused on two nearby hotels, neither of which had had any guests who matched the suspect's description. Despite the overwhelming evidence, Sinaga pleaded not guilty to all 159 charges, forcing a series of four trials in which his victims had to give evidence and jurors had to watch hours of distressing videos. Court rules meant that nothing could be reported in the media and each jury was unaware of the wider case against him. Sinaga gave evidence in the first and last of the trials, running what the judge called a ""ludicrous defence"" which involved him claiming that each victim had agreed to fulfil his ""sexual fantasy"" by being penetrated while being filmed and pretending to be asleep. When this scenario was suggested to one victim in court, he responded by saying it was ""absolutely farcical"". Sinaga changed his story during the trials. In the first trial, he denied that the loud snoring heard in some films was snoring at all, insisting it was just ""breathing sounds"". But, by the time of the final trial, he claimed the snoring was actually just ""role-play"". It was only halfway through the first trial that he admitted penetrating most of the victims on that indictment. In the witness box he came across as vain and self-absorbed, telling jurors: ""I make myself available all the timeâ¦ I may look like a 'lady boy' and it seems very popular amongst curious men who are looking for a gay experience."" When entering and exiting court he often appeared cheerful, as if he was enjoying the process. In the absence of the jury, the judge repeatedly asked defence counsel whether any of the evidence could be agreed, to spare jurors watching every video. But Sinaga would not agree and, because he insisted each victim was conscious and consenting, the videos had to be played to demonstrate this was a lie. The prosecution case was that Sinaga used the drug GHB to incapacitate his victims. No trace of the drug was found in his apartment and - due to the circumstances of Sinaga's arrest - the final victim was not tested quickly enough for its presence to be established. However, the symptoms shown by the hundreds of videos were all consistent with GHB intoxication, as were the descriptions of him providing clear liquid shots, and each trial heard expert evidence about its effects. GHB was used by Stephen Port, who murdered four men between June 2014 and September 2015. The men were given fatal overdoses of the drug. Port was also convicted of raping or assaulting several living victims using GHB. The impact on Sinaga's victims is vast. Waters says that ""some of the men have found it very difficult to function in everyday life"". This has resulted in substance misuse, people unable to go to work, students unable to finish university, and others having to leave home after feeling unable to function any longer within their families. She adds that ""some men have been suicidal and we've had to try to help them come to terms with that and how we can make them safe"". Dr Sam Warner, author of a report about the psychological impact on Sinaga's victims, says a loss of power coupled with an absence of memory can be ""extremely frightening, disturbing, upsetting because that goes to the heart of how you make sense of yourself, how you understand your experiences"". ""In a situation where people have been incapacitated through drugs they may have no flashback to that particular event,"" she says. ""What they will have is the flashback to being told, however sensitively done, because suddenly they become a rape victim at that point."" She says the stress and trauma ""may continue throughout people's lives"". In a series of statements read in court, the men themselves described the impact. ""I felt numb. I was totally shocked, embarrassed, betrayed and very angry,"" one said. ""His actions were disgusting, unforgiveable. He has massively abused my trust in humanity."" Another man said: ""I want Sinaga to spend the rest of his life in prison. Not only for what he has done to me but for what he has done to the other lads and the misery and stress he has caused them."" A further victim said: ""I remember the day the police contacted me, it is a day I will never forget because it changed my life forever."" Another: ""I wish the worse for him, I want him to feel the pain and sufferance I have felt. He has destroyed a part of my life."" Throughout all four trials, Sinaga displayed not a glimmer of empathy or contrition. His persistent smile, so often used to comfort and disarm, was instead revealed to be a mark of his cruelty. In a message to Sinaga, one victim said: ""I'm not going to let you ruin my life.""

Only one previous report to police was linked to Sinaga after his arrest, dating from April 2017, when the victim had woken disorientated and unwell in a strange room with an Asian male. Princess Street He quickly left, but later that day had flashbacks of being sexually assaulted and - two days afterwards - he called the police. However, the man was unsure of the property in which he had been assaulted, meaning inquiries focused on two nearby hotels, neither of which had had any guests who matched the suspect's description. Despite the overwhelming evidence, Sinaga pleaded not guilty to all 159 charges, forcing a series of four trials in which his victims had to give evidence and jurors had to watch hours of distressing videos. Court rules meant that nothing could be reported in the media and each jury was unaware of the wider case against him. Sinaga gave evidence in the first and last of the trials, running what the judge called a ""ludicrous defence"" which involved him claiming that each victim had agreed to fulfil his ""sexual fantasy"" by being penetrated while being filmed and pretending to be asleep. When this scenario was suggested to one victim in court, he responded by saying it was ""absolutely farcical"". Sinaga changed his story during the trials. In the first trial, he denied that the loud snoring heard in some films was snoring at all, insisting it was just ""breathing sounds"". But, by the time of the final trial, he claimed the snoring was actually just ""role-play"". It was only halfway through the first trial that he admitted penetrating most of the victims on that indictment. In the witness box he came across as vain and self-absorbed, telling jurors: ""I make myself available all the timeâ¦ I may look like a 'lady boy' and it seems very popular amongst curious men who are looking for a gay experience."" When entering and exiting court he often appeared cheerful, as if he was enjoying the process. In the absence of the jury, the judge repeatedly asked defence counsel whether any of the evidence could be agreed, to spare jurors watching every video. But Sinaga would not agree and, because he insisted each victim was conscious and consenting, the videos had to be played to demonstrate this was a lie. The prosecution case was that Sinaga used the drug GHB to incapacitate his victims. No trace of the drug was found in his apartment and - due to the circumstances of Sinaga's arrest - the final victim was not tested quickly enough for its presence to be established. However, the symptoms shown by the hundreds of videos were all consistent with GHB intoxication, as were the descriptions of him providing clear liquid shots, and each trial heard expert evidence about its effects. GHB was used by Stephen Port, who murdered four men between June 2014 and September 2015. The men were given fatal overdoses of the drug. Port was also convicted of raping or assaulting several living victims using GHB. The impact on Sinaga's victims is vast. Waters says that ""some of the men have found it very difficult to function in everyday life"". This has resulted in substance misuse, people unable to go to work, students unable to finish university, and others having to leave home after feeling unable to function any longer within their families. She adds that ""some men have been suicidal and we've had to try to help them come to terms with that and how we can make them safe"". Dr Sam Warner, author of a report about the psychological impact on Sinaga's victims, says a loss of power coupled with an absence of memory can be ""extremely frightening, disturbing, upsetting because that goes to the heart of how you make sense of yourself, how you understand your experiences"". ""In a situation where people have been incapacitated through drugs they may have no flashback to that particular event,"" she says. ""What they will have is the flashback to being told, however sensitively done, because suddenly they become a rape victim at that point."" She says the stress and trauma ""may continue throughout people's lives"". In a series of statements read in court, the men themselves described the impact. ""I felt numb. I was totally shocked, embarrassed, betrayed and very angry,"" one said. ""His actions were disgusting, unforgiveable. He has massively abused my trust in humanity."" Another man said: ""I want Sinaga to spend the rest of his life in prison. Not only for what he has done to me but for what he has done to the other lads and the misery and stress he has caused them."" A further victim said: ""I remember the day the police contacted me, it is a day I will never forget because it changed my life forever."" Another: ""I wish the worse for him, I want him to feel the pain and sufferance I have felt. He has destroyed a part of my life."" Throughout all four trials, Sinaga displayed not a glimmer of empathy or contrition. His persistent smile, so often used to comfort and disarm, was instead revealed to be a mark of his cruelty. In a message to Sinaga, one victim said: ""I'm not going to let you ruin my life.""

Ms Rayner said Labour now faced a stark choice following December's heavy election defeat - ""win or die"".

Huge crowds at funeral for Iran commander,"This video can not be played Mourners packed the streets in Tehran - and Iran's supreme leader wept as he led prayers Huge crowds have packed the streets of the Iranian capital Tehran for the funeral of military commander Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was assassinated in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday on the orders of President Donald Trump. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei led prayers and at one point was seen weeping. Iran has vowed ""severe revenge"" for the death of Soleimani and on Sunday pulled back from the 2015 nuclear accord. Soleimani, 62, headed Iran's elite Quds Force, and was tasked with protecting and boosting Iran's influence in the Middle East. In pictures: Tehran mourns Qasem Soleimani Trump under fire for threat to Iran cultural sites Voices from Iran: 'Soleimani did not deserve such a fate' He supported Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil conflict, aided the Shia militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, and guided Iraqi militia groups against the Islamic State group. The US saw him as a terrorist, and President Trump said Soleimani was plotting ""imminent"" attacks on US diplomats and military personnel. In Iran, Soleimani was hailed as a national hero and widely considered the second most powerful man in the country behind Supreme Leader Khamenei. But not all Iranians are as distressed about the general's death as the mourners who lined Tehran's streets, says BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen. Soleimani was a hardliner and a dominant force in a regime that shot dead scores of protesters at the end of 2019. He also spent vast sums building up alliances and militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria at a time when US sanctions are impoverishing many Iranians, our correspondent says. State television showed huge crowds in Tehran for the event. It put the number who turned out as ""millions"" although this is yet to be verified. Some people cried, while others clutched pictures of the late commander. Mourners passed Soleimani's coffin over their heads and ""death to America"" chants were heard. His daughter Zeinab Soleimani warned the US that it faced a ""dark day"". ""Crazy Trump, don't think that everything is over with my father's martyrdom,"" she said. Many in Iran saw Soleimani as a hero Among those there was Esmail Ghaani, the new head of Quds Soleimani's remains were then taken to Qom, one of the centres of Shia Islam, where massive crowds also gathered for a ceremony. The general will be buried in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday. On Sunday Iran declared it would no longer abide by any of the restrictionsimposed by the 2015 nuclear deal. The deal limited Iranian nuclear capacities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Three European parties to the deal - Germany, France and the UK - urged Iran to abide by its terms. Who was Qasem Soleimani? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? Also on Sunday, Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave. US forces had been invited back to Iraq in 2014 to help defeat the Islamic State group, and there are about 5,000 in the country. This video can not be played Jeremy Bowen in Baghdad: ""There will be consequences"" over death of Qasem Soleimani The new head of Iran's Quds force has vowed to expel the US from the Middle East. Meanwhile, BBC security correspondent Frank Gardner says an Iranian official told him he backed a claim by Iraq's PM that Soleimani was carrying an Iranian response to a Saudi peace overture. Following warnings from Iran, Mr Trump said that the US would respond in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"". This video can not be played Who was Qasem Soleimani? He repeated a threat to target Iranian cultural sites, saying the US would ""strike very fast and very hard"" if Tehran attacked Americans or US assets. President Trump also threatened severe sanctions against Iraq if US troops left. ""We have a very extraordinarily expensive airbase that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it,"" he told reporters. The president on Monday also responded to Iran's decision to no longer abide by the nuclear deal, tweeting: ""Iran will never have a nuclear weapon!"" A number of political leaders across the world have called for restraint, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a joint statement. Nato's ruling council met on Monday to discuss the crisis and made a similar call. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Nato had suspended its training operations within Iraq as a precautionary measure to protect personnel. US federal site hacked with pro-Iranian message Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words A brief history of US-Iran relations He said the decision to kill Soleimani had been made by the US alone, but that all Nato members had shown ""very strong unity"" and expressed concerned about Iran's ""destabilising actions in the region"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged restraint, saying: ""Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century."" Mrs Merkel will travel to Russia later this week for talks with President Vladimir Putin. Markets have remained turbulent. Brent crude oil topped $70 (Â£53) a barrel on Monday for the first time since September. The BBC's Persian service has been seeking the views of Iranians on Soleimani's killing. ""I believe Soleimani did not deserve such a fate. He did a lot for Iran, to protect this country. Our enemies have been attacking us for the past four decades and he tried to save the country,"" - Paniz (f) ""Soleimani was not a hero, in my opinion he was a soldier and overrated by the establishment. People are being too emotional about him,"" - Erfan (m) Read more Voices from Iran The suggestion that the US could target Iranian cultural sites sparked alarm in Iran and beyond. Such action could be considered a war crime under international law. Iran is home to two dozen Unesco World Heritage sites. These are sites that the UN's cultural organisation believes need preserving for their cultural, historic or scientific significance. These include: Persepolis, the sprawling ancient ruins which date back to 518 BC and were the site of the capital of the ancient Persian Achaemenid empire Naqsh-e Jahan Square in the city of Isfahan, which was built in the early 17th Century and is is one of the largest city squares in the world Golestan Palace in Tehran, the residence and seat of power for the Qajar dynasty which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925 In pictures - Iran's sites of cultural importance Do you have any questions about the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, the circumstances preceding it and the consequences?

Is the nuclear deal dead and buried?,"This video can not be played The Iran Nuclear Deal explained In theory, the Iran nuclear deal is still in existence. But only just. The country has announced that it will no longer be bound by any of its restrictions in terms of the numbers or type of centrifuges that can be operated or the level of enrichment of uranium that it can pursue. But Tehran insists that all of the steps it has taken to breach the agreement - formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) - are reversible. Other parties have to honour its terms, which presumably means that the US must abandon its crushing economic sanctions and endorse the deal once more. It is very hard to imagine President Donald Trump abandoning his ""maximum pressure"" campaign and lifting the sanctions, so that may well be a non-starter. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Why do the limits on Iran's uranium enrichment matter? Iran nuclear deal: Key details At the very least, the Europeans must find some payment mechanism to make up for the damage that is being done to the Iranian economy. They have tried to do this but so far to no great effect. Governments can posture from the sidelines but it is up to individual companies to decide if they want to trade with Iran and risk the weight of US sanctions. The evidence so far is that they do not. So is the nuclear agreement dead and buried, or could it be revived? If it is well and truly defunct, then why not simply acknowledge this fact? And who exactly killed it? The last question is the easiest to answer. For in a purely technical sense, looking at the agreement and its implementation, the Iranians have a point when they blame the US. The deal has effectively been on life support ever since the Trump administration abandoned it in May 2018. Donald Trump has consistently railed against former President Barack Obama's ""bad deal"". But all of its other signatories - the UK, France, Russia, China, Germany and the EU - still believe it has merit. The JCPOA was never designed to be a perfect deal - there is no such thing. Its purpose was to constrain Iran's nuclear programme for a set period in a largely verifiable way. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani (R) previously threatened to restart uranium enrichment There was a hope that as economic benefits came to Iran, its wider disruptive policies might change. By the time the constraints of the agreement finally expired, perhaps there would be an altogether different Iran from the one we know today. But the deal's main rationale - a particularly significant one given the current crisis - was that it helped to avert war. Before its signature, there was mounting concern about Tehran's nuclear activities and every chance that Israel (or possibly Israel and the US in tandem) might attack Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran has always insisted that it does not want the bomb. But at one point it certainly had a military nuclear programme. The specifically military aspects of its nuclear programme were halted some time ago, but its enrichment effort, the hardening of its facilities against attack, and its developing missile programme, all stoked fears that Tehran would one day get to a point where it could ""break out"" and dash towards a bomb. The whole point of the 2015 deal was to make this ""break-out"" time sufficient to ensure that any military-related activities would be spotted in time for international action to be taken. The deal went into force. But then along came President Trump and he wanted the agreement gone. Sanctions were re-imposed. Iran condemned this as a breach of the whole deal and thus determined to take action itself. It should be noted that prior to the US withdrawal, the international nuclear watchdog, the IAEA, was clear: Iran was living up to its side of the bargain. Since the US withdrawal, Iran (albeit after some delay) has successively breached some of the key constraints of the deal. Now it appears to be throwing these constraints over altogether. What matters now is precisely what it decides to do. Will it up its level of uranium enrichment to 20%? This would significantly reduce the time it would take Tehran to obtain suitable material for a bomb. Will it continue to abide by enhanced international inspection measures? Much has been made in Washington of Iran's wider regional behaviour. Signing the nuclear deal made no difference to this. Indeed, the initial relaxation of sanctions may have provided funds for Iran's expansive regional campaign of influence. But that is not what the agreement was designed to constrain. It was a nuclear agreement alone and according to most of its signatories it was working up until the US walked away. We are now at the destination the Trump administration clearly hoped for in May 2018. But the major powers, while deeply unhappy about  Iran's breaches of the deal, are also shocked at the controversial decision by Mr Trump to kill the head of Iran's Quds Force - a decision that has again brought the US and Iran to the brink of war. The tensions between the US and many of its European allies complicate things no end. Nobody other than President Trump wants to declare the agreement dead. Once it is gone and Iran is breaching its terms, the Europeans will have to decide whether to renew nuclear-related sanctions themselves. Accepting the deal's demise might make a difficult situation even worse and Iran clearly sees value in holding to the empty shell of the agreement - a least, to differentiate itself from Washington.

PM and European leaders call for US-Iran restraint,"No 10 has urged Iraq to allow UK troops to stay in the country following the US assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, saying their work is vital. Soleimani was killed in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday on the orders of President Donald Trump. Iraqi MPs responded to the strike by passing a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the foreign military presence in their country. European leaders have called for all sides to show restraint. Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Mark Esper hasdenied US troops are pulling out of Iraq,after a letter from a US general there suggested a withdrawal. The letter said the US would be ""repositioning forces in the coming days and weeks"" - but Mr Esper said there had been ""no decision whatsoever to leave"". Earlier, Boris Johnson spoke to Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi by phone, and a Downing Street spokesman said the leaders had ""agreed to work together to find a diplomatic way forward"". ""The prime minister underlined the UK's unwavering commitment to Iraq's stability and sovereignty and emphasised the importance of the continued fight against the shared threat from Daesh [the Islamic State group]"". Mr Johnson then chaired a meeting of senior ministers to discuss the deepening crisis. Afterwards, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the government's key message was the ""importance of de-escalating the tensions and finding a diplomatic way through this crisis"". He also distanced the UK from the US president's threat that cultural sites in Iran could be targeted, saying: ""We have been clear cultural sites are protected under international law and we would expect that to be respected."" Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Your questions: Will Soleimani killing spark war? About 400 British troops are stationed in Iraq, while the US has 5,200. Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg announced on Monday that the alliance's forces had suspended training in Iraq. Only a small number of the UK troops in Iraq are involved in that operation. The Army says that British troops are in the country toprovide training and equipment,externalto Iraqi and Kurdish security forces - rather than in a combat role - and have trained more than 25,000 Iraqi forces. Caretaker Iraqi Prime Minister Mr Abdul Mahdi spoke in favour of US and other foreign forces leaving the country, although most Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote. A UK government spokesman said that coalition forces were in Iraq to protect its people and others from the Islamic State group, at the request of the Iraqi government. Meanwhile, Iran's ambassador to the UK has strongly deniedreports in the Times,externalthat his country had threatened to kill British troops following the assassination of Soleimani. The paper quotes an unnamed senior commander in Iran's Revolutionary Guard as saying that its forces would ""target US troops in the Middle East without any concern about killing its allies, including UK troops"". But Hamid Baeidinejad described the story as ""provocative"" and a ""vicious lie""in a Twitter post,external. ""I will ask the concerned UK authorities to take swift action to stop such malicious false propaganda in this very sensitive time,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

An Iranian Embassy official also told the BBC there were no plans to attack British targets and said any suggestion that an attack could take place in Britain was laughable, adding ""we are not idiots"". Retired army officer Sir Simon Vincent Mayall warned on Radio 4's Today programme that British troops serving in the Middle East could ""possibly"" be killed in retaliation attacks on US soldiers. The Ministry of Defence adviser said western allied troops stationed in neighbouring Iraq were ""joined at the hip"" and that casualties could be shared in Iraq if Iran hits back. In a joint statement issued on Sunday night, Mr Johnson, Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron said the current cycle of violence ""must be stopped"" and called on Iran to refrain from further violent action and proliferation. The three leaders said they were concerned by the ""negative"" role Iran has played in the region but called on ""all parties to exercise utmost restraint and responsibility"". With tensions rising in the region, Iran has responded by vowing revenge and announcing it will no longer abide by the restrictions in its 2015 nuclear deal. The deal limited Iranian nuclear capacities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. A No 10 spokesman said Iran's announcement was ""extremely concerning"". ""It's in everyone's interest that the deal remains in place,"" he said, adding that ""it makes the world safer"". ""We've always said the nuclear deal is a reciprocal deal and in light of Iran's announcement we are urgently speaking to partners about next steps,"" the spokesman said. In their statement, the three European leaders urged the country to ""reverse all measures inconsistent with"" the deal. Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Mr Johnson said he spoke to President Trump on Sunday about the assassination of the Iranian general, who spearheaded the country's military operations in the Middle East as head of the elite Quds Force. The White House said the two leaders had ""reaffirmed the close alliance between the two countries"". Following warnings from Iran, Mr Trump said that the US would respond in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"". He repeated a threat to target Iranian cultural sites, saying the US would ""strike very fast and very hard"" if Tehran attacked Americans or US assets. Mr Johnson accused Soleimani of ""destabilising"" the region On Monday, former foreign secretary Jeremy Hunt told BBC Breakfast one ""heartbreaking"" result of the crisis was that it was now going to be ""much harder"" to secure the release of British-Iranian womanNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe. She was jailed in Iran over spying allegations that she denies. Meanwhile, a British frigate and destroyer - HMS Montrose and HMS Defender - are to start accompanying UK-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, where a tanker was seized by Iran last July.

Labour to decide rules for leadership battle,"The contest for the new Labour leader will formally begin on Tuesday with the winner announced on 4 April, the party's ruling body has decided. Those who join the party or become affiliated supporters before 20 January will be eligible to vote. Registered supporters - who are not full party members - will have 48 hours from 14-16 January to secure a vote by paying Â£25. Five MPs have so far entered the running to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Clive Lewis, Lisa Nandy, Jess Phillips, Sir Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry are all in contention. A sixth contender,shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey, is also expected to throw her hat into the ring.She is close to Mr Corbyn's inner circle and represented Labour in an election TV debate. However Yvette Cooper - a minister under former Labour leaders Tony Blair and Gordon Brown - hasruled herself out of the contest,external. Ms Cooper, who came third behind Jeremy Corbyn in 2015, had previously said she was considering standing. A party spokeswoman said: ""We want as many of our members and supporters to take part, so it has been designed to be open, fair and democratic."" The first parliamentary Labour Party hustings will be held on Tuesday with a similar event for deputy leadership candidates on Wednesday. 7-13 January: Nomination period for MPs and MEPs 14-16 January: Application period for registered supporters 15 January - 14 February: Second stage of nominations from Constituency Labour Parties (CLP) and affiliates, including unions 20 January: Freeze date for voting eligibility for new members and affiliated supporters 21 February: Ballot opens 2 April: Ballot closes 4 April: Special conference to announce results More than 500,000 people took part in the last leadership contest, when Mr Corbyn was re-elected in 2016. He signalled his intention to stand down last month after Labour lost its fourth general election in a row and his second as leader. His successor will be in place before council and mayoral elections at the start of May. Labour hopefuls address trust and Brexit issues Who will be Labour's next leader? Today's meeting was being closely watched to see whether the rules or the timetable for this contest might end up working in favour of any particular candidate. In fact, the NEC's decision today doesn't seem to have caused great surprise. Labour's ruling body has kept the rules for registered supporters the same as last time round. While some might claim the Â£25 fee is high and the 48-hour window small, others will argue they didn't prevent thousands taking part previously. In contrast to 2016, there will be more time for new members to join the party and be eligible to vote in the contest; a two-week window which is the minimum Labour's current rules allow. There is still some discussion about who gets access to party data and when - which might aid campaigning. But on the whole this timetable seems - so far - to have avoided significant controversy in the early stages of this crucial contest. A new deputy leader also has to be elected after Tom Watson stepped down in December and Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) also set the rules for that contest. Shadow education secretary Angela Raynerlaunched her candidacy for deputy in Stockport earlier. She said she would be backing friend and flat-mate Ms Long Bailey if she chose to run for the top job. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler and shadow Europe minister Khalid Mahmood have also confirmed they intend to run for the post of deputy. Rebecca Long Bailey is yet to formally enter the leadership race In order to take part, leadership candidates need the support of at least 22 MPs and MEPs, as well as the backing of at least 5% of constituency parties or three affiliated bodies - two of which must be trade unions. One of the key issues decided during the meeting was the cut-off period for membership. In 2016, the cut-off date was set retrospectively, but this time the NEC voted to stick with the time frame set out in Labour's rulebook, meaning those who want to join and vote now have two weeks to sign up. This is potentially helpful to Birmingham Yardley MP Ms Phillips and Ms Nandy, MP for Wigan. Both are looking to attract new members to join and vote for them, and to persuade former supporters - who became disillusioned about the party's direction under Mr Corbyn - to return to the fold. In contrast, those contenders who appear to be more popular with the current left-wing and pro-Remain membership, such as shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir, were likely to have benefitted from a more restricted timetable. MEPs will still be able to nominate candidates event though by the end of the race they are likely to be out of a job given the UK looks set to leave the EU on 31 January. The NEC also decided the rules around the participation of registered supporters. Since 2015, non-party members have been able to sign up temporarily at a reduced cost to cast a vote. When Mr Corbyn first became leader in 2015, people were given two months to sign up for a small fee of Â£3. A year later - when he was challenged by Owen Smith - the NEC gave them just two days and the fee went up to Â£25. However, more people signed up in 2016, with about 120,000 registered supporters ultimately taking part. The NEC is an elected body made of up parliamentarians, councillors, trade unionists and constituency party members.

Trump threatens sanctions if US troops exit Iraq,"Donald Trump has threatened Iraq with ""sanctions like they've never seen before"" President Trump has threatened severe sanctions against Iraq after its parliament called on US troops to leave the country. ""We have a very extraordinarily expensive air base that's there. It cost billions of dollars to build. We're not leaving unless they pay us back for it,"" he told reporters. Tensions are high after the US assassinated Iranian General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad last week. Iran has vowed ""severe revenge"". Soleimani, 62, spearheaded Iranian military operations in the Middle East, and was regarded as a terrorist by the US. The general's remains have now returned to his home country, where mourners packed the streets of Tehran early on Monday. Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? The new head of Iran's Quds force - which Soleimani led - has vowed to expel the US from the Middle East. ""We promise to continue martyr Soleimani's path with the same force... and the only compensation for us would be to remove America from the region,"" state radio quoted Esmail Qaani as saying. Soleimani was seen as the second most powerful figure in Iran The strike that killed Soleimani also claimed the life of Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis, a top Iraqi military figure who commanded the Iranian-backed Kataib Hezbollah group. Speaking from the presidential plane, Mr Trump said that if Iraq asked US forces to depart on an unfriendly basis, ""we will charge them sanctions like they've never seen before, ever. It'll make Iranian sanctions look somewhat tame."" Some 5,000 US soldiers are in Iraq as part of the international coalition against the Islamic State (IS) group. On Sunday, the coalition paused its operations against IS in Iraq, and Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave. Iraqi MPs back call to expel US troops The resolution was pushed through by the parliament's Shia Muslim bloc - which is close to Iran. Iran has announced it will no longer abide by restrictions imposed by the 2015 nuclear deal, under which it agreed to limit its sensitive nuclear activities and allow in international inspectors in return for the lifting of economic sanctions. Iran rolls back nuclear deal commitments Iran nuclear deal: Key details Iran's response options for Soleimani's death US President Donald Trump abandoned the deal in 2018, saying he wanted to force Iran to negotiate a new deal that would place indefinite curbs on its nuclear programme and also halt its development of ballistic missiles. Iranian MPs stood up in parliament and chanted 'death to America' for several minutes Iran refused and had since been gradually rolling back its commitments under the deal. In a statement, it said it would no longer observe limitations on its capacity for enrichment, the level of enrichment, the stock of enriched material, or research and development. The leaders of Germany, France and the UK - which were all signatories to the 2015 deal, alongside China and Russia - responded with ajoint statement urging Iran to refrain from ""further violent action or proliferation"",external. ""It is crucial now to de-escalate. We call on all the players involved to show utmost restraint and responsibility,"" they said. Mr Trump has vowed to strike back at Iran in the event of retaliation for Soleimani's death, ""perhaps in a disproportionate manner"". Allow Twitter content?

He also repeated a controversial threat to target Iranian cultural sites on Sunday, despite criticism from within the US and overseas. ""They're allowed to kill our people. They're allowed to torture and maim our people. They're allowed to use roadside bombs and blow up our people. And we're not allowed to touch their cultural site? It doesn't work that way,"" the president said. In a series of tweets on Saturday, Mr Trump said the US had identified 52 Iranian sites, some ""at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture"", and warned they would be ""HIT VERY FAST AND HARD"" if Tehran struck at the US. US ready to strike 52 Iranian sites, Trump warns US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a senior member of the Democratic Party, responded by tweeting: ""You are threatening to commit war crimes."" Iran's Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif drew parallels with IS destruction of the Middle East's cultural riches. This video can not be played Huge crowds poured into the city of Ahvaz in Iran to honour General Soleimani ""A reminder to those hallucinating about emulating ISIS war crimes by targeting our cultural heritage,"" he tweeted. ""Through MILLENNIA of history, barbarians have come and ravaged our cities, razed our monuments and burnt our libraries. Where are they now? We're still here, & standing tall."" Targeting cultural sites is banned under the Geneva and Hague Conventions - and violating them would constitute a war crime in the US. Iran is home to two dozen Unesco World Heritage sites. These are landmarks the UN's cultural organisation believes need preserving for their cultural, historic or scientific significance.They include:,external Persepolis, the capital of the ancient Persian Achaemenid empire and whose earliest remains date back to Sixth Century BC Naqsh-e Jahan Square in the city of Isfahan, which was built in the early 17th Century and is is one of the largest city squares in the world Golestan Palace in Tehran, the residence and seat of power for the Qajar dynasty which ruled Iran from 1785 to 1925 There are also a number of sites which - while not listed by Unesco - still retain huge cultural importance. For example, the Azadi (Freedom) Tower in Tehran has been the gathering point for celebrations, military parades and mass demonstrations for almost 50 years. Elsewhere in the city, the Mausoleum of Ruhollah Khomeini is dedicated to the Islamic Republic's founder and also houses the tombs of some of the country's leading political figures. The country has always insisted that its nuclear programme is entirely peaceful - but suspicions that it was being used to develop a bomb covertly prompted the UN Security Council, US and EU to impose crippling sanctions in 2010. The 2015 deal was designed to constrain the programme in a verifiable way in return for sanctions relief. It restricted Iran's enrichment of uranium, which is used to make reactor fuel but also nuclear weapons, to 3.67%. Iran was also required to redesign a heavy-water reactor being built, whose spent fuel would contain plutonium suitable for a bomb, and allow international inspections. Before July 2015, Iran had a large stockpile of enriched uranium and almost 20,000 centrifuges, enough to create eight to 10 bombs, according to the White House at the time. President Hassan Rouhani pictured at a nuclear plant in Iran in 2015 US experts estimated back then that if Iran had decided to rush to make a bomb, it would take two to three months until it had enough 90%-enriched uranium to build a nuclear weapon - the so-called ""breakout time"". Iran's current ""breakout time"", should it attempt to build a nuclear bomb, is estimated to be around a year, but this could be reduced to half a year or even a matter of months if enrichment levels are increased to 20%, for example.

Huge crowds at funeral for slain Iran commander,"This video can not be played Mourners packed the streets in Tehran - and Iran's supreme leader wept as he led prayers Huge crowds have packed the streets of the Iranian capital Tehran for the funeral of military commander Qasem Soleimani. Soleimani was assassinated in a US drone strike in Iraq on Friday on the orders of President Donald Trump. Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei led prayers and at one point was seen weeping. Iran has vowed ""severe revenge"" for the death of Soleimani and on Sunday pulled back from the 2015 nuclear accord. Soleimani, 62, headed Iran's elite Quds Force, and was tasked with protecting and boosting Iran's influence in the Middle East. In pictures: Tehran mourns Qasem Soleimani Trump under fire for threat to Iran cultural sites Voices from Iran: 'Soleimani did not deserve such a fate' He supported Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil conflict, aided the Shia militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon, and guided Iraqi militia groups against the Islamic State group. The US saw him as a terrorist, and President Trump said Soleimani was plotting ""imminent"" attacks on US diplomats and military personnel. In Iran, Soleimani was hailed as a national hero and widely considered the second most powerful man in the country behind Supreme Leader Khamenei. But not all Iranians are as distressed about the general's death as the mourners who lined Tehran's streets, says BBC Middle East Editor Jeremy Bowen. Soleimani was a hardliner and a dominant force in a regime that shot dead scores of protesters at the end of 2019. He also spent vast sums building up alliances and militias in Lebanon, Yemen, Iraq and Syria at a time when US sanctions are impoverishing many Iranians, our correspondent says. State television showed huge crowds in Tehran for the event. It put the number who turned out as ""millions"" although this is yet to be verified. Some people cried, while others clutched pictures of the late commander. Mourners passed Soleimani's coffin over their heads and ""death to America"" chants were heard. His daughter Zeinab Soleimani warned the US that it faced a ""dark day"". ""Crazy Trump, don't think that everything is over with my father's martyrdom,"" she said. Many in Iran saw Soleimani as a hero Among those there was Esmail Ghaani, the new head of Quds Soleimani's remains were then taken to Qom, one of the centres of Shia Islam, where massive crowds also gathered for a ceremony. The general will be buried in his hometown of Kerman on Tuesday. On Sunday Iran declared it would no longer abide by any of the restrictionsimposed by the 2015 nuclear deal. The deal limited Iranian nuclear capacities in exchange for the lifting of economic sanctions. Three European parties to the deal - Germany, France and the UK - urged Iran to abide by its terms. Who was Qasem Soleimani? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead and buried? Also on Sunday, Iraqi MPs passed a non-binding resolution calling for foreign troops to leave. US forces had been invited back to Iraq in 2014 to help defeat the Islamic State group, and there are about 5,000 in the country.

The president on Monday also responded to Iran's decision to no longer abide by the nuclear deal, tweeting: ""Iran will never have a nuclear weapon!"" A number of political leaders across the world have called for restraint, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and British Prime Minister Boris Johnson in a joint statement. Nato's ruling council met on Monday to discuss the crisis and made a similar call. Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said Nato had suspended its training operations within Iraq as a precautionary measure to protect personnel. US federal site hacked with pro-Iranian message Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words A brief history of US-Iran relations He said the decision to kill Soleimani had been made by the US alone, but that all Nato members had shown ""very strong unity"" and expressed concerned about Iran's ""destabilising actions in the region"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres urged restraint, saying: ""Geopolitical tensions are at their highest level this century."" Mrs Merkel will travel to Russia later this week for talks with President Vladimir Putin. Markets have remained turbulent. Brent crude oil topped $70 (Â£53) a barrel on Monday for the first time since September. The BBC's Persian service has been seeking the views of Iranians on Soleimani's killing. ""I believe Soleimani did not deserve such a fate. He did a lot for Iran, to protect this country. Our enemies have been attacking us for the past four decades and he tried to save the country,"" - Paniz (f) ""Soleimani was not a hero, in my opinion he was a soldier and overrated by the establishment.

How strong is Iran's military?,"Iran's missile capabilities are a key part of its military prowess Iran has launched more than a dozen missiles at two bases in Iraq housing US forces. It had vowed to retaliate after its most powerful military commander, General Qasem Soleimani, was killed by a US drone strike at Baghdad airport. So what do we know about Iran's military capabilities? Iran's missile systems are a key part of its military arsenal given its relative lack of air power. Regional rivals such as Israel and Saudi Arabia have the technology to carry out precision air strikes. Iran largely lacks this capability and so relies on launching missiles. A US Defense Department report describes the country's missile forces as the largest in the Middle East. It's not possible to give precise figures but the US-based Centre for Strategic and International Studies says Iran has thousands of missiles of more than a dozen different types. An Iranian media outlet reported that Fateh and Qiam missiles were used in the attack on the US base. Military analysts have also pointed to the use of these types based on images of the attack sites. The Qiam-1 missile has been widely produced since 2011, has a range of up 700km and a payload (an indication of how much explosive material it can carry) of 750kg.  It was used by Iran against IS fighters in June 2017. The Fateh class of missiles, which first went into service in the early 2000s, have a slightly lower payload. The variations of theShahab-3,externalintermediate range ballistic missile have payloads of more than 750kg and ranges upwards of 1,500km. For comparison, a US-built F35 fighter jet has a payload of up to 10,000kg. Iran has up to 50 medium range ballistic missile launchers and up to 100 short range ballistic missile launchers, according to the International Institute for Strategic Studies, a UK-based think tank. Iran is also testing space technology to allow it to develop longer range inter-continental missiles, according to the US report. ""Iran has a highly developed missile force with weapons of a variety of ranges"" says Jonathan Marcus, the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. ""They are reasonably accurate - but not as accurate or as reliable as advanced western systems."" What is the Patriot missile defence system? The long-range missile programme was put on hold by Iran following the 2015 nuclear deal, according to the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi), but this may now have resumedgiven the uncertainty surrounding that deal. In any case, many targets in Saudi Arabia and the Gulf would be within range of Iran's current short and medium-range missiles, and possibly targets in Israel as well. In May last year, the US deployed a Patriot anti-missile defence system to the Middle East as tensions with Iran increased. This is meant to counter ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and advanced aircraft. There are an estimated 523,000 active Iranian personnel, according to the IISS. This includes 350,000 in the regular army, and at least 150,000 in the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). There are a further 20,000 service personnel in the IRGC's naval forces. This group operates a number of armed patrol boats in the Strait of Hormuz, the site of several confrontations involving foreign-flagged tankers in 2019. Seized British-flagged tanker leaves Iran The IRGC also controls the Basij unit, a volunteer force which has helped suppress internal dissent. This unit can potentially mobilise many hundreds of thousands of personnel. The IRGC has its own navy and air force, and oversees Iran's strategic weapons The IRGC was set up 40 years ago to defend the Islamic system in Iran and has become a major military, political and economic force in its own right. Profile: Iran's Revolutionary Guards Top Iranian general killed by US in Iraq Despite having fewer troops than the regular army, it is considered the most authoritative military force in Iran. The Quds Force, which was led by General Soleimani, conducts secret operations abroad for the IRGC and reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. It's believed to be about 5,000 strong. The unit has been deployed to Syria, where it advised military elements loyal to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and armed Shia militias fighting with them. In Iraq, it has supported a Shia-dominated paramilitary force which assisted in the defeat of IS. However, the US says the Quds force has a wider role by providing funding, training, weapons and equipment to organisations that Washington has designated as terrorist groups in the Middle East. These include Lebanon's Hezbollah movement and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Iran's IRGC detained the British-flagged tanker the Stena Impero in the Strait of Hormuz in 2019 Economic problems and sanctions have hampered Iran's arms imports, which are relatively small compared to those of other countries in the region. The value of Iran's defence imports between 2009 and 2018 was equivalent to just 3.5% of Saudi Arabia's imports over the same period, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Most Iranian imports come from Russia, and the rest from China. Iran does not currently have a nuclear weapons programme, and has previously said it does not want one. But it does have many of the elements required and the knowledge to create a military nuclear capability. In 2015, the US government under President Obama estimated that Iran only needed two to three months to produce enough nuclear material to make a weapon. Iran nuclear deal: Key details Why do uranium enrichment limits matter? Is the Iran nuclear deal dead? The nuclear agreement that year between Tehran and six world powers - from which President Trump withdrew in 2018 -  introduced limits and international checks on Iran's nuclear activities. It aimed to make it more difficult and time consuming to develop weapons-grade material. Following the killing of General Soleimani by US forces, Iran has said it will not be bound by these restrictions. But it also says it will continue to co-operate with the UN's nuclear watchdog, the IAEA. The US has accused Iran of supplying Houthi rebels with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles Despite years of sanctions, Iran has also been able to develop drone capabilities. In Iraq, Iranian drones have been used since 2016 in the fight against IS. Iran has also entered Israeli airspace with armed drones operated from bases in Syria, according to Rusi. In June 2019, Iran shot down a US surveillance drone, claiming it had violated Iranian airspace over the Strait of Hormuz. The other aspect of Iran's drone programme is its willingness to sell or transfer its drone technology to its allies and proxies in the region, says Jonathan Marcus,the BBC's Defence and diplomatic correspondent. In 2019, drone and missile attacks damaged two key Saudi oil facilities. Both the US and Saudi Arabia linked these attacks to Iran, although Tehran denied any involvement and pointed to a claim of responsibility by rebels in Yemen. Following a major cyber-attack in 2010 on Iranian nuclear facilities, Iran ramped up its own cyber-space capability. The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) is believed to have its own cyber-command, working on commercial and military espionage. In 2012, US officials blamed Iran for a series of cyber attacks on US banks intended to disrupt traffic to their websites. A US military report in 2019 said Iran had also targeted aerospace companies, defence contractors, energy and natural resource companies and telecommunications firms for cyber-espionage operations around the world. Also in 2019, Microsoft said a hacker group that ""originates from Iran and is linked to the Iranian government""targeted a US presidential campaign and tried to break into the accounts of American government officials.,external Read more from Reality Check Send us your questions Follow us on Twitter,external LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Climate 'whiplash' linked to raging LA fires Watch: The moment five US presidents gather at Jimmy Carter's funeral The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

New car registrations fall to seven-year low,"New car registrations in the UK last year fell to their lowest level since 2013, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It was the third consecutive year of decline, and the SMMT expects that trend to continue in 2020. Those expectations are largely due to weak consumer confidence and confusion over clean-air legislation. The organisation also says the industry is facing serious challenges adapting to new emissions legislation. It says new rules will require a huge expansion in the use of electric and hybrid cars. But according to the SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes, the fallout from Brexit remains the biggest ""clear and present danger"" to the sector in the UK. The SMMT's figures,externalshow a total of 2.31 million new cars were registered in 2019, down 2.4% from the year before. Since reaching a record high of 2.69 million vehicles in 2016, the market has been steadily contracting, in response to what Mr Hawes describes as a ""perfect storm"" for the industry. A key factor has been the collapse in demand for diesel-powered cars, which fell by 22% compared with 2018. Where once they accounted for half of all new cars sold, now they make up just a quarter of the market. The SMMT says uncertainty over future air quality rules, and in particular over potential restrictions on diesel vehicles entering city centres, has left consumers confused. That, combined with political uncertainty and a general fall in consumer confidence, has meant many potential buyers have decided to hang on to their old cars rather than investing in new ones. Five reasons the car industry is struggling ""You can never put it down to one single factor. It has been a perfect storm over the past few years"", says Mr Hawes. ""It's really no surprise the market has been declining. That's why we need a return of confidence and strong economic conditions"". The situation is not expected to improve this year, however, with the SMMT forecasting a further 1.6 % fall in registrations in 2020. One area in which sales have increased dramatically over the past year is the market for ""alternatively fuelled vehicles"", in other words electric cars and hybrids. They rose by more than a fifth. Registrations of pure-electric cars were up 144%, albeit from a very low level. The problem for the industry is that this increase is not happening nearly fast enough. New EU rules which are being phased in this year, and which enter fully into force in 2021, oblige manufacturers to cut the average CO2 emissions of their new car fleets dramatically - or face swingeing fines. These targets are expected to remain in force, even after the UK has left the EU. But they imply a cut of more than a third in overall CO2 output, and the industry believes that meeting them will be extremely challenging. In fact, the SMMT calculates that without other changes, the market share of electric vehicles would have to rise from the current 1.6% to 27% - or the combined share of electric vehicles and hybrids would have to increase from 7.4% to 56%. In reality, manufacturers will not rely solely on selling more low- or zero-emission vehicles in order to meet the targets. They will also be able to withdraw their most-polluting models and sell more efficient petrol and diesel vehicles, for example. But sales of electric and hybrid vehicles will still need to rise very substantially, and Mr Hawes insists government must play a role. ""These are still expensive technologies. They carry a price premium,"" he says. ""That's why incentives are so significant in determining the uptake."" But of all the clouds hanging over the industry, one remains darker than the rest in the eyes of the SMMT: the aftermath of Brexit. Although the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January, what happens after the transition period remains uncertain. The government insists it will be able to conclude a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year. But if that doesn't happen, there remains the possibility that the movement of cars and car parts across the channel could be subject to steep tariffs or disruptive border checks and delays. ""That is probably the clear and present danger,"" says Mr Hawes ""Yes, we will always sell cars in the UK and buy cars in the UK. Where they come from will be affected by Brexit. How much you pay will be affected by Brexit."" ""That is right before us now.""

Johnson 'will not lament' Soleimani's death,"Boris Johnson has said ""we will not lament"" the death of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, describing him as ""a threat to all our interests"". But the prime minister called for ""de-escalation from all sides"" following thekilling in a US airstrike in Iraq on Friday. Mr Johnson's intervention came asIraqi MPs called for foreign troops to leave. And in a separate joint statement, Mr Johnson and his French and German counterparts urged restraint. French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel joined the PM in calling on Iran to refrain from further violent action and proliferation. ""The current cycle of violence in Iraq must be stopped,"" the joint statement, released late on Sunday night, said. With tensions rising in the region following the drone strike ordered by US President Donald Trump, Iran has responded by vowing revenge andannouncing it will no longer abide by the restrictions in its 2015 nuclear deal. In the statement, the three leaders urged the country to ""reverse all measures inconsistent with"" the deal. Why kill Soleimani now and what happens next? Who was Iran's Qasem Soleimani? Your questions: Will Soleimani killing spark war? Meanwhile, Mr Johnson is preparing to assemble key ministers to discuss the spiralling crisis in the Middle East. The prime minister said he spoke with Mr Trump on Sunday about the assassination of the Iranian general, who spearheaded the country's military operations in the Middle East as head of the elite Quds Force. Earlier on Sunday, in his first public statement since Soleimani's death, Mr Johnson said the 62-year-old had been ""responsible for a pattern of disruptive, destabilising behaviour in the region"". ""Given the leading role he has played in actions that have led to the deaths of thousands of innocent civilians and western personnel, we will not lament his death,"" Mr Johnson said. ""It is clear, however, that all calls for retaliation or reprisals will simply lead to more violence in the region and they are in no one's interest."" Mr Johnson said the UK was in ""close contact"" with all sides to encourage de-escalation and said Parliament will be updated when it returns on Tuesday. Mr Johnson accused Soleimani of ""destabilising"" the region Iraqi MPs have responded to the drone strike by passing a non-binding resolution calling for an end to the foreign military presence. Caretaker Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi spoke in favour of US and other foreign forces leaving, although most Sunni and Kurdish MPs boycotted the vote. About 400 British troops are stationed in Iraq, while the US has 5,200. A UK government spokesman said that coalition forces were in Iraq to protect its people and others from the Islamic State group. ""We urge the Iraqi government to ensure the coalition is able to continue our vital work countering this shared threat,"" he said. Meanwhile, HMS Montrose and HMS Defender are to start accompanying UK-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf, where a tanker was seized by Iran last July. This video can not be played Dominic Raab says he found out about the Soleimani killing ""as it happened"" Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that he learned of the US attack on Soleimani ""as it happened"", spoke to the Iraqi prime minister on Sunday morning. Mr Raab defended the killing because of the US's ""right to self-defence"" against Soleimani's use of militia's to destabilise the region and attack Western forces. He also defended Mr Johnson for being on holiday as the crisis unfolded, saying that he had been ""in constant contact with the prime minister over the Christmas break on a whole range of foreign policy issues"". Iran rolls back nuclear deal commitments Foreign Office warns against Iran and Iraq travel Shadow foreign secretary and Labour leadership candidate Emily Thornberry accused the prime minister of ""sunning himself"" while the chief civil servant chaired three meetings of Cobra, the government's emergency response committee. Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon,external, who is standing to be Labour deputy leader, said Mr Johnson's response was ""pathetic"", adding that he should stand up to a US president ""recklessly threatening to launch a war"".

But sales of electric and hybrid vehicles will still need to rise very substantially, and Mr Hawes insists government must play a role. ""These are still expensive technologies. They carry a price premium,"" he says. ""That's why incentives are so significant in determining the uptake."" But of all the clouds hanging over the industry, one remains darker than the rest in the eyes of the SMMT: the aftermath of Brexit. Although the UK is due to leave the EU on 31 January, what happens after the transition period remains uncertain. The government insists it will be able to conclude a trade deal with the EU by the end of the year. But if that doesn't happen, there remains the possibility that the movement of cars and car parts across the channel could be subject to steep tariffs or disruptive border checks and delays. ""That is probably the clear and present danger,"" says Mr Hawes ""Yes, we will always sell cars in the UK and buy cars in the UK. Where they come from will be affected by Brexit. How much you pay will be affected by Brexit."" ""That is right before us now.""

Number seeking advice over revenge porn doubles,"The number of people seeking help about so-called revenge porn has doubled in less than a year, a charity has said.

Sharing intimate content without consent becameillegal under the Abusive Behaviour and Sexual Harm (Scotland) Act in 2017. People convicted under the Act face up to five years behind bars.

She added: ""The relevant law here is still fairly new so it's important that people know and understand that sharing intimate images is a crime in Scotland. ""No matter why an image or video was taken or sent, most people don't expect or want them being shared more widely. ""The experience can be incredibly distressing, and many won't want to speak out, but people should know that if they have been a victim of this crime they have rights, and can report it to the police.""

Troubled Families scheme extended for further yearMinisters say the project is transforming people's lives and an extra Â£165m will be made available.,"The government's Troubled Families project is getting Â£165m in funding to ensure it continues for another year. Launched by David Cameron in 2012, the scheme targets families with multiple and complex social and health issues. Existing support for the project was due to run out later this year, prompting speculation about its future. But Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick said it had proved a success in transforming lives and relieving the burden on public services. The programme was set up by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition governmentin response to the 2011 riots in English cities, at a cost of Â£448m. It was revamped in 2015, with the aim of helping 400,000 families by 2020. About Â£920m has been spent since then, averaging about Â£157.6m, a year, with councils being paid on the basis of their results in helping the most vulnerable families. Anne Longfield, the Children's Commissioner for England, said the government announcement was ""welcome"" but needed to be followed by ""long term and extended funding commitments"" in this year's spending review. Writing on Twitter,,externalshe highlighted the ""vital"" role children's centres and so-called family hubs played in the initiative. Under the project, local authorities identify and support families in England with multiple problems, including domestic abuse, unemployment, mental health problems and truancy. Some big lessons from Troubled Families IDS's issues with Troubled Families scheme How one night in the riots changed my life Central government funds local authorities to work with these families on a payment-by-performance basis. In 2016,a report by the National Institute of Economic and Social Researchconcluded that the initiative had had no measurable effect on school attendance, employment or behaviour. And former work and pensions secretary Iain Duncan Smith suggested last year that the scheme had become a high-profile ""distraction"" and some of its targets were ""slightly nebulous"". But ministerssaid an evaluation published last April,externaldemonstrated that the programme had reduced the proportion of children going into care by a third, reduced the proportion of adults going to prison by a quarter and had cut the number of adults claiming Jobseeker's Allowance. Their latest analysis suggests 297,733 families have ""made improvements"" with the problems that led to them joining the programme since 2015. In 26,848 of these families, one or more adults has moved off benefits and into work. The scheme was set up in the wake of the 2011 riots in England The Treasury indicated in September's Spending Review that the programme would be extended, although ministers have yet to commit to its long-term future. Mr Jenrick said the new funding would be used to help families with inter-connected problems, including unemployment, poorâ¯school attendance, mental health issues, anti-social behaviour and domestic abuse. ""The programme will help more people in need get access to the early, practical and coordinated support to transform their lives for the better,"" he said. ""This is the right thing to do for families and for society as a whole, and these reforms will reduce the demand and dependency on costly, reactive key public services."" In their election manifesto, the Conservatives promised to develop ""family hubs"" to give vulnerable families intensive, integrated support to help care for their children, both in the early years and through to adulthood. Mr Jenrick's predecessor, James Brokenshire, suggested last year that the Troubled Families project could potentially be renamed to ensure it is not ""getting in the way of the positive objectives"". The Department for Communities said any future changes would be considered and announced in due course.
