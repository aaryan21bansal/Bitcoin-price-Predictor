Hong Kong reports 'first case' of virus reinfection,"Hong Kong scientists are reporting the case of a healthy man in his 30s who became reinfected with coronavirus four and a half months after his first bout. They say genome sequencing shows the two strains of the virus are ""clearly different"", making it the world's first proven case of reinfection. The World Health Organization warns it is important not to jump to conclusions based on the case of one patient. And experts say reinfections may be rare and not necessarily serious. There have been more than 23 million cases of coronavirus infection around the world. Coronavirus immunity: Can you catch it twice? More could have Covid immunity than tests suggest Can you become immune to coronavirus? Those infected develop an immune response as their bodies fight off the virus which helps to protect them against it returning. The strongest immune response has been found in the most seriously ill patients. But it is still not clear how strong this protection or immunity is - or how long it lasts. And the World Health Organization said larger studies over time of people who had previously had coronavirus were needed to find out more. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters This report, by the University of Hong Kong,external, due to be published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, says the man spent 14 days in hospital before recovering from the virus but then, despite having no further symptoms, tested positive for the virus a second time, following a saliva test during airport screening. ""This is a very rare example of reinfection,"" said Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis, at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""And it should not negate the global drive to develop Covid-19 vaccines. ""It is to be expected that the virus will naturally mutate over time."" Dr Jeffrey Barrett, senior scientific consultant for the Covid-19 genome project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""Given the number of global infections to date, seeing one case of reinfection is not that surprising even if it is a very rare occurrence. ""It may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious - though we don't know whether this person was infectious during their second episode."" Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said more information about this and other cases of reinfection was needed ""before we can really understand the implications"".

Driver jailed for head-on crash with cyclists,"The bikes were left scattered around the mountainside after the head-on crash A driver who ploughed head-on into four cyclists at 60mph has been jailed for two years and eight months. Jason Morgan, who had taken amphetamine, hit the riders with his Vauxhall Corsa on a mountain road in Bargoed in April. The 48-year-old, from Treharris, admitted drug driving, dangerous driving, and two counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. One of the cyclists suffered life-changing injuries. Photographs of the bikes crumpled and broken, one missing a wheel and parts spread around, were shown at Cardiff Crown Court. Jason Morgan apologised and said he never wanted to drive again Prosecutor Peter Donnison said friends Darran Thomas, Huw Smith, Christopher Jones and David Myhill were ""experienced and passionate"" cyclists who had ridden all over the world. Mr Donnison said the riders heard ""a car engine revving"" and saw it on the wrong side of the road travelling towards them. ""Mr Thomas thought the driver did not like cyclists and was doing it on purpose to scare them then realised he was not going to swerve or stop,"" the prosecutor said. ""He shouted at the driver and tried to avoid the car by turning towards the grassy bank but felt the bumper hit his leg and bike, and he was thrown into the air. ""He was struggling to breathe, he was in so much pain."" Mr Thomas, 54, suffered life-changing injuries, including a broken leg, six fractured ribs and a punctured lung. Six months after the crash he is still receiving physiotherapy and counselling. Mr Thomas said in a victim impact statement: ""I don't think I will ever be the same person again. ""I can't put into words the impact the incident has had on me. It has completely changed my life in ways I did not know were possible."" He said he did not think he would ever be emotionally strong enough to ride a bike on the road again. Defence barrister Lucy Crowther said: ""He does ask me to say, on his behalf, how desperately sorry he is. ""He has not driven since and he has got no intention of ever driving again in his life."" As well as the sentence, Judge Nicola Evans banned Morgan from driving for three years and ordered that his car be confiscated.

David Olusoga: 'TV industry left me crushed',"TV presenter David Olusoga has told the Edinburgh TV Festival his career had sometimes left him feeling ""crushed, isolated,"" and ""disempowered"". The historian and producer said he wanted to talk about his experiences as a black person working in TV ""in the spirit of Black Lives Matter"". He said sometimes he felt working in TV was ""the best job in the world"". But he added the industry's ""culture"" had also led him to seek medical treatment for clinical depression. ""I have been given amazing opportunities, but I've also been patronised and marginalised,"" he said in his MacTaggart Lecture. ""In the spirit of Black Lives Matters, in the spirit of an age in which millions of people have come to recognise that silence on these issues is a form of complicity, I am going to say what I really think about race, racism and our industry,"" he continued. ""And I'll discover if, at the end of it, I still have a career."" He warned broadcasters they risk fading into insignificance if they don't better represent ""marginalised"" people. ""I've been in high demand, but I've also been on the scrap heap. I've felt inspired, and convinced that our job - making TV and telling stories - is the best job in the world. BBC commits Â£100m to increasing diversity on TV ""But at other times I've been so crushed by my experiences, so isolated and disempowered by the culture that exists within our industry, that I have had to seek medical treatment for clinical depression."" He added: ""I've come close to leaving this industry on several occasions. And I know many black and brown people who have similar stories to tell."" Olusoga, who won a Bafta for his BBC documentary, Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners, made the comments while giving his keynote MacTaggart Lecture speech at the online event. Looking back on his career, the broadcaster and writer said he viewed himself as a ""survivor"", rather than ""a success story"". ""I am one of the last men standing of TV's lost generation,"" said Olusoga, who has also contributed to The One Show and The Guardian. ""The generation of black and brown people who entered this industry 15, 20, 25 years ago with high hopes. ""I'm a survivor of a culture within TV that failed that generation. I'm here because a handful of people used their power and their privilege to help me."" David Olusoga won a Bafta Award for Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners In 2016, Directors UK reported that 2.22% of TV programmes were made by black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) directors; who made up 3.6% of their data-set. The Film and TV Charity recently reported to the government that 73% of BAME production talent had considering leaving the TV industry. Olusoga noted how he'd attended a session at the Edinburgh TV festival 12 years ago on the topic of when exactly we might see the first black controller of a major network. Over a decade on, he stressed, the question remains. ""For as long as I've been in this industry we collectively have been aware that the people who make and commission the UK's television programmes do not look like the population at large - our audience,"" he said. He referred to a story when he was filming on a reconstructed slave plantation that had been built in Jamaica for a drama-documentary. ""As we were filming in a remote location we set up our own catering and on the first day cast crew and extras queued up for lunch. But without informing me it had been decided that the actors and the crew were to eat first, the extras would get their lunch afterwards. Standard procedure perhaps, but the unintentional effect was that white people ate first and black people only after they had finished."" He said what he found "" most shocking... was that my white colleagues - good, decent, creative people - genuinely could not see the problem, a problem that the black actors and the black extras had no problem seeing."" He also spoke about class privilege. ""What I learnt in my early years in TV is that there were parts of the industry in which diversity meant making sure that there was a fair balance of people from Oxford and Cambridge."" The broadcaster and writer also stressed that retaining TV talent and workers from non-white backgrounds was still a major issue, saying: ""We had them, we lost them"". He referred to the mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees. ""When I asked Marvin Rees why he had finally given up and left the industry this is what he said, 'The truth is, the BBC just wore me down with hopelessness.'"" He underlined how the events of 2020, including the Black Lives Matters protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd; and the spread of Covid-19 had ""made manifest and obvious some of the oldest and deepest inequalities in our society"". ""The generation that is leading this global shift in consciousness and for whom these principles are sacred, is also the generation that our industry is at risk of losing,"" he said. But he did feel there was hope for change this time around: ""So much has been promised that there is reason to hope that this really is a moment of change for our industry, rather than a false dawn - and we've had a number of those. ""There is, I honestly believe, real reason to be hopeful. This time it does feel different."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Cardiff socialising 'behind Covid-19 case rise',"Cardiff city centre at the end of July More people out socialising in Cardiff is believed to be behind a rise in coronavirus cases in the capital. There have been 47 positive tests in the last week - which is 37% of all cases in Wales. Public health officials said many of the new cases were among people between the ages of 20 and 30. But the infection rate is still well below some areas in northern England and the Midlands, which have seen local measures introduced. Fiona Kinghorn, director of public health at Cardiff and Vale health board, said they did not have a particular source in mind for the new cases, but they were believed to be more to do with people moving around between workplaces and social establishments. ""We've experienced a small number of clusters - that's led to a rise in the number of cases in Cardiff,"" she said. She said it was not a spike but a small rise - and a sign that people were not following social distancing rules and hand-washing. ""I think it's a result of people being out and about and in work places as well, we're not seeing people sticking to the rules,"" Ms Kinghorn said. She said if people were not able to work from home it was important they followed advice. The current infection rate in Cardiff is 12.8 cases per 100,000 over the last week.Only three new cases were reported on Monday, fewer than over previous days. But local interventions, including some lockdowns, have only been introduced in areas of England when weekly infections have reached 70 to 90 cases per 100,000. Birmingham was recently put on a ""watch"" list by Public Health England, with 31 cases per 100,000, but with problems confined to particular neighbourhoods. Coronavirus: What do the stats tell us in Wales? Cardiff Sky call centre workers test positive What happens if I'm in an area on the watchlist? Public Health Wales (PHW) said no outbreak had been declared and it was monitoring a number of small clusters. ""As we move through the recovery phase of the Coronavirus pandemic, we expect to see clusters in different settings,"" said a spokesman.Â ""We manage any clusters of Coronavirus appropriately, including by providing advice around infection prevention and control, and by supporting contact tracing where required."" PHW incident director Dr Robin Howe said: ""I think it is a concern that we are seeing an increase in cases, and they are particularly localised around Cardiff. ""It is good that we are identifying them and the Test Trace Protect scheme is kicking in and bringing those cases under control and making sure that all contacts are identified and isolated."" The coronavirus incident director said deaths ""usually"" reflected what was going on a few weeks previously in the pandemic. What was important, he said, was that the number of cases was kept under control. ""Deaths usually reflect what is going on a number of weeks ago in terms the pandemic, and there is likely to be a small tail of cases, happening over the next few days and weeks,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""We just need to ensure we keep the cases under control and it should mean that we don't have further deaths."" 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' Boris Johnson says it is 'vitally important' children return to class Is the US the worst-hit country for deaths? The latest figures show three deaths reported in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area - one on Saturday and two more last Thursday. Overall in Wales, there have been 127 Covid-19 cases over the last week - a case rate of four per 100,000. Dr Howe added: ""Just because we are able to go to shops and pubs, and people are increasingly going back to work, we still need to be vigilant and observe the social distancing of two metres wherever possible."" Other hygiene measures, such as hand washing, also needed to be adhered to, he added.

"Tesco's 16,000 jobs drive to reward lockdown temps","Tesco will create 16,000 new permanent jobs after lockdown led to ""exceptional growth"" in its online business. The new posts will include 10,000 staff to pick customer orders from shelves and 3,000 delivery drivers. The recruitment drive reflects the shift to online shopping, which was accelerated by lockdown. Tesco said it expected many of the roles to go to staff who joined them on a temporary basis at the start of the pandemic. Supermarkets scrambled to meet a surge in demand for online deliveries while the UK was in lockdown. Tesco said online customer numbers had risen from around 600,000 at the start of the pandemic, to nearly 1.5 million. How can I find a new job? 'Three quarters of UK does grocery shopping online' Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent Before the pandemic, around 9% of Tesco's sales were online. Now, online sales amount to 16% of sales, and are expected to be worth over Â£5.5bn this year, the company said. Online grocery orders now make up 16% of Tesco's sales ""The crisis has seen a dramatic increase in the size of the online grocery market in the UK,"" said Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital. ""It does not look like, and Tesco UK does not seem to think, it is going to revert back to the pre-coronavirus levels."" Tesco UK & Ireland's chief executive Jason Tarry said: ""These new roles will help us continue to meet online demand for the long term."" Tesco's announcement may sound like welcome relief from the somewhat ominous drip-drip of job cut announcements from retailers, but its real significance is to underline the shift in shopping habits from bricks-and-mortar retailing to online. That shift benefits those with a big online presence, at the cost of the old-fashioned shops that don't. It was already underway before the coronavirus crisis, threatening the viability of small independent retailers and defacing High Streets with boarded up shopfronts and 'To Let' signs. With lockdown, the shift accelerated dramatically, as even the remaining users of the High Street were forced to go online. At first, online retailers like Tesco hedged their bets to meet the surge in demand for online delivery, hiring thousands of workers on temporary contracts. However, now they're offering them permanent jobs it's clear that Tesco's executives believe much of the shift to online during the pandemic will be permanent. Growth in the online grocery market will have made the sector more profitable, points out Mr Black. ""As the market expands, economies of scale start to come into play,"" he said. There is no need to offer money-off coupons or free delivery to attract new customers in the current climate, he added. Mr Black emphasised that the efficiency of deliveries is improved because drivers can serve customers who are closer together, and supermarkets can make better use of systems, staff and equipment: ""You put all those things together and the industry goes from marginally loss-making to marginally profitable."" Tesco has already created 4,000 new permanent roles since March. The new roles are permanent and a mixture of full and part-time. The big supermarkets have added jobs in their warehouses during the pandemic The expansion is in contrast to other parts of the retail sector, where High Street companies have been forced to make steep job cuts following lockdown. Most recently, Marks & Spencer said it would axe 7,000 jobs over three months, while Debenhams said it plans to cut a further 2,500 roles. Even across the grocery sector the impact of lockdown has varied - discount chains, such as Aldi and Lidl, which were putting pressure on the bigger chains through lower prices, don't offer online services. ""The players that already had an established foothold, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, all reported incredibly high growth over last months,"" said Thomas Brereton retail analyst for Globaldata. ""They had vast hiring drives in April. So they could send them into stores and out as delivery drivers."" While Amazon has been trying to expand its fresh food delivery, it hadn't scaled up its services enough before the pandemic hit to make the most of increased demand, Mr Brereton added, and Ocado was limited by the capacity of its large automated warehouses. ""For Tesco as they rely on store picking rather than automated I think this is something they will keep for the foreseeable future.""

Man who believed virus was hoax loses wife to Covid-19,"Brian with his wife Erin, who passed away this month A Florida taxi driver, who believed false claims that coronavirus was a hoax, has lost his wife to Covid-19. Brian Lee Hitchens and his wife, Erin, had read claims online that the virus was fabricated, linked to 5G or similar to the flu. The couple didn't follow health guidance or seek help when they fell ill in early May. Brian recovered but his 46-year-old wife became critically ill and died this month from heart problems linked to the virus. Brian spoke to the BBC in July as part of aninvestigation into the human cost of coronavirus misinformation. At the time, his wife was on a ventilator in hospital. Erin, a pastor in Florida, had existing health problems - she suffered from asthma and a sleeping disorder. Her husband explained that the couple did not follow health guidance at the start of the pandemic because of the false claims they had seen online. Brian continued to work as a taxi driver and to collect his wife's medicine without observing social distancing rules or wearing a mask. They had also failed to seek help as soon as possible when they fell ill in May and were both subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19. Brian and Erin both came across conspiracy theories on Facebook Brian told BBC News that he ""wished [he'd] listened from the beginning"" and hoped his wife would forgive him. ""This is a real virus that affects people differently. I can't change the past. I can only live in today and make better choices for the future,"" Brian explained. ""She's no longer suffering, but in peace. I go through times missing her, but I know she's in a better place."" Brian said he and his wife didn't have one firm belief about Covid-19. Instead, they switched between thinking the virus was a hoax, linked to 5G technology, or a real, but mild ailment. They came across these theories on Facebook. ""We thought the government was using it to distract us,"" Brian explained, ""or it was to do with 5G."" But after the couple fell ill with the virus in May, Brian took to Facebook in a viral post to explain that he'd been misled by what he'd seen online about the virus. ""If you have to go out please use wisdom and don't be foolish like I was so the same thing won't happen to you like it happened to me and my wife,"" he wrote. Allow Facebook content?

In May, a BBC team tracking coronavirus misinformation found links to assaults, arson and deaths. Doctors and experts have warned that the potential for indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health information online remains huge - especially as anti-vaccination conspiracies are being spread on social media. While social media companies have made attempts to tackle misinformation about coronavirus on their platforms, critics argue that more needs to be done in the coming months. A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We don't allow harmful misinformation on our platforms and between April and June we removed more than seven million pieces of harmful Covid-19 misinformation, including claims relating to false cures or suggestions that social distancing is ineffective.""

National Guard deployed after US police shooting,"This video can not be played The US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin There have been clashes for a second night in Wisconsin, with buildings and cars set alight, following the police shooting of a black man on Sunday. Jacob Blake, 29, is in a stable condition after he was shot several times as he went to a car and opened its door in the city of Kenosha. Governor Tony Evers has called up the National Guard to aid local police. The killing of black man George Floyd in Minnesota in May led to protests against racism and police brutality. Demonstrations across the US and in many cities internationally put a spotlight on the treatment of African-Americans by US law enforcement and prompted a wider reflection on racism in society. How are African Americans treated under the law? Five pieces of context to understand US protests Why do some protests turn violent? Video footage of the Kenosha shooting, taken from across the street and shared on social media, shows Mr Blake leaning into the car and an officer grabbing his shirt, with seven shots heard. A curfew has been in effect in Kenosha from 20:00 local time (01:00 GMT) until 07:00 on Tuesday - but has been defied by some protesters. This video can not be played Wisconsin's Lieutenant Governor Mandela Barnes says the shooting was ""familiar violence to too many of us"" The BBC's Aleem Maqbool in Kenosha It had started out as an evening reminiscent of so many in towns and cities across the US after the killing of George Floyd, with hundreds of young people in Kenosha breaking a curfew to confront police lined up outside the courthouse. The demonstrators, here this time to call for justice for Jacob Blake, were initially pushed back and dispersed with strong tear gas and the use of sound bombs, but kept returning. Even now in the early hours of the morning they still face the officers in their riot shields. ""We're not leaving"", they chant. In the surrounding streets we saw vehicles set on fire, buildings vandalised and whole rows of streetlights pulled down. ""It is a breath of fresh air,"" one young protester told me. ""I am tired of being scared of the police killing me. Tonight they are going to listen."" Ina press release,external, Governor Evers said the ""limited mobilisation"" of the National Guard - made at the request of local officials - was to help law enforcement ""protect critical infrastructure"" and make sure people could demonstrate safely. He said he was deploying 125 members of the National Guard on Monday night. Earlier in the day some protesters tried to force their way into Kenosha's public safety building, demanding that the officers involved in the shooting be arrested. A door was broken off its hinges before officers in riot gear used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. At least one officer was injured in the neck by a firework, the New York Times reported. Buildings and cars were set alight in Kenosha Hundreds of people had also marched on police headquarters on Sunday night to demonstrate against the shooting. Governor Evers has condemned the shooting, saying Mr Blake was ""not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country."" But the Democratic governor has faced criticism for this response. Pete Deates, head of Kenosha's police union, said Mr Evers' statement was ""wholly irresponsible"" and said people should wait until all facts were known. Many of the protesters were chanting ""Justice for Jacob"" Mr Evers has also said there will be a special session of the state legislature on 31 August to discuss a package of laws announced earlier this year on accountability and transparency of the police following the police killing of George Floyd. Lawmakers had ""failed to act"" in the two months since he announced the ""commonsense policies"", the governor tweeted. Demonstrations have also spread to other parts of the country, with disturbances reported as protesters marched through Madison, Wisconsin, and Portland, Oregon. ""This is now a RIOT. Leave the area now,"" Portland Police tweeted as fires were being lit near the police building. Kenosha Police Department said the ""officer involved shooting"" happened shortly after 17:00 on Sunday. It added that officers had provided ""immediate aid"" to Mr Blake, who was taken to a hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition. The person who shot the video, Raysean White, said that before he began taking it, he saw police wrestle with Mr Blake. He said police punched and Tasered Mr Blake. ""Jacob kind of leaned on the car and they proceeded to wrestle him toward the back of the car and he went to the other side,"" Mr White told CNN. It was then he started recording. Mr Blake is shown walking around the front of the SUV. The two officers closest to Mr Blake at this point on the video are white males. As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Wisconsin's Department of Justice is investigating the incident The police said officers had been responding to a ""domestic incident"" but gave no details about what led to the shooting. They have not said how many officers were involved and no names have been given. Police in Kenosha do not have body cameras, although they do have microphones. Mr Blake's partner, Laquisha Booker, told a local NBC channel that the couple's three children were in the back of the vehicle at the time and saw the shooting. Civil rights lawyer Ben Crump, who represents the families of George Floyd and others pursuing actions against the police, has announced he is representing Mr Blake's family. In a statement released on Twitter,externalhe said the 29-year-old father ""was helping to de-escalate a domestic incident"" at the time. Mr Crump said the officers' ""irresponsible, reckless and inhumane actions nearly cost the life of a man who was simply trying to do the right thing"".

Police 'can't win' after breaking up child's party,"Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said illegal gatherings were a drain on police resources Police criticised for breaking up a child's 10th birthday party celebration say they ""can't win"" when enforcing enhanced coronavirus restrictions. Greater Manchester Police's Chief Constable revealed the force attended 126 incidents over the weekend. Officers were slammed by some for breaking up the child's party in Manchester and issuing a fine. But Ian Hopkins said it was not a ""jelly and ice cream"" event and saw ""mostly adults celebrating"". Police were ""in a difficult position"" with ""lots of reports"" of lockdown breaches, he said, and were trying to take a ""very balanced and proportionate view"". He continued: ""We can't win. If we don't deal with them, people are saying it isn't fair and when we do deal with it people are saying it is heavy-handed. ""Throughout this pandemic we have issued very few fixed penalty notices. And even this weekend we have only issued 19. ""We don't get to everything. We just have to assess which [gatherings] appear to be the biggest and most problematic."" Lockdown restrictions on social gatherings remainin Greater Manchester following a local spike in cases. As well as illegal gatherings, officers visited 172 licensed premises over the weekend. Greater Manchester is among the areas of northern England still subject to enhanced lockdown restrictions Mr Hopkins said ""pretty much all"" bars were showing ""really good measures to keep people safe"" but that was not the case with house parties. ""It isn't safe. Social distancing is not taking place and that will lead to the virus spreading,"" he said. He said the force had received help this weekend from police forces in Durham, Humberside, North Yorkshire, Cheshire and North Wales. He said it meant an extra Â£100,000 a week had to found to cover the costs. The child's 10th birthday party in Swinton was being attended by three families in a private garden after 20:00 BST on Friday. Mr Hopkins said the force was not ""making an example of them"" but defended the fine issued to the homeowner, adding: ""Those people knew they were breaching the regulations"".

"Last Night of the Proms will play Rule, Britannia","Orchestral versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory will be performed at the Last Night Of The Proms, the BBC has confirmed. It had been reportedthe songs could be dropped over concerns of associations with colonialism and slavery. The pieces are usually sung but will be performed without lyrics this year, although they are expected to be back in full when the pandemic is over. The concert is due to take place on 12 September but without an audience. In a statement on Monday evening, BBC Proms said it was announcing the concert's programme following recent speculation. It said there would be new orchestral versions of Land Of Hope And Glory, and Rule, Britannia!, as well as a new arrangement of Jerusalem. ""With much reduced musical forces and no live audience, the Proms will curate a concert that includes familiar, patriotic elements such as Jerusalem and the National Anthem, and bring in new moments capturing the mood of this unique time, including You'll Never Walk Alone, presenting a poignant and inclusive event for 2020,"" the statement said. Ivor Novello-winning composer Errollyn Wallen confirmed online on Monday evening that she is making the new arrangement of Proms favourite, Jerusalem, ""In it I remember the Commonwealth nations and am dedicating the work to the Windrush generation,""tweeted,externalthe Belize-born British musician. At the weekend, the Sunday Times had reported both Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory could be dropped from the programme. The paper said conductor Dalia Stasevska believed it was time ""to bring change"" to the Royal Albert Hall, in the year that the anti-racism movement gathered pace followingthe death of George Floyd. The 35-year-old Finnish conductor, who will be joined by soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra for this year's classic al finale, declined to comment on the reports directly. Dalia Stasevska will conduct The Last Night of the Proms this year inside an audience-less Royal Albert Hall In its statement, the BBC added they ""very much regret the unjustified personal attacks on Dalia Stasevska"" on social media. ""As ever, decisions about the Proms are made by the BBC, in consultation with all artists involved,"" it said. ""The Proms will reinvent the Last Night in this extraordinary year so that it respects the traditions and spirit of the event whilst adapting to very different circumstances at this moment in time."" All the familiar tunes will be there but in a very unfamiliar setting. The Last Night of the Proms will still have Jerusalem, the National Anthem and new orchestral versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory. However, there will be no live audience in the Royal Albert Hall to sing along, and the number of musicians and singers will be reduced and dispersed around the hall because of social distancing. The music will, the BBC says, have to be adapted to reflect the new circumstances - which means there will be no singing of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory. The rumours that the tunes were being dropped for political reasons because of concerns about lyrics extolling Britain's imperial past has led to a heated debate. The BBC says the orchestra-only arrangement was how the tunes were first performed at the Proms in 1905, and it's clear the evening's two rousing sing-along tunes would sound odd and perhaps rather bleak with just a handful of singers spread around an empty hall. It's understood that the songs will return with their lyrics when the coronavirus restrictions come to an end. Meanwhile, Jerusalem, another sing-along favourite, will still have its words, as will the National Anthem. On Monday, Downing Street waded into the row, with a spokesman saying: ""This is a decision and a matter for the organisers of the Proms and the BBC. ""But the PM previously has set out his position on like issues and has been clear that while he understands the strong emotions involved in these discussions, we need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols."" Proms concerts will change depending on Covid rules Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden also said he had raised ""concerns"" with the corporation over the Sunday Times' report. ""Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory are highlights of the Last Night of the Proms,"" he tweeted. ""Share concerns of many about their potential removal and have raised this with BBC. ""Confident forward-looking nations don't erase their history, they add to it."" Meanwhile, Tory MP Michael Fabricant said the move was ""all very sad"", adding: ""There's some lovely words to Rule Britannia."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he called for a ""compromise"" of a single voice performing the tune, rather than the usual sing-along version. ""Let's just have a single voice singing those words proudly,"" he said. ""There's nothing wrong with a bit of tradition, and it's a beautiful tune."" Rule, Britannia! was set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740, and its lyrics were based on a poem by James Thomson. It contains verses such as: ""The nations, not so blest as thee / Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall. ""While thou shalt flourish great and free / The dread and envy of them all. ""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves / Britons never will be slaves."" Land Of Hope And Glory makes similar reference to the ""might"" of the former British Empire, which some people today find problematic. Chi-chi Nwanoku runs the Chineke! Foundation, which aims to provide opportunities for black, Asian and ethnically diverse classical musicians in the UK and Europe, said: ""We find it offensive. ""Of course I know other people are going to want to cling to it, but I know why they want to cling to it. ""These songs are jingoistic echoes of empire and, depending on what side of the fence you're sitting on, you either feel joyous, emboldened and patriotic and immediately identify with all the sentiments of it."" Chi-chi Nwanoku's Chineke! Foundation is about ""championing change and celebrating diversity in classical music"" ""For any conscious black person who is aware of their history, the empire and colonialism, for example, they will struggle to enjoy the patriotic jingoism of these songs."" She particularly draws attention to the themes of superiority, domination and ownership of black people. ""And the thing is, people continue to benefit from the proceeds of that relationship,"" she says. ""How are we going to break down the institutional system, if we hang on to these [songs]?""

Gospel-singing MP 'ordered pastor spouse's murder',"Flordelis dos Santos de Souza cannot be arrested because she has parliamentary immunity A Brazilian congresswoman has been accused of orchestrating the murder of her pastor husband, after multiple botched attempts. Flordelis dos Santos de Souza's husband, Anderson do Carmo, was shot 30 times at their home in Rio de Janeiro in June 2019. Ms de Souza, 59, said her husband, 42, had been killed in a robbery. But prosecutors say they have unearthed a murder plot, implicating Ms de Souza and several of her children. Ms de Souza, a celebrity lawmaker for Rio de Janeiro who found fame as a gospel singer before entering politics, has dismissed the allegations, insisting she is innocent. On Monday, prosecutors announced charges against Ms de Souza and 10 others, including six of her children and one granddaughter. Arrest warrants were issued against nine of the accused. Police could not arrest Ms de Souza, known as Flordelis to her fans, because her status as an elected lawmaker affords her parliamentary immunity. Instead, detectives have written to Congress with details of their investigation, asking for Ms de Souza to be stripped of her parliamentary status. ""The conclusion the investigation reached was this: that she [Ms de Souza] planned this cowardly murder,"" homicide chief Antonio Ricardo Lima Nunes told reporters. He cited a feud over Mr do Carmo's handling of the family's finances as a possible motive. Prosecutors described a vicious family row in which Ms de Souza's husband blocked her from giving ""preferential treatment"" to her favourite children. They said Ms de Souza had tried to poison her husband at least six times before ultimately ordering several of her children to kill him. Mr do Carmo, 42, was gunned down in the early hours of 16 June at the couple's home in Niteroi, a city in south-east Brazil. Investigators said Flavio dos Santos Rodrigues, Ms de Souza's biological son, fired the shots that killed his stepfather, with a gun purchased by Lucas Cesar dos Santos, one of the couple's adopted children. Given Ms de Souza's celebrity status, Mr do Carmo's murder and the subsequent investigation has attracted much media attention in Brazil. Ms de Souza and her husband, who were parents to more than 50 biological and adopted children, were considered a power couple of Brazil's burgeoning Evangelical Christian movement. The lawmaker has pleaded her innocence, insisting she ""never ordered this savage crime"" her lawyer said, according to Brazilian media. But speaking to Brazilian TV network Globo, police commissioner Allan Duarte portrayed Ms de Souza as the ringleader of the alleged murder plot. ""The investigation demonstrated that [Ms de Souza's] image of altruism and decency was merely a ploy to gain wealth and political power,"" he said.

Protests erupt as Wisconsin police shoot black man,"This video can not be played US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin Protests have erupted in the US state of Wisconsin after police shot a black man many times while responding to what they said was a domestic incident. The man, identified as Jacob Blake, was taken to hospital for surgery and is now in intensive care, his family said. Video posted online appears to show Mr Blake being shot in the back as he tries to get into a car in Kenosha. Authorities in the city declared an emergency overnight curfew after unrest broke out following the shooting. Hundreds of people marched on police headquarters on Sunday night. Vehicles were set on fire and protesters shouted ""We won't back down"". Protesters set vehicles on fire in Kenosha In a public safety alert, police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. On Twitter, President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr decried the protests as ""anarchy"", and reposted a series of videos depicting burning buildings and cars, purportedly filmed in Kenosha. Officers used tear gas to try to disperse hundreds of protesters who defied the county-wide curfew, which is in place until 07:00 on Monday (12:00 GMT). How are African Americans treated under the law? What's next after flood of racial equity donations? Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers condemned the shooting of Mr Blake, who was reportedly unarmed. ""While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,"" he said in a statement. ""I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognise the racism in our state and our country for far too long."" Allow Twitter content?

Jacob Blake's name was trending on social media and thousands signed a petition calling for the officers involved to be charged. He is now out of surgery and in stable condition, according to family and friends on social media. The shooting comes amid heightened tensions in the US over racism and police brutality following the death of African-American man George Floyd earlier this year. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday released a statement calling for a ""full and transparent investigation"" of the shooting. ""This morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force,"" Mr Biden said. ""The officers must be held accountable."" Kenosha Police Department said the ""officer involved shooting"" happened shortly after 17:00 on Sunday.  It added that officers had provided ""immediate aid"" to Mr Blake, who was taken to a hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition. It said police had been responding to a ""domestic incident"" but gave no details about what led to the shooting. It is so far unclear who called police and what happened before the video recording began. The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating the incident. It said the officers involved had been placed on administrative leave. As of Monday morning local time, more than 18,000 people had signed a petition on change.org calling for the officers involved to be charged. In video footage shared on social media, three officers can be seen pointing their weapons at a man identified as Mr Blake as he walks around a parked SUV. As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire.  Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. The officers involved have not been officially named. Prominent civil rights lawyer Ben Crump told CNN that Mr Blake's family had reached out to him for assistance. In a tweet, he said Mr Blake's three sons were in the car he was getting into when he was shot. ""They saw a cop shoot their father. They will be traumatized forever. We cannot let officers violate their duty to PROTECT us,"" he wrote. He said the shooting happened after Mr Blake tried to break up a fight between two women. This video can not be played Why does Wisconsin send so many black people to jail? Witnesses also told local news site Kenosha News that Mr Blake had tried to break up a fight between two women and that police had attempted to use a Taser on him prior to the shooting. Clyde McLemore, a spokesman with a nearby chapter of Black Lives Matter, told reporters ""the frustration is boiling to the top and we're sick and tired"". Black Lives Matter protests were held across the US and around the world after African-American man George Floyd was killed in police custody in Wisconsin's neighbouring state of Minnesota in May. A white police officer knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes before he died. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with murder.

"Last Night of the Proms will play Rule, BritanniaOrchestral versions of the song and Land Of Hope And Glory will be played but without lyrics.Entertainment & Arts","Orchestral versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory will be performed at the Last Night Of The Proms, the BBC has confirmed. It had been reportedthe songs could be dropped over concerns of associations with colonialism and slavery. The pieces are usually sung but will be performed without lyrics this year, although they are expected to be back in full when the pandemic is over. The concert is due to take place on 12 September but without an audience. In a statement on Monday evening, BBC Proms said it was announcing the concert's programme following recent speculation. It said there would be new orchestral versions of Land Of Hope And Glory, and Rule, Britannia!, as well as a new arrangement of Jerusalem. ""With much reduced musical forces and no live audience, the Proms will curate a concert that includes familiar, patriotic elements such as Jerusalem and the National Anthem, and bring in new moments capturing the mood of this unique time, including You'll Never Walk Alone, presenting a poignant and inclusive event for 2020,"" the statement said. Ivor Novello-winning composer Errollyn Wallen confirmed online on Monday evening that she is making the new arrangement of Proms favourite, Jerusalem, ""In it I remember the Commonwealth nations and am dedicating the work to the Windrush generation,""tweeted,externalthe Belize-born British musician. At the weekend, the Sunday Times had reported both Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory could be dropped from the programme. The paper said conductor Dalia Stasevska believed it was time ""to bring change"" to the Royal Albert Hall, in the year that the anti-racism movement gathered pace followingthe death of George Floyd. The 35-year-old Finnish conductor, who will be joined by soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra for this year's classic al finale, declined to comment on the reports directly. Dalia Stasevska will conduct The Last Night of the Proms this year inside an audience-less Royal Albert Hall In its statement, the BBC added they ""very much regret the unjustified personal attacks on Dalia Stasevska"" on social media. ""As ever, decisions about the Proms are made by the BBC, in consultation with all artists involved,"" it said. ""The Proms will reinvent the Last Night in this extraordinary year so that it respects the traditions and spirit of the event whilst adapting to very different circumstances at this moment in time."" All the familiar tunes will be there but in a very unfamiliar setting. The Last Night of the Proms will still have Jerusalem, the National Anthem and new orchestral versions of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory. However, there will be no live audience in the Royal Albert Hall to sing along, and the number of musicians and singers will be reduced and dispersed around the hall because of social distancing. The music will, the BBC says, have to be adapted to reflect the new circumstances - which means there will be no singing of Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory. The rumours that the tunes were being dropped for political reasons because of concerns about lyrics extolling Britain's imperial past has led to a heated debate. The BBC says the orchestra-only arrangement was how the tunes were first performed at the Proms in 1905, and it's clear the evening's two rousing sing-along tunes would sound odd and perhaps rather bleak with just a handful of singers spread around an empty hall. It's understood that the songs will return with their lyrics when the coronavirus restrictions come to an end. Meanwhile, Jerusalem, another sing-along favourite, will still have its words, as will the National Anthem. On Monday, Downing Street waded into the row, with a spokesman saying: ""This is a decision and a matter for the organisers of the Proms and the BBC. ""But the PM previously has set out his position on like issues and has been clear that while he understands the strong emotions involved in these discussions, we need to tackle the substance of problems, not the symbols."" Proms concerts will change depending on Covid rules Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden also said he had raised ""concerns"" with the corporation over the Sunday Times' report. ""Rule Britannia and Land of Hope and Glory are highlights of the Last Night of the Proms,"" he tweeted. ""Share concerns of many about their potential removal and have raised this with BBC. ""Confident forward-looking nations don't erase their history, they add to it."" Meanwhile, Tory MP Michael Fabricant said the move was ""all very sad"", adding: ""There's some lovely words to Rule Britannia."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he called for a ""compromise"" of a single voice performing the tune, rather than the usual sing-along version. ""Let's just have a single voice singing those words proudly,"" he said. ""There's nothing wrong with a bit of tradition, and it's a beautiful tune."" Rule, Britannia! was set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740, and its lyrics were based on a poem by James Thomson. It contains verses such as: ""The nations, not so blest as thee / Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall. ""While thou shalt flourish great and free / The dread and envy of them all. ""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves / Britons never will be slaves."" Land Of Hope And Glory makes similar reference to the ""might"" of the former British Empire, which some people today find problematic. Chi-chi Nwanoku runs the Chineke! Foundation, which aims to provide opportunities for black, Asian and ethnically diverse classical musicians in the UK and Europe, said: ""We find it offensive. ""Of course I know other people are going to want to cling to it, but I know why they want to cling to it. ""These songs are jingoistic echoes of empire and, depending on what side of the fence you're sitting on, you either feel joyous, emboldened and patriotic and immediately identify with all the sentiments of it."" Chi-chi Nwanoku's Chineke! Foundation is about ""championing change and celebrating diversity in classical music"" ""For any conscious black person who is aware of their history, the empire and colonialism, for example, they will struggle to enjoy the patriotic jingoism of these songs."" She particularly draws attention to the themes of superiority, domination and ownership of black people. ""And the thing is, people continue to benefit from the proceeds of that relationship,"" she says. ""How are we going to break down the institutional system, if we hang on to these [songs]?""

David Olusoga: 'TV industry left me crushed'The presenter says his experience working as a black person in the TV industry left him with depression.Entertainment & Arts,"TV presenter David Olusoga has told the Edinburgh TV Festival his career had sometimes left him feeling ""crushed, isolated,"" and ""disempowered"". The historian and producer said he wanted to talk about his experiences as a black person working in TV ""in the spirit of Black Lives Matter"". He said sometimes he felt working in TV was ""the best job in the world"". But he added the industry's ""culture"" had also led him to seek medical treatment for clinical depression. ""I have been given amazing opportunities, but I've also been patronised and marginalised,"" he said in his MacTaggart Lecture. ""In the spirit of Black Lives Matters, in the spirit of an age in which millions of people have come to recognise that silence on these issues is a form of complicity, I am going to say what I really think about race, racism and our industry,"" he continued. ""And I'll discover if, at the end of it, I still have a career."" He warned broadcasters they risk fading into insignificance if they don't better represent ""marginalised"" people. ""I've been in high demand, but I've also been on the scrap heap. I've felt inspired, and convinced that our job - making TV and telling stories - is the best job in the world. BBC commits Â£100m to increasing diversity on TV ""But at other times I've been so crushed by my experiences, so isolated and disempowered by the culture that exists within our industry, that I have had to seek medical treatment for clinical depression."" He added: ""I've come close to leaving this industry on several occasions. And I know many black and brown people who have similar stories to tell."" Olusoga, who won a Bafta for his BBC documentary, Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners, made the comments while giving his keynote MacTaggart Lecture speech at the online event. Looking back on his career, the broadcaster and writer said he viewed himself as a ""survivor"", rather than ""a success story"". ""I am one of the last men standing of TV's lost generation,"" said Olusoga, who has also contributed to The One Show and The Guardian. ""The generation of black and brown people who entered this industry 15, 20, 25 years ago with high hopes. ""I'm a survivor of a culture within TV that failed that generation. I'm here because a handful of people used their power and their privilege to help me."" David Olusoga won a Bafta Award for Britain's Forgotten Slave Owners In 2016, Directors UK reported that 2.22% of TV programmes were made by black, Asian, and minority ethnic (BAME) directors; who made up 3.6% of their data-set. The Film and TV Charity recently reported to the government that 73% of BAME production talent had considering leaving the TV industry. Olusoga noted how he'd attended a session at the Edinburgh TV festival 12 years ago on the topic of when exactly we might see the first black controller of a major network. Over a decade on, he stressed, the question remains. ""For as long as I've been in this industry we collectively have been aware that the people who make and commission the UK's television programmes do not look like the population at large - our audience,"" he said. He referred to a story when he was filming on a reconstructed slave plantation that had been built in Jamaica for a drama-documentary. ""As we were filming in a remote location we set up our own catering and on the first day cast crew and extras queued up for lunch. But without informing me it had been decided that the actors and the crew were to eat first, the extras would get their lunch afterwards. Standard procedure perhaps, but the unintentional effect was that white people ate first and black people only after they had finished."" He said what he found "" most shocking... was that my white colleagues - good, decent, creative people - genuinely could not see the problem, a problem that the black actors and the black extras had no problem seeing."" He also spoke about class privilege. ""What I learnt in my early years in TV is that there were parts of the industry in which diversity meant making sure that there was a fair balance of people from Oxford and Cambridge."" The broadcaster and writer also stressed that retaining TV talent and workers from non-white backgrounds was still a major issue, saying: ""We had them, we lost them"". He referred to the mayor of Bristol, Marvin Rees. ""When I asked Marvin Rees why he had finally given up and left the industry this is what he said, 'The truth is, the BBC just wore me down with hopelessness.'"" He underlined how the events of 2020, including the Black Lives Matters protests in the wake of the death of George Floyd; and the spread of Covid-19 had ""made manifest and obvious some of the oldest and deepest inequalities in our society"". ""The generation that is leading this global shift in consciousness and for whom these principles are sacred, is also the generation that our industry is at risk of losing,"" he said. But he did feel there was hope for change this time around: ""So much has been promised that there is reason to hope that this really is a moment of change for our industry, rather than a false dawn - and we've had a number of those. ""There is, I honestly believe, real reason to be hopeful. This time it does feel different."" Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

'Creepy men' message women on Scrabble Go app,"Players on Scrabble go can chat with anyone they are playing a game against A number of women who play online Scrabble on the Scopely app Scrabble Go say they are being messaged by ""creepy men"" within the game's chat function. They begin a game and then start asking where the women live and whether they are married and want to continue chatting via other messaging apps such as WhatsApp. It is likely many of them are romance scammers. Scopely said the chat function could be restricted to friends only. One woman, who is in her 60s and lives in London, told BBC News she was contacted via private message by two or three people per week, all claiming to be men from the US. She did not wish to be named. ""It's almost like a script,"" she said. ""They start with, 'How you doing?' They match you to start a game, then start messaging. ""They play very badly, so you win the game. And then they big you up. ""Regularly, they say, 'I just want to check, can't we be friends?' ""When you say, 'No,' some of them disappear, they resign from the game. ""If you don't reply at all, most of them resign from the game."" She believes many of them are scammers. English did not appear to be their first language, she said. One man confessed to using his son's photograph as a profile picture, because he thought his son was ""more attractive"". ""This is not a dating site,"" she said. Scopely said it ""does not tolerate any harassment or misconduct"" on its games platforms and players should report incidents to it. ""In Scrabble Go, players are able to access mute and block functions within the chat feature, as well as the 'mute public chat' privacy setting,"" a spokeswoman said. ""When enabled, players will only receive chat notifications and messages from players they already know and are connected with as a Facebook friend, favourite, or via their synced contacts."" Scrabble Go became the official Scrabble app in June 2020 Scrabble Go launched in March 2020. And it became the official Scrabble app in June, when the Mattel franchise ended with games giant EA. It says it has 2.5 million daily players. But a petition calling for the return of the EA app has now had nearly 8,500 signatures. And Scopely introduced a ""classic"", stripped-down version of the game aftercomplaints about additional features such as treasure-style rewards and vivid colours. One woman who signed the petition three days ago, wrote: ""I do not like being targeted by creepy men who want to chat not play Scrabble."" Australia's Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Gizmodoit had received two reports of romance scams on Scrabble Go in its first three months,externalbut it had also received two about the previous EA app during the first half of 2020. On the website sixtyandme, Pat Skenedescribed similar experiences on the unofficial Scrabble-like app Words With Friends.,external ""Suddenly, I'm inundated with guys wanting to hook up because they have fallen madly in love with me at first sight,"" she wrote in a blog last year. It's a problem that is common across many social-media platforms. And it's difficult to police, especially as it takes place in the form of private messages. Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber-security, said: ""As individuals, we really need to start treating unsolicited online contact with people we don't know as suspicious until it's proven otherwise.""

"Could the BBC Proms drop Rule, Britannia?","Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory could be dropped from the Last Night of the Proms in the wake of the recent Black Lives Matter protests, according to reports. The Sunday Times claims,externalthere are concerns at the BBC about associations with colonialism and slavery. The Last Night of the Proms is due to take place on 12 September, but without an audience, due to coronavirus. A government spokesman said they would leave any such decision up to the BBC. However, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden explained on Monday that he had raised ""concerns"" with the corporation over reports the popular songs could be axed on the night. Proms concerts will change depending on Covid rules The Sunday Times suggested that conductor Dalia Stasevska believes it is time ""to bring change"" to the Royal Albert Hall, in the year that the anti-racism movement gathered pace followingthe death of George Floyd. The 35-year-old Finnish conductor, who will be joined by soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra for this year's classical finale, declined to comment on the reports directly, and BBC Proms refused to confirm or deny the story. ""We are still finalising arrangements for the Last Night of the Proms so that we are able to respond to the latest advice in regards to Covid-19 and deliver the best offering possible for audiences,"" a spokeswoman told BBC News, noting that full details will be announced nearer the time. Dalia Stasevska will conduct The Last Night of the Proms this year inside an audience-less Royal Albert Hall The BBC's chief political correspondent Vicki Young said the government would not interfere with the broadcasters over the issue. But, she went on to explain, a Downing Street spokesman noted Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously set out his position on similar issues, saying ""he understands the strong emotions but thinks we must tackle the substance not the symbols"".

Several other politicians and commentators have voiced their disapproval of the proposal on social media. ""Seriously? Has the Beeb totally lost touch?""asked Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom,external. Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan, meanwhile, said the proposal to bin the songs was ""ridiculous"". Rule, Britannia! was set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740, and its lyrics were based on a poem by James Thomson. It contains verses such as: ""The nations, not so blest as thee / Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall. ""While thou shalt flourish great and free / The dread and envy of them all. ""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves / Britons never will be slaves."" Soprano Golda Schultz performed with cellists at the BBC Proms in 2016 Last year, pop singer Lily Allen criticised its continued usage. ""Sorry what? Britannia rule the wavesâ¦ I think we should not [sing] this song anymore,"" she wrote online. Land of Hope and Glory is another patriotic song, composed by Edward Elgar and with lyrics by A. C Benson in 1901. It makes similar reference to the ""might"" of the former British Empire, which some people today find problematic. Chi-chi Nwanoku runs the Chineke! Foundation, which aims to provide opportunities for black, Asian and ethnically diverse classical musicians in the UK and Europe. She told BBC News she would be ""elated"" to see the back of the songs. ""We find it offensive,"" she said. ""Of course I know other people are going to want to cling to it, but I know why they want to cling to it.

""If the BBC can't or won't cut Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory, this year of all years - with the Black Lives Matter movement at the forefront of everyone's mind - it shows a lack of courage and a lack of understanding and a complete and utter belief of their own superiority of the British."" On the other side of the argument, music writer and commentator Norman Lebrecht told Radio 4's Today programme he was ""thrilled that there's a row"" as it had got people talking about the Proms again. He says the songs in question bring the country together, rather than tear it apart. ""Rule, Britannia! is very much a part of the Proms, it's a tradition that goes back at least seven decades, and it's a unifying force for the nation,"" he said. ""The Proms is the only time the BBC ever shows classical music on a live channel, the only time the nation unifies around it, and it's a prelude to what follows.

Lebrecht went on to say he feels the whole row boils down to the use of the word ""slaves"" in the lyrics, which he said is ""beyond absurd"". ""For heaven's sake, when the French President comes here we play La Marseillaise, which says, 'Let all alien blood be expunged from the soul',"" he said.

"Tesco's 16,000 jobs drive to reward lockdown tempsThe supermarket will bolster its online business with permanent hires following ""exceptional growth"".BusinessComments","Tesco will create 16,000 new permanent jobs after lockdown led to ""exceptional growth"" in its online business. The new posts will include 10,000 staff to pick customer orders from shelves and 3,000 delivery drivers. The recruitment drive reflects the shift to online shopping, which was accelerated by lockdown. Tesco said it expected many of the roles to go to staff who joined them on a temporary basis at the start of the pandemic. Supermarkets scrambled to meet a surge in demand for online deliveries while the UK was in lockdown. Tesco said online customer numbers had risen from around 600,000 at the start of the pandemic, to nearly 1.5 million. How can I find a new job? 'Three quarters of UK does grocery shopping online' Ocado says switch to online shopping is permanent Before the pandemic, around 9% of Tesco's sales were online. Now, online sales amount to 16% of sales, and are expected to be worth over Â£5.5bn this year, the company said. Online grocery orders now make up 16% of Tesco's sales ""The crisis has seen a dramatic increase in the size of the online grocery market in the UK,"" said Clive Black, retail analyst at Shore Capital. ""It does not look like, and Tesco UK does not seem to think, it is going to revert back to the pre-coronavirus levels."" Tesco UK & Ireland's chief executive Jason Tarry said: ""These new roles will help us continue to meet online demand for the long term."" Tesco's announcement may sound like welcome relief from the somewhat ominous drip-drip of job cut announcements from retailers, but its real significance is to underline the shift in shopping habits from bricks-and-mortar retailing to online. That shift benefits those with a big online presence, at the cost of the old-fashioned shops that don't. It was already underway before the coronavirus crisis, threatening the viability of small independent retailers and defacing High Streets with boarded up shopfronts and 'To Let' signs. With lockdown, the shift accelerated dramatically, as even the remaining users of the High Street were forced to go online. At first, online retailers like Tesco hedged their bets to meet the surge in demand for online delivery, hiring thousands of workers on temporary contracts. However, now they're offering them permanent jobs it's clear that Tesco's executives believe much of the shift to online during the pandemic will be permanent. Growth in the online grocery market will have made the sector more profitable, points out Mr Black. ""As the market expands, economies of scale start to come into play,"" he said. There is no need to offer money-off coupons or free delivery to attract new customers in the current climate, he added. Mr Black emphasised that the efficiency of deliveries is improved because drivers can serve customers who are closer together, and supermarkets can make better use of systems, staff and equipment: ""You put all those things together and the industry goes from marginally loss-making to marginally profitable."" Tesco has already created 4,000 new permanent roles since March. The new roles are permanent and a mixture of full and part-time. The big supermarkets have added jobs in their warehouses during the pandemic The expansion is in contrast to other parts of the retail sector, where High Street companies have been forced to make steep job cuts following lockdown. Most recently, Marks & Spencer said it would axe 7,000 jobs over three months, while Debenhams said it plans to cut a further 2,500 roles. Even across the grocery sector the impact of lockdown has varied - discount chains, such as Aldi and Lidl, which were putting pressure on the bigger chains through lower prices, don't offer online services. ""The players that already had an established foothold, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, all reported incredibly high growth over last months,"" said Thomas Brereton retail analyst for Globaldata. ""They had vast hiring drives in April. So they could send them into stores and out as delivery drivers."" While Amazon has been trying to expand its fresh food delivery, it hadn't scaled up its services enough before the pandemic hit to make the most of increased demand, Mr Brereton added, and Ocado was limited by the capacity of its large automated warehouses. ""For Tesco as they rely on store picking rather than automated I think this is something they will keep for the foreseeable future.""

Man who believed virus was hoax loses wife to Covid-19A couple from Florida did not follow health guidelines after believing lies about the virus online.US & Canada,"Brian with his wife Erin, who passed away this month A Florida taxi driver, who believed false claims that coronavirus was a hoax, has lost his wife to Covid-19. Brian Lee Hitchens and his wife, Erin, had read claims online that the virus was fabricated, linked to 5G or similar to the flu. The couple didn't follow health guidance or seek help when they fell ill in early May. Brian recovered but his 46-year-old wife became critically ill and died this month from heart problems linked to the virus. Brian spoke to the BBC in July as part of aninvestigation into the human cost of coronavirus misinformation. At the time, his wife was on a ventilator in hospital. Erin, a pastor in Florida, had existing health problems - she suffered from asthma and a sleeping disorder. Her husband explained that the couple did not follow health guidance at the start of the pandemic because of the false claims they had seen online. Brian continued to work as a taxi driver and to collect his wife's medicine without observing social distancing rules or wearing a mask. They had also failed to seek help as soon as possible when they fell ill in May and were both subsequently diagnosed with Covid-19. Brian and Erin both came across conspiracy theories on Facebook Brian told BBC News that he ""wished [he'd] listened from the beginning"" and hoped his wife would forgive him. ""This is a real virus that affects people differently. I can't change the past. I can only live in today and make better choices for the future,"" Brian explained. ""She's no longer suffering, but in peace. I go through times missing her, but I know she's in a better place."" Brian said he and his wife didn't have one firm belief about Covid-19. Instead, they switched between thinking the virus was a hoax, linked to 5G technology, or a real, but mild ailment. They came across these theories on Facebook. ""We thought the government was using it to distract us,"" Brian explained, ""or it was to do with 5G."" But after the couple fell ill with the virus in May, Brian took to Facebook in a viral post to explain that he'd been misled by what he'd seen online about the virus. ""If you have to go out please use wisdom and don't be foolish like I was so the same thing won't happen to you like it happened to me and my wife,"" he wrote. Allow Facebook content?

In May, a BBC team tracking coronavirus misinformation found links to assaults, arson and deaths. Doctors and experts have warned that the potential for indirect harm caused by rumours, conspiracy theories and bad health information online remains huge - especially as anti-vaccination conspiracies are being spread on social media. While social media companies have made attempts to tackle misinformation about coronavirus on their platforms, critics argue that more needs to be done in the coming months. A Facebook spokesperson told the BBC: ""We don't allow harmful misinformation on our platforms and between April and June we removed more than seven million pieces of harmful Covid-19 misinformation, including claims relating to false cures or suggestions that social distancing is ineffective.""

Heads want to know if masks allowed in England's schools,"Pupils in Germany wearing face masks. But heads want clarification on wearing them in schools in England Head teachers have complained about a lack of clarity over the rules on whether teachers or pupils can wear face masks in schools in England. They want to know if they can override the official guidance which rejects the use of face coverings in school. ""The guidance is silent on what schools should do if staff or pupils want to wear face coverings,"" says Geoff Barton of the ASCL head teachers' union. A Downing Street spokesman ruled out any review on masks in school. InScotland's secondary schools, face coverings will be used in corridors and shared areas. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Monday she was acting in response to new guidance from the World Health Organization. But Mr Barton said it remained unclear whether schools in England could have flexibility to allow masks if they were requested as a safety measure by teachers or pupils' parents or where they might be seen as a ""useful additional measure"". A teacher in Northern Ireland wearing a visor as pupils return to school It comes as head teachers in England have written a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson,seen by the Guardian,,externalaccusing the government of failing to listen during the coronavirus crisis. The Worth Less? lobbying group, which says it represents thousands of head teachers, wrote that they felt they were ""working in isolation"" from the government as they faced ""some of the most important challenges of our professional lives"". ""Collaboration, consultation and partnership have felt in short supply and this caused immense frustration as time, energy and resources have been wasted by head teachers as we respond to shifting policy directives and myriad changes,"" it said. Face masks for corridors in Scotland's secondary schools PM says 'vitally important' pupils back in school Medical adviser calls for return to school Jon Richards of Unison, representing support staff in schools, said masks were worn in other workplaces and it was ""vital"" that school staff should be allowed to wear them. Medical advisers at the weekend also highlightedthe risk of teachers spreading the virus to each other- rather than from pupil to pupil. The government's guidance, issued in early July, says Public Health Englanddoes not recommend using face coverings,externalin school. Schools are getting ready for reopening in September As pupils would be in their own separate ""bubbles"" there is no need for masks, says the guidance, which warned that ""misuse"" of face coverings could ""inadvertently increase the risk of transmission"". On Monday, a Downing Street spokesman said masks could get in the way of communication between teachers and pupils. Since the government guidance was published on returning safely to school on 2 July, the use of masks has become more widespread, for example, becoming compulsory in shops. ASCL said they had asked for further guidance on wearing masks more than a month ago. ""It would be helpful if the government could provide more advice on these complex issues but that has not been forthcoming,"" said Mr Barton. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We have consistently followed Public Health England advice, which does not recommend the use of face coverings in schools because there are a range of protective measures in place, including children staying in consistent groups. ""We have set out the system of controls schools should use, including cleaning and hygiene measures, to substantially reduce the risk of transmission of the virus when they open to all children in the coming weeks.""

"'Creepy men' message women on Scrabble Go appMen, believed to be romance scammers, are approaching women via the chat function of the game.","Players on Scrabble go can chat with anyone they are playing a game against A number of women who play online Scrabble on the Scopely app Scrabble Go say they are being messaged by ""creepy men"" within the game's chat function. They begin a game and then start asking where the women live and whether they are married and want to continue chatting via other messaging apps such as WhatsApp. It is likely many of them are romance scammers. Scopely said the chat function could be restricted to friends only. One woman, who is in her 60s and lives in London, told BBC News she was contacted via private message by two or three people per week, all claiming to be men from the US. She did not wish to be named. ""It's almost like a script,"" she said. ""They start with, 'How you doing?' They match you to start a game, then start messaging. ""They play very badly, so you win the game. And then they big you up. ""Regularly, they say, 'I just want to check, can't we be friends?' ""When you say, 'No,' some of them disappear, they resign from the game. ""If you don't reply at all, most of them resign from the game."" She believes many of them are scammers. English did not appear to be their first language, she said. One man confessed to using his son's photograph as a profile picture, because he thought his son was ""more attractive"". ""This is not a dating site,"" she said. Scopely said it ""does not tolerate any harassment or misconduct"" on its games platforms and players should report incidents to it. ""In Scrabble Go, players are able to access mute and block functions within the chat feature, as well as the 'mute public chat' privacy setting,"" a spokeswoman said. ""When enabled, players will only receive chat notifications and messages from players they already know and are connected with as a Facebook friend, favourite, or via their synced contacts."" Scrabble Go became the official Scrabble app in June 2020 Scrabble Go launched in March 2020. And it became the official Scrabble app in June, when the Mattel franchise ended with games giant EA. It says it has 2.5 million daily players. But a petition calling for the return of the EA app has now had nearly 8,500 signatures. And Scopely introduced a ""classic"", stripped-down version of the game aftercomplaints about additional features such as treasure-style rewards and vivid colours. One woman who signed the petition three days ago, wrote: ""I do not like being targeted by creepy men who want to chat not play Scrabble."" Australia's Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) told Gizmodoit had received two reports of romance scams on Scrabble Go in its first three months,externalbut it had also received two about the previous EA app during the first half of 2020. On the website sixtyandme, Pat Skenedescribed similar experiences on the unofficial Scrabble-like app Words With Friends.,external ""Suddenly, I'm inundated with guys wanting to hook up because they have fallen madly in love with me at first sight,"" she wrote in a blog last year. It's a problem that is common across many social-media platforms. And it's difficult to police, especially as it takes place in the form of private messages. Lisa Forte, from Red Goat Cyber-security, said: ""As individuals, we really need to start treating unsolicited online contact with people we don't know as suspicious until it's proven otherwise.""

Hong Kong reports 'first case' of virus reinfectionExperts say no conclusions on immunity can be drawn from one patient - and larger studies are needed.,"Hong Kong scientists are reporting the case of a healthy man in his 30s who became reinfected with coronavirus four and a half months after his first bout. They say genome sequencing shows the two strains of the virus are ""clearly different"", making it the world's first proven case of reinfection. The World Health Organization warns it is important not to jump to conclusions based on the case of one patient. And experts say reinfections may be rare and not necessarily serious. There have been more than 23 million cases of coronavirus infection around the world. Coronavirus immunity: Can you catch it twice? More could have Covid immunity than tests suggest Can you become immune to coronavirus? Those infected develop an immune response as their bodies fight off the virus which helps to protect them against it returning. The strongest immune response has been found in the most seriously ill patients. But it is still not clear how strong this protection or immunity is - or how long it lasts. And the World Health Organization said larger studies over time of people who had previously had coronavirus were needed to find out more. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? YOUR QUESTIONS:Our experts have answers LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters This report, by the University of Hong Kong,external, due to be published in Clinical Infectious Diseases, says the man spent 14 days in hospital before recovering from the virus but then, despite having no further symptoms, tested positive for the virus a second time, following a saliva test during airport screening. ""This is a very rare example of reinfection,"" said Brendan Wren, professor of microbial pathogenesis, at London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. ""And it should not negate the global drive to develop Covid-19 vaccines. ""It is to be expected that the virus will naturally mutate over time."" Dr Jeffrey Barrett, senior scientific consultant for the Covid-19 genome project at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, said: ""Given the number of global infections to date, seeing one case of reinfection is not that surprising even if it is a very rare occurrence. ""It may be that second infections, when they do occur, are not serious - though we don't know whether this person was infectious during their second episode."" Prof Paul Hunter, from the University of East Anglia, said more information about this and other cases of reinfection was needed ""before we can really understand the implications"".

Christchurch gunman 'planned third mosque attack'A sentencing hearing begins for the man behind the worst mass shooting in modern New Zealand's history.Asia,"This video can not be played Maysoon Salama, whose son died in the attack, said Tarrant ""terrorised the whole of New Zealand and saddened the world"" The man who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in 2019 had plans to target a third mosque, his sentencing hearing has heard. Brenton Tarrant also planned to burn down the mosques, wanting to ""inflict as many fatalities as possible"". The Australian has pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 attempted murders and one charge of terrorism. Tarrant, 29, faces life in prison, possibly without parole - a sentence never before imposed in New Zealand. He was confronted by survivors and relatives of the victims in court on Monday. ""You gave yourself the authority to take the souls of 51 innocent people, their only crime - in your eyes - being Muslims,"" said Maysoon Salama, whose son Atta Elayyan was killed. ""You transgress beyond comprehension, I cannot forgive you."" Survivors and relatives of victims are attending the court hearing The attacks, parts of which the gunman streamed live online, saw him open fire at two mosques in Christchurch on 15 March last year. He first drove to the Al Noor mosque, firing on people taking part in Friday prayers. He then drove about 5km (3 miles) to the Linwood mosque and killed more people. The attack sent shockwaves around the world and prompted New Zealand to make swift changes to its gun laws. The sentencing hearing, which will last four days, began on Monday morning in Christchurch. Covid-19 restrictions mean the main court room is relatively empty. Hundreds will watch the proceedings on video feeds from other courtrooms in the city to allow for social distancing measures. Dressed in grey prison clothes and surrounded in the dock by three police officers, the gunman reportedly remained silent, occasionally looking around the room where survivors and relatives of the victims were sitting. Tarrant was surrounded by police officers as he sat in the dock Crown prosecutor Barnaby Hawes told the court that the gunman had began formulating a plan years earlier, and his goal was to ""inflict as many fatalities as possible"". He gathered information about mosques in New Zealand - studying floor plans, locations and further details - with the aim of targeting them at the time they would be busiest. In the months before the attack, he travelled to Christchurch and flew a drone over his primary target, the Al Noor mosque. He also planned to target the Ashburton Mosque in addition to the Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre, but was detained while on his way to the third mosque. On the day of the attack, he shot people on the street as they tried to escape the Al Noor mosque, the court heard. This included one victim, Ansi Alibava, whose body he drove over as he left the mosque. As he drove towards the Linwood Islamic Centre, he stopped and shot at men of African origin who were able to escape. He briefly pointed his gun at a Caucasian man, the court heard, but then ""smiled and then drove off"". Who were the victims? How the attacks unfolded He told police after his arrest that his plan was to burn down the mosques after his attack, and that he wished he had done so. Tarrant is representing himself in court. He had previously denied the charges and was due to face trial in June, but reversed his plea. He faces a minimum sentence of 17 years, but Justice Cameron Mander, the High Court judge presiding over the case, has the power to sentence him to a full life term with no parole - a sentence never before imposed in New Zealand. More than 60 people will give victim impact statements over the course of the next few days. People arrive for the sentencing hearing at Christchurch High Court The imam of Al-Noor Mosque, Gamal Fouda - who was the first to speak - addressed Tarrant, calling him ""misguided and misled"". He said he saw the ""hate in the eyes of a brainwashed terrorist"" as he was standing in the pulpit, telling Tarrant: ""Your hatred is unnecessary."" The son of victim Ashraf Ali, said he still suffered trauma, saying: ""I have flashbacks, seeing dead bodies all around me. Blood everywhere."" Among the other victims were: Three-year-old Mucaad Ibrahim, who was shot directly while clinging to his father's leg Abdukadir Elmi, 70, from Somalia who previously survived a civil war Naeem Rashid, originally from Pakistan, who was shot while trying to tackle the gunman Hosne Ara, killed while searching for her husband who uses a wheelchair - he survived. Some relatives of victims travelled from overseas and had undergone a two-week coronavirus quarantine in order to take part. This video can not be played Hamimah Tuyan lost her husband in the attacks Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said it will be a difficult week for survivors and families of the victims. ""I don't think there's anything I can say that is going to ease how traumatic that period is going to be,"" she said last week. She has vowed never to say the gunman's name, saying soon after the attack: ""He sought many things from his act of terror - but one was notoriety."" Less than a month after the shootings, New Zealand's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms.

"Police 'can't win' after breaking up child's partyChief Constable Ian Hopkins says police are trying to be ""proportionate"" when tackling gatherings.Manchester","Chief Constable Ian Hopkins said illegal gatherings were a drain on police resources Police criticised for breaking up a child's 10th birthday party celebration say they ""can't win"" when enforcing enhanced coronavirus restrictions. Greater Manchester Police's Chief Constable revealed the force attended 126 incidents over the weekend. Officers were slammed by some for breaking up the child's party in Manchester and issuing a fine. But Ian Hopkins said it was not a ""jelly and ice cream"" event and saw ""mostly adults celebrating"". Police were ""in a difficult position"" with ""lots of reports"" of lockdown breaches, he said, and were trying to take a ""very balanced and proportionate view"". He continued: ""We can't win. If we don't deal with them, people are saying it isn't fair and when we do deal with it people are saying it is heavy-handed. ""Throughout this pandemic we have issued very few fixed penalty notices. And even this weekend we have only issued 19. ""We don't get to everything. We just have to assess which [gatherings] appear to be the biggest and most problematic."" Lockdown restrictions on social gatherings remainin Greater Manchester following a local spike in cases. As well as illegal gatherings, officers visited 172 licensed premises over the weekend. Greater Manchester is among the areas of northern England still subject to enhanced lockdown restrictions Mr Hopkins said ""pretty much all"" bars were showing ""really good measures to keep people safe"" but that was not the case with house parties. ""It isn't safe. Social distancing is not taking place and that will lead to the virus spreading,"" he said. He said the force had received help this weekend from police forces in Durham, Humberside, North Yorkshire, Cheshire and North Wales. He said it meant an extra Â£100,000 a week had to found to cover the costs. The child's 10th birthday party in Swinton was being attended by three families in a private garden after 20:00 BST on Friday. Mr Hopkins said the force was not ""making an example of them"" but defended the fine issued to the homeowner, adding: ""Those people knew they were breaching the regulations"". The party's host declined to comment when approached by the BBC. Officers were also called to what turned out to be a party for a terminally ill child.

"Ballet school closes after sexual misconduct claimsA liquidator is appointed to wind up Ballet West Ltd, which will mean the closure of the prestigious school in Argyll.Glasgow & West Scotland","Ballet West is a boarding school based in Argyll A prestigious dance school based in the Highlands has closed after allegations of sexual misconduct. Ballet West, a boarding school located in Taynuilt, Argyll, has ceased operations with immediate effect. Trustees of the ballet school announced on Monday that a provisional liquidator had been appointed. It followed the withdrawal of accreditation of the school's courses from a series of colleges and universities. Earlier this monthan ITV investigation alleged that the school's vice principal,external, Jonathan Barton, had been involved in inappropriate sexual behaviour. Mr Barton resigned from his position at the school but denied any wrongdoing. Police Scotland said it had been made aware of concerns regarding inappropriate behaviour but that no criminality had yet been established. 'Inappropriate sexual behaviour' probed at Argyll dance school Argyll dance school suspends senior staff member Ballet West was established in 1991 and trained dancers to undergraduate level. It also offered courses for dance teachers and operated associate and outreach programmes for young dancers. In 2018 it launched its own professional touring company, employing former students for performances across the world. It was named ""Best British Ballet School"" for 2019/20 at the British Ballet Grand Prix, an an international ballet competition for elite level dancers. On Monday, trustees of Ballet West issued a statement which said: ""The trustees must today report the saddest news. The Sheriff at Oban Sheriff Court has approved the appointment of a provisional liquidator to Ballet West Ltd. ""A process has now begun to wind up Ballet West Ltd, which will mean the closure of the school. ""Due to events over the last two weeks, Ballet West Ltd.  a registered Scottish charity, has been driven to the point of insolvency and the trustees had a legal duty to inform the charity regulator and take appropriate action in these circumstances. The board was required to make an application for a liquidator to be appointed."" Ballet West was regarded as one of the UK's leading dance schools The company's affairs will now be managed by liquidator Eileen Blackburn of French Duncan LLP. The trustees said that Ms Blackburn would assist Police Scotland and any other regulatory bodies. They said: ""The board of trustees is deeply saddened by this outcome and appalled that parent and students have been placed in such a terrible situation.  This is the consequence of a catastrophic sequence of events and we could not prevent this from happening. ""The allegations broadcast by ITV News regarding the Vice-Principal on Thursday 13 August were shocking. Immediate action was required in response and he resigned. The board launched an internal inquiry, committed to an external inquiry and informed Police Scotland. We hoped the Board's prompt action would allay fears in terms of student safety going forward."" However, Bath Spa University terminated its relationship with Ballet West on 14 August, which accounted for 70% of the school's student intake. The Royal Academy of Dance withdrew its accreditation and then the Scottish Qualifications Authority (SQA) cancelled the HNC/HND courses at the school. After the allegations were made, Ballet West arranged for a senior legal figure with no connection to the school to carry out a full independent inquiry, but that will no longer go ahead. The trustees said that funding was not available for it to proceed and that it was a matter of ""deep regret"". The statement ended by urging students to report concerns. It said any student who felt the school had failed them, should report their experience to Police Scotland or any relevant body. The school provided students with a list of other dance course providers and said it hoped that ""those who see their future in ballet and the performing arts can find a route to realise their hopes and ambitions"".

Scotland's high schools set to introduce face coverings,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Face coverings may be introduced in Scottish high schools The use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas of secondary schools is set to be introduced in Scotland. The government is in the ""final stages"" of consultations with teachers and councils about having pupils wear face coverings while moving between classes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was acting in response to new guidance from the World Health Organization. Ministers are also considering whether to make masks mandatory on school transport - but not inside classrooms. The use of face coverings in schools is currently voluntary, although some schools have started advising staff and pupils to wear them to help combat the spread of Covid-19. Advice 'may change' on face coverings in schools More schools ask pupils to wear face coverings Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. However, over the weekend the World Health Organization (WHO) issued fresh guidance sayingchildren over the age of 12 should wear masks. At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said Education Secretary John Swinney was ""in the final stages of consulting teachers and local authorities on a recommendation for the use of face coverings by staff and pupils in secondary schools when moving around corridors and communal areas"". She said there was more mixing between different groups of children in these areas, and that there was less scope for effective ventilation. People are also thought to be more likely to raise their voices in crowded places, increasing the risk of aerosol transmission of the virus. Pupils may have to wear masks indoors as they move between classes, like these Dutch teenagers Ms Sturgeon said the government's scientific advisers were also considering whether face coverings should be made mandatory on school transport. However, she said they were ""not currently consulting on any proposal"" to have pupils wear masks in class, saying: ""There is greater scope for physical distancing in classrooms and face coverings are more likely to interfere with teaching and learning."" She added: ""The best way to ensure schools can stay open safely is for all of us to play our part in keeping transmission rates in the community as low as possible."" Some schoolsin Edinburgh, Inverness and Grantown on Speyhave written to parents recommending pupils wear masksdue to concerns about overcrowding as they move between lessons. The first minister said she expected the Scotland-wide move would be confirmed ""over the next couple of days"", and would constitute a change to guidance which schools would be expected to follow. She said: ""We are not talking about a mandatory system in the sense of there being penalties and enforcement in schools. I get the sense that schools - while I accept there will be a mixture of opinion around it - are themselves looking to follow this kind of approach. ""We will set out the detail when we get to the point of finalising the recommendation."" Under the existing guidance no-one is required to wear face coverings in school, apart from staff who have close personal contact with a pupil for an extended period of time. However, anyone who wants to wear one is allowed to do so. A recent survey of nearly 30,000 teachers by the EIS teaching union found 41% supported the mandatory wearing of face coverings by senior pupils in classrooms. However, one parents group - Us For Them Scotland - claimed making masks mandatory ""could have an extremely negative impact on pupils with autism, hearing impairments and conditions such as asthma"". Health authorities are working to tackle a number of coronavirus ""clusters"" in Scotland, including one centred on the Kingspark School in Dundee. A total of 17 members of staff have tested positive, as well as two pupils,and all households connected to the school have been told to go into self-isolation for two weeks. A growing number of school pupils across Scotland have tested positive for Covid-19, but the government believes the infection has been transmitted in other settings such as house parties. Ms Sturgeon said ""most"" transmission of the virus was not happening in schools, saying that ""the risk is greater of community transmission getting into schools"". She said the current consultation was only on a ""limited"" use of face coverings in schools, because of ""the relatively low levels of transmission we are currently seeing in the community"". However she added that ""where there are outbreaks there is an option for incident management teams to recommend more extensive use of face coverings for a period to protect public health"".

Does my child have to go back?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

More schools ask pupils to wear face coverings,"For most schools in Scotland the wearing of face coverings is currently voluntary More schools are advising pupils and staff to wear face coverings to help combat coronavirus. Grantown Grammar School in Grantown on Spey and Millburn Academy in Inverness have both said masks need to be worn between classes. Children across Scotland are not currently required to wear masks in either primary or high schools. But Nicola Sturgeon has said this advice couldchange for secondary school students in the ""near future"". The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued fresh guidance sayingchildren over the age of 12 should wear masksand the EIS trade union posted a message on Twitter that it will ""will press [the] Scottish Government further on face covering protocols in light of WHO advice"". In a letter to parents, Grantown Grammar School explained the changes are being introduced because ""corridors are becoming crowded between lessons and at break and lunchtime, even with the one way system"". Millburn Academy in Inverness has asked pupils to wear face coverings Similar concerns about overcrowding as pupils move between lessons sparked theintroduction of face coverings at James Gillespie's High Schoolin Edinburgh. The letter to parents at Millburn Academy in Inverness also asks for face coverings to be worn on school buses. Education campaign group Us for Them Scotland, which says it has 9,500 members, claimed any move to make coverings mandatory for children would cause more harm than good. Organiser Jo Bisset, said: ""Everyone appreciates the health and safety of pupils and teachers has to be a priority. ""But forcing children to wear masks when there's little, if any, scientific evidence to support such a move could be hugely damaging. ""It could have an extremely negative impact on pupils with autism, hearing impairments and conditions such as asthma."" The Scottish government has said there is currently no evidence that coronavirus among young people is being transmitted in schools. Agrowing number of school pupils have tested positive for Covid-19, but the government believes the infection has been transmitted in other settings, such as house parties or other indoor gatherings. A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ""There is currently no widespread transmission of the virus in Highland. ""However, there may be circumstances in some secondary schools, where physical distancing during movement between classes is more difficult due to the school layout, or there may be medical conditions which are assessed as an increased risk. ""We are currently updating our guidance to head teachers to provide clarity on this matter and we will enable people to wear face coverings where they wish to do so."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

Return to school - how was it?,"Millions of pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland are returning to school within the coming weeks, after months of disrupted education as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Parents and teachers where schools have already reopened tells us what they've learned from their children returning to the classroom. This video can not be played ""Homework is all digital now"": Mother-of-three Colette Reilly from Paisley describes what has changed Masks are a big talking point in Scotland. Colette Reillysays since her daughters, aged 12 and 14, returned to the classroom, a teacher has told them the current lack of rules about wearing masks is ""likely to change"" at the school in Paisley. It comes after criticism from some pupils saying""it's not possible to social distance"" inside schools. One high school in Edinburgh has already chosen to tell pupils and staff to wear face coveringswhile moving around between lessons. ""I've not got an issue with [my children wearing masks],"" Colette tells Radio 5 Live. ""Even if it's [for a] year, in terms of a life span, it's a very short-term issue. At the end of the day, this isn't about individual families, this is about the collective. We all need to look after each other."" She says the ""significant changes"" her daughters have noticed about the return to school life include using hand sanitiser at stations throughout school, social distancing from other students inside classrooms, and being given digital-only homework. This video can not be played Scottish teacher and NASUWT member Mike Corbett: ""It's not the same, but it's better for the kids to be back in"" Mike Corbettwas happy to return to face-to-face teaching at his secondary school in East Dunbartonshire earlier this month. ""Just that buzz of classroom discussion that you get - that's completely impossible online - is a delight to have and one of the best things that we like about teaching,"" the English teacher tells Radio 5 Live. Mike, who is national executive member for the NASUWT Scotland teaching union, thinks the pupils are ""very happy to be back"" too - but there's plenty of pandemic protocols for them to get used to such as regularly using hand sanitiser, not doing group work, and wiping down their desks before leaving the room. Pupils to wear face coverings at Edinburgh school Where have school pupils tested positive for Covid-19? Could reopening schools spread coronavirus? Mike also has things to adapt to. He's frustrated by a line marking out two metres to keep him a safe distance from pupils, because it means he cannot approach individuals who are struggling with understanding his lesson. But it's ""just as well"" the line is there, Mike says. On Thursday, his entire classroom had to be evacuated and cleaned as a result of a pupil displaying coronavirus symptoms. ""The only reason I was able to sleep soundly on Thursday night was because I did not cross that two-metre line,"" he says. Despite comments from the UK's chief medical adviser,Prof Chris Whitty, attempting to reassure parents, pupils and teachersthat schools are safe, Mike says ""staff out there are very anxious still about the situation"". He said the recentincrease in cases in Scotlandmeans the virus will ""inevitably"" get into the classroom - ""and then the fear is that there's a spread in schools"". Gemma Frasersaid when her eight-year-old daughter Poppy returned to primary school in Edinburgh, the children abided by the rules - and it was the parents who had to be reminded about social distancing. ""The major change is they have to stagger the start times - so my daughter's group is the first in, at 8.40am, and the first to leave,"" said Gemma. ""The idea is that there aren't as many parents in at the same time. But it's actually been the parents who've been struggling with socially distancing the most - we've had several emails from the school reminding us to stand 2m apart. It feels like being back at school yourself."" She said the playground has been segregated for dropping off and pick-up times so parents don't congregate. There are also separate entrance and exit points. ""We've missed seeing each other as well,"" she added. ""So it's only natural we want to catch up - but we have to behave ourselves."" As for Poppy, she said she bounded out of bed on her first day back - on 13 August - and has quickly adapted to changes. ""They've not found it a problem at all,"" said her mother. ""As far as they're concerned, everything is as normal as can be. They've got used to washing their hands, and sanitising them. Children adapt really quickly. ""They can't have hot lunches now and we have to send a packed lunch in, for them to have in their classroom. So that's a key difference - they also only have 15 minutes to eat it."" There's no social distancing between children in the classroom - but when Poppy's teacher has to get closer to any pupil, she puts a mask on. There is also a line by her desk that children are not meant to cross. ""The school is doing their best,"" said Gemma. ""It's a big school so they've had a mammoth task to organise it. We've been really happy with how they've kept parents informed. ""It's not the same as it was - but it's a lot better than we thought it might be."" Liz Silverman helps to collect her grandchildren Jack, nine, and Betsy, five, from school Liz Silvermanwants face coverings to be made mandatory within the grounds of her grandchildren's primary schools. ""At collection time all the mums, dads and grandparents have to wait outside the classroom as the teacher will not release a child until they see the parent or grandparent. Social distancing is not possible,"" she says. Liz, 69, says her daughter and daughter-in-law are both teachers, so would not be able to return to work without her help picking up her four grandchildren from their two separate primary schools, two days a week. ""I don't feel safe... I would like to say 'no' but I can't let them down,"" Liz says. Liz from Northwood, London, believes making adults wear masks when dropping off or picking up schoolchildren is a ""simple thing"" to solve a surge in cases and assuage her worries about the safety of her husband, who has been shielding. ""If I bring anything home to him, it could be devastating."" Alex Nunnlives in Berlin, where her 15-year-old step-children have been back to school for two weeks. ""There was no extra spacing or anything like that going on in the school,"" she says, but that's because teachers and pupils there must wear masks everywhere around the school, apart from once they're seated at their desks. ""As soon as they get up to move around the school, go to the loo, go in the playground, they're wearing masks the whole time,"" she says. SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when? BUBBLES:How do they work and who can be in yours? SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Alex, 50, tells Radio 5 Live she struggles to understand why some people in the UK see wearing a mask as ""such a big problem"", and hopes some anxious parents will learn lessons from her sister, who she has been visiting in London. ""My five-year-old nephew is wearing one here when he's going on public transport. Somehow my sister's managed to make it a bit of an adventure, and fun, and he understands why he's wearing it - and I simply don't get why it's being perceived as being a big deal to wear a mask here,"" she says. The World Health Organization has said children aged 12 and overshould wear masks in line with national recommendations, citing evidence suggesting teenagers can infect others in the same way as adults.

Dundee school Covid cluster rises to 22,"Many of the youngsters at Kingspark have additional physical disabilities or medical problems A total of 27 coronavirus cases, most of them adult staff, have now been linked to a school in Dundee. Kingspark School was closed last Wednesday as pupils and staff were asked to self-isolate for 14 days. NHS Tayside said in an update on Monday that 21 staff, two pupils and four community contacts had tested positive. Two other school sites in Dundee have also been identified as result of contact tracing connected to the Kingspark outbreak. A primary two class at St Peter and Paul's School has been asked to self-isolate until 2 September after an individual tested positive. Children who attended the Happy Times out-of-school club at Downfield Primary School are also being asked to self-isolate until the same date following a positive test result. Coronavirus cases in Scotland up by 83 Dundee school closed after adults test positive Where have school pupils tested positive for Covid-19? Elsewhere,two classes at High Blantyre Primary School in South Lanarkshire are self-isolatingafter two pupils and a staff member tested positive. NHS Lanarkshire said there was no evidence to suggest transmission within the school and the school will remain open. Kingspark School in Dundee, which has about 185 pupils aged between five and 18 who have additional support needs, was closed on Wednesday evening to allow deep cleaning to be carried out. The decision was taken to shut it for two weeks because of the complex health conditions of the pupils. Pupils and anyone who lives with them who cannot maintain physical distancing have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days. Dr Daniel Chandler, of NHS Tayside, said: ""Due to the high level of tests undertaken among staff who work at the school, we may see a small rise in the number of positive cases as these results come through. ""The actions and measures that have been put in place will help to prevent any further spread of infection and we hope to see the numbers of positive cases tail off over the coming days."" Paul Clancy, executive director of Dundee City Council's Children and Families Services, said: ""I would like to reassure families that this action is being taken to keep everyone safe. This is our paramount concern and we cannot be complacent."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where?Dundee school Covid cluster rises to 27 RULES:What's still closed in Scotland and why?

High schools set to introduce face coveringsMinisters are consulting on the use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas in Scotland's secondaries.Scotland,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Face coverings may be introduced in Scottish high schools The use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas of secondary schools is set to be introduced in Scotland. The government is in the ""final stages"" of consultations with teachers and councils about having pupils wear face coverings while moving between classes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was acting in response to new guidance from the World Health Organization. Ministers are also considering whether to make masks mandatory on school transport - but not inside classrooms. The use of face coverings in schools is currently voluntary, although some schools have started advising staff and pupils to wear them to help combat the spread of Covid-19. Advice 'may change' on face coverings in schools More schools ask pupils to wear face coverings Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. However, over the weekend the World Health Organization (WHO) issued fresh guidance sayingchildren over the age of 12 should wear masks. At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said Education Secretary John Swinney was ""in the final stages of consulting teachers and local authorities on a recommendation for the use of face coverings by staff and pupils in secondary schools when moving around corridors and communal areas"". She said there was more mixing between different groups of children in these areas, and that there was less scope for effective ventilation. People are also thought to be more likely to raise their voices in crowded places, increasing the risk of aerosol transmission of the virus. Pupils may have to wear masks indoors as they move between classes, like these Dutch teenagers Ms Sturgeon said the government's scientific advisers were also considering whether face coverings should be made mandatory on school transport. However, she said they were ""not currently consulting on any proposal"" to have pupils wear masks in class, saying: ""There is greater scope for physical distancing in classrooms and face coverings are more likely to interfere with teaching and learning."" She added: ""The best way to ensure schools can stay open safely is for all of us to play our part in keeping transmission rates in the community as low as possible."" Some schoolsin Edinburgh, Inverness and Grantown on Speyhave written to parents recommending pupils wear masksdue to concerns about overcrowding as they move between lessons. The first minister said she expected the Scotland-wide move would be confirmed ""over the next couple of days"", and would constitute a change to guidance which schools would be expected to follow. She said: ""We are not talking about a mandatory system in the sense of there being penalties and enforcement in schools. I get the sense that schools - while I accept there will be a mixture of opinion around it - are themselves looking to follow this kind of approach. ""We will set out the detail when we get to the point of finalising the recommendation."" Under the existing guidance no-one is required to wear face coverings in school, apart from staff who have close personal contact with a pupil for an extended period of time. However, anyone who wants to wear one is allowed to do so. A recent survey of nearly 30,000 teachers by the EIS teaching union found 41% supported the mandatory wearing of face coverings by senior pupils in classrooms. However, one parents group - Us For Them Scotland - claimed making masks mandatory ""could have an extremely negative impact on pupils with autism, hearing impairments and conditions such as asthma"". Health authorities are working to tackle a number of coronavirus ""clusters"" in Scotland, including one centred on the Kingspark School in Dundee. A total of 17 members of staff have tested positive, as well as two pupils,and all households connected to the school have been told to go into self-isolation for two weeks. A growing number of school pupils across Scotland have tested positive for Covid-19, but the government believes the infection has been transmitted in other settings such as house parties. Ms Sturgeon said ""most"" transmission of the virus was not happening in schools, saying that ""the risk is greater of community transmission getting into schools"". She said the current consultation was only on a ""limited"" use of face coverings in schools, because of ""the relatively low levels of transmission we are currently seeing in the community"". However she added that ""where there are outbreaks there is an option for incident management teams to recommend more extensive use of face coverings for a period to protect public health"".

"'Vitally important' children return to class - PMBoris Johnson tries to reassure parents that schools are Covid-secure, ahead of term starting.UKComments","Schools in Northern Ireland welcomed some year groups back on Monday It is ""vitally important"" children go back to school, with the life chances of a generation at stake, Boris Johnson has said in a message to parents. As the autumn term began in Northern Ireland, the prime minister said the risk of contracting coronavirus at schools across the UK was ""very small"". He said missing any more school was ""far more damaging"" for children. Meanwhile No 10 said it had ""no plans"" to follow Scotland inreviewing rules on wearing face coverings at school. But the BBC understands the government is considering measures which could see secondary schools operating on a rota in parts of England where there are Covid-19 outbreaks. On face coverings, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said a consultation on their use in corridors and communal areas of secondary schools was in its ""final stages"". It follows guidance from the World Health Organization thatchildren over the age of 12 should wear masks. Since Scottish schools reopened last month, there have been several confirmed cases among pupils and staff, including at Kingspark School in Dundee, where23 people - most of them adult staff - have tested positiveand which has shut for two weeks. Heads in England - where face coverings are not recommended for schools -are calling for more clarityon whether staff or pupils can choose to wear face coverings. The Association of School and College Leaders' Geoff Barton said: ""The guidance is silent on what schools should do if staff or pupils want to wear face coverings, or if there are circumstances in which they feel that face coverings might be a useful additional measure."" This video can not be played Gavin Williamson says the government ""is not in a position where we're suggesting"" face masks in secondary schools. But a Downing Street spokesman said no such review was planned for England's schools, adding: ""We are conscious of the fact that [face masks] would obstruct communication between teachers and pupils."" And Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government was not suggesting secondary pupils or teachers should wear face coverings because there was a  system of controls in place that meant it wasn't necessary. Classroom buzz, sanitiser stations and more masks How many confirmed cases are there in your area? How dangerous is coronavirus for children? But he said there were ""elements of discretion"" in guidance for schools provided by Public Health England. Somepupils in Northern Ireland returned to schoolon Monday, while term starts in England and Wales in September. The government's pondering of measures that could see England's secondary schools operating on a rota system if necessary is part of discussions under way on four different levels of schools operating. They aim to keep primary schools operating as normal wherever possible, with localised restrictions on secondary schools where needed to bring the R number down. Updated guidelines for schools for coping with local outbreaks are expected within weeks. Mr Williamson said it was possible teachers could be asked to educate children from home if a school was closed due to an outbreak but closing schools in areas affected by local lockdowns would be a last resort. The education secretary also said every school would have home testing kits for coronavirus by the time they reopened. Mr Johnson thanked school staff for spending the summer ""making classrooms Covid-secure"". Citingcomments from England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty,the prime minister said ""nothing will have a greater effect on the life chances of our children than returning to school"". In avideo message,external, he added it was the ""best way"" to help children with any mental health problems resulting from or exacerbated by lockdown. Prof Whitty had said children were more likely to be harmed by not returning to school next month than if they caught coronavirus. He said evidence showed they ""much less commonly"" needed hospital treatment or became severely ill with coronavirus than adults. Temperature checks for staff are the new normal for this primary school in Belfast According to the Office for National Statistics' latest data on ages, there were 10 deaths recorded as ""due to Covid-19"" among those aged 19 and under in England and Wales between March and June - and 46,725 deaths among those aged 20 and over. And of the more than one million children who attended pre-school and primary schools in England in June, 70 children and 128 staff caught the virus,according to a Public Health England study published on Sunday.,external It said most of the 30 outbreaks detected in that time had likely been caused by staff members infecting other staff or students, with only two outbreaks thought to have involved students infecting other students. And it suggested children who went to school in June were more likely to catch coronavirus at home than at school. Dr Jenny Harries, England's deputy chief medical officer, told BBC Breakfast the study should ""reassure"" teachers that transmission from students to teachers was rare. But she said the higher risk of staff-to-staff transmission meant teachers should remember to maintain social distancing and good hand hygiene while on coffee breaks,  ""because that does seem to be a risk factor"". Dr Matthew Snape, associate professor in paediatrics at Oxford University, said the risk to children from Covid-19 appeared to be low but the risk was that pupils could pass the virus to each other on the playground or in the classroom and then go home and ""take that infection into their household"". This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? The NEU, the UK's largest teaching union, said schools were being let down by the lack of a ""plan B"" as they prepared to reopen. It said more staff, extra teaching space and greater clarity on what to do if there was a spike in cases were needed for schools to reopen safely. Paul Jackson, head teacher of a primary school in east London, told the BBC it would have been useful to have clearer guidance from the government for school leaders and additional funding to help to pay for extra cleaning and other resources. ""Whether you are a very small school, with maybe just 70 pupils or whether you are a large school like us with 750 pupils, the guidance issued is exactly the same,"" he said. Kay Mountfield, head teacher at Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her school would reopen with safety measures, such as Perspex screens around teachers' desks, and had hired marquees to provide extra classroom space. She urged the government to set up a dedicated helpline for school leaders to advise on keeping sites safe. Gemma Fraser says when eight-year-old daughter Poppy bounded out of bed on her first day back to primary school in Edinburgh, the children abided by the new rules - and it was the parents who had to be reminded about social distancing. ""The major change is they have to stagger the start times - so my daughter's group is the first in, at 8.40am, and the first to leave,"" Gemma says. ""The idea is that there aren't as many parents in at the same time. But it's actually been the parents who've been struggling with socially distancing the most - we've had several emails from the school reminding us to stand 2m apart. It feels like being back at school yourself."" Gemma says the playground has been segregated for dropping off and pick-up times so parents don't congregate. There are also separate entrance and exit points. ""We've missed seeing each other as well,"" she adds. ""So it's only natural we want to catch up - but we have to behave ourselves."" Read more:What can we learn from schools that have reopened? Shadow education secretary Kate Green accused the government of being ""asleep at the wheel"" on the reopening of schools. She said ministers had spent the past two weeks ""totally pre-occupied with their own exams fiasco when they should've been out supporting schools and reassuring parents"". Exams chaos 'must never happen again' Students relieved and annoyed after A-level U-turn Meanwhile in Northern Ireland, many pupils in years seven, 12 and 14 were back at school on Monday for the first time since March. But at least two schools were not opening as planned because of people testing positive for coronavirus. Education Minister Peter Weir said opening schools was probably the ""top priority"" for the executive. But he said that there would be ""undoubtedly bumps along the road"" and staff and pupils will have to adapt to a new way of working. SCHOOLS:Which are re-opening, when?

Mike Ashley buys long-time rival's sports businessThe Sports Direct owner will buy Dave Whelan's gyms and fitness assets after they went bust.Business,"Mike Ashley's Frasers Group owns Sports Direct among other brands Billionaire businessman Mike Ashley has bought the gym and fitness business from his rival and long-time critic Dave Whelan after they fell into administration. Mr Ashley's Frasers Group said it would buy 46 leisure clubs and 31 retail outlets from DW Sports Fitness for Â£37m to merge with its own business. Some 922 jobs out of a total of 1,700 across the business will be saved. DW went bust earlier this month after its income evaporated during lockdown. The firm owns 75 retail stores and 73 gyms in total, all of which had to close temporarily due to coronavirus restrictions. Frasers, which also owns Lillywhites, Evans Cycles and House of Fraser, said the DW assets would ""compliment (sic)"" its own gym and fitness club portfolio, and would now be managed under its Everlast brand. Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was surprising the group had bought a gym business as they were still ""grappling with the public's reluctance to train indoors"". ""It's likely to be some time before people bound back to the gym in greater numbers and it can be ascertained whether this latest acquisition will have been the right choice for the company."" DW also owns the Fitness First gym chain which is unaffected by the administration. Mr Ashley, who has been buying up struggling High Street brands over the last five years, has had a feud with DW Sports' owner, Mr Whelan, dating back two decades. In 2000, Mr Whelan was famously reported to have told his younger rival from the south: ""There is a club in the north, son, and you're not part of it."" Dave Whelan has been in a feud with Mike Ashley dating back two decades Mr Ashley later reported Mr Whelan's JJB Sports business to the Office of Fair Trading, alleging it was involved in a price-fixing scheme over football shirts. The OFT issued multi-million pound fines to those involved, including JJB. Mr Whelan, 83, a former owner of Wigan Athletic football club, created DW Sports in 2009 when he bought 50 JJB Sports fitness clubs and the adjoining shops out of administration. During the year ending 31 March 2019, DW made a loss of just over Â£20m. Frasers itself has been struggling during the pandemic, calling its most recent financial year the ""most challenging"" in its history. In the year to 26 April, its sales climbed slightly, but profits dived by 20% to Â£143.5m due to lockdown store closures. Last week, it said that more of its House of Fraser department stores were ""anticipated"" to close, likely resulting in further job cuts. It has already shut 10 of the 59 stores it bought out of administration in 2018.

"Could the BBC Proms drop Rule, Britannia?Reports suggest the BBC is considering axing certain songs because of associations with colonialism.","Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory could be dropped from the Last Night of the Proms in the wake of the recent Black Lives Matter protests, according to reports. The Sunday Times claims,externalthere are concerns at the BBC about associations with colonialism and slavery. The Last Night of the Proms is due to take place on 12 September, but without an audience, due to coronavirus. A government spokesman said they would leave any such decision up to the BBC. However, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden explained on Monday that he had raised ""concerns"" with the corporation over reports the popular songs could be axed on the night. Proms concerts will change depending on Covid rules The Sunday Times suggested that conductor Dalia Stasevska believes it is time ""to bring change"" to the Royal Albert Hall, in the year that the anti-racism movement gathered pace followingthe death of George Floyd. The 35-year-old Finnish conductor, who will be joined by soprano Golda Schultz and the BBC Symphony Orchestra for this year's classical finale, declined to comment on the reports directly, and BBC Proms refused to confirm or deny the story. ""We are still finalising arrangements for the Last Night of the Proms so that we are able to respond to the latest advice in regards to Covid-19 and deliver the best offering possible for audiences,"" a spokeswoman told BBC News, noting that full details will be announced nearer the time. Dalia Stasevska will conduct The Last Night of the Proms this year inside an audience-less Royal Albert Hall The BBC's chief political correspondent Vicki Young said the government would not interfere with the broadcasters over the issue. But, she went on to explain, a Downing Street spokesman noted Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously set out his position on similar issues, saying ""he understands the strong emotions but thinks we must tackle the substance not the symbols"". Dowden tweeted that the anthems were highlights of the Last Night of the Proms, and that ""confident forward-looking nations don't erase their history, they add to it"". Allow Twitter content?

Several other politicians and commentators have voiced their disapproval of the proposal on social media. ""Seriously? Has the Beeb totally lost touch?""asked Conservative MP Andrea Leadsom,external. Good Morning Britain presenter Piers Morgan, meanwhile, said the proposal to bin the songs was ""ridiculous"". Rule, Britannia! was set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740, and its lyrics were based on a poem by James Thomson. It contains verses such as: ""The nations, not so blest as thee / Must, in their turns, to tyrants fall. ""While thou shalt flourish great and free / The dread and envy of them all. ""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves / Britons never will be slaves."" Soprano Golda Schultz performed with cellists at the BBC Proms in 2016 Last year, pop singer Lily Allen criticised its continued usage. ""Sorry what? Britannia rule the wavesâ¦ I think we should not [sing] this song anymore,"" she wrote online. Land of Hope and Glory is another patriotic song, composed by Edward Elgar and with lyrics by A. C Benson in 1901. It makes similar reference to the ""might"" of the former British Empire, which some people today find problematic. Chi-chi Nwanoku runs the Chineke! Foundation, which aims to provide opportunities for black, Asian and ethnically diverse classical musicians in the UK and Europe. She told BBC News she would be ""elated"" to see the back of the songs. ""We find it offensive,"" she said. ""Of course I know other people are going to want to cling to it, but I know why they want to cling to it. ""These songs are jingoistic echoes of empire and, depending on what side of the fence you're sitting on, you either feel joyous, emboldened and patriotic and immediately identify with all the sentiments of it."" Chi-chi Nwanoku's Chineke! Foundation is about ""championing change and celebrating diversity in classical music"" But, she continued: ""For any conscious black person who is aware of their history, the empire and colonialism, for example, they will struggle to enjoy the patriotic jingoism of these songs."" She particularly draws attention to the themes of superiority, domination and ownership of black people. ""And the thing is, people continue to benefit from the proceeds of that relationship,"" she says. ""How are we going to break down the institutional system, if we hang on to these [songs]?"" Double bassist Nwanoku thinks that it would be particularly galling for Schultz, a black woman, to have to sing such songs. ""If the BBC can't or won't cut Rule, Britannia! and Land of Hope and Glory, this year of all years - with the Black Lives Matter movement at the forefront of everyone's mind - it shows a lack of courage and a lack of understanding and a complete and utter belief of their own superiority of the British."" On the other side of the argument, music writer and commentator Norman Lebrecht told Radio 4's Today programme he was ""thrilled that there's a row"" as it had got people talking about the Proms again. He says the songs in question bring the country together, rather than tear it apart. ""Rule, Britannia! is very much a part of the Proms, it's a tradition that goes back at least seven decades, and it's a unifying force for the nation,"" he said. ""The Proms is the only time the BBC ever shows classical music on a live channel, the only time the nation unifies around it, and it's a prelude to what follows. Norman Lebrecht says Rule, Britannia! is a Proms ""tradition"" ""It's the end of the summer, it's the beginning of what promises to be an extremely bleak winter of recession, it raises people's spirits, it brings us together."" Lebrecht went on to say he feels the whole row boils down to the use of the word ""slaves"" in the lyrics, which he said is ""beyond absurd"". ""For heaven's sake, when the French President comes here we play La Marseillaise, which says, 'Let all alien blood be expunged from the soul',"" he said. ""The day that we replace La Marseillaise with [French nursery rhyme] Frere Jacques when Monsieur Macron comes to Downing Street, we can consider replacing Rule, Britannia!""

Putin critic Navalny 'probably poisoned' - doctorsThe Russian opposition figure is being treated in Berlin after falling ill on a flight on Thursday.Europe,"Mr Navalny is being treated at the Charite hospital in Berlin The Berlin hospital treating the seriously ill Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, says he appears to have been poisoned. The CharitÃ© hospital released a statement saying ""clinical evidence suggests an intoxication through a substance belonging to the group of cholinesterase inhibitors"". But doctors who treated him in Russia say the substance was not present. Mr Navalny fell ill on an internal flight in Russia on Thursday. Video appeared to show Mr Navalny, a dogged critic of the Kremlin, writhing in agony on the flight from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea he drank at the airport in Tomsk. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Mr Navalny's flight made an emergency landing in Omsk where he was first treated. In their latest statement released after that of the German medical team, the Omsk doctors say tests showed no sign of cholinesterase inhibitors in his body. Speaking last week, the same team suggested his illness was caused by a metabolic disorder triggered by low blood sugar. On Friday, they at first said he was too ill to be moved but then allowed him to board a medical evacuation flight, which landed in Berlin on Saturday morning. His condition was ""serious but not life-threatening"" the statement said. ""The exact substance is not yet known,"" the hospital said. ""Widespread analysis has begun. The effect of the poison - i.e. the inhibition of cholinesterase in the organism - has been proven several times and in independent laboratories."" The clinical outcome remained unclear, the statement said, and the medical team warned of possible effects on the nervous system. Navalny's wife Yulia has been at his bedside at the CharitÃ© The opposition leader is in intensive care and is still in an artificial coma. Mr Navalny is being given an antidote, atropine, the same drug used inthe case of ex-KGB agent Sergei Skripalby UK doctors after his poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in 2018. They are a group of chemicals, some of which can be used to treat diseases, such as Alzheimer's. When used in nerve agents and pesticides they can be harmful to humans.

Doctors in Omsk had at first been co-operative in helping to transfer Mr Navalny abroad for treatment, they said, but had then backtracked before he was finally allowed to leave. His wife, Yulia, said she feared the Russian authorities were trying to wait for evidence of any chemical substance to disappear before sending him abroad. But President Vladimir Putin's spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, said on Thursday that the Kremlin would help move Mr Navalny abroad if necessary, describing it as a purely medical decision. Alexander Murakhovsky, the chief doctor at the Omsk hospital said: ""There was no influence on the treatment of the patient a priori and there couldn't have been any."" Mr Navalny, 44, is a prominent critic of Mr Putin and has exposed official corruption in Russia. He has  served multiple jail terms for organising rallies. The NGO which arranged his flight to Berlin, the Cinema for Peace, said Mr Navalny would probably be out of action for one or two months.

Mike Ashley buys long-time rival's sports business,"Mike Ashley's Frasers Group owns Sports Direct among other brands Billionaire businessman Mike Ashley has bought the gym and fitness business from his rival and long-time critic Dave Whelan after they fell into administration. Mr Ashley's Frasers Group said it would buy 46 leisure clubs and 31 retail outlets from DW Sports Fitness for Â£37m to merge with its own business. Some 922 jobs out of a total of 1,700 across the business will be saved. DW went bust earlier this month after its income evaporated during lockdown. The firm owns 75 retail stores and 73 gyms in total, all of which had to close temporarily due to coronavirus restrictions. Frasers, which also owns Lillywhites, Evans Cycles and House of Fraser, said the DW assets would ""compliment (sic)"" its own gym and fitness club portfolio, and would now be managed under its Everlast brand. Susannah Streeter, senior markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said it was surprising the group had bought a gym business as they were still ""grappling with the public's reluctance to train indoors"". ""It's likely to be some time before people bound back to the gym in greater numbers and it can be ascertained whether this latest acquisition will have been the right choice for the company."" DW also owns the Fitness First gym chain which is unaffected by the administration. Mr Ashley, who has been buying up struggling High Street brands over the last five years, has had a feud with DW Sports' owner, Mr Whelan, dating back two decades. In 2000, Mr Whelan was famously reported to have told his younger rival from the south: ""There is a club in the north, son, and you're not part of it."" Dave Whelan has been in a feud with Mike Ashley dating back two decades Mr Ashley later reported Mr Whelan's JJB Sports business to the Office of Fair Trading, alleging it was involved in a price-fixing scheme over football shirts. The OFT issued multi-million pound fines to those involved, including JJB. Mr Whelan, 83, a former owner of Wigan Athletic football club, created DW Sports in 2009 when he bought 50 JJB Sports fitness clubs and the adjoining shops out of administration. During the year ending 31 March 2019, DW made a loss of just over Â£20m. Frasers itself has been struggling during the pandemic, calling its most recent financial year the ""most challenging"" in its history. In the year to 26 April, its sales climbed slightly, but profits dived by 20% to Â£143.5m due to lockdown store closures. Last week, it said that more of its House of Fraser department stores were ""anticipated"" to close, likely resulting in further job cuts. It has already shut 10 of the 59 stores it bought out of administration in 2018.

Evidence Navalny was poisoned - Berlin hospital,"Mr Navalny is being treated at the Charite hospital in Berlin The Berlin hospital treating the seriously ill Russian opposition leader, Alexei Navalny, says he appears to have been poisoned. The CharitÃ© hospital released a statement saying ""clinical evidence suggests an intoxication through a substance belonging to the group of cholinesterase inhibitors"". But doctors who treated him in Russia say the substance was not present. Mr Navalny fell ill on an internal flight in Russia on Thursday. Video appeared to show Mr Navalny, a dogged critic of the Kremlin, writhing in agony on the flight from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. His supporters suspect poison was placed in a cup of tea he drank at the airport in Tomsk. Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Mr Navalny's flight made an emergency landing in Omsk where he was first treated. In their latest statement released after that of the German medical team, the Omsk doctors say tests showed no sign of cholinesterase inhibitors in his body. Speaking last week, the same team suggested his illness was caused by a metabolic disorder triggered by low blood sugar. On Friday, they at first said he was too ill to be moved but then allowed him to board a medical evacuation flight, which landed in Berlin on Saturday morning. His condition was ""serious but not life-threatening"" the statement said. ""The exact substance is not yet known,"" the hospital said. ""Widespread analysis has begun. The effect of the poison - i.e. the inhibition of cholinesterase in the organism - has been proven several times and in independent laboratories."" The clinical outcome remained unclear, the statement said, and the medical team warned of possible effects on the nervous system. Navalny's wife Yulia has been at his bedside at the CharitÃ© The opposition leader is in intensive care and is still in an artificial coma. Mr Navalny is being given an antidote, atropine, the same drug used inthe case of ex-KGB agent Sergei Skripalby UK doctors after his poisoning with the nerve agent Novichok in Salisbury in 2018. They are a group of chemicals, some of which can be used to treat diseases, such as Alzheimer's. When used in nerve agents and pesticides they can be harmful to humans. ""Cholinesterase inhibitors block a crucial enzyme which regulates messages from nerves to muscles,"" says Alastair Hay, Professor (Emeritus) of Environmental Toxicology at Leeds University. ""The enzyme is called acetylcholinesterase.  Inhibition of the enzyme interferes with nerve to muscle messaging and muscles are no longer able to contract and relax.  They go into a sort of spasm.

Microsoft backs Epic in Apple row,"Microsoft has thrown its weight behind Epic Games in a continuing legal battle with Apple. Apple pulled hugely popular game Fortnite from its App Store after Epic deliberately broke its rules in protest at Apple's policies. In an escalation, Apple then said it would pull Epic's access to developer tools on iOS and Mac. But Microsoft said this would damage a ""critical technology"" for many third-party game creators. That is because Epic also owns the Unreal Engine - a tool widely used by developers from other studios to build games, virtual-reality VR experiences andspecial effects in major television shows and films. Microsoft uses the technology itself. Xbox head Phil Spencer tweeted: ""Ensuring that Epic has access to the latest Apple technology is the right thing for game developers and gamers."" Epic has objected to what it calls a ""monopoly"" in the App Store - specifically the 30% cut Apple demands from in-game purchases. It had legal documentation and a huge marketing push prepared after it decided to circumvent the rule by signposting players to a discount available away from the app. Allow Twitter content?

Microsoft said denying Epic access to Apple's developer tools would ""prevent Epic from supporting Unreal Engine on iOS and macOS, and will place Unreal Engine and those game creators that have built, are building, and may build games on it at a substantial disadvantage"". Fortnite sues Apple over App Store ban Apple claims 'half a trillion dollars' app economy ""Apple's discontinuation of Epic's ability to develop and support Unreal Engine for iOS or macOS will harm game creators and gamers,"" it added. Apple, however, says it applies the rules equally and ""won't make an exception for Epic because we don't think it's right to put their business interests ahead of the guidelines that protect our customers"". Microsoft has also previously criticised Apple's App Store terms. When it became clear Apple would not allow Xbox game streaming on iPhones, Microsoft said Apple was the only major platform to ""deny consumers from cloud gaming and game subscription services"". Earlier this year, whenApple was engaged in another high-profile stand-off with an app developer over its policies, Microsoft's president, Brad Smith, hinted at the company's disapproval. He said regulators should have a ""focused conversation"" about app stores and the rules they enforced. However, Microsoft also runs the Windows and Xbox stores, where it takes a 15-30% cut of software sales, depending on the platform,according to its developer agreement,external.

Her husband, George, an outspoken critic of the president, will also be stepping back from political activism. She added that her decision was ""completely my choice"", and that she would announce future plans ""in time"". The announcement came hours after one of Mrs Conway's daughters, Claudia, 15, tweeted that her mother's job had ""ruined [her] life"".

"Protests erupt as Wisconsin police shoot black manAn overnight curfew is imposed on the US state's Kenosha county, after the man is seriously injured.","This video can not be played US police shooting of Jacob Blake sparks protests in Wisconsin Protests have erupted in the US state of Wisconsin after police shot a black man many times while responding to what they said was a domestic incident. The man, identified as Jacob Blake, was taken to hospital for surgery and is now in intensive care, his family said. Video posted online appears to show Mr Blake being shot in the back as he tries to get into a car in Kenosha. Authorities in the city declared an emergency overnight curfew after unrest broke out following the shooting. Hundreds of people marched on police headquarters on Sunday night. Vehicles were set on fire and protesters shouted ""We won't back down"". Protesters set vehicles on fire in Kenosha In a public safety alert, police urged 24-hour businesses to consider closing because of ""numerous"" calls about armed robberies and shots being fired. On Twitter, President Donald Trump's son Donald Trump Jr decried the protests as ""anarchy"", and reposted a series of videos depicting burning buildings and cars, purportedly filmed in Kenosha. Officers used tear gas to try to disperse hundreds of protesters who defied the county-wide curfew, which is in place until 07:00 on Monday (12:00 GMT). How are African Americans treated under the law? What's next after flood of racial equity donations? Five pieces of context to understand the US protests Wisconsin Governor Tony Evers condemned the shooting of Mr Blake, who was reportedly unarmed. ""While we do not have all of the details yet, what we know for certain is that he is not the first black man or person to have been shot or injured or mercilessly killed at the hands of individuals in law enforcement in our state or our country,"" he said in a statement. ""I have said all along that although we must offer our empathy, equally important is our action. In the coming days, we will demand just that of elected officials in our state who have failed to recognise the racism in our state and our country for far too long."" Allow Twitter content?

Jacob Blake's name was trending on social media and thousands signed a petition calling for the officers involved to be charged. He is now out of surgery and in stable condition, according to family and friends on social media. The shooting comes amid heightened tensions in the US over racism and police brutality following the death of African-American man George Floyd earlier this year. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden on Monday released a statement calling for a ""full and transparent investigation"" of the shooting. ""This morning, the nation wakes up yet again with grief and outrage that yet another Black American is a victim of excessive force,"" Mr Biden said. ""The officers must be held accountable."" Kenosha Police Department said the ""officer involved shooting"" happened shortly after 17:00 on Sunday.  It added that officers had provided ""immediate aid"" to Mr Blake, who was taken to a hospital in Milwaukee in serious condition. It said police had been responding to a ""domestic incident"" but gave no details about what led to the shooting. It is so far unclear who called police and what happened before the video recording began. The Wisconsin Department of Justice is investigating the incident. It said the officers involved had been placed on administrative leave. As of Monday morning local time, more than 18,000 people had signed a petition on change.org calling for the officers involved to be charged. In video footage shared on social media, three officers can be seen pointing their weapons at a man identified as Mr Blake as he walks around a parked SUV. As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire.  Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. The officers involved have not been officially named. Prominent civil rights lawyer Ben Crump told CNN that Mr Blake's family had reached out to him for assistance. In a tweet, he said Mr Blake's three sons were in the car he was getting into when he was shot. ""They saw a cop shoot their father. They will be traumatized forever. We cannot let officers violate their duty to PROTECT us,"" he wrote. He said the shooting happened after Mr Blake tried to break up a fight between two women. This video can not be played Why does Wisconsin send so many black people to jail? Witnesses also told local news site Kenosha News that Mr Blake had tried to break up a fight between two women and that police had attempted to use a Taser on him prior to the shooting. Clyde McLemore, a spokesman with a nearby chapter of Black Lives Matter, told reporters ""the frustration is boiling to the top and we're sick and tired"". Black Lives Matter protests were held across the US and around the world after African-American man George Floyd was killed in police custody in Wisconsin's neighbouring state of Minnesota in May. A white police officer knelt on Mr Floyd's neck for almost nine minutes before he died. The officer, Derek Chauvin, has been charged with murder.

US allows wider use of blood plasma treatment,"During the announcement, President Trump called on Americans to donate blood plasma The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency authorisation to use plasma to treat Covid patients. The technique uses antibody-rich blood plasma from people who've recovered from the disease and has already been applied to 70,000 people in the US - in trials or for the gravely ill. The FDA says initial trials indicate it is safe, although more are needed to prove effectiveness. Several experts have questioned the robustness of studies into its use. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons, and on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where he will launch his campaign to win a second term in the White House. Does the US have the world's worst coronavirus death rate? How close are we to finding a treatment to coronavirus? ""This is what I've been looking forward to doing for a long time,"" the president told reporters on Sunday. ""I'm pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives."" Mr Trump described the procedure as a powerful therapy, as he appealed to Americans to come forward to donate plasma if they had recovered from Covid-19. More than 176,000 people have died from coronavirus since the start of the outbreak in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 5.7 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide. The country has had more confirmed cases and deaths than anywhere else in the world. The FDA had already approved the use of plasma transfusions on coronavirus patients under certain conditions. It has now given the treatment ""emergency use authorisation"", rather than full approval, saying that early research suggests blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve patient health if it is administered within the first three days of admittance to hospital. However, more trials are needed to prove its effectiveness. The agency said it had concluded it was safe after reviewing the results of 20,000 patients who had received the treatment so far. The FDA said people under the age of 80 who were not on a respirator and received plasma containing high levels of antibodies had a 35% better survival rate a month after the treatment than those who had received plasma with a low level of antibodies. ""It appeared that the product is safe and we're comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,"" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. In his own comments, Mr Trump did not use such nuanced language, saying instead that the plasma treatment had been ""proven to reduce mortality by 35%"". Several experts, including Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, have expressed reservations about the robustness of studies so far. Many countries are using plasma as a coronavirus therapy, but it's not yet clear how effective the treatment is. The decision by the US FDA to grant emergency use is a balance of risks. It says, based on the evidence so far, convalescent plasma may lessen the severity or shorten the length of Covid-19 illness. Certainly, sick coronavirus patients whose own immune systems are struggling to fight off the pandemic virus might get protection from a transfusion of antibody-rich plasma from someone who has successfully recovered from Covid-19. Convalescent plasma has been used to successfully treat other diseases, including Ebola. It is generally well-tolerated, but unwanted effects can occur, including harmful allergic reactions. A recent UK analysis said it remained ""very uncertain"" whether plasma was beneficial,externalfor people admitted to hospital with Covid-19. Trials are ongoing to understand precisely which patients might benefit and by how much. Experts want ""gold standard"" evidence to inform treatment decisions and gathering that data will take time. In a statement, the Infectious Diseases Society of America said that while there were ""some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with Covid-19.... we lack the randomised controlled trial data we need to better understand its utility in Covid-19 treatment"". Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, called it ""a political stunt"". ""Convalescent plasma may have some efficacy, but we need to have definitive data,"" he wrote on Twitter. World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Monday that using convalescent plasma was ""still an experimental treatment"". They added that the risks and side effects associated with it, ranging from mild to severe, must be considered. ""There are a number of clinical trials going on around the world looking at convalescent plasma compared to the standard of care. Only a few of them have actually reported interim results... and at the moment, it's still very low-quality evidence,"" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference. The WHO has previously said that ""Covid-19 convalescent plasma can be made available on an experimental basis through local production provided that ethical and safety criteria are met for its preparation and use"". In a tweet on Saturday, President Trump said ""the deep state, or whoever, at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. ""Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after [the US presidential election],"" he added. Earlier this year, US regulators gave emergency authorisation to Gilead Science Inc's remdesivir as a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus. Meanwhile, a report by the Financial Times suggests the White House is considering granting emergency authorisation for a vaccine being developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, ahead of the US presidential election on 3 November. The White House has not commented on the story, but a spokesperson for AstraZeneca told Reuters that efficacy results for its trials were not expected until later this year.

BTS blow up YouTube records with Dynamite,"Dynamite precedes a new album from BTS, which is due later this year. Dynamite, the latest single by Korean boy band BTS, has smashed YouTube records - and looks set to be the UK's number one single this Friday. The pastel-coloured, dance-heavy video was watched 101.1 million times in 24 hours after its release last Friday. That surpasses the previous record, set by fellow K-Pop band Blackpink, whose song How You Like That racked up 86.3 million views in 24 hours in June. Dynamite is also the first video to achieve 100 million views in one day. More than three million fans also tuned in to watch the clip's live premiere - almost double the previous record, also held by Blackpink's How You Like That. Dynamite is the first single from BTS to be sung entirely in English, and the band said they wanted it to convey ""positive vibes, energy, hope, love, the purity, everything"". Allow YouTube content?

The septet first teased the video in July, explaining that they were currently preparing an album for the second half of the year. ""[We] decided to first release a single because we wanted to reach our fans as soon as possible. Due to Covid-19, people around the world have been going through tough times and we wanted to share some positive energy with our fans,"" they said. BTS ask fans to avoid shows over coronavirus fears Blackpink smash YouTube premiere record BTS fans match $1m Black Lives Matter donation The shimmery, pop-disco track was written by David Stewart and Jessica Agombar, who most recently teamed up for the Jonas Brothers' hit, What a Man Gotta Do. It has already topped the iTunes download chart in 104 countries, and could give the band their first UK number one single this Friday. According to the Official Chart Company, Dynamite notched up 1.7 million UK streams in its first 48 hours, and is currently 1,700 chart sales ahead of Joel Corry & MNEK's chart-topper Head & Heart. However, the song has so far failed to break Spotify's UK Top 10, which means the band's streaming numbers could count against them when the final figures are compiled later this week. Dynamite comes six months after BTS's last studio album Map of the Soul: 7, which was released in February; and the band are due to perform it live at the MTV VMAs on 30 August. Meanwhile, Blackpink are poised to challenge the band's YouTube record this Friday, when they release a new single, Ice Cream, with US superstar Selena Gomez. Allow YouTube content?

"Microsoft backs Epic in Apple rowThe Xbox company has declared support for the Fortnite-maker as it battles Apple's ""monopoly"".","Microsoft has thrown its weight behind Epic Games in a continuing legal battle with Apple. Apple pulled hugely popular game Fortnite from its App Store after Epic deliberately broke its rules in protest at Apple's policies. In an escalation, Apple then said it would pull Epic's access to developer tools on iOS and Mac. But Microsoft said this would damage a ""critical technology"" for many third-party game creators. That is because Epic also owns the Unreal Engine - a tool widely used by developers from other studios to build games, virtual-reality VR experiences andspecial effects in major television shows and films. Microsoft uses the technology itself. Xbox head Phil Spencer tweeted: ""Ensuring that Epic has access to the latest Apple technology is the right thing for game developers and gamers."" Epic has objected to what it calls a ""monopoly"" in the App Store - specifically the 30% cut Apple demands from in-game purchases. It had legal documentation and a huge marketing push prepared after it decided to circumvent the rule by signposting players to a discount available away from the app. Allow Twitter content?

Fortnite sues Apple over App Store ban Apple claims 'half a trillion dollars' app economy ""Apple's discontinuation of Epic's ability to develop and support Unreal Engine for iOS or macOS will harm game creators and gamers,"" it added.

More schools ask pupils to wear face coveringsOvercrowding concerns prompt two high schools in the Highlands to introduce face coverings indoors.Highlands & IslandsComments,"For most schools in Scotland the wearing of face coverings is currently voluntary More schools are advising pupils and staff to wear face coverings to help combat coronavirus. Grantown Grammar School in Grantown on Spey and Millburn Academy in Inverness have both said masks need to be worn between classes. Children across Scotland are not currently required to wear masks in either primary or high schools. But Nicola Sturgeon has said this advice couldchange for secondary school students in the ""near future"". The World Health Organisation (WHO) has issued fresh guidance sayingchildren over the age of 12 should wear masksand the EIS trade union posted a message on Twitter that it will ""will press [the] Scottish Government further on face covering protocols in light of WHO advice"". In a letter to parents, Grantown Grammar School explained the changes are being introduced because ""corridors are becoming crowded between lessons and at break and lunchtime, even with the one way system"". Millburn Academy in Inverness has asked pupils to wear face coverings Similar concerns about overcrowding as pupils move between lessons sparked theintroduction of face coverings at James Gillespie's High Schoolin Edinburgh. The letter to parents at Millburn Academy in Inverness also asks for face coverings to be worn on school buses. Education campaign group Us for Them Scotland, which says it has 9,500 members, claimed any move to make coverings mandatory for children would cause more harm than good. Organiser Jo Bisset, said: ""Everyone appreciates the health and safety of pupils and teachers has to be a priority. ""But forcing children to wear masks when there's little, if any, scientific evidence to support such a move could be hugely damaging. ""It could have an extremely negative impact on pupils with autism, hearing impairments and conditions such as asthma."" The Scottish government has said there is currently no evidence that coronavirus among young people is being transmitted in schools. Agrowing number of school pupils have tested positive for Covid-19, but the government believes the infection has been transmitted in other settings, such as house parties or other indoor gatherings. A Highland Council spokeswoman said: ""There is currently no widespread transmission of the virus in Highland. ""However, there may be circumstances in some secondary schools, where physical distancing during movement between classes is more difficult due to the school layout, or there may be medical conditions which are assessed as an increased risk. ""We are currently updating our guidance to head teachers to provide clarity on this matter and we will enable people to wear face coverings where they wish to do so."" DEATHS:Who is dying and where?

"'I became alcoholic during lockdown'Chris McLone's story is far from unique, say addiction specialists.","Chris has now been sober for more than two months Before lockdown, Chris McLone was looking forward to a good year. In his late 40s, he felt fit and healthy, enjoying life with a successful career as a sales manager. Always a very social person, Chris enjoyed nights out with friends and going to the football. Alcohol played a part in his life but he never viewed it as a problem. But within weeks of lockdown, Chris, who lives on Teesside, had gone from being someone who enjoyed a drink to someone who needed a drink. ""I suppose I've always been a social drinker - I was never within the limits, the recommended limits, and so yeah, I used to enjoy a drink, sometimes a little bit more than I should, as a lot of people do. ""I was in a good place before lockdown, I was keeping fit, I was swimming five days a week, I was doing well at work and I was in a good mindset to be honest."" His adult daughter, a key worker, moved out during lockdown to protect her dad, but that left Chris living on his own - isolated, anxious, uncertain about the future and growing increasingly depressed. The weeks dragged on and Chris's drinking escalated. Chris says he began experiencing withdrawal symptoms at the very end. ""Although I wanted to cut down and stop at that point, I wasn't in control of that. And that was the frightening part. ""I've never been like that in my life and I had to admit that to myself. So I was drinking very early in the morning to stop withdrawal symptoms. ""I promised myself I wouldn't do it again tomorrow. Of course, the exact same thing happened the next day. And that's when I realised I had to take big steps to get some proper treatment."" With the help and encouragement of his family, Chris turned to the Steps Together drug and alcohol rehabilitation service in Leicestershire. He's been sober now for more than 70 days, determined to lay his demons to rest. ""Where I was before, it was just a horrible dark place I was in and sobriety is just fantastic. I can't explain how good I feel."" One of those who helped Chris get his life back together was GP Dr Rob Hampton, who specialises in addiction services. He says they've seen a marked increase in people in need of help and that Chris's story is far from unique. ""When listening to the stories, these were people who, a few weeks ago, were actually functioning very well, holding down jobs, living normal, day-to-day lives. ""Within three weeks they'd become dependent alcoholic drinkers and needing detoxification rehab. ""If you look at what lockdown meant to people's lives - so first of all, having to get up every day to go to work and take the kids to school - all of that just stopped. ""Somebody described it perfectly to me - 'Every day is Friday night now' - and there's no reason to get up in the morning. ""You add that to the isolation some people were feeling, the job insecurity, all sorts of stresses and strains in relation to the uncertainty for the future. ""But even those who were furloughed and felt more confident about their work, their kids were at home, they were having to get involved in home schooling. ""There was just that need for a stress-buster every day."" All of this is familiar to the British Liver Trust, one of the UK's main charities dealing with the medical consequences of alcohol abuse. Its helpline has seen an increase in calls of 500% since lockdown began, an indication of how many people have found their drinking has escalated out of control. But this comes on the back of an already huge increase - up by 400% - in deaths due to alcohol-related liver disease since 1970. The statistics make for grim reading: every day, more than 40 people die from liver disease in the UK. It is the third biggest cause of premature death in the UK and the biggest cause of death in those aged between 35 and 49. Vanessa Hebditch, policy director at the charity, says lockdown has only accentuated the need for a proper alcohol strategy from government. ""We need to address the public health measures, the population-wide issues. ""So that's about increasing taxation, introducing, for example, a minimum unit price, but it's also addressing advertising, marketing and things like labelling so consumers have a real choice, and understand what alcohol includes. ""It's absolutely crazy that I can buy a bottle of milk and get all sorts of nutritional and calorie information, and yet I can buy a bottle of beer or wine and get nothing."" The governments in both Scotland and Wales have introduced a minimum unit price (MUP) of 50p for alcohol sales. In March of this year, the government in England said there were ""no plans for the introduction of MUP in England"" although it would continue to monitor the progress in Scotland and consider the evidence of its impact. Of course, not everyone found they were drinking more during lockdown. In June, the National Survey for Wales found that 31% of those who took part reported drinking less than before lockdown. Across the UK, health services in all four nations reported that while the number of people trying to access alcohol support services fell during the initial phase of the pandemic, referrals are now getting back to normal levels. And for those who have found themselves in trouble, support is out there. This video can not be played Musician Nick Davis was in alcohol recovery when lockdown started and has had to find new ways to stay sober Nick Davis, who's in his late 50s and from West Yorkshire, is now more than 500 days sober but says he is always only an hour away from a return to alcoholism. Like Chris, he found lockdown and the chaos of the pandemic hard to cope with. But distractions - caring for his dog, playing his guitar - kept him going. And he offers these words to those who might be struggling: ""I think the best advice I could give is, just be honest. Be honest with yourself, be honest with everybody else, tell everybody else what you're going through. ""It's not as much of a stigma now as it was in the past, it's an illness.""

Breaking|Breaking newsHigh schools set to introduce face coveringsMinisters are consulting with teachers about the use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas.Scotland,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Face coverings may be introduced in Scottish high schools The use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas of secondary schools is set to be introduced in Scotland. The government is in the ""final stages"" of consultations with teachers and councils about having pupils wear face coverings while moving between classes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was acting in response to new guidance from the World Health Organization. Ministers are also considering whether to make masks mandatory on school transport - but not inside classrooms. The use of face coverings in schools is currently voluntary, although some schools have started advising staff and pupils to wear them to help combat the spread of Covid-19. Advice 'may change' on face coverings in schools More schools ask pupils to wear face coverings Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. However, over the weekend the World Health Organization (WHO) issued fresh guidance sayingchildren over the age of 12 should wear masks. At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said Education Secretary John Swinney was ""in the final stages of consulting teachers and local authorities on a recommendation for the use of face coverings by staff and pupils in secondary schools when moving around corridors and communal areas"". She said there was more mixing between different groups of children in these areas, and that there was less scope for effective ventilation. People are also thought to be more likely to raise their voices in crowded places, increasing the risk of aerosol transmission of the virus. Pupils may have to wear masks indoors as they move between classes, like these Dutch teenagers Ms Sturgeon said the government's scientific advisers were also considering whether face coverings should be made mandatory on school transport. However, she said they were ""not currently consulting on any proposal"" to have pupils wear masks in class, saying: ""There is greater scope for physical distancing in classrooms and face coverings are more likely to interfere with teaching and learning."" She added: ""The best way to ensure schools can stay open safely is for all of us to play our part in keeping transmission rates in the community as low as possible."" Some schoolsin Edinburgh, Inverness and Grantown on Speyhave written to parents recommending pupils wear masksdue to concerns about overcrowding as they move between lessons. The first minister said she expected the Scotland-wide move would be confirmed ""over the next couple of days"", and would constitute a change to guidance which schools would be expected to follow. She said: ""We are not talking about a mandatory system in the sense of there being penalties and enforcement in schools. I get the sense that schools - while I accept there will be a mixture of opinion around it - are themselves looking to follow this kind of approach. ""We will set out the detail when we get to the point of finalising the recommendation."" Under the existing guidance no-one is required to wear face coverings in school, apart from staff who have close personal contact with a pupil for an extended period of time. However, anyone who wants to wear one is allowed to do so. A recent survey of nearly 30,000 teachers by the EIS teaching union found 41% supported the mandatory wearing of face coverings by senior pupils in classrooms. However, one parents group - Us For Them Scotland - claimed making masks mandatory ""could have an extremely negative impact on pupils with autism, hearing impairments and conditions such as asthma"". Health authorities are working to tackle a number of coronavirus ""clusters"" in Scotland, including one centred on the Kingspark School in Dundee. A total of 17 members of staff have tested positive, as well as two pupils,and all households connected to the school have been told to go into self-isolation for two weeks. A growing number of school pupils across Scotland have tested positive for Covid-19, but the government believes the infection has been transmitted in other settings such as house parties. Ms Sturgeon said ""most"" transmission of the virus was not happening in schools, saying that ""the risk is greater of community transmission getting into schools"". She said the current consultation was only on a ""limited"" use of face coverings in schools, because of ""the relatively low levels of transmission we are currently seeing in the community"". However she added that ""where there are outbreaks there is an option for incident management teams to recommend more extensive use of face coverings for a period to protect public health"".

US allows wider use of blood plasma treatmentThe move comes after Donald Trump accused regulators of impeding the development of a Covid-19 cure.US & Canada,"During the announcement, President Trump called on Americans to donate blood plasma The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency authorisation to use plasma to treat Covid patients. The technique uses antibody-rich blood plasma from people who've recovered from the disease and has already been applied to 70,000 people in the US - in trials or for the gravely ill. The FDA says initial trials indicate it is safe, although more are needed to prove effectiveness. Several experts have questioned the robustness of studies into its use. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons, and on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where he will launch his campaign to win a second term in the White House. Does the US have the world's worst coronavirus death rate? How close are we to finding a treatment to coronavirus? ""This is what I've been looking forward to doing for a long time,"" the president told reporters on Sunday. ""I'm pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives."" Mr Trump described the procedure as a powerful therapy, as he appealed to Americans to come forward to donate plasma if they had recovered from Covid-19. More than 176,000 people have died from coronavirus since the start of the outbreak in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 5.7 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide. The country has had more confirmed cases and deaths than anywhere else in the world. The FDA had already approved the use of plasma transfusions on coronavirus patients under certain conditions. It has now given the treatment ""emergency use authorisation"", rather than full approval, saying that early research suggests blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve patient health if it is administered within the first three days of admittance to hospital. However, more trials are needed to prove its effectiveness. The agency said it had concluded it was safe after reviewing the results of 20,000 patients who had received the treatment so far. The FDA said people under the age of 80 who were not on a respirator and received plasma containing high levels of antibodies had a 35% better survival rate a month after the treatment than those who had received plasma with a low level of antibodies. ""It appeared that the product is safe and we're comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,"" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. In his own comments, Mr Trump did not use such nuanced language, saying instead that the plasma treatment had been ""proven to reduce mortality by 35%"". Several experts, including Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, have expressed reservations about the robustness of studies so far. Many countries are using plasma as a coronavirus therapy, but it's not yet clear how effective the treatment is. The decision by the US FDA to grant emergency use is a balance of risks. It says, based on the evidence so far, convalescent plasma may lessen the severity or shorten the length of Covid-19 illness. Certainly, sick coronavirus patients whose own immune systems are struggling to fight off the pandemic virus might get protection from a transfusion of antibody-rich plasma from someone who has successfully recovered from Covid-19. Convalescent plasma has been used to successfully treat other diseases, including Ebola. It is generally well-tolerated, but unwanted effects can occur, including harmful allergic reactions. A recent UK analysis said it remained ""very uncertain"" whether plasma was beneficial,externalfor people admitted to hospital with Covid-19. Trials are ongoing to understand precisely which patients might benefit and by how much. Experts want ""gold standard"" evidence to inform treatment decisions and gathering that data will take time. In a statement, the Infectious Diseases Society of America said that while there were ""some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with Covid-19.... we lack the randomised controlled trial data we need to better understand its utility in Covid-19 treatment"". Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, called it ""a political stunt"". ""Convalescent plasma may have some efficacy, but we need to have definitive data,"" he wrote on Twitter. World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Monday that using convalescent plasma was ""still an experimental treatment"". They added that the risks and side effects associated with it, ranging from mild to severe, must be considered. ""There are a number of clinical trials going on around the world looking at convalescent plasma compared to the standard of care. Only a few of them have actually reported interim results... and at the moment, it's still very low-quality evidence,"" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference. The WHO has previously said that ""Covid-19 convalescent plasma can be made available on an experimental basis through local production provided that ethical and safety criteria are met for its preparation and use"". In a tweet on Saturday, President Trump said ""the deep state, or whoever, at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. ""Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after [the US presidential election],"" he added. Earlier this year, US regulators gave emergency authorisation to Gilead Science Inc's remdesivir as a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus. Meanwhile, a report by the Financial Times suggests the White House is considering granting emergency authorisation for a vaccine being developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, ahead of the US presidential election on 3 November. The White House has not commented on the story, but a spokesperson for AstraZeneca told Reuters that efficacy results for its trials were not expected until later this year.

Rio bosses lose bonuses over Aboriginal cave blastExecutives at the mining giant Rio Tinto have had their payouts cut over the culturally important site.Business,"Juukan Gorge cave site before and after mining works Mining giant Rio Tinto has cut the bonuses of three executives over the destruction of two ancient caves in Australia. In May, the world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed the sacred Aboriginal sites in Pilbara, Western Australia. The company went ahead with the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters despite the opposition of Aboriginal traditional owners. They were among the oldest historic sites in Australia. The caves showed evidence of continuous human habitation dating back 46,000 years. Rio Tinto's chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques will lose a total of Â£2.7m. Chris Salisbury, chief executive of iron ore, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, will lose payouts of more than half a million pounds each. The company, whose shares are listed in both London and Sydney, said it would provide more details on the bonus cuts in its 2020 remuneration report. All three will remain in their roles. ""It is clear that no single individual or error was responsible for the destruction of the Juukan rockshelters,"" said Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson. ""But there were numerous missed opportunities over almost a decade and the company failed to uphold one of Rio Tinto's core values - respect for local communities and for their heritage."" Mining firm sorry for destroying Aboriginal caves Australia's oldest human remains head home The sites were above about eight million tonnes of high-grade iron ore, with an estimated value at the time of Â£75m. ""We will implement important new measures and governance to ensure we do not repeat what happened at Juukan Gorge and we will continue our work to rebuild trust with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people,"" said Mr Thompson. The review found that while the company had obtained legal authority for the blasts, the decision fell short of the standards and internal guidance Rio Tinto had set for itself. It also found that the firm had failed to properly engage with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people, the traditional owners of the site. After the caves were destroyed, a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"". ""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... its importance cannot be underestimated,"" he said, according to the news agency Reuters. ""Our people are deeply troubled and saddened by the destruction of these rock shelters and are grieving the loss of connection to our ancestors as well as our land.""

High schools set to introduce face coveringsThe Scottish government is consulting with teachers about the use of face coverings in secondary schools.Scotland,"This video can not be played Coronavirus: Face coverings may be introduced in Scottish high schools The use of face coverings in corridors and communal areas of secondary schools is set to be introduced in Scotland. The government is in the ""final stages"" of consultations with teachers and councils about having pupils wear face coverings while moving between classes. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she was acting in response to new guidance from the World Health Organization. Ministers are also considering whether to make masks mandatory on school transport - but not inside classrooms. The use of face coverings in schools is currently voluntary, although some schools have started advising staff and pupils to wear them to help combat the spread of Covid-19. Advice 'may change' on face coverings in schools More schools ask pupils to wear face coverings Young people returned to Scotland's schools earlier in August with no requirements for physical distancing between younger pupils, and no rules around face coverings. However, over the weekend the World Health Organization (WHO) issued fresh guidance sayingchildren over the age of 12 should wear masks. At her daily coronavirus briefing, Ms Sturgeon said Education Secretary John Swinney was ""in the final stages of consulting teachers and local authorities on a recommendation for the use of face coverings by staff and pupils in secondary schools when moving around corridors and communal areas"". She said there was more mixing between different groups of children in these areas, and that there was less scope for effective ventilation. People are also thought to be more likely to raise their voices in crowded places, increasing the risk of aerosol transmission of the virus. Pupils may have to wear masks indoors as they move between classes, like these Dutch teenagers Ms Sturgeon said the government's scientific advisers were also considering whether face coverings should be made mandatory on school transport. However, she said they were ""not currently consulting on any proposal"" to have pupils wear masks in class, saying: ""There is greater scope for physical distancing in classrooms and face coverings are more likely to interfere with teaching and learning."" She added: ""The best way to ensure schools can stay open safely is for all of us to play our part in keeping transmission rates in the community as low as possible."" Some schoolsin Edinburgh, Inverness and Grantown on Speyhave written to parents recommending pupils wear masksdue to concerns about overcrowding as they move between lessons. The first minister said she expected the Scotland-wide move would be confirmed ""over the next couple of days"", and would constitute a change to guidance which schools would be expected to follow. She said: ""We are not talking about a mandatory system in the sense of there being penalties and enforcement in schools.

Football and rugby training resumes as rules relax,"Outdoor contact sports for adults can kick off again People of all ages are able to take part in organised outdoor contact sports as a number of further lockdown restrictions are lifted. Amateur rugby and football clubs are among those which can resume training in groups of no more than 15 people. The relaxation of rules also allows bingo halls, amusement arcades, casinos, funfairs and snooker halls to reopen and driving lessons to resume. Outdoor live events such as concerts and comedy shows can also begin again. However, there must be strict observation of guidelines on physical distancing, enhanced hygiene and restricted audience numbers. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? All of the activities have been in lockdown since coronavirus measures were introduced in March. Members of Broughton Rugby Club's women's team are getting back together for the first time since March Broughton Rugby Club's women's team are among those who are ""so excited"" to be reunited and resume serious training. Captain Lauren Park toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""It's been a long time coming.... it's going to be the first time since March that we've been able to get together in such a large group and have some competitive touch rugby on the go."" She said they would train in two bubbles of 15 people, on separate areas of the pitch. And as well as hand sanitizing ""before during and after"" training, the rugby ball will also be thoroughly cleaned. ""It's been a long five months for everyone involved"" in Thorn Athletic in Johnstone, according to its chairman Mark McGee. The team have kept in touch on WhatsApp, and taken part in 5k challenges and Zoom workouts, but they are looking forward to getting back to a routine which benefits their physical and mental health. And as training almost gets back to normal, and with friendly games due to begin on 11 September, he said: ""Everyone's absolutely buzzing"". A socially-distanced gig by Sam Fender took place in Newcastle two weeks ago Promoter Oli Norman is disappointed that more restrictions have not been lifted on live events in Scotland. He saidguidelines published on Sunday afternoon,externalstated that capacity at outdoor events would be limited to 200 people ""which may sound like a lot but for a commercial outdoor event is northing"". ""So unfortunately until they do a U-turn on a ridiculous restriction, they've killed an entire industry at a point when an entire industry is on its knees,"" he added. He said it put under threat plans to hold GlasGlow - an annual light show in the Botanic Gardens - which attracts about 2,000 people day at the end on October. These kinds of events are naturally socially-distanced, in acres of parkland, and require authorisation by the council, he added. ""It's deeply illogical what is currently happening so thousands of people can currently go into a zoo or a safari park, an outdoor market - indeed a beer garden I was in the other week had 4-500 people drinking alcohol,"" Mr Norman told Radio Scotland. ""All these events that are hugely needed as we go into the dark months face real risk of cancellation right now unless the government comes to its senses and does something far more pragmatic."" The Scottish government has been approached for a comment. It has previously said its decision-making on coronavirus restrictions was guided by public health concerns. Many musicians and artists who have faced a summer without gigs and festivals will now be looking to restart live performances Caroline Sewel, regional organiser for the Musicians Union in Scotland and Northern Ireland, said: ""Musicians are creatives and if any industry has the ability to come back then the music industry can, and I'm sure will."" However, she warned that social distancing and reduced capacity for live gigs could mean they are not financially viable for some venues, promoters and musicians. Glasgow based musician Kapil Seshasayee, like many artists, had to switch to building a fan base online during the pandemic. He said: ""The thing I like most about being forced to do that is that geography becomes irrelevant and you can set up a zoom call with anyone. ""There is an interesting culture of collaboration that is emerging because of Covid."" Driving instructor Tony Clarke was due to take his first lesson in about five months at 10:00. Speaking ahead of returning to work, he said he had ""mixed emotions"" but he wanted to get back to the pupils who had been left behind, to get them through their test. That will mean additional cleaning of the car between lessons, masks worn by student and instructor, and windows down throughout each lesson. The Clydebank-based instructor said he was fully booked and there were a lot of his pupils ""itching to sit a driving test"". Some of them might be a bit rusty after five months away from the wheel ""but I won't be long in getting them back up to scratch,"" he said. Further restrictions are due to be lifted next Monday (31 August). They include the reopening of gyms, swimming pools and indoor sports courts. However, people over the age of 12 will not be able to take part in contact sports indoors until 14 September. Do you still need to take Covid tests?

Malaysia opens inquest into death of NÃ³ra Quoirin,"NÃ³ra Quoirin went missing from her room on 4 August 2019 An inquest has opened into the death of a London teenager who was found dead while on a family holiday in Malaysia. NÃ³ra Quoirin, 15, vanished from her room at the Dusun rainforest resort last August. Her unclothed body was found beside a stream just over a mile away after a 10-day search operation. Malaysian police said there was no foul play but NÃ³ra's parents said she would not have wandered off alone otherwise, and fought for an inquest. 'No foul play' in Nora Quoirin death Nora Quoirin's parents speak publicly for the first time since her death On Monday, Coroner Maimoonah Aid said the inquest aimed to determine how and when the teenager died and whether anyone was ""criminally"" connected. She said that the inquest served to deliver ""justice for everyone"". NÃ³ra, her parents and her younger brother and sister arrived at the eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65 km) south of the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur, on 3 August last year for a two-week stay. Her disappearance the next day sparked a vast search operation. Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate Nora An initial post-mortem report said that NÃ³ra had died due to gastrointestinal bleeding from hunger and stress over a prolonged period. But the family have always insisted it was highly unlikely their daughter - who had severe learning and development disabilities - would have wandered off alone. NÃ³ra was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development. In January, her Irish mother, Meabh, and her French father, Sebastian, expressed their shock at the case being closed by Malaysian police. Parents want answers after teen death case closed They called for an inquest in order to have ""the fullest possible picture of what happened to NÃ³ra and how her case was dealt withâ. They previously said: ""As a vulnerable child, with significant physical and mental challenges, we strongly refute any conclusion that NÃ³ra was alone for the entire duration of her disappearance."" NÃ³ra's parents were unable to attend the proceedings in Malaysia due to the Covid-19 pandemic but are expected to give evidence through video conferencing next week.

Travel firms 'desperately need' government help,"The UK's travel industry has reached a ""critical point"" and is calling for further support to stem job losses. Measures to curb the pandemic have already led to the loss of around 39,000 jobs, said travel industry trade body ABTA. About 65% of travel firms have had to make redundancies or start a consultation process. ABTA said the industry desperately needs ""tailored support"" or many more jobs would be lost. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) warned that more job losses were set to come as the government's furlough scheme is phased out, unless new support measures are introduced. ""With the government's stop start measures, the restart of travel has not gone as hoped for the industry, and sadly businesses continue to be adversely affected and jobs are being lost at an alarming rate,"" said ABTA's chief executive Mark Tanzer. ""Coming towards the end of the traditional period for peak booking, we have hit a critical point as existing government measures to support businesses begin to taper off, the consequence of which, according to this survey of ABTA Members will be ruinous for more people's livelihoods."" ABTA said many travel firms had not yet restarted after the lockdown, with cruise firms and school travel operators still closed for business. ""We have already seen well-known and respected businesses that would normally be successful falling into administration, and more are sadly set to follow,"" said Mr Tanzer. STA Travel, which specialised in long-haul trips aimed primarily at young people and students,stopped trading on Friday, placing 500 jobs at risk. And in August,Hays Travel announced that it would be cutting almost 900 jobsdue to cancelled holidays because of new coronavirus travel restrictions. Before that, in July the UK's largest tour operatorTui said it would be shutting 166 High Street stores in the UK and Ireland, affecting up to 900 jobs, on top of plans in May to cut around 8,000 jobs globally. ABTA has written to the chancellor Rishi Sunak to ask for more support in the form of a package of measures aimed specifically at the travel industry, including a temporary suspension of Air Passenger Duty for next summer. If there were to be a second lockdown, 96% of travel businesses report it would have a critical or serious impact on their ability to survive, ABTA warned. ""Travel desperately needs the government in its next review to provide tailored support or tens of thousands more jobs will be lost,"" said Mr Tanzer. The government has changed its travel quarantine rules for countries where rising coronavirus cases have caused it concern in the last week, adding 11 more countries including France, Netherlands, Austria, Malta and Monaco. Travellers returning from countries on the UK's quarantine list need to self-isolate for 14 days.

US allows wider use of blood plasma treatmentThe move comes after Donald Trump accused regulators of impeding the development of a Covid-19 cure.,"During the announcement, President Trump called on Americans to donate blood plasma The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency authorisation to use plasma to treat Covid patients. The technique uses antibody-rich blood plasma from people who've recovered from the disease and has already been applied to 70,000 people in the US - in trials or for the gravely ill. The FDA says initial trials indicate it is safe, although more are needed to prove effectiveness. Several experts have questioned the robustness of studies into its use. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons, and on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where he will launch his campaign to win a second term in the White House. Does the US have the world's worst coronavirus death rate? How close are we to finding a treatment to coronavirus? ""This is what I've been looking forward to doing for a long time,"" the president told reporters on Sunday. ""I'm pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives."" Mr Trump described the procedure as a powerful therapy, as he appealed to Americans to come forward to donate plasma if they had recovered from Covid-19. More than 176,000 people have died from coronavirus since the start of the outbreak in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 5.7 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide. The country has had more confirmed cases and deaths than anywhere else in the world. The FDA had already approved the use of plasma transfusions on coronavirus patients under certain conditions. It has now given the treatment ""emergency use authorisation"", rather than full approval, saying that early research suggests blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve patient health if it is administered within the first three days of admittance to hospital. However, more trials are needed to prove its effectiveness. The agency said it had concluded it was safe after reviewing the results of 20,000 patients who had received the treatment so far. The FDA said people under the age of 80 who were not on a respirator and received plasma containing high levels of antibodies had a 35% better survival rate a month after the treatment than those who had received plasma with a low level of antibodies. ""It appeared that the product is safe and we're comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,"" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. In his own comments, Mr Trump did not use such nuanced language, saying instead that the plasma treatment had been ""proven to reduce mortality by 35%"". Several experts, including Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, have expressed reservations about the robustness of studies so far. Many countries are using plasma as a coronavirus therapy, but it's not yet clear how effective the treatment is. The decision by the US FDA to grant emergency use is a balance of risks. It says, based on the evidence so far, convalescent plasma may lessen the severity or shorten the length of Covid-19 illness. Certainly, sick coronavirus patients whose own immune systems are struggling to fight off the pandemic virus might get protection from a transfusion of antibody-rich plasma from someone who has successfully recovered from Covid-19. Convalescent plasma has been used to successfully treat other diseases, including Ebola. It is generally well-tolerated, but unwanted effects can occur, including harmful allergic reactions. A recent UK analysis said it remained ""very uncertain"" whether plasma was beneficial,externalfor people admitted to hospital with Covid-19. Trials are ongoing to understand precisely which patients might benefit and by how much. Experts want ""gold standard"" evidence to inform treatment decisions and gathering that data will take time. In a statement, the Infectious Diseases Society of America said that while there were ""some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with Covid-19.... we lack the randomised controlled trial data we need to better understand its utility in Covid-19 treatment"". Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, called it ""a political stunt"". ""Convalescent plasma may have some efficacy, but we need to have definitive data,"" he wrote on Twitter. World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Monday that using convalescent plasma was ""still an experimental treatment"". They added that the risks and side effects associated with it, ranging from mild to severe, must be considered. ""There are a number of clinical trials going on around the world looking at convalescent plasma compared to the standard of care. Only a few of them have actually reported interim results... and at the moment, it's still very low-quality evidence,"" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference. The WHO has previously said that ""Covid-19 convalescent plasma can be made available on an experimental basis through local production provided that ethical and safety criteria are met for its preparation and use"". In a tweet on Saturday, President Trump said ""the deep state, or whoever, at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. ""Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after [the US presidential election],"" he added. Earlier this year, US regulators gave emergency authorisation to Gilead Science Inc's remdesivir as a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus. Meanwhile, a report by the Financial Times suggests the White House is considering granting emergency authorisation for a vaccine being developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, ahead of the US presidential election on 3 November. The White House has not commented on the story, but a spokesperson for AstraZeneca told Reuters that efficacy results for its trials were not expected until later this year.

Covid-19 death rise 'likely' in coming days,"Cardiff city centre at the end of July More people out socialising in Cardiff is believed to be behind a rise in coronavirus cases in the capital. There have been 47 positive tests in the last week - which is 37% of all cases in Wales. Public health officials said many of the new cases were among people between the ages of 20 and 30. But the infection rate is still well below some areas in northern England and the Midlands, which have seen local measures introduced. Fiona Kinghorn, director of public health at Cardiff and Vale health board, said they did not have a particular source in mind for the new cases, but they were believed to be more to do with people moving around between workplaces and social establishments. ""We've experienced a small number of clusters - that's led to a rise in the number of cases in Cardiff,"" she said. She said it was not a spike but a small rise - and a sign that people were not following social distancing rules and hand-washing. ""I think it's a result of people being out and about and in work places as well, we're not seeing people sticking to the rules,"" Ms Kinghorn said. She said if people were not able to work from home it was important they followed advice. The current infection rate in Cardiff is 12.8 cases per 100,000 over the last week.Only three new cases were reported on Monday, fewer than over previous days. But local interventions, including some lockdowns, have only been introduced in areas of England when weekly infections have reached 70 to 90 cases per 100,000. Birmingham was recently put on a ""watch"" list by Public Health England, with 31 cases per 100,000, but with problems confined to particular neighbourhoods. Coronavirus: What do the stats tell us in Wales? Cardiff Sky call centre workers test positive What happens if I'm in an area on the watchlist? Public Health Wales (PHW) said no outbreak had been declared and it was monitoring a number of small clusters. ""As we move through the recovery phase of the Coronavirus pandemic, we expect to see clusters in different settings,"" said a spokesman.Â ""We manage any clusters of Coronavirus appropriately, including by providing advice around infection prevention and control, and by supporting contact tracing where required."" PHW incident director Dr Robin Howe said: ""I think it is a concern that we are seeing an increase in cases, and they are particularly localised around Cardiff. ""It is good that we are identifying them and the Test Trace Protect scheme is kicking in and bringing those cases under control and making sure that all contacts are identified and isolated."" The coronavirus incident director said deaths ""usually"" reflected what was going on a few weeks previously in the pandemic. What was important, he said, was that the number of cases was kept under control. ""Deaths usually reflect what is going on a number of weeks ago in terms the pandemic, and there is likely to be a small tail of cases, happening over the next few days and weeks,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""We just need to ensure we keep the cases under control and it should mean that we don't have further deaths."" 'I became alcoholic during lockdown' Boris Johnson says it is 'vitally important' children return to class Is the US the worst-hit country for deaths? The latest figures show three deaths reported in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area - one on Saturday and two more last Thursday. Overall in Wales, there have been 127 Covid-19 cases over the last week - a case rate of four per 100,000. Dr Howe added: ""Just because we are able to go to shops and pubs, and people are increasingly going back to work, we still need to be vigilant and observe the social distancing of two metres wherever possible."" Other hygiene measures, such as hand washing, also needed to be adhered to, he added.

Call to extend eviction ban in Wales,"Before coronavirus, landlords only had to give tenants two months' notice before eviction There are calls for renters in Wales to get more protection from eviction over fears that homelessness services could ""crack"" under increased demand. In England - except in certain circumstances - renters will getsix months' notice of their landlord's plan to evict themuntil March 2021. Shelter Cymru said private renters were among the hardest-hit by the pandemic. The Welsh Government said it would keep its own six-month notice period, due to expire in September, ""under review"". Shelter wants ministers to use emergency coronavirus powers to give renters in Wales the same protection as those in England. In Scotland, a proposal for six months of notice until March requires approval from the Scottish Parliament, while laws in Northern Ireland include a 12-week notice period. Anti-eviction protests after 'U-turn' on ban Furloughed student 'drowning' in rent arrears A YouGov poll of just over 1,000 households in Wales, commissioned by Shelter Cymru, suggested an estimated 15,000 private renters had been threatened with eviction since the start of lockdown. The charity called the number ""off the scale"" compared to the usual number of about 1,500 renters a year. At the start of the pandemic,the law was changed so landlords would have to give tenants three months' noticefor eviction, instead of two. Jennie Bibbings urged the Welsh Government to extend the emergency legislation Jennie Bibbings, from Shelter Cymru, said homelessness services in Wales would come under increased pressure when the ban on court-ordered evictions comes to an end on 20 September. ""We are not out of the woods, more people are going to lose their jobs and their homes,"" she said. ""The Welsh Government needs to extend the emergency legislation to at least the end of March or ideally for another 12 months so that tenants have that breathing space."" But the National Residential Landlords Association (NRLA) said the extension was ""unacceptable"" and called on government to compensate private landlords for lost income during the pandemic. Douglas Haig, from the NRLA in Wales, said the courts were needed to deal with cases where tenants were committing anti-social behaviour or hade long-standing rent arrears unrelated to the pandemic. Latest data from Rent Smart Wales suggests more than 70,000 private tenants have fallen behind on rent payments since the start of the pandemic. Many people are struggling to pay the rent during the pandemic and face the prospect of eviction Beth - not her real name - a teaching assistant in Blaenau Gwent, was issued aSection 8 ""notice to quit"",externalin July, along with her roommate. It gave them three months to pay their rent arrears or move out. Beth fell behind on her rent after being furloughed from her job in March. She is hoping to be back to work in September and wants to arrange a repayment plan with her landlord who, she says, is ""not being very communicative"". She said the property was ""pretty much all I have"" after paying Â£14,000 in rent over three years. ""The fact that I've been a good tenant doesn't seem to mean anything, not to my landlord, not to my estate agents, not the government,"" she said. ""It feels like I shouldn't even try and build anything going forward because it could all just be taken away from me."" She and her roommate were given their notice just before the Welsh Government extended the notice period to six months. The Welsh Government has also introduceda loan scheme allowing renters to borrow money to pay back arrearsbuilt up during the pandemic and Beth said she hoped she would be eligible to apply. ""My living plans are uncertain, putting me under a great deal of stress,"" she said. ""And I'm going to have to go back in a few weeks' time and teach our nation's children and do it with a smile on my face."" Ms Bibbings fears landlords could benefit from tenants using the loan scheme and ""take the money and run"", usingSection 21 notices,external, so-called no fault evictions, to get rid of tenants they fear may not be able to pay their rent. She said putting the six-month notice period in place until at least March would ensure landlords ""can't use eviction as a quick fix to get rid of tenants once they've taken out a loan and they receive that money"". ""This is the most important emergency measure that the government needs to take,"" she added. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We will continue to work closely with stakeholders to monitor impacts in the rented sector.""

Where have pupils tested positive?,"THIS PAGE WILL NOT BE UPDATED AFTER 4 SEPTEMBER 2020 A growing number of cases of Covid-19 have been confirmed among pupils and staff at Scottish schools. The Scottish government has stressed that these are part of community clusters which have had an impact on schools, rather than school-based clusters. It is not thought that the virus has been transmitted within schools. Here are details of the latest cases. Kingspark School in Dundee has been closed after a cluster of coronavirus cases connected to the school. There are currently 40 cases in total - 23 staff members, three pupils and 14 community contacts. All staff and pupils at the additional support needs school have been asked to self-isolate for 14 days and the building will remain closed during that time. The council said robust hygiene measures were in place but a decision was taken to close because of the vulnerabilities and complex needs of the pupils. Anyone who lives with a pupil at the school has also been asked to self-isolate for 14 days, unless they can maintain physical distancing within the house. A primary two class at St Peter and Paul's School, also in Dundee, has been asked to isolate until Wednesday after an individual tested positive. Children who attended the Happy Times out-of-school club at the city's Downfield Primary School are also being asked to self-isolate until the same date following two positive test results connected to Kingspark school. Elsewhere in Dundee, a pupil in the primary three class at St Clement's Primary School has tested positive and all children in that year group have been asked to self-isolate until Tuesday. A Grove Academy pupil has also tested positive and subsequently a small number of staff and pupil close contacts of the individual have been asked to self-isolate until Saturday. Three cases have been detected among pupils in Perth and Kinross -one at Newhill Primary in Blairgowrie, one at Oakbank Primary in Perth, and one at St John's RC Academy in Perth. NHS Tayside, the health board which covers the area, said the primary pupils had mild symptoms and were self-isolating at home. Close contacts of the St John's pupil have been asked to self-isolate until Wednesday. A pupil has tested positive at Balfron High School. Any pupils and staff who have been in close contact with the individual are being given advice. On 31 August, NHS Lanarkshire said four new cases of Covid-19 identified in South Lanarkshire were associated with a nursery and three schools. They included a staff member at First Steps Nursery School in Hamilton, a pupil at Holycross High School, Hamilton, a staff member at Stonelaw High School, Rutherglen, and a staff member at Udston Primary School, Hamilton. The individuals were self-isolating and the cases are not known to be linked. The schools and nursery remained open. Previously,a nursery pupil at Ace Place Nursery in Rutherglen,externaltested positive for Covid-19. The pupil was self-isolating and close contacts were being traced. It cameafter three new confirmed cases of Covid-19 were identified at Lanarkshire schools last Monday.,external The pupils - at St Margaret's High School in Airdrie, Uddingston Grammar and Stepps Primary - were self-isolating. The schools remained open, but all pupils and staff in Stepps Primary School class 1B were asked to isolate for 14 days. Four pupils at St Ambrose High and one from St Andrew's High- both in Coatbridge - and one from Caldervale High in Airdrie had previously tested positive for the virus, with health protection officials saying they believedhouse parties had played a part in the spread of the virus. But the investigation into this cluster of Covid-19 cases was stood down after a week of no new cases. Also in Lanarkshire,two classes and associated staff at High Blantyre Primary School,externalhave been asked to isolate until they have been tested and received a negative result after two pupils and a staff member tested positive. There were a further three linked cases in Lanarkshire who were not staff or pupils. There were 16 confirmed cases in north east Glasgow, withsome of these cases confirmed to be pupils at Bannerman High School in Baillieston. However, NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has not disclosed the exact number due to patient confidentiality. A primary school class and their teacher atSt Albert's Primary School in Pollokshields was also been asked to self-isolateafter a case of coronavirus. Contact tracing is taking place at Hutchesons Grammar School and Lochend Community High School. In the NHS Greater Glasgow area, it is also taking place atJohn Paul Academy,external, Carntyne Primary,St Ninian's Primary,external, Blairdardie Primary, Kelvinside Academy and St Andrew's Secondary in Glasgow, at Lady Alice Primary in Greenock,Killermont Primary School in East Dunbartonshire,externaland Edinbarnet Primary in West Dunbartonshire. Contact tracing is also being carried out at Corpus Christi Primary school, Glasgow, Holy Cross Primary School, Glasgow, and St Anthony's Primary School, Renfrewshire, following positive cases. Pupils at Knightswood Primary have now been told by public health officials that they can return to school after a class was asked to self-isolate as a precaution. Contact tracing was also taking place after one caseinvolving a pupil at Todholm Primary School in Paisley, as well as at Wallace Primary School in Elderslie, St James' Primary in Renfrew and Castlehead High School in Paisley after positive tests. On 31 August it emerged five further schools are now the focus of test and protect teams: Aileymill Primary, Greenock; Twechar Primary, Twechar; St Monica's Primary, Pollock; Knightswood Secondary and Gartconnor Primary, Kirkintilloch. The latest update identified cases linked to Our Lady and St Patrick's High School, Dumbarton and Glasgow Gaelic Secondary School. A pupil at Preston Tower Primary School in Prestonpans, East Lothian, tested positive for Covid-19. East Lothian Council said that children who had been in direct contact with the confirmed case had been contacted and would be staying at home for 14 days. The school remained open, in line with public health advice. A pupil also tested positive for coronavirus at Balbardie Primary School in Bathgate, West Lothian. NHS Lothian confirmed that the pupil was self-isolating at home with their family. An incident management team was assessing the situation and the board said enhanced cleaning measures were in place and close contacts had been traced. Elsewhere in Lothian, contacts have been traced at Dalry Primary and nursery campus, Granton Primary School, Dalkeith High School and Lasswade High School. A nursery at Newburgh Primary school was closed after one person tested positive. NHS Fife said the individual was isolating at home with other household members. While a link between the confirmed case and the nursery was being investigated, there was no evidence to suggest onward transmission within the nursery at this stage, the health board added. All close contacts from the nursery have been informed and asked to self-isolate for 14 days. At Queen Anne High School in Dunfermline, class 2B2 and all those on the bus from the school to Kingseat on 28 August have been asked to stay at home on 1 September, after a pupil tested positive. There is no evidence to suggest transmission of the virus in the school and close contacts of the child will be contacted and given individual advice. A pupil at Dalneigh Primary School, Inverness, tested positive for the virus. The school remained open, but the ""small number"" of pupils who had contact with the confirmed case were asked to isolate for 14 days. A member of staff at Kinmylies Primary Schoolin Inverness also tested positive. Highland Council has sent a letter to parents, saying that ""all appropriate measures"" are in place at the school, and that the relevant areas have been cleaned. A case of Covid-19 was linked with Aberdeen's Oldmachar Academy. NHS Grampian said close contacts had been identified and advised to self isolate. The school was closed on Friday 21 August for cleaning as a precaution, but has now reopened. Contact tracing has now been completed after a single case has been linked to the Selkirk High School ""community"". Additional cleaning was carried out before the secondary opened on Monday.

Two storms force mass evacuations across Caribbean,"People in the Dominican Republic tried to save their animals from the flash floods At least 12 people have been killed as two storms tore through the Caribbean on Sunday. Hurricane Marco and Tropical Storm Laura brought high winds and rough seas leaving at least nine people dead in Haiti and another three in the Dominican Republic. Heavy rains have also battered Cuba and the US territory of Puerto Rico. Marco is expected to make landfall in the US state of Louisiana on Monday, with Laura hitting Texas by Thursday.

Rio bosses lose bonuses over Aboriginal cave blast,"Juukan Gorge cave site before and after mining works Mining giant Rio Tinto has cut the bonuses of three executives over the destruction of two ancient caves in Australia. In May, the world's biggest iron ore miner destroyed the sacred Aboriginal sites in Pilbara, Western Australia. The company went ahead with the destruction of the Juukan Gorge rock shelters despite the opposition of Aboriginal traditional owners. They were among the oldest historic sites in Australia. The caves showed evidence of continuous human habitation dating back 46,000 years. Rio Tinto's chief executive Jean-Sebastien Jacques will lose a total of Â£2.7m. Chris Salisbury, chief executive of iron ore, and Simone Niven, group executive of corporate relations, will lose payouts of more than half a million pounds each. The company, whose shares are listed in both London and Sydney, said it would provide more details on the bonus cuts in its 2020 remuneration report. All three will remain in their roles. ""It is clear that no single individual or error was responsible for the destruction of the Juukan rockshelters,"" said Rio Tinto chairman Simon Thompson. ""But there were numerous missed opportunities over almost a decade and the company failed to uphold one of Rio Tinto's core values - respect for local communities and for their heritage."" Mining firm sorry for destroying Aboriginal caves Australia's oldest human remains head home The sites were above about eight million tonnes of high-grade iron ore, with an estimated value at the time of Â£75m. ""We will implement important new measures and governance to ensure we do not repeat what happened at Juukan Gorge and we will continue our work to rebuild trust with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama and Pinikura people,"" said Mr Thompson. The review found that while the company had obtained legal authority for the blasts, the decision fell short of the standards and internal guidance Rio Tinto had set for itself. It also found that the firm had failed to properly engage with the Puutu Kunti Kurrama people, the traditional owners of the site. After the caves were destroyed, a PKKP representative, John Ashburton, said losing the site was a ""devastating blow"". ""There are less than a handful of known Aboriginal sites in Australia that are as old as this one... its importance cannot be underestimated,"" he said, according to the news agency Reuters. ""Our people are deeply troubled and saddened by the destruction of these rock shelters and are grieving the loss of connection to our ancestors as well as our land."" This video can not be played Miriwoong: The push to keep the Australian language alive Mr Salisbury apologised for the company's actions at the time: ""We are sorry for the distress we have caused.""

Road planners accused of rigging emissions rules,"Road planners in England have been accused of rigging accounting rules to disguise the climate impact of new roads. Environmentalists say the Department for Transport has under-counted CO2 from its road improvement programme. That's because the DfT measures emissions against national CO2 targets, whilst measuring benefits of a new road against the local economy. A Treasury spokesperson said this was a reasonable approach. But critics say the resulting calculation exaggerates the benefits of new roads, whilst downgrading the negatives in terms of carbon emissions. Road plans will scupper CO2 targets, report says Get Britain building, says Sunak on infrastructure Electric car emissions myth 'busted' Chris Todd, director of pressure group Transport Action Network, told the BBC it proved the government has one rule for its Â£27bnroad-building programme,external, and another rule for everything else. He said: âThis is like someone who's morbidly obese insisting they can gorge on another cream cake, because no single cake will have a 'material impact' on their well-being.â The Treasury strongly rejects the allegation. A spokesperson said it made sense to measure the carbon emissions from new roads against the UKâs entire carbon budget, because climate change is a global problem, whereas smaller road schemes offer local benefits. But the objectors are motivated by a recent analysis from transport academic Phil Goodwin, an emeritus professor at University College London. He says the DfT should employ the same standard for measuring the negatives of the roads programme as it uses to measure the positives. âConsider,â he says, âif one calculated the total number of jobs generated by a specific scheme as a proportion of the total jobs in the economy."" âAny such calculation will always be open to words like âimmaterialâ or âinsignificant' - but this does not in the slightest prove that the aggregate effect really is unimportant.â Prof Goodwin said the appraisal system made CO2 âuniquely unimportantâ. Ministers say their five-year roadbuilding plan will boost the economy. Arecent consultantsâ reportprojected that the governmentâs roads programme will increase carbon emissions from the strategic road network by about 20 MtCO2, when they need to go down by about 167 MtCO2 to meet carbon targets. A Treasury spokesperson said: âWe reject this. The report is based on old project appraisals, and takes no account of our ambitious plans to decarbonise transport. âWe have assessed carbon impacts throughout the design of the roads programme using much more accurate methods, and expect the impact of new improvements to be around 0.27 million tonnes through to the end of 2032.â But Prof Goodwin said the roads programme was still predicated on increased traffic, even though Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says weshould be driving less. The government argues that the advent of electric cars will solve the CO2 problem on the roads. But its critics predict that the switch to 100% electric cars will come too late to meet CO2 targets. They also warn that battery cars take a huge toll on resources.

Outdoor contact sports and bingo out of lockdownLive events such as concerts and comedy can also resume as further restrictions are lifted.Scotland,"Outdoor contact sports for adults can kick off again People of all ages are able to take part in organised outdoor contact sports as a number of further lockdown restrictions are lifted. Amateur rugby and football clubs are among those which can resume training in groups of no more than 15 people. The relaxation of rules also allows bingo halls, amusement arcades, casinos, funfairs and snooker halls to reopen and driving lessons to resume. Outdoor live events such as concerts and comedy shows can also begin again. However, there must be strict observation of guidelines on physical distancing, enhanced hygiene and restricted audience numbers. Which lockdown rules will change next - and when? All of the activities have been in lockdown since coronavirus measures were introduced in March. Members of Broughton Rugby Club's women's team are getting back together for the first time since March Broughton Rugby Club's women's team are among those who are ""so excited"" to be reunited and resume serious training. Captain Lauren Park toldBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland: ""It's been a long time coming.... it's going to be the first time since March that we've been able to get together in such a large group and have some competitive touch rugby on the go."" She said they would train in two bubbles of 15 people, on separate areas of the pitch. And as well as hand sanitizing ""before during and after"" training, the rugby ball will also be thoroughly cleaned. ""It's been a long five months for everyone involved"" in Thorn Athletic in Johnstone, according to its chairman Mark McGee. The team have kept in touch on WhatsApp, and taken part in 5k challenges and Zoom workouts, but they are looking forward to getting back to a routine which benefits their physical and mental health. And as training almost gets back to normal, and with friendly games due to begin on 11 September, he said: ""Everyone's absolutely buzzing"". A socially-distanced gig by Sam Fender took place in Newcastle two weeks ago Promoter Oli Norman is disappointed that more restrictions have not been lifted on live events in Scotland. He saidguidelines published on Sunday afternoon,externalstated that capacity at outdoor events would be limited to 200 people ""which may sound like a lot but for a commercial outdoor event is northing"". ""So unfortunately until they do a U-turn on a ridiculous restriction, they've killed an entire industry at a point when an entire industry is on its knees,"" he added. He said it put under threat plans to hold GlasGlow - an annual light show in the Botanic Gardens - which attracts about 2,000 people day at the end on October. These kinds of events are naturally socially-distanced, in acres of parkland, and require authorisation by the council, he added. ""It's deeply illogical what is currently happening so thousands of people can currently go into a zoo or a safari park, an outdoor market - indeed a beer garden I was in the other week had 4-500 people drinking alcohol,"" Mr Norman told Radio Scotland. ""All these events that are hugely needed as we go into the dark months face real risk of cancellation right now unless the government comes to its senses and does something far more pragmatic."" The Scottish government has been approached for a comment. It has previously said its decision-making on coronavirus restrictions was guided by public health concerns. Many musicians and artists who have faced a summer without gigs and festivals will now be looking to restart live performances Caroline Sewel, regional organiser for the Musicians Union in Scotland and Northern Ireland, said: ""Musicians are creatives and if any industry has the ability to come back then the music industry can, and I'm sure will."" However, she warned that social distancing and reduced capacity for live gigs could mean they are not financially viable for some venues, promoters and musicians. Glasgow based musician Kapil Seshasayee, like many artists, had to switch to building a fan base online during the pandemic. He said: ""The thing I like most about being forced to do that is that geography becomes irrelevant and you can set up a zoom call with anyone. ""There is an interesting culture of collaboration that is emerging because of Covid."" Driving instructor Tony Clarke was due to take his first lesson in about five months at 10:00. Speaking ahead of returning to work, he said he had ""mixed emotions"" but he wanted to get back to the pupils who had been left behind, to get them through their test. That will mean additional cleaning of the car between lessons, masks worn by student and instructor, and windows down throughout each lesson. The Clydebank-based instructor said he was fully booked and there were a lot of his pupils ""itching to sit a driving test"". Some of them might be a bit rusty after five months away from the wheel ""but I won't be long in getting them back up to scratch,"" he said. Further restrictions are due to be lifted next Monday (31 August). They include the reopening of gyms, swimming pools and indoor sports courts. However, people over the age of 12 will not be able to take part in contact sports indoors until 14 September. Do you still need to take Covid tests?

Will pupils do a full school day?,"All remaining Covid restrictions have now been scrapped in English schools. Rules have also been eased elsewhere in the UK, but some measures are being retained for the moment. Staff and students without symptomsinEnglandareno longer asked to test for Covid twice-weekly. Secondary school pupils alsodon't need to wear masks. Thelegal requirement to self-isolate after a positive test is also being removed, although it is still recommended. Head teachers groups havewarned that the changes to testing and self-isolation ""may actually lead to an increase in disruption"", as Covid is more likely to spread in the classroom, leading to further pupil and staff absence. All school staff and secondary school pupils inScotlandandNorthern Irelandare still asked to take two lateral flow tests (LFTs) a week(three inWales). InWales,schools are largely back to normal,external. Face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms after 28 February, but should still be worn in communal areas of secondary schools. InNorthern Ireland, schoolsreopened with the same measures as last term. If a primary or post-primary class has multiple Covid cases,all pupils should take an LFT. The guidance that pupils in post-primary schools should wear face coverings still applies. InScotland,social distancing remains in place. However, pupils will no longer have to wear masks in schoolfrom 28 February. Thelatest data,externalfor England shows that 182,000 pupils (2.2%) of pupils were absent for Covid-related reasons on 10 February, down from 320,000 (3.9%) on 3 February. On the same date, 2.8% of teachers and school leaders and 2.5% of teaching assistants and other staff were absent due to Covid, down from 4.4% and 4.1% respectively the previous week. Almost half England's schools (45%) had one in 20 teachers absent due to Covid. InScotlandon 17 February,12,638 students (2.4%) were missing from school,externaldue to Covid-related reasons. The highest absence rate this year was seen on 7 January, when 43,565 students (14.1%) were off. InNorthern Ireland,5.2% of students, 9% of teachers and 11% of classroom assistants in schools were absent due to Covidover the week 24 to 28 January - the highest rates since the new term began. Many schools have told the BBC they have struggled to find temporary staff to cover the teachers who are off. England's Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawiurged retired teachers to return and join teacher supply agencies to fill gaps, but a BBC survey suggested there had been a limited response. Mr Zahawi also suggested schools could merge classes. But teaching unions said there were logistical difficulties and safety issues with teaching large groups of children. After Thursday 24 February,people in England with Covid will no longer have a legal obligation to self-isolate. However, people who test positive will still be advised to stay at home and avoid contact with others for at least five full days, including school staff and students. The legal requirement to self-isolate remains in place across Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. As long as they don't haveCovid symptoms, under-18s already don't have to self-isolate if someone else in their household has Covid. Similarly, whole classes are no longer automatically sent home to isolate if a pupil or teacher tests positive. However, close contacts aged five or above are strongly advisedto testfor at least seven days. All primary and post-primary pupils in Northern Ireland are advised to take an LFT if there are multiple Covid cases in their class. Allchildren aged five to 11 in the UKwill be offered a low-dose vaccine, which is being rolled out on a ""non-urgent"" basis. It's expected to be offered in England in April, and plans are also under way in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. In addition: the low-dose vaccineis already being offered to five to 11-year-olds with medical conditionsthat put them at greater risk all children aged 12 and overare being offered two doses of the Pfizer jab sixteen and 17-year-olds who had a second vaccine dose at least three months ago can have a booster theJCVI has also recommended,externalthat the booster is also offered to children aged 12-15 who are in an at-risk group or live with someone who is immunosuppressed Children who aren't at high risk from Covid should wait 12 weeks after a positive test before having a jab. Grades will again be decided by external marking, instead of the teacher assessments used in 2020 and 2021, but grade boundaries will be more lenient in England, Wales and Scotland. English exam boardshave published details about this year's GCSE, AS and A-level papersfor most subjects, including maths, biology, chemistry and languages. Students taking GCSE exams in English Literature, geography, history and ancient history won't have to answer questions on one option from their course. In maths and science exams, students will be given sheets of formulae and equations. Students takingvocational B-Tec qualificationswill have fewer internal assessments. Qualification Wales, the Scottish Qualification Authority (SQA) and Northern Ireland's CCEA exam board have already set out their plans to ensure candidates' work is fairly assessed.

First day back for many NI pupils,"This video can not be played Many pupils in years seven, 12 and 14 are back at school on Monday for the first time since March Many pupils in years seven, 12 and 14 are back at school on Monday for the first time since March. Schools closed to all but a few pupilsthat month due to the coronavirus pandemic. Education Minister Peter Weir has said that opening schools was probablythe ""top priority"" for the executive. Speaking on the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme, he said that the highest level of staff and pupil safety is ""obviously the key concern"". Ballyclare Secondary School will not be opening on Monday after a pupil tested positive for Covid-19 after being in the school on Thursday, 20 August. On Friday it was announced thatSt Kevin's Primary School on the Falls Road in west Belfast would not be reopening as planned after someone connected to the school tested positive for coronavirus. St Louise's College, also on the Falls Road, also confirmed a positive case of Covid-19 among the school community. The education minister said that there will be ""undoubtedly bumps along the road"" and staff and pupils will have to adapt to a new way of working. When asked about school closures, he said that ""if there is a particular problem in a particular school then that may lead to a particular action"". ""Is everything going to be smooth? No. But I think there is a critical need to get our young people back to school, as indeed our young people have highlighted, that there is a much greater need to get our children back into school safely."" Mr Weir said that pupils should adopt safety measures at home. ""What we have seen in terms of international study is that the opening of schools has not led to major problems, but what it does highlight is that problems will not necessarily be in the classroom,"" he said. ""It is important when a child gets home that they change their clothes, they wash and take precautionary measures."" Peter Weir visited St Joseph's in Carryduff on the first day of term A union representing many principals told a Stormont's committee there isstill a ""real risk"" that many schools will only be able to open part-time. According to Department of Education (DE) guidance school leaders, for example, must carry out individual risk assessments to assess whether it is safe for some vulnerable staff and pupils to return to school. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said that ""school leaders have been left unsupported to make serious decisions on risk with potentially very serious ramifications"". Sandra Isherwood, principal at Jones Memorial Primary School in Enniskillen, County Fermanagh, told Good Morning Ulster that staff would be giving parents a tour of the school to allow them to see what safety measures were in place. Following safety guidance issued to schools last week, Ms Isherwood said principals ""were left to sit down and see how each individual classroom would best fit that purpose"". ""So a lot of that is based on individual schools, because every school is totally different, and the intake of pupils is totally different,"" she said. The principal at Jones Memorial Primary School said that staff had completed ""a lot of paperwork"" ahead of its reopening Guidance for the reopening of schools states thatface coverings are ""strongly encouraged"" in NI schools if social distancing is not possible, but are ""not generally recommended for routine use"". A number of schools have already said that they will be encouraging the wearing of face coverings andBelfast Royal Academy is making it mandatoryfor pupils and staff to wear face coverings when they return. The guidance for the journey to and from school is that it is ""strongly recommended that all pupils, regardless of age, should wear a face covering on all buses, trains or taxis for the journey to school"" if it is appropriate in their case. Schools are also required to keep most pupils inwhole-class ""bubbles"" to limit mixing. The need for ""bubbles"" will mean that most pupils should stay in their own class groups for the entire school day and not mix with pupils in other classes. All pupils to return to school full-time Face coverings 'encouraged' but not for 'routine use' in schools In many schools there will be measures in place such as: Staggered starts and ends to the school day so parents are not dropping all children off at once Staggered meal and break times so children are not mixing in the playground with a lot of others at one time School meals may have to be eaten in classrooms or even outside One-way systems in school corridors Children may not be able to bring things like books or stationery home and then back to school Items such as Lego and soft toys that are difficult to clean are likely to disappear from classes Previous 'Education Restart' guidance issued by the department in June had suggested that many pupilsmay only be able to return to school part-time in September. Many students starting back at school will have received examination grades last week. There wasa significant rise in the number of top GCSE grades awardedin Northern Ireland, just days after the education minister said they would besolely based on grades provided by schools. Mr Weir also made asimilar decision on A-Level and AS gradeswhich had already been awarded to students.

How has one hospital dealt with Covid-19?,"This video can not be played Welsh hospital prepares for potential second wave Staff at a north Wales hospital have appealed to patients and visitors to ""carry on listening and keeping to the the guidelines"" as they prepare for a possible second wave of Covid-19. The latest figures show Betsi Cadwaladr health board has seena spike in deathscompared to other health boards. But staff at Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor said some people ""seem to think the pandemic is over"". The health board said it was slowly resuming normal services for patients. It has seena high number of cases in Wrexham, which had the highest weekly number of coronavirus-related deaths. Interim chief executive Simon Dean said the health board was ""well prepared for an increase in cases"", having increased bed capacity in hospitals, recruiting staff and established the three Ysbyty Enfys field hospitals. Patients needing urgent care were given priority, despite the effect the pandemic has had on services, he added. ""We have prioritised our waiting lists to ensure access for patients to treatment according to clinical priorities."" At Ysbyty Gwynedd hospital, receptionist Carol Ann Jones said there had been a ""mixture of feelings and responses"" from patients and visitors. ""Some are still nervous and a little afraid... perhaps too afraid. Others are a little too confident and seem to think the pandemic is over and we know it is not,"" she said. Nursing director Mandy Jones said these have been challenging times for her team: ""At the moment we have learned a lot from the first wave. ""I am confident that we have prepared as much as we can. I have never seen anything like this in my career. I don't think anyone has seen anything like it. ""It has been like a huge wave of emotion, and we as staff are really grateful to people for that.

But the team had seen what was happening across the world, so we had an idea of what we faced. The important thing was to make sure we were prepared,"" she said. ""There was a lot of training. And we also had to prepare as regards ensuring there were extra items of equipment available such as ventilators.

Christchurch gunman wanted to attack three mosques,"This video can not be played Maysoon Salama, whose son died in the attack, said Tarrant ""terrorised the whole of New Zealand and saddened the world"" The man who killed 51 people at two mosques in New Zealand in 2019 had plans to target a third mosque, his sentencing hearing has heard. Brenton Tarrant also planned to burn down the mosques, wanting to ""inflict as many fatalities as possible"". The Australian has pleaded guilty to 51 counts of murder, 40 attempted murders and one charge of terrorism. Tarrant, 29, faces life in prison, possibly without parole - a sentence never before imposed in New Zealand. He was confronted by survivors and relatives of the victims in court on Monday. ""You gave yourself the authority to take the souls of 51 innocent people, their only crime - in your eyes - being Muslims,"" said Maysoon Salama, whose son Atta Elayyan was killed. ""You transgress beyond comprehension, I cannot forgive you."" Survivors and relatives of victims are attending the court hearing The attacks, parts of which the gunman streamed live online, saw him open fire at two mosques in Christchurch on 15 March last year. He first drove to the Al Noor mosque, firing on people taking part in Friday prayers. He then drove about 5km (3 miles) to the Linwood mosque and killed more people. The attack sent shockwaves around the world and prompted New Zealand to make swift changes to its gun laws. The sentencing hearing, which will last four days, began on Monday morning in Christchurch. Covid-19 restrictions mean the main court room is relatively empty. Hundreds will watch the proceedings on video feeds from other courtrooms in the city to allow for social distancing measures. Dressed in grey prison clothes and surrounded in the dock by three police officers, the gunman reportedly remained silent, occasionally looking around the room where survivors and relatives of the victims were sitting. Tarrant was surrounded by police officers as he sat in the dock Crown prosecutor Barnaby Hawes told the court that the gunman had began formulating a plan years earlier, and his goal was to ""inflict as many fatalities as possible"". He gathered information about mosques in New Zealand - studying floor plans, locations and further details - with the aim of targeting them at the time they would be busiest. In the months before the attack, he travelled to Christchurch and flew a drone over his primary target, the Al Noor mosque. He also planned to target the Ashburton Mosque in addition to the Al Noor mosque and Linwood Islamic Centre, but was detained while on his way to the third mosque. On the day of the attack, he shot people on the street as they tried to escape the Al Noor mosque, the court heard. This included one victim, Ansi Alibava, whose body he drove over as he left the mosque. As he drove towards the Linwood Islamic Centre, he stopped and shot at men of African origin who were able to escape. He briefly pointed his gun at a Caucasian man, the court heard, but then ""smiled and then drove off"". Who were the victims? How the attacks unfolded He told police after his arrest that his plan was to burn down the mosques after his attack, and that he wished he had done so. Tarrant is representing himself in court. He had previously denied the charges and was due to face trial in June, but reversed his plea. He faces a minimum sentence of 17 years, but Justice Cameron Mander, the High Court judge presiding over the case, has the power to sentence him to a full life term with no parole - a sentence never before imposed in New Zealand. More than 60 people will give victim impact statements over the course of the next few days. People arrive for the sentencing hearing at Christchurch High Court The imam of Al-Noor Mosque, Gamal Fouda - who was the first to speak - addressed Tarrant, calling him ""misguided and misled"". He said he saw the ""hate in the eyes of a brainwashed terrorist"" as he was standing in the pulpit, telling Tarrant: ""Your hatred is unnecessary."" The son of victim Ashraf Ali, said he still suffered trauma, saying: ""I have flashbacks, seeing dead bodies all around me. Blood everywhere."" Among the other victims were: Three-year-old Mucaad Ibrahim, who was shot directly while clinging to his father's leg Abdukadir Elmi, 70, from Somalia who previously survived a civil war Naeem Rashid, originally from Pakistan, who was shot while trying to tackle the gunman Hosne Ara, killed while searching for her husband who uses a wheelchair - he survived. Some relatives of victims travelled from overseas and had undergone a two-week coronavirus quarantine in order to take part. This video can not be played Hamimah Tuyan lost her husband in the attacks Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern has said it will be a difficult week for survivors and families of the victims. ""I don't think there's anything I can say that is going to ease how traumatic that period is going to be,"" she said last week. She has vowed never to say the gunman's name, saying soon after the attack: ""He sought many things from his act of terror - but one was notoriety."" Less than a month after the shootings, New Zealand's parliament voted by 119 to 1 on reforms banning military-style semi-automatic weapons as well as parts that could be used to build prohibited firearms. The government offered to compensate owners of newly-illegal weapons in a buy-back scheme.

US approves blood plasma treatment for coronavirus,"During the announcement, President Trump called on Americans to donate blood plasma The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has given emergency authorisation to use plasma to treat Covid patients. The technique uses antibody-rich blood plasma from people who've recovered from the disease and has already been applied to 70,000 people in the US - in trials or for the gravely ill. The FDA says initial trials indicate it is safe, although more are needed to prove effectiveness. Several experts have questioned the robustness of studies into its use. The announcement came a day after President Donald Trump accused the FDA of impeding the rollout of vaccines and therapeutics for political reasons, and on the eve of the Republican National Convention, where he will launch his campaign to win a second term in the White House. Does the US have the world's worst coronavirus death rate? How close are we to finding a treatment to coronavirus? ""This is what I've been looking forward to doing for a long time,"" the president told reporters on Sunday. ""I'm pleased to make a truly historic announcement in our battle against the China virus that will save countless lives."" Mr Trump described the procedure as a powerful therapy, as he appealed to Americans to come forward to donate plasma if they had recovered from Covid-19. More than 176,000 people have died from coronavirus since the start of the outbreak in the United States, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University. Nearly 5.7 million cases have also been confirmed nationwide. The country has had more confirmed cases and deaths than anywhere else in the world. The FDA had already approved the use of plasma transfusions on coronavirus patients under certain conditions. It has now given the treatment ""emergency use authorisation"", rather than full approval, saying that early research suggests blood plasma can decrease mortality and improve patient health if it is administered within the first three days of admittance to hospital. However, more trials are needed to prove its effectiveness. The agency said it had concluded it was safe after reviewing the results of 20,000 patients who had received the treatment so far. The FDA said people under the age of 80 who were not on a respirator and received plasma containing high levels of antibodies had a 35% better survival rate a month after the treatment than those who had received plasma with a low level of antibodies. ""It appeared that the product is safe and we're comfortable with that and we continue to see no concerning safety signals,"" said Peter Marks, director of the FDA's Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. In his own comments, Mr Trump did not use such nuanced language, saying instead that the plasma treatment had been ""proven to reduce mortality by 35%"". Several experts, including Dr Anthony Fauci, a member of the White House's coronavirus task force, have expressed reservations about the robustness of studies so far. Many countries are using plasma as a coronavirus therapy, but it's not yet clear how effective the treatment is. The decision by the US FDA to grant emergency use is a balance of risks. It says, based on the evidence so far, convalescent plasma may lessen the severity or shorten the length of Covid-19 illness. Certainly, sick coronavirus patients whose own immune systems are struggling to fight off the pandemic virus might get protection from a transfusion of antibody-rich plasma from someone who has successfully recovered from Covid-19. Convalescent plasma has been used to successfully treat other diseases, including Ebola. It is generally well-tolerated, but unwanted effects can occur, including harmful allergic reactions. A recent UK analysis said it remained ""very uncertain"" whether plasma was beneficial,externalfor people admitted to hospital with Covid-19. Trials are ongoing to understand precisely which patients might benefit and by how much. Experts want ""gold standard"" evidence to inform treatment decisions and gathering that data will take time. In a statement, the Infectious Diseases Society of America said that while there were ""some positive signals that convalescent plasma can be helpful in treating individuals with Covid-19.... we lack the randomised controlled trial data we need to better understand its utility in Covid-19 treatment"". Jonathan Reiner, a professor of medicine at George Washington University, called it ""a political stunt"". ""Convalescent plasma may have some efficacy, but we need to have definitive data,"" he wrote on Twitter. World Health Organization (WHO) officials said on Monday that using convalescent plasma was ""still an experimental treatment"". They added that the risks and side effects associated with it, ranging from mild to severe, must be considered. ""There are a number of clinical trials going on around the world looking at convalescent plasma compared to the standard of care. Only a few of them have actually reported interim results... and at the moment, it's still very low-quality evidence,"" WHO chief scientist Soumya Swaminathan told a news conference. The WHO has previously said that ""Covid-19 convalescent plasma can be made available on an experimental basis through local production provided that ethical and safety criteria are met for its preparation and use"". In a tweet on Saturday, President Trump said ""the deep state, or whoever, at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics. ""Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after [the US presidential election],"" he added. Earlier this year, US regulators gave emergency authorisation to Gilead Science Inc's remdesivir as a therapeutic treatment for coronavirus. Meanwhile, a report by the Financial Times suggests the White House is considering granting emergency authorisation for a vaccine being developed by Oxford University and pharmaceutical giant AstraZeneca, ahead of the US presidential election on 3 November. The White House has not commented on the story, but a spokesperson for AstraZeneca told Reuters that efficacy results for its trials were not expected until later this year.

"Travel firms 'desperately need' government helpThe industry is asking government for a new rescue plan as jobs are being lost at an ""alarming"" rate.Business","The UK's travel industry has reached a ""critical point"" and is calling for further support to stem job losses. Measures to curb the pandemic have already led to the loss of around 39,000 jobs, said travel industry trade body ABTA. About 65% of travel firms have had to make redundancies or start a consultation process. ABTA said the industry desperately needs ""tailored support"" or many more jobs would be lost. The Association of British Travel Agents (ABTA) warned that more job losses were set to come as the government's furlough scheme is phased out, unless new support measures are introduced. ""With the government's stop start measures, the restart of travel has not gone as hoped for the industry, and sadly businesses continue to be adversely affected and jobs are being lost at an alarming rate,"" said ABTA's chief executive Mark Tanzer. ""Coming towards the end of the traditional period for peak booking, we have hit a critical point as existing government measures to support businesses begin to taper off, the consequence of which, according to this survey of ABTA Members will be ruinous for more people's livelihoods."" ABTA said many travel firms had not yet restarted after the lockdown, with cruise firms and school travel operators still closed for business. ""We have already seen well-known and respected businesses that would normally be successful falling into administration, and more are sadly set to follow,"" said Mr Tanzer. STA Travel, which specialised in long-haul trips aimed primarily at young people and students,stopped trading on Friday, placing 500 jobs at risk. And in August,Hays Travel announced that it would be cutting almost 900 jobsdue to cancelled holidays because of new coronavirus travel restrictions. Before that, in July the UK's largest tour operatorTui said it would be shutting 166 High Street stores in the UK and Ireland, affecting up to 900 jobs, on top of plans in May to cut around 8,000 jobs globally. ABTA has written to the chancellor Rishi Sunak to ask for more support in the form of a package of measures aimed specifically at the travel industry, including a temporary suspension of Air Passenger Duty for next summer. If there were to be a second lockdown, 96% of travel businesses report it would have a critical or serious impact on their ability to survive, ABTA warned. ""Travel desperately needs the government in its next review to provide tailored support or tens of thousands more jobs will be lost,"" said Mr Tanzer. The government has changed its travel quarantine rules for countries where rising coronavirus cases have caused it concern in the last week, adding 11 more countries including France, Netherlands, Austria, Malta and Monaco. Travellers returning from countries on the UK's quarantine list need to self-isolate for 14 days.

"Trump's sister says he's an 'unprincipled phoney'Recordings reveal Maryanne Trump Barry, a former federal judge, saying her brother ""has no principles"".","Maryanne Trump Barry said her brother Donald just ""wants to appeal to his base"" US President Donald Trump's eldest sister, a former federal judge, has said her brother is a liar who ""has no principles"", secret recordings reveal. The critical remarks by Maryanne Trump Barry were recorded by her niece, Mary Trump, who last month published a book excoriating the president. ""His goddamned tweet and lying, oh my God,"" Ms Barry is heard saying. ""It's the phoniness and this cruelty."" Mary Trump said she had taped her aunt to protect herself from litigation. Mr Trump responded to the latest revelations in a statement issued by the White House, saying: ""Every day it's something else, who cares."" The recordings were first reported by The Washington Post, after which the Associated Press obtained them. In the secret recordings, Ms Barry criticises the Trump administration's immigration policy, which has led to children being held at migrant detention centres at the border. ""All he wants to do is appeal to his base,"" she said. One of the claims made in Mary Trump's memoir - Too Much and Never Enough: How My Family Created the World's Most Dangerous Man - is that her uncle paid a friend to take a SAT test for him - a standardised exam which determines university placement. Ms Barry refers to this in the recording, even suggesting that she remembers the name of the friend involved. ""He got into University of Pennsylvania because he had somebody take the exams,"" she said. Five shocking passages in Mary Trump's tell-all book Trump's parents and siblings: What do we know of them? Ms Barry has been supportive of her brother Donald and has previously said the two were close. She once told the story of how he had visited her every day she was in hospital following an operation. ""Once would have been enough - the duty call. That's how love shows, when you go that extra yard."" She also said she ""knew better even as a child than to even attempt to compete with Donald"". A Superior Court judge in California has ordered the president to pay $44,100 (Â£34,000) to Stephanie Clifford, also known as Stormy Daniels. The sum was awarded to cover her legal fees relating to a non-disclosure agreement over an alleged affair between the two. Ms Daniels alleges that she and Mr Trump had sex in a hotel room in Lake Tahoe, a resort area between California and Nevada, in 2006. The president denies the affair. Ms Daniels said she had signed an agreement to keep quiet about her claims in exchange for $130,000 in October 2016, days before the presidential election. In a court ruling published online, a judge ruled that despite the case being dismissed,Ms Daniels was ""the prevailing party"" in the dispute,externaland therefore her costs should be covered.
