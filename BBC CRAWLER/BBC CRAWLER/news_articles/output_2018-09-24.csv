Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit,"A no-deal Brexit could cause disruption to air travel between the UK and European Union countries, the government warned on Monday. This worst-case scenario is set out in the latest batch of documents outlining what what would happen to key industries if no agreement is reached. Bus and coach services to EU countries could also be suspended in the event of no deal. The government wants the EU and UK to accept each other's aviation standards. However, the EU has not yet done so and will stop recognising UK safety standards if there is a hard Brexit. ""If the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 with no agreement in place, UK and EU licensed airlines would lose the automatic right to operate air services between the UK and the EU without seeking advance permission,"" the government said. The UK ""would envisage"" allowing EU airlines to continue flying and ""we would expect EU countries to reciprocate in turn"", according to the document. It added: ""It would not be in the interest of any EU country or the UK to restrict the choice of destinations that could be served, though if such permissions are not granted, there could be disruption to some flights."" Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan What do the government's Brexit ""no-deal"" papers reveal? Brexit: What would a 'no deal' look like? The warning does not necessarily mean that flights would be grounded the day after Brexit. The UK government says it is 'confident' that there will be no disruption to air travel after Brexit According to Airlines UK, which represents 13 UK-registered carriers, the European Commission has said it would put in place a ""bare bones"" aviation agreement with the UK to keep planes flying and to cover safety issues. Tim Alderslade, the trade body's chief executive, said airlines expected the EU and UK to reach a new agreement on aviation. ""Whilst we don't support a no-deal Brexit, we welcome that both the UK and the EU are proposing in this event a minimum agreement that would cover flight and safety requirements for the benefit of both passenger and cargo services,"" he said. ADS Group, which represents the UK's aerospace, defence, security and space sectors, has called for Britain to remain a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). It said talks should be held between the Civil Aviation Authority and the EASA to address the complex issues involved and ensure flights are not disrupted. The no deal notices the government published this afternoon will make uncomfortable reading for many businesses and consumers, but also for the government. In dry, technical language they make clear that many aspects of day-to-day life could be affected significantly if the UK leaves the EU with no deal at all, including air and coach travel (which could in theory come to a temporary halt) food labelling, driving in Europe for business or pleasure, and taking your pet across the Channel. The government argues that these warnings represent contingency planning for a worst case scenario, but until they can guarantee that a deal will be done, preparations will have to be made. And with time running out, people will have to start acting on some of the advice as soon as November. The prospect of a no deal Brexit is beginning to loom large. Flights between the UK and 17 non-EU countries, such as the US, Canada, Switzerland and Iceland, operate due to the UK being an EU member. The guidance states that ""replacement arrangements will be in place before exit day"". The UK has already reached agreements with some of these countries and is ""confident the remaining agreements will be agreed well in advance of the UK leaving the EU"", the government said. A separate government document warned that UK passengers may have to undergo extra security screening when changing flights in the EU after Brexit. Neither passengers nor their luggage are usually rescanned when connecting at other EU airports after flying from the UK. However, new advice states that could change if the EU failed to recognise the UK's aviation security standards after Brexit.

Trump hails South Korea trade deal,"Donald Trump has signed a revised trade pact with South Korea, aimed at expanding opportunities for US carmakers and pharmaceutical companies. It marks the first such agreement finalised by the US president, who has promised to overhaul his country's trade relationships. At a press conference in New York, Mr Trump called the updates to the 2012 agreement ""a very big deal"". The White House first announced the outline of the changes in March. Most analysts said the revisions were relatively modest. The completion of the pact came as Mr Trump faced a number of political controversies, including the sexual harassment allegations against his nominee to the Supreme Court. Businesses are also worried about the impact of retaliatory tariffs to those Mr Trump's administration has imposed on steel and aluminium imports and Chinese goods. Mr Trump said the signing, which took place on the sidelines of the United Nation's General Assembly, was ""a great day"" for the US and South Korea. He described the revised pact as a ""brand new agreement"" and a sign that his trade strategy was working. ""In addition to this deal, we have many in the works, and they are fair deals,"" he said. South Korean President Moon Jae-In focused his remarks on denuclearisation talks with North Korea, in which the US has been involved. He said the new trade agreement, which still needs approval by South Korea's parliament, was a sign of the strong partnership between the US and South Korea. The US started negotiations with South Korea last year, following Mr Trump's criticism of the 2012 deal as a ""one-way street"". Under the new terms, South Korea has agreed to exempt up to 50,000 cars per US manufacturer per year from South Korean safety requirements - double the current number and far higher than any American company currently exports. The country has also agreed to changes such as improvements to its customs procedures and amendments to its drug pricing policies. The agreement also extends a 25% US tariff against South Korean trucks to 2041. It had been scheduled to expire in 2021. Separately, the US agreed to exempt a certain amount of South Korean steel from the 25% tariffs Mr Trump announced in March - equivalent to 70% of the country's average imports from 2015-2017. South Korea and the US are major trade partners, exchanging nearly $155bn in goods and services in 2017.

Gene editing wipes out mosquitoes in lab,"Anopheles gambiae is one of the species responsible for spreading malaria Researchers have used gene editing to completely eliminate populations of mosquitoes in the lab. The team tested their technique on the mosquitoAnopheles gambiae, which transmits malaria. They altered part of a gene called doublesex, which determines whether an individual mosquito develops as a male or as a female. This allowed the Imperial College London scientists to block reproduction in the female mosquitoes. They want to see if the technology could one day be used to control mosquito populations in the wild. Writing in the journal Nature Biotechnology,external, Prof Andrea Crisanti and colleagues report that caged populations ofAnopheles gambiaecollapsed within 7-11 generations. Dr Crisanti said: ""2016 marked the first time in over two decades that malaria cases did not fall year-on-year despite huge efforts and resources, suggesting we need more tools in the fight."" The approach falls within a category of genetic engineering known as a gene drive. It describes technologies that spread a gene or particular suites of genes through a population. The researchers used the gene editing technique known as Crispr to modify a part of the doublesex gene that is responsible for female development. Males who carried the modified gene showed no changes, and neither did female mosquitoes with one copy of the modified gene. However, female insects with two copies of the altered gene showed both male and female characteristics, did not bite and did not lay eggs. As the modified gene - which confers female infertility - spread, the caged populations crashed. However, previous attempts to use this approach in mosquitoes ran into problems: the insects developed resistance to the genetic modification. This occurred because targeted genes developed natural mutations that allowed them to continue functioning, and these mutations were then passed down to offspring. However, the doublesex gene is highly ""conserved"", which means that random mutations are for the most part lethal to the organism. In this way, the scientists were able to sidestep a potential source of resistance. The researchers now want to test the technique on larger populations of mosquitoes confined in more realistic settings, where competition for food and other ecological factors could affect the outcome. Prof Crisanti commented: ""There is still more work to be done, both in terms of testing the technology in larger lab-based studies and working with affected countries to assess the feasibility of such an intervention. ""It will still be at least 5-10 years before we consider testing any mosquitoes with gene drive in the wild, but now we have some encouraging proof that we're on the right path. ""Gene drive solutions have the potential one day to expedite malaria eradication by overcoming the barriers of logistics in resource-poor countries.""

Born in Los Angeles in 1940, Kurtz started out as an assistant director on Ride in the Whirlwind, a 1965 Western starring a pre-stardom Jack Nicholson. After serving in the Marines in Vietnam, he began a collaboration with Lucas that saw him become an early champion of his nascent Star Wars saga. His involvement extended to working as an uncredited assistant director on The Empire Strikes Back, whose title he conceived. Yet his desire to work on other projects saw his partnership with Lucas dissolve and another producer take on Return of the Jedi, the next Star Wars film. The Dark Crystal, a fantasy adventure featuring elaborate puppets, saw him work with Muppets creator Jim Henson. The 1982 film was Bafta-nominated for its special effects. But his next films, 1985's Return to Oz and 1989's Slipstream, were not a success and led to him filing for bankruptcy. In later life Kurtz made appearances in numerous documentaries about the Star Wars series, among them the BBC productionThe Galaxy Britain Built.

Monthly rubbish bin collection launched,"This video can not be played One local said the area was being plagued by flies and maggots Controversial monthly bin collections are being rolled out across a Welsh county on Monday - the first area in Wales and England to make the move. Waste destined for landfill will now only be collected once a month in Conwy countyfollowing a trial. It has been met with controversy, with residents and councillors calling it ""unfair"" and claiming the trial broughtmore rats, seagulls and flies. The council said it could save Â£390,000 a year and concerns had been addressed. It said food waste was collected weekly and it offered a free weekly collection service for nappies and incontinence products - to reduce the smell in residual waste bags. Many parts of the UK are now moving towards bin collections every three weeks in a bid to cut down on residual waste and increase recycling. Two councils in Scotland have made the move to bin collections every four weeks - Fife and Falkirk - and Belfast City Council has included the optionas part of a consultationinto the future of its waste and recycling. All the plastic you can and cannot recycle Should parents pay to bin used nappies? How chewing gum could be recycled into new objects From the outset, the year-long monthly bin collection trial in Conwy county  - brought in for 11,000 homes in in 2016 - caused a stink. Many residents are still unhappy about the changes, and have said the rubbish causes a smell, breeds maggots and attracts mice and rats. Residents claim their bins are often overflowing Some have also admitted to burning their waste in a bid to reduce the amount of rubbish in their bins. ""It's the length of time that's the problem, not the quantity,"" one resident said. ""It festers. It's as simple as that. The whole area is plagued with flies now in the summer. ""We've bought an incinerator so we burn the majority of the rubbish, which is not good for the environment. This video can not be played Homeowners say the four-weekly bin collection pilot has been ""horrendous"" ""But we have animals and they refused to pick up animal waste, so it has to go in black bag. It sits there for a month then."" Families in particular have reported having issues with bins that are too full. ""I think it's dreadful. They should be emptied regularly,"" another resident said. ""It's more than full after two weeks and I burn some of it. You're not supposed to do that, but you have to otherwise the bin is absolutely bursting. ""It is more manageable at three weeks, but I think four weeks is a step too far, especially for families."" The best tip to reduce waste is not to produce it in the first place. Plan what you buy and buy what you plan Get to grips with what your local council recycles - not all recycle the same things Is junk mail a problem for you? De-register yourself from online marketing lists. If you do get junk mail through the door remember to recycle it Think before you throw away an unwanted electrical item. Ask if your friend or family if they want it, sell it or donate to charity Buy a compost bin and make your own compost to enrich your garden and reduce the amount of garden and kitchen waste your throw away Source:Recycle for Wales,external The decision to roll out the four-weekly collections was signed off by the cabinet in January, despite councillors voting toscrap the scheme in November 2017in favour of three-weekly collections. It came despite councillors expressing concern that the county was ""not ready"" for the new system and that more people would struggle with overflowing bins. Blaenau Gwent council recycling letters 'dumped' on hill QUIZ: How rubbish are you at recycling? In response, the cabinet put extra measures in place to help residents recycle, including free collection of large items, free nappy bins for grandparents who look after children and bespoke collections for people who miss having bin collections if they are on holiday. Reports by council officials had previously suggested that four-weekly collections would increase the amount of rubbish that was recycled and also save the council up to Â£390,000 per year. The drive for more recycling is being made across the country, with authorities facing fines if they fail to meet targets. Last year it was announced thata target for 64%of waste to be recycled in Wales by 2019-20 had been met four years early. On itswebsite,external, Conwy council said: ""We currently recycle 64% of our waste, which is really good, but we need to recycle 70% by 2024/25 to meet the Welsh Government's targets. If these targets are not achieved the council may be fined. ""A year long trial of four weekly collections to 10,000 households has led to 14% increase in recycling and 31% decrease in the amount of refuse in the wheelie bins. These items are now being recycled into something new and the food waste is being used to make electricity. As a result of the trial, we are now rolling this out county-wide from September 2018.""

Half a billion stolen in banking scams,"More than Â£500m was stolen from customers of British banks in the first half of 2018, figures have shown. Industry group UK Finance said Â£145m of that was due to authorised push payment (APP) scams, in which people are conned into sending money to another account. But Â£358m was lost to unauthorised fraud, which includes transactions made without account holders' knowledge. Unauthorised fraud victims are usually refunded by their banks, but most victims of APP fraud do not get their money back. This is because current legislation means they are liable for any losses incurred if they authorise a payment themselves. 'I was conned out of Â£13,000' Should banks cover the losses from scams? The new safeguards that could help stop the scams ""Purchase scams"", in which people are duped into paying for products or services that do not exist, were the most prevalent form of APP fraud reported in the first six months of 2018. These scams often happen online, and examples include payments made for cars or holidays that are never delivered or provided. There were also 3,866 reported cases of impersonation scams, in which criminals pretend to be from a financial institution or law enforcement, and trick account holders into transferring money. During the first six months of 2017, APP scams led to Â£101m in losses, but UK Finance said this year's Â£44m increase was partly down to four more banks reporting data. When you transfer money from your bank account, you are asked to enter three pieces of information:  the name of the payee, their account number, and the sort code. However, only the last two are cross-checked by the bank. So putting in the correct name is no guarantee that person will get the money. UK Finance offers the following advice: Never disclose security details, such as your PIN or full banking password Don't assume an email, text or phone call is authentic Don't be rushed - a genuine organisation won't mind waiting Listen to your instincts - you know if something doesn't feel right Stay in control - don't panic and make a decision you'll regret The group's managing director for economic crime, Katy Worobec, said the new figures underlined that fraud was a ""major threat"" to the UK, and added that the ""proceeds go on to fund terrorism, people smuggling and drug trafficking"". Ms Worobec also emphasised that two-thirds of all unauthorised fraud was successfully thwarted by UK financial institutions. But Gareth Shaw, of the consumer group Which?, said the banks' efforts to tackle fraud had been ""woefully insufficient"". APPs were the subject of a ""super-complaint"" made in September 2016 to regulators by Which?, which has been calling for banks to shoulder more responsibility when victims are tricked in this way. ""They have not done enough to protect their customers, who continue to lose life-changing sums of money to ever-more sophisticated crooks,"" Mr Shaw said. But he welcomed plans by the Payments System Regulator to introduce a reimbursement scheme for victims of APP fraud.

Labour: We'll make firms give staff shares,"This video can not be played John McDonnell says the new water firms will have ""unprecedented levels of openness and transparency"". Labour would force all large firms to give workers shares worth up to Â£500 a year each, John McDonnell has said. In his main party conference speech, the shadow chancellor set out plans for ""inclusive ownership funds"". He also announced that the water industry in England would be the first to be re-nationalised under Labour. Existing bosses would be fired and control handed to workers, local councils and customers, with new executives hired on reduced salaries. Simon Jack: Can Labour's plan work? He told Labour delegates: ""There will be unprecedented openness and transparency in how the industry will be managed. ""We are ending the profiteering in dividends, vast executive salaries, and excessive interest payments. ""Surpluses will be reinvested in water infrastructure and staff, or used to reduce bills. Real investment will allow the highest environmental standards."" Ownership of the existing water and sewerage companies would be transferred to new Regional Water Authorities, with day-to-day operational management in the hands of professional management and the wider workforce. Existing shareholders would be compensated with bonds and all staff would be transferred to the same jobs, ""except for senior executives and directors, whose posts will be re-advertised on dramatically reduced salaries capped by our 20:1 pay ratio policy"", Labour sources said. The new authorities would be self-financing, along similar lines to Transport for London, which manages the London Underground, rail and bus services. Labour also plans to nationalise the railways, energy and mail industries. Mr McDonnell also announced: Plans for a new Public and Community Ownership Unit at the Treasury to bring PFI contracts in-house Plans to force companies to ""sign up to the Fair Tax Mark standards, demonstrating transparently that they pay their fair share of taxes"" A new international forum to deal with future economic crises, headed by Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz Plans to give workers in private industry more of a say - and a financial stake - in industry are a key plank of Labour's industrial strategy. Since its conference opened in Liverpool on Sunday, Labour has already announced plans for worker representation on company boards and to make employers provideup to 10 days' paid leave for victims of domestic violence. Under Labour's ""inclusive ownership fund"" proposal, Mr McDonnell said workers would be given a financial stake in their employers and more say over how companies are run. Firms would have to put 1% of their shares into the fund every year up to a maximum of 10%. The amount of share capital available to workers would be capped at Â£500, with the rest - estimated at Â£2.1bn a year by the end of a five-year Parliamentary term - going into a fund to pay for public services and welfare. The scheme would apply to companies with more than 250 workers, although smaller firms could set up inclusive ownership funds if they wanted to. Labour calculates that 40% of the UK's private sector workforce - some 10.7 million people - would initially be covered by the scheme. Dividend payouts would be made at a flat rate to all employees of the firm. The funds would be held and managed collectively, with a bar on selling or trading their shareholdings. The system would be similar to that operated by employee-owned retailer John Lewis. But payments from the fund would be made to individual, eligible employees, Labour sources said. Labour's plans are based on the John Lewis Partnership Workers' fund representatives would have voting rights in companies' decision-making processes in the same way as other shareholders. Labour aides said the creation of the funds would help redress growing inequalities after a decade when average pay has not increased in real terms. But the dividend payments would not be available to state employees - including workers in industries such as water, which Labour hopes to nationalise. Labour sources say the Â£2bn social dividend fund would ensure public sector workers and employees of smaller firms also benefited from what the party calls a ""broadening of ownership in our economy"". By BBC business editor Simon Jack Many companies offer incentives and discounts to employees who wish to build a shareholding over time. That is not the same as taking 10% of the company away from its current owners to stick in a fund for the workers and the government's benefit, which seems to be what the shadow chancellor is proposing. For a start, the workers will not be able to buy and sell the shares - so they won't really ""own"" them in a traditional sense. They will be eligible to receive dividends on the shares up to a value of Â£500 per worker per year. The government gets the rest. The Labour Party reckons this will raise about Â£2bn a year. It could end up much more. Let's take just one company - bumper dividend-payer Shell. Ten percent of its Â£12bn annual dividend comes to Â£1.2bn. If each of its 6,500 UK employees got Â£500 each (totalling Â£3.25m) that leaves Â£1.116bn for the government. That's just from one company - every year. Wow. Read more:Can Labour's shares giveaway work? Mr McDonnell told Labour delegates: ""Workers, who create the wealth of a company, should share in its ownership and, yes, in the returns that it makes. ""We believe it's right that we all share in the benefits that investment produces."" Ahead of the speech, he dismissed claims of an anti-business agenda, telling the BBC that a future Labour government would support the vast majority of ""entrepreneurial and ethical"" British firms to the hilt. But he said those which engaged in aggressive tax avoidance and whose ""standards did not match up to the rest"" could expect a tough response from the government. Carolyn Fairbairn, director general of the CBI, which represents big business in the UK, said Labour was ""wrong to assert that workers will be helped by these proposals in their current form"". She said: ""Their diktat on employee share ownership will only encourage investors to pack their bags and will harm those who can least afford it. If investment falls, so does productivity and pay."" The Conservatives said Labour's proposal was ""yet another tax rise"" that would make it harder for firms to ""take on staff and pay them a good wage"". Jack: Can Labour's shares giveaway work?

Plus-size dance group in Strictly name row,"Dance teacher Teresa Lawrence runs Strictly Curved, which offers dance classes for people with ""fuller figures"" A plus-size dance teacher has been told to rename her business by the BBC. Teresa Lawrence runs Strictly Curved - a dance group ""dedicated to people with curves and a fuller figure"". But after applying to trademark the business name, BBC lawyers asked her to change it, claiming it was too similar to the popular TV dance show, Strictly Come Dancing. A spokesman for the broadcaster said it was concerned members of the public could be ""misled"". Ms Lawrence, 50, has been offering classes in Brentwood and Basildon for the last four weeks and welcomes dancers ranging from size 12 to 30. She has been given until the start of October to drop the Strictly from her business name - or face an expensive court battle. The dance teacher, who is a size 24 herself, said: ""They sent me a letter to say I could not use the name, but I really want to keep it. ""Anything that sounds like Strictly is basically not allowed - they're saying I'm trying to fool people into thinking I'm in association with the BBC or teaching Strictly classes, which I'm clearly not."" Strictly is a huge worldwide success for the BBC Ms Lawrence, who has been teaching dance for 22 years, said the whole thing was ""a bit petty"" but she was keen to appeal to the BBC's ""better nature"". ""I have sent them pictures of my classes so they can see exactly what I am doing and have even invited them to come down,"" she said. ""I know I can't ever be in competition with the BBC but it's more the principle of the thing."" A BBC spokesman said: ""We're fully supportive of someone running dance classes and wish them luck, but it's important the public isn't misled and don't mix up an independent dance business with something endorsed by the BBC.""

Weight Watchers drops 'weight' from name,"Weight Watchers has unveiled a slimmed down version of its name, rebranding itself WW, in what it says marks  ""the next stage of the company's evolution"". The company says the new name reflects its development from focusing on weight loss to overall health and wellness. But the chief executive was unable to explain what the letters WW stood for. Mindy Grossman said they did not stand for Weight Watchers or ""Wellness that Works"", a phrase the company has trade marked, but were simply ""a marque"". ""That marque represents our heritage and history and what we are going forward,"" she said. Ms Grossman, who took the helm just over a year ago, said the firm had been shifting from a focus on just weight loss to its broader remit looking at ""wellness"" over the past two years. ""This is just a next step, a point of validation. Like any brand we have to stay relevant,"" she said. DJ Khaled signs up for Weight Watchers Weight Watchers shares jump on Oprah ad Oprah Winfrey bought a 10% stake in Weight Watchers in 2015 US media personality Oprah Winfrey - who bought a stake in the company in 2015 and works as an ambassador for Weight Watchers - said she had always thought that the company's role in people's lives ""goes far beyond a number on the scale"". Oprah's involvement has seen the firm's share price surge from under $5 each to about $70 currently.Its latest results,externalshow sales rose nearly 18% in the three months to the end of June, with subscribers up by one million from a year earlier to 4.5 million. However, concern that the firm's momentum could be slowing sparked a sharp sell-off in the shares recently. People don't go to Weight Watchers because they want to feel well, they go because they want to lose weight. Taking the name off the tin suggests an embarrassment around that notion -  it's no longer enough just to lust after smaller thighs, now you also need to desire ""wellness"", whatever that means. Of course it's good to be encouraged to exercise and develop healthy eating habits, but a corporate re-brand is a reminder of the profiteering behind your hunger pangs. Weight Watchers offered me kindly support in a peer group setting - and I found its basic mantras helpful - but I'm not sure WW will lead any more people into the promised (size 12) land than its predecessor. During its 55-year history, the firm has focused mainly on weight loss. US business entrepreneur Jean Nidetch, who founded the firm, described herself as a ""formerly fat housewife"". But the new Weight Watchers name comes amid a backlash against the word ""weight"". Earlier this year, Weight Watchers' decision to offer free membership for the summer to teenagers, sparked an outcry from eating disorder groups, with a hashtag #wakeupweightwatchers quickly gaining ground. Meanwhile, social media campaigns such as the #iweigh hashtag have become popular. The campaign,external, started by ""The Good Place"" star Jameela Jamil, encourages others to look beyond their weight, and instead to count other ""measurements"" in their life such as your ""three best friends"" or your ""one loving sister.""  The iweigh Instagram account now has 153,000 followers. Other successful campaigns have encouraged a focus on fitness, rather than appearance. Sport England's campaign called This Girl Can aimed to encourage more women to take up exercise and featured women of all shapes and sizes taking part in a variety of sports. Social media hashtags such as #StrongNotSkinny and #FitNotThin hashtags have also grown in popularity. Weight Watchers' rebranding includes updating its so called Fit points system to encourage subscribers to choose activities which have the biggest impact on health, and a new focus on ""healthy habits"" in its app for those ""who want to build healthy habits without focusing on weight loss"". It has also personalised its online user groups to help members find like-minded people. The rebrand is aimed at broadening its appeal to attract more potential users, but also to encourage subscribers to stay with them long-term. ""The paradox is that everyone is talking about wellness and nobody wants to use [the words] diet or weight, but we're not getting healthier,"" Ms Grossman said. .

Spinal implant 'truly changed my life',"This video can not be played Kelly Thomas learned to walk again after doctors attached an electrical patch to her spinal cord Three patients, all paralysed from the waist down, have been able to walk again after having an electrical patch fitted to their spinal cords. Experts say the device, which is placed below the injury, helps lost signals from the brain reach the leg muscles. US research teams at the University of Louisville and the Mayo Clinic, report the success inNature Medicine,externaland theNew England Journal of Medicine,external. One of the recipients says her life has been transformed by the technology. Kelly Thomas, 23, from Florida, is one of two patients at the University of Louisville who has been helped by the development, which has been combined with months of intense rehabilitation therapy. She said: ""Being a participant in this study truly changed my life, as it has provided me with a hope that I didn't think was possible after my car accident. ""The first day I took steps on my own was an emotional milestone in my recovery that I'll never forget, as one minute I was walking with the trainer's assistance and while they stopped, I continued walking on my own. It's amazing what the human body can accomplish with help from research and technology."" Jeff Marquis can now walk with help from a frame or human support Jeff Marquis, who was injured in a mountain-biking accident, has also benefited. The 35-year-old is now able to walk for himself with support either from a frame or from people on either side of him holding his hands. A third patient, 29-year-old Jered Chinnock, was treated at the Mayo Clinic in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles. He injured his spine in 2013 in a snowmobile accident. Since having the patch fitted he has been able to walk more than 100m with the support of a frame. Jered Chinnock has walked 100m with his frame since using the implant The patch does not repair the damage but circumvents it by stimulating nerves lower down in the spinal cord. This appears to allow signals from the brain to reach the target muscles so the person can voluntarily control their own movements again. When the stimulation was switched off again the conscious movement didn't happen. Neurosurgeon Dr Kendall Lee, who co-led the team from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, said: ""It's very exciting, but still very early in the research stage."" Although there are many unanswered questions, including precisely how it works and who it might help, Dr Lee said: ""It gives hope to people faced with paralysis."" Other scientists have had success in the past withmending spinal damage using cells.

"Russia inquiry chief set for Trump showdownRod Rosenstein, who oversees the Russia inquiry, faces crunch talks at the White House this week.US & Canada","This video can not be played Rod Rosenstein's year under pressure Rod Rosenstein, the US deputy attorney general, is set for crunch talks with Donald Trump on Thursday, amid doubts over his future in the job. The two already spoke on Monday to discuss reports that Mr Rosenstein had talked last year about ousting the president and secretly taping him. Mr Rosenstein oversees the inquiry into alleged collusion by the Trump team with Russia during the 2016 election. The president said Thursday's meeting would be ""determining what's going on"". ""We want to have transparency, we want to have openness and I look forward to meeting with Rod at that time,"" he added, speaking in New York where he is attending the annual UN General Assembly. Chief of Staff John Kelly (left) and Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein (right) had a previously scheduled meeting at the White House on Monday America's second most senior law official was summoned to the White House on Monday amida report that he had verbally resigned,externalto the president's chief of staff in the expectation that he was going to be fired. But White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said afterwards: ""At the request of the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, he and President Trump had an extended conversation to discuss the recent news stories. ""Because the President is at the United Nations General Assembly and has a full schedule with leaders from around the world, they will meet on Thursday when the President returns to Washington DC."" Monday's meeting between Chief of Staff John Kelly and Mr Rosenstein had been previously scheduled, US media later reported. If Mr Rosenstein did lose his job, another Department of Justice official, the solicitor general, would be in line to take over supervision of the Russia investigation. Mr Rosenstein assumed oversight of the inquiry after his boss, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, recused himself when it emerged he had been in contact with Russia's ambassador to Washington while serving as a Trump campaign adviser. The furore around Mr Rosenstein's position comes as mid-term elections are looming on 6 November, when the president's party will try to keep control of the US Congress. This video can not be played The 25th Amendment: Could it be used to unseat Trump? Mr Rosenstein and Mr Trump are believed to have discussed Friday's report in the New York Times that the deputy attorney general had discussed recruiting cabinet members to invoke a US constitutional clause that provides for the removal of a president if deemed unfit for office. According to the newspaper, Mr Rosenstein had also suggested surreptitiously recording the president in order to expose the chaos in the White House. He denied the claims, and a Department of Justice spokesperson told the BBC the secret recording remark was just a joke. The deputy attorney general was said to have made the comments after Mr Trump fired FBI Director James Comey in May 2017. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington If Rod Rosenstein goes, by resignation or firing, the future of Robert Mueller's special counsel investigation would be very much in doubt. Mr Rosenstein is the reason there is a special counsel investigation, and he has given Mr Mueller a wide mandate to pursue that inquiry wherever it may lead. It has resulted, for instance, in the successful prosecution of former Trump campaign chair Paul Manafort and a plea deal from Donald Trump's personal lawyer Michael Cohen - both for activities tangential to the Russia probe. A different person in charge might have nipped those moves in the bud. Whoever took over if Mr Rosenstein departed - at the moment, Solicitor General Noel Francisco - could decide to curtail the scope of the investigation or push for a speedy resolution. At the very least, Mr Francisco would assume the oversight duties knowing full well the president is watching very closely and has no hesitation going on the attack - even against members of his own administration - if he feels in any way slighted or wronged. As Mr Rosenstein will surely attest, it is an unenviable position. From left: Mr Rosenstein, Attorney General Jeff Sessions, and Mr McCabe Mr Trump said over the weekend he had not made up his mind whether to fire the deputy attorney general in the wake of the New York Times report. ""We will make a determination,"" the Republican president told Fox News in the radio interview, which aired on Monday. ""It's certainly a very sad story. ""I haven't gotten all the facts, but certainly it's being looked at in terms of what took place - If anything took place."" Russia-Trump: Who's who? Sean Hannity, a Fox News host and friend of Mr Trump, has urged him to not fire Mr Rosenstein, warning he would fall into a trap laid by his political enemies. Mr Trump has repeatedly referred to the special counsel's Russia investigation as a political witch hunt. Andrew McCabe, the former acting director of the FBI who was fired by Mr Trump in March, said on Monday that he was ""deeply concerned"" about rumours of Mr Rosenstein's departure as it would put the Russia investigation ""at risk"".

Born in Los Angeles in 1940, Kurtz started out as an assistant director on Ride in the Whirlwind, a 1965 Western starring a pre-stardom Jack Nicholson. After serving in the Marines in Vietnam, he began a collaboration with Lucas that saw him become an early champion of his nascent Star Wars saga. His involvement extended to working as an uncredited assistant director on The Empire Strikes Back, whose title he conceived. Yet his desire to work on other projects saw his partnership with Lucas dissolve and another producer take on Return of the Jedi, the next Star Wars film. The Dark Crystal, a fantasy adventure featuring elaborate puppets, saw him work with Muppets creator Jim Henson. The 1982 film was Bafta-nominated for its special effects. But his next films, 1985's Return to Oz and 1989's Slipstream, were not a success and led to him filing for bankruptcy.

It's Harry v Meghan in netball shootout,"This video can not be played It's Meghan v Harry in netball shootout Dancer Ginger Rogers famously did everything her partner Fred Astaire did, but backwards and in high heels. And the Duchess of Sussex seemed to have taken the example to heart when she took on her husband Prince Harry in a netball shootout. Meghan was in stiletto heels for an awards ceremony at Loughborough University in Leicestershire - but still got stuck into a sports session. The royal couple were snapped laughing their way through the on-court contest. The Duke and Duchess clearly enjoyed their sporting face-off Meghan's blue Oscar de la Renta top and Altuzarra trousers made for an unconventional netball ensemble, as did Harry's shirt and suit Prince Harry was also unusually dressed for the netball court Meghan was joined by a roster of sports stars including tennis player Laura Robson, gymnastics coach Scott Hann, and England netballer Eboni Beckford-Chambers - an obvious advantage, you might think. Not to be outdone, Harry's team got a boost from ex-US basketball star David Robinson, as well as marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe, former England cricketer (and Strictly Come Dancing champion) Mark Ramprakash, and ex-England rugby player Ugo Monye.

Second murder arrest over missing student,"Thomas Jones' disappearance was said to be ""extremely out of character"" A second man has been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with a missing university student. Thomas Jones, 18, from Bromsgrove has not been heard from since the early hours of Wednesday morning. A 20-year-old from Worcester is in police custody along with another man, also aged 20. Prior to the second arrest West Mercia Police shared CCTV images, of two men they wanted to speak to, recorded at the city's Velvet nightclub. Both men were arrested on Sunday. The force said it believed Mr Jones had crossed the Sabrina footbridge, which crosses the River Severn near to Worcester Racecourse, and then walked on to the footpath that runs along the top of the flood defences on Hylton Road in the direction of Hallow, just before 03:50 BST. Supt Damian Pettit said: ""We are continuing the investigation with a number of lines of inquiry and will keep the community updated with developments in our continued investigation. ""Thomas' family has been made aware of the updates and they are being supported by specially trained officers."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands The missing teenager's family believe he may have crossed over Sabrina Bridge As searches are ongoing, police have asked people to ""kindly stay away"" from the area to allow officers and divers to work ""without distraction"". They said there had been an ""unprecedented response"" to the case, with hundreds of volunteers supporting the investigation. Mr Jones was embarking on a primary teaching course at the University of Worcester and had only moved to the city on 16 September. His aunt, Jackie Rogers, said a ""small army"" was carrying out house-to-house inquiries in and around Hylton Road and was determined to ""find our boy"". Mrs Rogers said the teenager sent a Facebook message to a friend at 03:46, but no-one had heard from him since. Mr Jones was believed to have been wearing pale-coloured jeans, a navy blue, woollen zip-up Lacoste top and green shoes at the time of his disappearance. Appeals for information have also been made by West Bromwich Albion Football Club, where Mr Jones was a season ticket holder. Aston Villa FC have also publicised the search for him.

Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan,"Pet owners who want to take their animals to the EU face having to make plans at least four months in advance if there is no Brexit deal. This worst-case scenario isset out,externalin the latest batch of government papers about planning for leaving the EU without a deal in place. Currently pets can travel with their owners throughout the EU thanks to the pet passport scheme. But without a Brexit deal, the UK will become a ""third country"". Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit Reality Check: Are pet passports under threat? May's cabinet 'fully behind' Brexit plan Brexit: What happens next? At the moment people can take their dogs, cats or ferrets from the UK to the EU and back again without quarantine using a pet passport, for which the animals need a rabies vaccination and a microchip. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has previously said ""the ability... of dogs and cats to cross the Channel"" will be affected if the UK leaves the EU without a deal - a scenario both sides say they are keen to avoid. According to the government's advice for pet-owners, the scale of checks required in a no-deal scenario will depend on which category the UK falls into. BBC Reality Check These no-deal notices will make uncomfortable reading for many businesses and consumers, but also for the government. In dry, technical language they make clear that many aspects of day-to-day life could be affected significantly if the UK leaves the EU with no deal at all. These include air and coach travel (which could in theory come to a temporary halt), food labelling, driving in Europe for business or pleasure, and taking your pet across the Channel. The government argues that these warnings represent contingency planning for a worst case scenario, but until they can guarantee that a deal will be done, preparations will have to be made. And with time running out, people will have to start acting on some of the advice as soon as November. The prospect of a no-deal Brexit is beginning to loom large. The government said it was pressing to become a ""listed"" third country when the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, which it says would avoid ""burdensome"" changes to requirements. But if it becomes an ""unlisted"" third country, pet-owners wanting to travel with their animals to EU countries would need to discuss this with a certified ""Official Veterinarian"" at least four months in advance. They would need to prove their pets were free of rabies - which could involve a vaccination followed by at least a 30-day wait before a subsequent blood test, which itself is then followed by a three-month waiting period before travel. The government says it believes reaching a deal with the EU is the most likely outcome but that it is its ""duty as a responsible government"" to prepare for the failure to reach one. The latest batch of 24 no-deal papers also includes warnings that airline passengers could facedisruption, coach travel to the EU could be suspended and UK residents may not be able to access online services like Netflix while on European holidays.

May's cabinet 'fully behind' Brexit planNo 10 says ministers are united amid pressure on her to do a U-turn and back Canada-style trade deal.UK PoliticsComments,"The cabinet remains fully behind Theresa May's Brexit policy in the face of growing calls within her party to change direction, No 10 has insisted. The prime minister is sticking by her Chequers plan for future co-operation despite European leaders attacking it. She met senior ministers as pressure grows on her to ditch it in favour of a Canada-style trade accord. Meanwhile, ministers have warned of the risk of disruption to flights in the event of the UK leaving without a deal. Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan The two sides are seeking to negotiate the terms of exit as well as an outline agreement on future co-operation, over the next month or so. But the talks hit the rocks on Thursday when EU leaders dismissed the basis of the PM's plan - a free trade zone and common rule book for goods with greater divergence for services - as ""unworkable"". At a cabinet meeting earlier, Mrs May defended her strategy following calls from leading Brexiteers in her party to keep the option of a Canada-style arrangement on the table as talks enter a crucial phase. Afterwards, Downing Street said she had told ministers hers was the ""only plan on the table"" that secured the ""frictionless trade"" needed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This video can not be played Theresa May: ""There's a plan on the table from us. If they have issues with it, let's hear what those issues are."" Mrs May also defended her Brexit trade plans to the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, who she hosted in Downing Street. The prime minister also told him the UK would guarantee the rights of the three million EU citizens living in the UK even if it leaves without a deal. Mr Verhofstadt described their meeting as an ""open an honest exchange"". The government has now published 77 technical notices designed to prepare business and inform the public about what could happen in the ""unlikely"" event of the UK leaving without a deal. The latest batch included warnings on aviation, pet transport and coach travel. Labour keeps option of fresh Brexit vote Brexit: What happens next?

Please upgrade your browser Former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said proposals put forward bythe Institute for Economic Affairs on Monday,externalshowed there was an alternative to ending up as a vassal state with ""colony status"" through the Chequers route. The IEA, a free market think-tank, said Mrs May should change tack and pursue an advanced free trade agreement with the EU, with full reciprocal market access, no tariffs in goods including agriculture and maximum recognition of regulatory standards. It said new customs processes had to be put in place that could handle a potential five-fold increase in declarations after Brexit, using enhanced technology and information sharing to separate the movement of goods from the processing of forms for as many traders as possible. What is the so-called Canada option? It is based on Canada's free trade deal with the EU, called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement or Ceta, which was agreed in 2016 after seven years of negotiations. The deal eliminates most trade tariffs on goods and gives Canadian firms preferential access to EU markets without them having to automatically sign up to EU regulations It does not include some food items, including eggs and chicken, while services are only partially covered. Brexiteers want a ""Plus, Plus"" version of the deal addressing these areas. It is strictly a trade deal - so the UK would still have to reach new arrangements with the EU in other areas, such as security. Read more: Is Canada a good model for the UK? Concerns over the Irish border could be ""solved"", the IEA argued, by bespoke technical solutions, including trusted trader schemes and streamlined procedures for small businesses. Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan Mr Johnson said the IEA blueprint would allow the UK to ""do a big free trade agreement with the EU but also to do free trade deals around the world"" while Jacob Rees-Mogg said it could win the backing of the EU, Parliament and also ""public opinion"". But former education secretary Nicky Morgan, who favours closer links with the EU after Brexit, said a Canada-style deal would take years to negotiate and might not give the kind of access its supporters hoped for. Mrs Morgan told Conservative Home,externalthat the fallback option was for the UK to rejoin the European Free Trade Association, the so-called Norway option which would give the UK preferential market access although it would be required to accept EU rules, including on freedom of movement. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the cabinet had had a ""good, healthy discussion"" and ministers would continue to press the EU on some of the criticisms it had made. ""Of course we respect different views across the board but we're not going to suddenly throw up our hands in despair because we've had a bump in the road in these negotiations,"" he said.

Scandal a 'criminal cover-up',"This video can not be played Burnham: 'I want to refocus everybody on giving victims what they've never had - the truth' A ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" took place over the use of NHS contaminated blood products in the 1970s and 1980s, former Health Secretary Andy Burnham has claimed. More than 2,000 deaths have been linked to the scandal in which haemophiliacs and others were infected with hepatitis C and HIV from imported blood products. Speaking in the Commons, the Labour MP said victims were ""guinea pigs"". Health minister Nicola Blackwood resisted calls for a fresh inquiry. She said thousands of documents had been released by the Department of Health in relation to the scandal, while two reviews had already been carried out. In 2015, the then Prime Minster David Cameronapologised to thousands of victimsof the contaminated blood scandal. Aparliamentary reporthad found around 7,500 patients were infected by imported blood products - contracting hepatitis C and HIV - the virus that can develop into Aids. The UK imported supplies of the clotting agent Factor VIII - some of which turned out to be infected. Much of the plasma used to make Factor VIII came from donors like prison inmates in the US, who sold their blood. More than 2,000 UK patients have since died as a result. Now Mr Burnham is calling for a public ""Hillsborough-style inquiry"" - echoing calls already made by the Haemophilia Society and victims' families. In what was his final speech in the Commons - having announcedhe will not standin the upcoming election - the MP for Leigh outlined evidence that he claimed amounted to ""deliberate, provable acts of cover-up"". He gave examples of inappropriate treatment given to patients, tests being done on people without their knowledge or consent, and results from such tests being withheld for several years. He labelled these ""criminal acts"", and compared campaigning by relatives of infected people to the efforts by families of Liverpool football fans crushed to death in the Hillsborough stadium disaster in 1989. He said both cases ""resulted in appalling negligence from public bodies"" and involved ""an orchestrated campaign to prevent the truth from being told"". Mr Burnham told the Commons he will take his claims to the police if a new inquiry is not established before Parliament breaks for its summer recess in July. WATCH: The three brothers killed in a blood scandal Victims of contaminated NHS blood launch legal case Speaking during the adjournment debate, Mr Burnham cited the cases of three victims. One of those was haemophiliac Ken Bullock, infected with non-A, non-B hepatitis, who died in 1998. His widow said that in December 1983, her husband's medical notes changed to suggest he was ""a clinical alcoholic"". Mr Burnham told MPs this accusation escalated over the next 15 years, with Mr Bullock unaware of the ""appalling"" claims. Mr Bullock was possibly refused a liver transplant based on his falsified medical records saying he was an alcoholic, Mr Burnham said. The MP later mentioned two documents, including a 1975 letter from Stanford University's medical centre warning the source blood is ""100% is from skid row derelicts"". Last year, the UK government launcheda consultationon the money available to to those affected by the scandal. As a result, the government announced that victims in England with stage 1 Hepatitis C would receive Â£3,500 a year, with the provision to appeal for a higher payment close to the Â£15,000 received by HIV patients who received toxic blood. It also announced it will fund payment for the bereaved partner or spouse of individuals infected with Hepatitis C and/or HIV as a result of receiving NHS-supplied blood products.

'It tore my family apart',"This video can not be played Brothers David, Vincent and Barry all died as a result of blood contamination Thousands of people with haemophilia were infected with HIV and hepatitis as a result of NHS treatments in the 1970s and 80s. But their families are still seeking a public inquiry into the scandal. Tony Farrugia was just 14-years-old when his father Barry died of Aids. Over the next 20 years, two of his four uncles would also die in what was perhaps the worst treatment scandal in the NHS's history. In the 1970s and 80s, thousands of haemophiliacs - like members of Tony's family - were treated with contaminated blood products. Some 4,670 of them were later diagnosed with hepatitis C, while around 1,200 also contracted HIV. Many did not live long enough to be treated with modern drugs. Thirty years later, the survivors and their relatives have told theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethey are still fighting for answers. Some are worried that a new support scheme planned by the government could leave them struggling to pay mortgages and bills. Tony's father Barry was diagnosed with haemophilia - a genetic condition that prevents blood from clotting - as a baby. It took Tony almost 25 years to get hold of his father's medical records after his death. They show that Barry was a mild haemophiliac, whose symptoms could have been managed. He might not have needed to be treated with the blood clotting agent Factor VIII - the cause of the contamination - but it was prescribed anyway. The result was that he was infected with hepatitis B in the late 70s and then with HIV as early as 1980. Entries in the records show that doctors were aware he might have had the virus two years before he was finally told. By 1985, Barry's health had declined rapidly. Tony, then a teenager, was sent away to live with other family members but the new living arrangements did not work out and he was eventually placed in care. In the summer of 1986, he visited his father in hospital for the final time. Barry contracted hepatitis B and Aids ""He started to lose weight by then,"" Tony recalls, ""a lot of weight - so he was really, really skinny."" ""I remember my dad asking me for some of my ice cream. I handed it to him, at which point one of the nurses intervened and said 'you can't give him that'. ""He had blisters in his mouth which were bleeding. I couldn't share an ice cream with my dad because they had given him Aids,"" he says. Barry's death in September 1986 split the family apart. Tony went back into care in Luton while his twin brother David went to a separate care home in North London. His older teenage brothers were left to fend for themselves. It was not until 2010 that he was reunited with other members of his family. ""That was the first time since dad died that we were together again,"" Tony says. ""That's what the [health service] did, they destroyed my dad with these viruses then they watched his family crumble."" In the years after Barry's death the family continued to struggle. One of Barry's brothers, Vincent, was killed by Aids passed on through contaminated blood. In 2012, another brother, David, died suddenly of a brain haemorrhage linked to the hepatitis C he had contracted through Factor VIII. Madeline, David's widow, says the contaminated blood scandal has caused ""devastation"" to her family. ""I can put my hand on my heart and tell you I am not the same person [since David's death]. I will never be the same person,"" she said. ""It comes back to haunt you in so many ways."" Barry died in September 1986 Madeline says the doctors who prescribed Factor VIII ""never, ever"" told them there was a risk of blood contamination. Angie, Barry's sister, adds: ""Treatment shouldn't kill you, should it? Medical treatment shouldn't kill you."" The family say they also had to live with the stigma that surrounded Aids in the 1980s. On one occasion, Vincent had ""Aids scum"" scratched into his car. When he walked into his local cafe one day, everyone else got up and walked out. ""It was awful - awful - to see this happen to a person,"" Angie said. The family are still looking for answers as to why their relatives died and have called for a public inquiry. ""All we are after is recognition for the harm which was done. We still haven't got the truth and they haven't given us all the answers,"" says Tony. ""The government can't learn lessons until they face up to what they have done."" Thousands of people in the UK were infected when they were treated with imported blood products in the 1970s and 80s There have been two previous inquiries. One was privately funded from donations and could not force health officials or ministers to testify. The other only looked at a small number of Scottish victims and did not have the power to summon witnesses from England. The Haemophilia Society is now calling for a full public inquiry into the scandal, something the government has so far ruled out. Victims and their families are also worried that a new financial support scheme currently being planned could leave some worse off. Under the proposals, a widow of a haemophiliac who died from Aids in England will receive a one-off sum of Â£10,000, compared to a lifetime payment of Â£27,750 a year in Scotland. A new Welsh scheme announced this month is also significantly more generous than in England and Northern Ireland. ""The whole thing is a shambles, it's shameful,"" says Sue Threakall, of the campaign group Tainted Blood. ""These are payments which people rely on to pay their mortgages, pay rent and feed their families."" The government says it has doubled the amount it is spending on support payments to those affected since 2015. ""This is significantly more than any previous government has provided for those affected by this tragedy,"" a spokesman for the Department of Health said. ""We will continue to listen and are currently consulting on new measures to extend the group of individuals who benefit from higher annual payments.""

Bodyguard most watched BBC drama in 10 years,"The Bodyguard finale saw David Budd (Richard Madden) bloodied but not bowed Hit BBC drama Bodyguard kept an average 10.4 million viewers on tenterhooks as the series drew to a close on Sunday.

The overnight ratings make the show - the brainchild of Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio - the most watched drama of the year so far. In fact, it is the biggest overnight drama figure since 10.5 million saw Downton Abbey's series two finale in November 2011. Allow Instagram content?

Unanswered questions from Bodyguard No BBC drama has drawn a bigger audience since Doctor Who, whose Christmas Day episode in 2008 was seen by 11.7 million people. The most watched programme of 2018 so far is ITV's broadcast of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia, which drew an average audience of 24.3 million. That figure did not take into account the number of people watching in pubs or on outdoor big screens. On the iPlayer, episode one of The Bodyguard had received 7.3m requests by Monday lunchtime, a record for any programme on the BBC's catch-up service. The series finale helped drive BBC iPlayer's biggest day ever with over 12.6m requests on Sunday. Without giving anything away, it's fair to say the Bodyguard finale served up a big helping of shock and suspense. Writer Jed Mercurio told the BBC he was ""humbled, delighted and grateful"" at the show's success and credited ""the magnetism of the leads"". He added: ""I don't think you can plan for success, all you can do is create something you think people will be interested in."" On talk of a second series, he said: ""We're just starting those talks, it's still too early to say."" Star Richard Madden - who played the show's ex-soldier turned protection officer David Budd - retweeted a thank you from the BBC to everyone who was watching the ""epic finale"". Anjli Mohindra, who played suicide bomber Nadia, praised Mercurio for putting so many female actors in powerful roles in the show. ""I do believe Jed Mercurio wrote a list of those roles as gender neutral and the right person with the right energy got the job,"" she told the BBC. This video can not be played Bodyguard actor Ash Tandon, who played DCI Sharma, on whether the series will return Director John Strickland had whipped up fans ahead of the broadcast by tweeting lyrics from Frank Sinatra's My Way. He posted: ""For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels. ""The record shows he took the blows and did it his way."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Laxative sales could be restricted,"The government is considering imposing stricter regulations on the sale of laxatives amid concerns they could be abused by people with eating disorders. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency will examine measures such as age limits on purchasers and possibly ending over-the-counter sales. Experts,externalsay available evidence suggests more than half of patients with eating disorders have misused them. Laxatives should never be used for weight control. Medical professionals warn that laxative abuse can cause diarrhoea, dehydration and imbalances that can lead to kidney failure. But currently, unlimited quantities of laxatives can be bought without a prescription from pharmacies and supermarkets. Rebecca Wojturska, 29 and from Fife, Scotland, says she bought and used laxatives for four years. ""I was 19 when I first took them. My doctor had prescribed them as a two week course, but then I started buying them for myself. I was spending quite a lot of money every week on them. ""I had an eating disorder and it was for about four years that I was abusing them."" She welcomes the idea of more safeguards, as does Rebecca Field, a spokeswoman for eating-disorders charity Beat: ""Just as painkillers are regulated to prevent people overusing them and harming their own health, there should be restrictions on the availability of laxatives. ""It is vital that people are aware of the dangers of abusing laxatives and there should be more education on their effects. ""Doctors and pharmacists should also be made aware that overuse of laxatives is one of the signs of an eating disorder, so that they are able to intervene and ensure sufferers get treatment."" The MHRA says its UK-wide review will take ""some months"". A spokesperson said: ""We are reviewing the safety of stimulant laxatives following concerns about the potential for abuse and misuse and considering how regulatory measures can best support their correct use, in line with current clinical guidance. ""All medicines, including those bought over-the-counter, must be used responsibly and as advised in the information provided with the medicine. ""Patient safety is our highest priority and we work to make sure the benefits of medicines outweigh the risks. This includes assessing whether regulatory action is needed to minimise the potential for abuse.""

Labour keeps option of fresh Brexit vote,"Labour's Brexit spokesman has insisted the party could back another referendum that offered voters the chance to stay in the EU. Sir Keir Starmer said the party was ""certainly not ruling out"" such a move. He was speaking after shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he thought any vote should be on the terms of a Brexit deal rather than staying in the EU. Mr McDonnell later said ""all options"" were on the table if it came to another referendum. Kuenssberg: Labour's conference '360' Labour: We'll make firms give staff shares Labour plans to give tenants more power Labour vows to end free schools programme On Tuesday, Labour's conference in Liverpool will debate and vote on a motion to keep a new referendum ""on the table"" if Labour is unable to force a general election. Key delegates - including Sir Keir and leading figures from some trade unions - decided the text at a meeting which lasted several hours on Sunday evening. The final draft for the vote says: ""If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote."" Since the draft was finalised, key figures have faced questions on whether it will include the option to stay in the EU. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr McDonnell said that Labour would continue to respect the 2016 referendum, in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union, adding: ""If we are going to respect the referendum it will be about the deal."" And he said a general election was needed so a Labour government could strike a Brexit deal with the EU which ""brings the country together"". But later, Sir Keir told the BBC the party was deliberately not being ""prescriptive"" about the question that could be posed in another referendum, saying it was ""certainly not ruling out"" the option to stay in the EU. Backbench MP David Lammy, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, said it would be ""farcical"" to have a vote without the option of remaining in the EU. This video can not be played Labour conference: what do party members want? After the late-night meeting on Sunday night, a Labour source told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""There was consensus in the room opposing the Tories' chaotic approach to the Brexit negotiations... and that a general election should be called as soon as any deal is voted down by parliament. ""It was then agreed that if we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote."" The Labour Party has never formally rejected the option of a so-called people's vote on Brexit, but both Mr Corbyn and his deputy, Tom Watson, have indicated they would prefer it to be resolved by a general election. On Twitter, Prime Minister Theresa May said Labour's approach sought to ""Britain back to square one - betraying all those who voted in the 2016 EU referendum"". By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent After what I am told was six re-drafts and five and a half hours of discussion, wording that could bridge the gap between campaigners for a new referendum and a reluctant leadership was agreed. But what was left out of the conference motion is as important as what went in. The leadership had to agree that wording which restricted a future referendum to ""the terms of Brexit"" had to go. This means that the party could, in theory, back a referendum that gave voters the option of remaining in the EU and not just a vote on the final deal. Campaigners for a new vote see this as significant step forward. But allies of Jeremy Corbyn say the wording doesn't commit him to backing a referendum as it is still only ""an option on the table"" if Theresa May refuses calls for a general election. So still a fudge of sorts - but one with a slightly sweeter taste for supporters of a new vote who firmly believe that ""all options"" will become their option. However, even the hint of a new referendum will allow the Conservatives to claim that Labour weren't serious enough about respecting the previous one. Pressed on the issue on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Corbyn, who has said he is not calling for another referendum, said ""our preference"" is for a general election. He said that would then allow a Labour government to negotiate the UK's future relationship with Europe. ""Let's see what comes out of conference. Obviously I'm bound by the democracy of our party,"" he added. This video can not be played David Lammy: ""Can you hear us Jeremy Corbyn?"" Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab ruled out a snap election this autumn, saying the idea was ""for the birds"". The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and Theresa May has been negotiating with other EU leaders on the UK's future relationship with the bloc. Allow Twitter content?

Talks hit a stumbling block at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday when EU leaders rejected Mrs May's plan for Brexit - known as theChequers agreement,external, and she warned them she was ready to walk away rather than accept a ""bad deal"". By Newsnight political editor Nick Watt The wrangling has led to much soul searching in the new Labour movement taking shape under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The Momentum group, established to shore up his leadership at the grassroots, has been torn between pro-European instincts and loyalty to Corbyn. He is heir to the Bennite tradition which regards the founding principles of the EU as anathema to Socialism. Momentum was thinking of taking a neutral position had the motion been difficult for Jeremy Corbyn. One Momentum source told me that, while the organisation is strongly pro-European, it would do nothing to jeopardise its main goal; the election of a truly Socialist government. The People's Vote campaign are reasonably content. They know their greatest weakness in Liverpool is they are seen as a bunch of unreconstructed Blairites seeking to thwart the will of the people on the EU and undermine Corbyn in the bargain. The campaign believe they have shown they have far wider support. They hope to have created a space in November for Labour to be able to endorse a referendum on the grounds that warring Conservative MPs agree on one thing - there must be no general election before 2022.

'I lost my whole life to infected blood scandal',"This video can not be played ""I hope I'm still alive when this ends"" Emotional testimonies from people infected with HIV and hepatitis have been heard at the start of the inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. The public inquiry is looking at how thousands of NHS patients were given infected blood products during the 1970s and 1980s in what has been dubbed the worst-ever NHS treatment disaster. In a video played to the inquiry, one man described how he felt he lost his entire life after finding out at the age of 43 that he had been infected with hepatitis C when he was a child. He was given an injection of blood products when he was eight for a swollen knee that was misdiagnosed as haemophilia. ""I lost everything. I lost my whole life the day I found out - everything ended,"" he explained. 'I don't want him to have died in vain' Both my husbands died from scandal 'I gave birth, and got Hepatitis C' With her identity hidden, one woman said she became infected with HIV through her husband who was a haemophiliac, and who had been given contaminated blood. She said when they found out they were left stunned and devastated. ""This was the mid-1980s and the climate of fear, discrimination and stigma associated with HIV and Aids was horrendous,"" she added. ""We coped the best we could. We were silenced, and we kept quiet."" Another victim, a widow, whose husband John died of Aids in 1994 and who also had hepatitis C, said: ""I feel we have been treated very badly. Nobody has listened to us over the years."" There have been previous inquiries into the scandal, but this is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up. This video can not be played Barbara, wife of one of the contaminated blood victims, says the inquiry is ""too little, too late"" About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years - nearly 3,000 of them have since died. This was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a new treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US. But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors, and concentrating it. People who underwent blood transfusions were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. Steve Dymond is now in his early 60s. He initially had only mild symptoms of haemophilia and led an active life. During the 1980s his health began to suffer. His muscles were sore, his joints ached and he was always exhausted. After going to hospital following a minor hand injury in the mid-1980s, he was told he had been treated with Factor VIII that had not been heat-treated. The concern was that he may have been exposed to HIV. At the time it took 18 months to get a diagnosis - a wait that his wife Su Gorman said put their lives on hold. He was given the all-clear, but in the 1990s was diagnosed with hepatitis C. He is now clear of hepatitis C, although his health has continued to suffer. Two years ago he suffered a near-fatal stomach bleed, has suffered hearing loss and has a damaged liver, leaving him at risk of cancer. He said people have been ""betrayed and lied to"" throughout, with the government, health professionals and drug companies all guilty of trying to avoid responsibility. ""It is difficult to try to imagine - even though there is a public inquiry - how they will be able to get past these walls of obfuscation,"" said Mr Dymond. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels. There have been previous inquiries. One was led by Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell and was privately funded. It held no official status and was unable to force witnesses to testify or force the disclosure of documents. Meanwhile, the Penrose Inquiry, a seven-year investigation launched by the government in Scotland, was criticised as a whitewash when it was published in 2015. Greater Manchester mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a probe into what happened. Mr Burnham said he was prepared to approach the police about the issue Mr Burnham claimed in the House of Commons last year that a ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" had taken place. The government announced there would be an inquiry only after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion. The inquiry could last more than two years. Payments have been made to some of the people who were infected - the first fund was set up as long ago as 1989. But if the new inquiry finds culpability, it opens the door to victims seeking large compensation payouts through the courts. Retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, who is leading the inquiry, said it marked the start of something which several people had campaigned for over many years. He said there had already been more than 100,000 documents submitted, with the prospect of lots more to come. Speaking at the start of the inquiry, he said if the campaigners were right there was a ""real chance"" the numbers affected could rise as there would be people out there who did not yet know they had been infected. ""It is a truly sobering thought,"" he added. Liz Carroll, chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, called on the inquiry to work diligently to ""uncover the truth, bring justice and ultimately closure for victims and their families"". ""This scandal devastated generations of people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders. ""Our members have waited decades for this to be properly investigated.""

The prime minister is sticking by her Chequers plan for future co-operation despite European leaders attacking it. She met senior ministers as pressure grows on her to ditch it in favour of a Canada-style trade accord. Meanwhile, ministers have warned of the risk of disruption to flights in the event of the UK leaving without a deal. Flights 'at risk' under no-deal Brexit Pet travel warning in no-deal Brexit plan The two sides are seeking to negotiate the terms of exit as well as an outline agreement on future co-operation, over the next month or so. But the talks hit the rocks on Thursday when EU leaders dismissed the basis of the PM's plan - a free trade zone and common rule book for goods with greater divergence for services - as ""unworkable"". At a cabinet meeting earlier, Mrs May defended her strategy following calls from leading Brexiteers in her party to keep the option of a Canada-style arrangement on the table as talks enter a crucial phase. Afterwards, Downing Street said she had told ministers hers was the ""only plan on the table"" that secured the ""frictionless trade"" needed to avoid a hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland.

Mrs May also defended her Brexit trade plans to the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator Guy Verhofstadt, who she hosted in Downing Street. The prime minister also told him the UK would guarantee the rights of the three million EU citizens living in the UK even if it leaves without a deal. Mr Verhofstadt described their meeting as an ""open an honest exchange"". The government has now published 77 technical notices designed to prepare business and inform the public about what could happen in the ""unlikely"" event of the UK leaving without a deal.

The IEA, a free market think-tank, said Mrs May should change tack and pursue an advanced free trade agreement with the EU, with full reciprocal market access, no tariffs in goods including agriculture and maximum recognition of regulatory standards. It said new customs processes had to be put in place that could handle a potential five-fold increase in declarations after Brexit, using enhanced technology and information sharing to separate the movement of goods from the processing of forms for as many traders as possible. What is the so-called Canada option? It is based on Canada's free trade deal with the EU, called the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement or Ceta, which was agreed in 2016 after seven years of negotiations. The deal eliminates most trade tariffs on goods and gives Canadian firms preferential access to EU markets without them having to automatically sign up to EU regulations It does not include some food items, including eggs and chicken, while services are only partially covered. Brexiteers want a ""Plus, Plus"" version of the deal addressing these areas. It is strictly a trade deal - so the UK would still have to reach new arrangements with the EU in other areas, such as security. Read more: Is Canada a good model for the UK?

Kuenssberg: Labour's debate,"By the time you read this, Labour delegates might have decided what to do. Or perhaps not. Their meetings have form. They've been discussing how to find a decent compromise on a Brexit vote at conference since 18:30 BST. These are issues that have been running hot for months and months, and I am writing this five hours later. What are they arguing about? A significant chunk - polling suggests a hefty majority of members - of the party would like to see another vote on the European Union, with the party's leanings overwhelmingly towards Remain. Jeremy Corbyn vowed he would be a different kind of leader and listen to his party's membership. So what's the problem? Surely he should just say ""sure"", and acquiesce? Guess what, it's not nearly so simple. First, repeat again and again, any party's members are not the same as their voters, and potential voters. That's always so. But it is clear as day now. Because while Labour MPs and members are overwhelmingly among those who voted Remain, millions of people who had voted Labour put their cross in the Leave box. To campaign immediately for another EU referendum risks infuriating huge swathes of voters, and opens Labour up to accusations from their opponents that they are insulting voters and ignoring democracy. The second reason why another referendum is only being reluctantly considered is that it's not clear how you actually get there. Referendums need legislation. They then need a Parliamentary process to decide questions. If there were to be a vote, should it be on the terms of a deal or no deal, or reopen the whole question of staying or leaving? Should it be straight away? Is it possible to do in the time given that we are due to be leaving the EU in about six months. Why does Labour think it would be able to get a better deal than the Tories in any case? Those campaigning for the vote of course say they have answers to those questions. But many senior figures aren't convinced. One member of the shadow cabinet, frustrated, said it's not realistic to see how it could happen, and the People's Vote campaign is just like ""praying for a fairy godmother"". Another told me ""it's just a distraction"", and could even give Theresa May a way out if she ends up completely stuck. They believe the party has to be ""resolute"", and keep pushing, pushing and pushing for a general election instead. Neither of those are in the party's gift. But even theoretical choices matter in a time of such political turmoil. And it's an interesting test for a leader who transformed his party based on the promise of giving members more say. By the early hours, the leadership may have given party members some, but not all of what they want - a compromise motion that will give the party a chance to commit to some kind of vote. It won't be as explicit as some want. But remember last year the debate was not even fully permitted on the conference floor. Jeremy Corbyn's supporters were reluctant to allow any divisions to be displayed. So, however vague the compromise, however late tonight's discussions go, those who've been pushing the party to commit to another referendum for months are encouraged just to have got this far.

Trump backs court nominee 'all the way',"This video can not be played Brett Kavanaugh: ""I've never sexually assaulted anyone"" US President Donald Trump's nominee for the Supreme Court says he will not pull out because of ""false accusations"". Brett Kavanaugh rejected allegations of sexual misconduct levelled against him by two women, telling Fox News he had ""never sexually assaulted anyone"". The judge and one of his accusers are due to testify publicly on Thursday. Judge Kavanaugh's confirmation would tilt the US top court in favour of conservatives for years to come, marking a major victory for Mr Trump. His first accuser, Christine Blasey Ford, will give evidence to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday, followed by rebuttal testimony from Judge Kavanaugh. She alleges he drunkenly tried to remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a high school party when she was 15 and he was 17. And on Sunday, a former Yale University classmate said Mr Kavanaugh once exposed himself to her at a party. Judge Kavanaugh appeared on conservative-leaning Fox News alongside his wife, Ashley, on Monday night, as Republicans fought to keep his nomination on track. ""I'm not going to let false accusations drive us out of this process,"" Judge Kavanaugh said in an interview with Martha MacCallum. He strongly denied the latest allegation saying he ""never sexually assaulted anyone, in high school or otherwise"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We're looking for a fair process where I can be heard defending my integrity, my lifelong record of promoting dignity and equality for women - starting with the women who knew me when I was 14 years old,"" Judge Kavanaugh told Fox News. #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford The truth about false assault accusations Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? ""I'm not questioning and have not questioned that perhaps Dr Ford at some point in her life was sexually assaulted by someone in some place, but what I know is I've never sexually assaulted anyone."" He added he was a virgin for ""many years"" after leaving high school. On Sunday, Deborah Ramirez, a Yale university classmate of Judge Kavanaugh,told the New Yorker,externalthat he had exposed himself to her at a dormitory party in the early 1980s. ""I remember a penis being in front of my face,"" she said. ""I knew that's not what I wanted, even in that state of mind."" Ms Ramirez, 53, said she ended up touching the man's genitals while attempting to push him away. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out She says she remembers Brett Kavanaugh standing next to her and laughing as he pulled up his pants. The article says Ms Ramirez acknowledges gaps in her memory caused by alcohol that night. The New York Times said it had been unable to corroborate her story, despite ""several dozen"" interviews. This video can not be played Kavanaugh protesters arrested on Capitol Hill Aformer roommate of the judge at Yale, James Roche, has issued a statement,externallargely supporting Ms Ramirez. Mr Roche said he had become close friends with her at Yale. Even though he did not observe the incident she described, he believed Ms Ramirez to be ""unusually honest and straightforward"" and could not imagine she had made the story up. Michael Avenatti, a US lawyer known for representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her cases against President Trump, told reporters he is representing a third woman with ""credible information"" about sexual misconduct allegations against Judge Kavanaugh. He said he expected his client to come forward with her claims against Judge Kavanaugh within 48 hours. Speaking at the United Nations in New York on Monday, Mr Trump said Judge Kavanaugh's accusers had come ""out of the woodwork"" to make ""highly unsubstantiated"" and ""totally political"" allegations. ""There's a chance this could be one of the single most unfair, unjust things to happen to a candidate for anything,"" he said. Trump challenges Kavanaugh accuser Why is the US top court so important? Who are the justices? Meanwhile, senior White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said: ""It's starting to feel like a vast left-wing conspiracy."" Her phrase echoed Hillary Clinton's 1998 depiction of infidelity allegations against her husband, President Bill Clinton, as a ""vast right-wing conspiracy"". Democrats have continued to call for the vote to be delayed to allow for the claims to be fully investigated. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Republican strategists have been saying for weeks that they believe Brett Kavanaugh could still be confirmed to the Supreme Court - if no new accusers emerge. Now another woman has come forward. Deborah Ramirez's recollection of the events from their first year at Yale is admittedly foggy. And as with Christine Blasey Ford, there are no supporting witnesses. Nevertheless, it becomes increasingly difficult for Judge Kavanaugh's side to dismiss what could now be characterised as a pattern of conduct, rather than an isolated accusation. Thursday's hearing, if it takes place, will probably be as much about Judge Kavanaugh's history with alcohol and the 1980s teen party culture as it will about any specific incident. That is much trickier ground for the nominee. The latest developments are already forcing both sides deeper into their partisan trenches. The White House is sticking by its man and focusing fire on what it views as a Democratic conspiracy. Those on the left see Republicans in a headlong rush to confirmation no matter the consequences or new information coming to light. Meanwhile, in the middle, are the same handful of moderate Republican senators. And in just over a month, mid-term voters also will have their say.

Weight Watchers slims down in rebrand,"Weight Watchers has unveiled a slimmed down version of its name, rebranding itself WW, in what it says marks  ""the next stage of the company's evolution"". The company says the new name reflects its development from focusing on weight loss to overall health and wellness. But the chief executive was unable to explain what the letters WW stood for. Mindy Grossman said they did not stand for Weight Watchers or ""Wellness that Works"", a phrase the company has trade marked, but were simply ""a marque"". ""That marque represents our heritage and history and what we are going forward,"" she said. Ms Grossman, who took the helm just over a year ago, said the firm had been shifting from a focus on just weight loss to its broader remit looking at ""wellness"" over the past two years. ""This is just a next step, a point of validation. Like any brand we have to stay relevant,"" she said. DJ Khaled signs up for Weight Watchers Weight Watchers shares jump on Oprah ad Oprah Winfrey bought a 10% stake in Weight Watchers in 2015 US media personality Oprah Winfrey - who bought a stake in the company in 2015 and works as an ambassador for Weight Watchers - said she had always thought that the company's role in people's lives ""goes far beyond a number on the scale"". Oprah's involvement has seen the firm's share price surge from under $5 each to about $70 currently.Its latest results,externalshow sales rose nearly 18% in the three months to the end of June, with subscribers up by one million from a year earlier to 4.5 million. However, concern that the firm's momentum could be slowing sparked a sharp sell-off in the shares recently. People don't go to Weight Watchers because they want to feel well, they go because they want to lose weight. Taking the name off the tin suggests an embarrassment around that notion -  it's no longer enough just to lust after smaller thighs, now you also need to desire ""wellness"", whatever that means. Of course it's good to be encouraged to exercise and develop healthy eating habits, but a corporate re-brand is a reminder of the profiteering behind your hunger pangs. Weight Watchers offered me kindly support in a peer group setting - and I found its basic mantras helpful - but I'm not sure WW will lead any more people into the promised (size 12) land than its predecessor. During its 55-year history, the firm has focused mainly on weight loss. US business entrepreneur Jean Nidetch, who founded the firm, described herself as a ""formerly fat housewife"". But the new Weight Watchers name comes amid a backlash against the word ""weight"". Earlier this year, Weight Watchers' decision to offer free membership for the summer to teenagers, sparked an outcry from eating disorder groups, with a hashtag #wakeupweightwatchers quickly gaining ground. Meanwhile, social media campaigns such as the #iweigh hashtag have become popular. The campaign,external, started by ""The Good Place"" star Jameela Jamil, encourages others to look beyond their weight, and instead to count other ""measurements"" in their life such as your ""three best friends"" or your ""one loving sister.""  The iweigh Instagram account now has 153,000 followers. Other successful campaigns have encouraged a focus on fitness, rather than appearance. Sport England's campaign called This Girl Can aimed to encourage more women to take up exercise and featured women of all shapes and sizes taking part in a variety of sports. Social media hashtags such as #StrongNotSkinny and #FitNotThin hashtags have also grown in popularity. Weight Watchers' rebranding includes updating its so called Fit points system to encourage subscribers to choose activities which have the biggest impact on health, and a new focus on ""healthy habits"" in its app for those ""who want to build healthy habits without focusing on weight loss"". It has also personalised its online user groups to help members find like-minded people. The rebrand is aimed at broadening its appeal to attract more potential users, but also to encourage subscribers to stay with them long-term. ""The paradox is that everyone is talking about wellness and nobody wants to use [the words] diet or weight, but we're not getting healthier,"" Ms Grossman said. .

Trump court nominee faces new sex claim,"Judge Kavanaugh, who is awaiting confirmation, has denied both allegations A second woman has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against President Donald Trump's US Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, a Yale university classmate of the judge, told the New Yorker that Mr Kavanaugh had exposed his genitals,externalat a dormitory party. The judge has denied both allegations, labelling the latest ""a smear"". The make-up of the nine-judge Supreme Court is crucial as it has the final say on often highly contentious laws. Before Judge Kavanaugh can take up the vacant seat, he has to be approved by the 21-strong Senate Judiciary Committee and then the whole Senate. Profile: Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's choice for Supreme Court Prof Christine Blasey Ford, who last week came forward alleging Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s,has agreed to testify before the Senate committee on Thursday. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, called for the ""immediate postponement of any further proceedings"" relating to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination in an letter sent to the committee's Republican chairman on Sunday evening. Ms Ramirez alleges the incident occurred when she was a freshman at Yale University alongside Judge Kavanaugh during the 1983-4 academic year. She says they were both taking part in a drinking game at a dormitory party where people sat in a circle and selected others to drink. #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford The truth about false assault accusations Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed?

The article says the 53-year-old acknowledges gaps in her memory caused by alcohol that night, which is said to have made her hesitant to come forward when contacted. The journalists behind the piece, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, say they contacted dozens of classmates to try to corroborate Ms Ramirez's account. Three former students, who were not independent eyewitnesses, recalled being told or discussing the incident in vague terms at the time. Trump challenges Kavanaugh accuser Why is the US top court so important? Who are the justices? Two males allegedly involved in the incident disputed her account, alongside several other classmates, adding the allegation against Judge Kavanaugh was ""completely out of character"". In a statement, the Supreme Court nominee strongly denied the allegation. ""This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,"" he said. ""The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. ""This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name - and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building - against these last-minute allegations."" A White House spokeswoman says the administration stands by the nominee, labelling the allegation ""the latest in a co-ordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear a good man down"".

Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said the cabinet had had a ""good, healthy discussion"" and ministers would continue to press the EU on some of the criticisms it had made. ""Of course we respect different views across the board but we're not going to suddenly throw up our hands in despair because we've had a bump in the road in these negotiations,"" he said.

Jailed Briton loses Egypt drug appeal,"Laura Plummer was jailed for three years in December A British woman jailed for smuggling painkiller tablets into Egypt has lost an appeal against her conviction. Laura Plummer, 34, from Hull, wasjailed for three yearsafter being caught taking almost 300 Tramadol tablets into the country in 2016. She had hoped Egypt's appeal court in Cairo would accept she did not know the pills were illegal in the country, but it upheld her conviction and jail term. Plummer was arrested when she was found with the tablets in her suitcase. She had been going to the Red Sea resort of Hurghada and claimed she had taken the tablets to give to her partner Omar Caboo to treat his back pain. Tramadol - a strong painkiller used to treat moderate to severe pain - is a banned substance in Egypt, though is available on prescription in the UK. Latest news and updates from Yorkshire Plummer had previously said she had ""no idea"" the tablets were illegal.

Pret baguette death girl's plea for help,"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight A 15-year-old girl who died after a severe allergic reaction to a baguette from an airport Pret a Manger said ""Daddy, help me"" as she struggled to breathe, an inquest has heard. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse became ill on a flight to Nice on 17 July 2016. Despite her father administering two EpiPen injections, Natashadied in a hospital in Nicewithin hours, West London Coroner's Court heard. Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply saddened"" by her death. Natasha from Fulham, west London, ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from a Pret shop at about 07:00 BST in Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport, the inquest heard. She began to feel ill about 20 minutes into the British Airways flight, and suffered a cardiac arrest and died later the same day. The inquest heard the baguette contained sesame - which Natasha was allergic to - but the ingredient was not listed on the packaging. Natasha's mother, brother and father attended the inquest at West London Coroner's Court The family's lawyer, Jeremy Hyam QC, became emotional as he read a statement by Natasha's father, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, at the first day of the inquest on Monday. Natasha had just finished school for the summer and was on her way to Nice for a four-day ""special treat"" with her best friend, Bethany, and her father. Mr Ednan-Laperouse's statement said he first applied an EpiPen when Natasha felt her throat growing itchy and red hives appeared on her midriff. When her symptoms did not improve he then used her second EpiPen, the inquest heard. ""Natasha said that she still couldn't breathe and desperately looked at me, she said 'Daddy, help me, I can't breathe',"" the statement read. She soon lost consciousness and cabin staff and an onboard junior doctor applied CPR for the rest of the journey. Mr Ednan-Laperouse recalled being ""totally focused on saving her life"" and ""begging her to fight and live"", but as his hope began to fade that she would survive in hospital he put a phone to her ear so that her mother and brother could say goodbye, the inquest was told. ""The pain and agony of the call was beyond anything I have known,"" his statement said. Natasha had eaten a baguette just before boarding the plane at Heathrow Mr Ednan-Laperouse told the hearing he had bought the baguette as it ""contained all the ingredients she loved and could eat"" and the label gave ""no indication or mention that sesame seeds were present"". After his daughter's death, Mr Ednan-Laperouse - the founder of Wow Toys company - said he called his own mother and asked her to visit a branch of Pret a Manger in west London to examine a similar baguette. Finding no ingredients on the label or on the shelf, his mother made inquiries at the counter and was handed a folder of information. ""My mother looked down the list and found that the baguette dough had sesame seed inside it,"" his statement said. ""I was stunned that a big food company like Pret could mislabel a sandwich and this could cause my daughter to die."" Oliver Campbell QC, representing the chain, said Natasha's father ""must unfortunately be mistaken"" about his recollections of the packaging, because Pret food does not typically display ingredients. The inquest heard that Pret fridges usually had transparent stickers with white text outlining allergy information. Mr Hyam suggested these had not been in place at the airport branch in July 2016. Abdoulaye-Djouma Diallo, the general manager of the branch at the time, told the inquest he was ""confident and sure"" he had put stickers on the tills and fridges. However, Mr Hyam said a health officer from Hillingdon Council visited the branch in May 2017 and reported ""there were no till stickers to be seen at the till area"". Sesame is one of 14 allergens that consumers must be made aware of when it is used as an ingredient in food products, according toEU Regulations,external However, the EU rules say individual member states are responsible for deciding on how information about non pre-packaged food is provided to the customer The UK'sFood Regulations 2014,externalallow freshly handmade, non pre-packaged food to not be individually labelled Pret confirmed at the time of Natasha's death products would not have been individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information, and that this was within regulations However, Pret said there were signs in the fridge and at till points telling consumers with allergies to speak to a manager for advice or to seeits allergen guide,external Natasha had suffered from food allergies her entire life, but diligently scrutinised labels and was alert to the danger of cross-contamination, the inquest heard. She put ""her trust in food labelling"", her father's statement added. UK regulations mean some foods can be sold without individual labels denoting which allergens they contain Antihistamines, EpiPens and inhalers had never before failed to halt an allergic reaction, he said. In a statement ahead of Monday's hearing, Natasha's parents said she loved horse-riding, ice-skating, and wanted to pursue a career in law. They added that she had been ""so excited"" about what was going to be ""her best summer ever"". Representatives from Pret a Manger and BA are expected to give evidence at the inquest, the family's lawyer has said. The inquest is expected to last five days.

Blood scandal inquiry: 'We need the truth',"This video can not be played ""I hope I'm still alive when this ends"" Emotional testimonies from people infected with HIV and hepatitis have been heard at the start of the inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. The public inquiry is looking at how thousands of NHS patients were given infected blood products during the 1970s and 1980s in what has been dubbed the worst-ever NHS treatment disaster. In a video played to the inquiry, one man described how he felt he lost his entire life after finding out at the age of 43 that he had been infected with hepatitis C when he was a child. He was given an injection of blood products when he was eight for a swollen knee that was misdiagnosed as haemophilia. ""I lost everything. I lost my whole life the day I found out - everything ended,"" he explained. 'I don't want him to have died in vain' Both my husbands died from scandal 'I gave birth, and got Hepatitis C' With her identity hidden, one woman said she became infected with HIV through her husband who was a haemophiliac, and who had been given contaminated blood. She said when they found out they were left stunned and devastated. ""This was the mid-1980s and the climate of fear, discrimination and stigma associated with HIV and Aids was horrendous,"" she added. ""We coped the best we could. We were silenced, and we kept quiet."" Another victim, a widow, whose husband John died of Aids in 1994 and who also had hepatitis C, said: ""I feel we have been treated very badly. Nobody has listened to us over the years."" There have been previous inquiries into the scandal, but this is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up. This video can not be played Barbara, wife of one of the contaminated blood victims, says the inquiry is ""too little, too late"" About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years - nearly 3,000 of them have since died. This was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a new treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US. But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors, and concentrating it. People who underwent blood transfusions were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. Steve Dymond is now in his early 60s. He initially had only mild symptoms of haemophilia and led an active life. During the 1980s his health began to suffer. His muscles were sore, his joints ached and he was always exhausted. After going to hospital following a minor hand injury in the mid-1980s, he was told he had been treated with Factor VIII that had not been heat-treated. The concern was that he may have been exposed to HIV. At the time it took 18 months to get a diagnosis - a wait that his wife Su Gorman said put their lives on hold. He was given the all-clear, but in the 1990s was diagnosed with hepatitis C. He is now clear of hepatitis C, although his health has continued to suffer. Two years ago he suffered a near-fatal stomach bleed, has suffered hearing loss and has a damaged liver, leaving him at risk of cancer. He said people have been ""betrayed and lied to"" throughout, with the government, health professionals and drug companies all guilty of trying to avoid responsibility. ""It is difficult to try to imagine - even though there is a public inquiry - how they will be able to get past these walls of obfuscation,"" said Mr Dymond. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels. There have been previous inquiries. One was led by Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell and was privately funded. It held no official status and was unable to force witnesses to testify or force the disclosure of documents. Meanwhile, the Penrose Inquiry, a seven-year investigation launched by the government in Scotland, was criticised as a whitewash when it was published in 2015. Greater Manchester mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a probe into what happened. Mr Burnham said he was prepared to approach the police about the issue Mr Burnham claimed in the House of Commons last year that a ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" had taken place. The government announced there would be an inquiry only after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion. The inquiry could last more than two years. Payments have been made to some of the people who were infected - the first fund was set up as long ago as 1989. But if the new inquiry finds culpability, it opens the door to victims seeking large compensation payouts through the courts. Retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, who is leading the inquiry, said it marked the start of something which several people had campaigned for over many years. He said there had already been more than 100,000 documents submitted, with the prospect of lots more to come. Speaking at the start of the inquiry, he said if the campaigners were right there was a ""real chance"" the numbers affected could rise as there would be people out there who did not yet know they had been infected. ""It is a truly sobering thought,"" he added. Liz Carroll, chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, called on the inquiry to work diligently to ""uncover the truth, bring justice and ultimately closure for victims and their families"". ""This scandal devastated generations of people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders. ""Our members have waited decades for this to be properly investigated.""

Anger over paedophile near children's home,"The court said it ""beggared belief"" that Martin Todd was sent to live near a children's home after being released from prison A judge has ordered a police force and council to pay Â£52,000 to a sex abuse victim after a convicted paedophile was housed near his children's home. Martin Todd was sent to live near the Leicester home in 2009 in a decision the court said ""beggared belief"". He was jailed in 2011 for sexually assaulting and attempting to rape the boy, then aged 15. Leicestershire Police and Leicester City Council said they would appeal against the decision. At the hearing, Judge Alison Hampton said there was a ""serious failure"" to share information about Todd with staff at the home so they could take steps to safeguard the children. She also expressed concern that the children's services and housing departments did not question the location of the address, ""a stone's throw away"" from the council-run children's home. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The judgement came in response to a compensation claim launched by the victim in April 2015, theLocal Democracy Reporting Service(LDRS) said. Todd was sent to live at the address - which was proposed by the police - in 2009, after being jailed firstly in 1997, for two separate sex attacks on young boys, and again in 2006 for 10 breaches of a sexual offences prevention order, by befriending four families with children. No offences were committed. The boy was sexually abused by Todd between October and November 2009. At a trial at Leicester Crown Court in 2011, he was found guilty of attempted rape and two counts of sexual assault. He was given an indeterminate sentence for public protection, with a minimum of five years. At the compensation hearing last month, Judge Hampton ordered police to pay Â£41,600 and the authority Â£10,400 to the victim, now in his 20s, and refused both organisations permission to appeal. Their appeals will now go before the High Court. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external,oronInstagram,external. Send your story ideas toeastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk,external.

Heatwave sparks Thomas Cook profit alert,"Thomas Cook shares fell as much as 25% after it blamed the summer heatwave for a drop in its annual profit forecast. ""Many customers"" had put off booking holidays abroad, instead staying at home in June and July to enjoy the sunshine, the holiday firm said. The company said,externalthis had led to ""higher than usual levels of discounting"" in August and September. It now expects full-year earnings of Â£280m, below its earlier forecast of around Â£323m, which it made in July. In a separate statement,,externalThomas Cook also said it would replace its chief financial officer. The share price has halved in value since the start of the year. Thomas Cook usually makes all of its annual profits during the summer. But it also warned that the impact of the heatwave ""is continuing to be felt into winter trading"". ""A downgrade of this size in 2018 is going to have some impact on 2019,"" chief executive Peter Fankhauser told investors. Heatwave hits Thomas Cook bookings Tour firm axes trips to killer whale parks Is the party over for Club 18-30? Thomas Cook said a return in popularity of holidays to Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia and Greece meant that total group bookings for the summer period were 12% higher than the same period last year. However, average selling prices were 5% lower than last year. Mr Fankhauser admitted its trading performance was ""disappointing"", but said the firm had made ""good strategic progress which positions us well to driver further performance improvement"". The firm warned in Julythat annual earnings would be at the lower end of market expectations due to more people staying at home rather than booking last-minute holidays. Shore Capital analyst Greg Johnson said assuming a normal trading environment going forward he expected ""some of this year's shortfall to be recovered, although the winter is likely to be tougher"". He downgraded his rating on the shares from ""buy"" to ""hold"" ""until we get greater clarity over trading for Summer 2019"". Thousands flocked to British beaches over the summer, including this one at Bournemouth Patricia Yates, the director of Visit Britain, told the BBC earlier this year that there was agrowing trend towards more late bookings, with nearly 80% of all trips being booked within three months of the travel date. The hot weather in the UK therefore acts as a ""timely reminder"" to people who are ""making a late-call on where to go on holiday"", she said. In August, Thomas Cook's bigger rival Tui Group reiterated its full-year profit forecast, but said the heatwave meant it was unlikely to exceed its profit prediction. Meanwhile, Thomas Cook's chief financial officer Bill Scottwill leave the company,externalat the end of November, and be replaced on an interim basis by Sten Daugaard, a board member of the company's German business. A search for a permanent successor would start immediately, the company added. Heatwave hits Thomas Cook bookings Tour firm axes trips to killer whale parks Is the party over for Club 18-30?

Rape conviction levels lowest for young men,"Less than a third of young men prosecuted for rape in England and Wales last year were found guilty, according to new figures. Prosecutors said the low conviction rate was a ""challenge for the entire criminal justice system"". Rape allegations tried at court led to 31.6% of men aged 18 to 24 being convicted from 2017-18, the lowest percentage of any age group. For men aged 25 to 59, the conviction rate was 45.6%. The figures were released by the Crown Prosecution Service after Labour MP Ann Coffey submitted a freedom of information request. She suggested they show how juries treat women - and the impact of false allegations of rape. The conviction rate for all offences was 86.6% in the year up to March 2018, according to Ministry of Justice figures. ""The figures may reflect the prevailing attitudes of society and therefore of juries to women, who are often blamed for putting themselves in risky situations,"" said Ms Coffey, MP for Stockport. ""There has been a strong media focus on the small number of false allegations of rape and this perpetuates the public perception that lying about rape is common when in fact the opposite is true. ""The vast majority of rapes are never reported because many young women fear they will not be believed."" MPs criticise CPS criminal case failures 'It was right to report being raped' She added there is a ""dominance of rape myths in our culture"", including ""that a woman who has drunk a lot cannot complain if she ends up being raped or that it is only rape if someone has injuries or that most rapes are done by mad axe men in alleyways."" In the past five years, young men accounted for more than a quarter of the defendants in rape-only cases according to the figures, first reported inThe Guardian,external. The CPS said rape and serious sexual offences were ""some of the most complex"" they deal with And of the 1,343 rape cases the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) has taken against those young men in that time, only 404 led to a conviction - an average of 30%. Sarah Green, co-director of End Violence Against Women, said: ""These figures are shocking and, given that very few cases make it to court in the first place, they could be read as showing that there is near impunity in this country for young adult men who commit rape."" The CPS said rape and serious sexual offences could be ""some of the most complex cases"" they deal with. ""Addressing the low conviction after contest rate in cases involving young defendants represents a challenge for the entire criminal justice system,"" a spokesman said. The CPS is taking steps including having early discussions with police before making the decision to charge and providing specialist training for prosecutors on issues of ""consent, myths and stereotypes"" and cases involving ""vulnerable witnesses and young people"".

Watt: Why change matters,"Demonstrators on the March for the Many in Liverpool A butterfly flaps its wings with hardly a care in the world and innocently triggers a tornado, goes the theory. The diehard Remain supporters advocating a further EU referendum are hardly retiring butterflies and their campaign is no political tornado. But their call for voters to be given another say on the EU is now, at the very least, a gentle breeze whistling through British politics. It will be felt by all sides in the final phase of the Brexit negotiations. A compromise motion, thrashed out during late night negotiations at theLabour conferencein Liverpool, now specifically ties a reluctant Labour leadership to another referendum. The party would back such a move if the leadership's preferred option of a general election failed. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, dashed the hopes of pro-Europeans in the party by suggesting on theToday programmethat the option to Remain in the EU should not be on the ballot paper. The choice should instead be about the proposed Brexit deal. But the loose wording of the Labour party does not rule out a Remain option on the ballot paper and McDonnell conceded that it would be up to Parliament to decide the wording. The wrangling has led to much soul searching in the new Labour movement taking shape under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The Momentum group, established to shore up his leadership at the grassroots, has been torn between pro-European instincts and loyalty to Corbyn. He is heir to the Bennite tradition which regards the founding principles of the EU as anathema to Socialism. Momentum was thinking of taking a neutral position had the motion been difficult for Jeremy Corbyn. One Momentum source told me that, while the organisation is strongly pro-European, it would do nothing to jeopardise its main goal; the election of a truly Socialist government. The People's Vote campaign are reasonably content. They know their greatest weakness in Liverpool is they are seen as a bunch of unreconstructed Blairites seeking to thwart the will of the people on the EU and undermine Corbyn in the bargain. This video can not be played David Lammy: ""Can you hear us Jeremy Corbyn?"" The campaign believe they have shown they have far wider support. They hope to have created a space in November for Labour to be able to endorse a referendum on the grounds that warring Conservative MPs agree on one thing - there must be no general election before 2022. And they believe that the motion leaves open the possibility of an option to Remain in the EU on the ballot paper. One source in the People's Vote campaign told me: ""The door is now wide open."" The numbers in parliament suggest that if Labour endorses a further referendum it would be difficult to pass the legislation without a sizeable contingent of Tory MPs defying Theresa May. But the events in Liverpool now set the stage for the issue of a further referendum to become everyone's favourite weapon in the final phase of the Brexit negotiations. To pro-Europeans it is an escape hatch if Theresa May fails to negotiate a deal with the EU or she negotiates a deal that is rejected by Parliament. To Brexiteers the People's Vote campaign does their work for them. Leavers have consistently said that the pro-European side represents an out of touch elite afraid to accept the judgment of the people. And along comes a well funded campaign seeking to overturn the results of a referendum they won by more than a million votes. Theresa May is using the threat of another referendum to warn Brexiteers opposed to her plan to be careful what they wish for. Brexiteers invited to dinner in Downing Street recently were reportedly told if the prime minister's plans collapse then the commons speaker John Bercow will help create the conditions to vote through a further referendum. The EU is, of course, watching events very closely. Some EU leaders said at last week's summit that they would be happy to extend the article 50 negotiations to allow a further referendum to take place. Innocently or not that sort of talks infuriates Theresa May who says the mere talk of a vote allows the EU to hold back in the hope the UK changes its mind. An innocent butterfly going about its business may never unleash a tornado over British politics. But it is certainly changing the weather. You can watchNewsnighton BBC 2 weekdays 22:30 or onIplayer.

Teenager survives 49 days adrift at sea,"Mr Adilang was on a rompong, a floating fishing trap that is shaped like a hut An Indonesian teenager who looked after a fishing hut survived for 49 days at sea by cooking fish over wood taken from his vessel, it has emerged. Aldi Novel Adilang was on the hut 125km (77 miles) off the Indonesian coast in mid-July when heavy winds caused its moorings to snap, casting the 18-year-old adrift. He ended up thousands of kilometres away near Guam, where he was eventually picked up by a Panamanian vessel. The 18-year-old, from the Indonesian island of Sulawesi, worked on a ""rompong"" - a floating fish trap without any paddles or engine. His job had been to light the rompong's lamps, which are designed to attract fish, the Jakarta Post newspaper reports. The trap, which is shaped like a hut, floats in the middle of the sea but is anchored to the seabed by ropes. Every week, the teenager would be brought fresh supplies of food, water and fuel by someone from his company who would come to collect the fish. On 14 July, Mr Adilang's rompong was hit by heavy winds, which caused its moorings to snap. He only had a limited amount of supplies left, so he caught fish and cooked it by burning the rompong's wooden fences. It is unclear how he remained hydrated. ""[He] said he had been scared and often cried while adrift,""Fajar Firdaus, an Indonesian diplomat in Osaka, Japan, told The Jakarta Post.,external ""Every time he saw a large ship, he said, he was hopeful, but more than 10 ships had sailed past him. None of them stopped or saw [him]."" Mr Adilang is now back with his family and in good health His mother told the news agency AFP how she learned of her son's disappearance. ""His boss told my husband that he went missing,"" Net Kahiking said. ""So we just surrendered to God and kept praying hard."" On 31 August, Mr Adilang sent an emergency radio signal upon seeing the MV Arpeggio nearby. He was picked up by the Panamanian vessel off the waters of Guam. He was given permission to enter Japan ""due to disaster"" The captain of the vessel contacted the Guam coast guard, who instructed the crew to take him to Japan, the ship's destination,according to a statement from the Indonesian Consulate General in Osaka's Facebook page.,external Mr Adilang arrived in Japan on 6 September and flew back to Indonesia two days later, where he has now been reunited with his family. He is said to be in good health. ""He is now back at home and he will be 19 on September 30 - we're going to celebrate,"" his mother said.

Weight Watchers slims down in rebrandThe firm says the change to WW reflects its development from focusing on weight loss to overall health.,"Weight Watchers has unveiled a slimmed down version of its name, rebranding itself WW, in what it says marks  ""the next stage of the company's evolution"". The company says the new name reflects its development from focusing on weight loss to overall health and wellness. But the chief executive was unable to explain what the letters WW stood for. Mindy Grossman said they did not stand for Weight Watchers or ""Wellness that Works"", a phrase the company has trade marked, but were simply ""a marque"". ""That marque represents our heritage and history and what we are going forward,"" she said. Ms Grossman, who took the helm just over a year ago, said the firm had been shifting from a focus on just weight loss to its broader remit looking at ""wellness"" over the past two years. ""This is just a next step, a point of validation. Like any brand we have to stay relevant,"" she said. DJ Khaled signs up for Weight Watchers Weight Watchers shares jump on Oprah ad Oprah Winfrey bought a 10% stake in Weight Watchers in 2015 US media personality Oprah Winfrey - who bought a stake in the company in 2015 and works as an ambassador for Weight Watchers - said she had always thought that the company's role in people's lives ""goes far beyond a number on the scale"". Oprah's involvement has seen the firm's share price surge from under $5 each to about $70 currently.Its latest results,externalshow sales rose nearly 18% in the three months to the end of June, with subscribers up by one million from a year earlier to 4.5 million. However, concern that the firm's momentum could be slowing sparked a sharp sell-off in the shares recently. People don't go to Weight Watchers because they want to feel well, they go because they want to lose weight. Taking the name off the tin suggests an embarrassment around that notion -  it's no longer enough just to lust after smaller thighs, now you also need to desire ""wellness"", whatever that means. Of course it's good to be encouraged to exercise and develop healthy eating habits, but a corporate re-brand is a reminder of the profiteering behind your hunger pangs. Weight Watchers offered me kindly support in a peer group setting - and I found its basic mantras helpful - but I'm not sure WW will lead any more people into the promised (size 12) land than its predecessor. During its 55-year history, the firm has focused mainly on weight loss. US business entrepreneur Jean Nidetch, who founded the firm, described herself as a ""formerly fat housewife"". But the new Weight Watchers name comes amid a backlash against the word ""weight"". Earlier this year, Weight Watchers' decision to offer free membership for the summer to teenagers, sparked an outcry from eating disorder groups, with a hashtag #wakeupweightwatchers quickly gaining ground. Meanwhile, social media campaigns such as the #iweigh hashtag have become popular. The campaign,external, started by ""The Good Place"" star Jameela Jamil, encourages others to look beyond their weight, and instead to count other ""measurements"" in their life such as your ""three best friends"" or your ""one loving sister.""  The iweigh Instagram account now has 153,000 followers. Other successful campaigns have encouraged a focus on fitness, rather than appearance. Sport England's campaign called This Girl Can aimed to encourage more women to take up exercise and featured women of all shapes and sizes taking part in a variety of sports. Social media hashtags such as #StrongNotSkinny and #FitNotThin hashtags have also grown in popularity. Weight Watchers' rebranding includes updating its so called Fit points system to encourage subscribers to choose activities which have the biggest impact on health, and a new focus on ""healthy habits"" in its app for those ""who want to build healthy habits without focusing on weight loss"". It has also personalised its online user groups to help members find like-minded people. The rebrand is aimed at broadening its appeal to attract more potential users, but also to encourage subscribers to stay with them long-term. ""The paradox is that everyone is talking about wellness and nobody wants to use [the words] diet or weight, but we're not getting healthier,"" Ms Grossman said. .

Last migrant rescue ship in Med deflagged,"The Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) only registered the ship last month, after the Gibraltar authorities revoked its flag A rescue vessel operating in the central Mediterranean Sea has had its registration revoked, leaving its future operations in jeopardy. When the Aquarius next docks, it will have to remove its Panama maritime flag and cannot set sail without a new one. It is the last private rescue ship operating in the area used for crossings from Libya to Europe. The charities running the vessel accuse the Italian government of pressuring Panama into deflagging the Aquarius. The two groups which lease it, MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and SOS MediterranÃ©e, say they were notified of the decision by the Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) on Saturday. The authority is said to have described the ship as a ""political problem"" for the country's government, and said Italian authorities had urged them to take ""immediate action"" against them, according to SOS MediterranÃ©e. Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who has previously described the aid boats as a ""taxi service"" for migrants, denies his country put pressure on Panama. On Sunday, he tweeted he didn't even know what prefix Panama has for telephone calls. Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? On board the migrant ship Aquarius The man who cut the migrant flow to Italy Mr Salvini has been a prominent figure in a public immigration crackdown in Italy since his government, a coalition between the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, came to power in June. He has frequently come into conflicts with rescue ship operators andlast month was involved in a public stand-off about the disembarkation of 150 migrants on a coast guard shipon the island of Sicily. According to the United Nations, more than 1,700 migrants have died trying to cross to Europe in 2018. Karline Kleijer, MSF's Head of Emergencies, accused European leaders of using ""abusive and vicious"" tactics The Aquarius has been operating in the area since February 2016, finding itself at the centre of diplomatic stand-offs in recent months over disembarkation. It was under the flag of the Gibraltar Maritime Administration until August this year, when it was given ""notice of removal"" and re-registered with Panama. Migration to Europe in charts Mediterranean crossings 'deadlier than ever' The ship's operators say they were notified of the new decision while on a current mission, and say they have 58 survivors on board from two boats they found in distress. Once it docks, the vessel will now be de-flagged and will not be able to set sail again without being registered with a new maritime authority. In a joint statement, the charities insisted they were in ""full compliance"" with maritime law and denounced the decision as condemning hundreds to death. The statement asks for European governments to step in to allow the vessel to continue its operations by either reassuring the Panamanian authorities or issuing it a new flag.

Plans to give tenants more power,"Labour says it would scrap laws allowing private landlords to evict tenants without giving a reason. The law, in force since 1988, is thought to be the biggest cause of homelessness. Labour's shadow housing minister John Healey announced the policy at the party's conference in Liverpool. Mr Healey also unveiled plans for a Â£20m fund to set up ""renters' unions"" to support tenants in disputes with landlords. So-called ""no-fault"" evictions - when landlords throw people out of their home without saying why - have been growing in recent years. Research by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation and the Cambridge Centre for Housing and Planning Research found 80% of private-sector evictions in 2015 fell into this category. Labour members' Brexit vote wording agreed No new academy schools, Labour to pledge McDonnell: Firms must give staff shares Deselecting Labour MPs to be made easier Before Section 21 of the 1988 Housing Act came into force it was more difficult for landlords to evict people who paid rent on time. The government hasannounced plans increase security for tenantsin the private rented sector, who now number about 11.5 million people, including minimum tenancies of three years. But Labour says it would go further if it gained power. The party's policies include: A new levy on second homes that are used as holiday homes Reversing cuts to legal aid for housing related cases Introducing three-year tenancies Banning letting agent fees New minimum legal standards to ensure homes are ""fit for human habitation"" Giving cities the power to introduce rent controls In his speech to the Labour faithful in Liverpool, Mr Healey said: ""Tenants who rent from private landlords have been hit hard by the housing crisis. ""Labour's commitment is clear: we'll give renters new rights to control rental costs, improve conditions and increase security. ""Renters' unions help put power in the hands of tenants. ""And the next Labour government will fund set-up costs for these unions across the country to support renters to defend their rights, and make the housing market fairer."" In response, Conservative Housing Secretary James Brokenshire said the costs of a new union for tenants would fall on ""hard-pressed renters"".

Buckingham Palace 'Taser' was a keyring,"The man was arrested at the visitor entrance of the palace A man arrested at Buckingham Palace on suspicion of possessing a Taser has been released by police. The 38-year-old, a visitor to London from the Netherlands, was detained at the visitors' entrance to the palace at about 12:45 BST on Sunday. Scotland Yard said his possession of the device, which was low-powered and part of a keyring, was a genuine error, and that he posed no threat. The man was released without further action. A spokesman said: ""Officers are reminding visitors to the United Kingdom to ensure that any items that they are carrying comply with legislation in the UK. ""This includes small knives and personal Taser-type devices, both of which may be considered offensive weapons or in breach of strict UK firearms laws.""

"Monthly rubbish bin collection launchedThe move - a first in Wales - has proved controversial, with claims a trial saw increases in rats and flies.WalesComments","This video can not be played One local said the area was being plagued by flies and maggots Controversial monthly bin collections are being rolled out across a Welsh county on Monday - the first area in Wales and England to make the move. Waste destined for landfill will now only be collected once a month in Conwy countyfollowing a trial. It has been met with controversy, with residents and councillors calling it ""unfair"" and claiming the trial broughtmore rats, seagulls and flies. The council said it could save Â£390,000 a year and concerns had been addressed. It said food waste was collected weekly and it offered a free weekly collection service for nappies and incontinence products - to reduce the smell in residual waste bags. Many parts of the UK are now moving towards bin collections every three weeks in a bid to cut down on residual waste and increase recycling. Two councils in Scotland have made the move to bin collections every four weeks - Fife and Falkirk - and Belfast City Council has included the optionas part of a consultationinto the future of its waste and recycling. All the plastic you can and cannot recycle Should parents pay to bin used nappies? How chewing gum could be recycled into new objects From the outset, the year-long monthly bin collection trial in Conwy county  - brought in for 11,000 homes in in 2016 - caused a stink. Many residents are still unhappy about the changes, and have said the rubbish causes a smell, breeds maggots and attracts mice and rats. Residents claim their bins are often overflowing Some have also admitted to burning their waste in a bid to reduce the amount of rubbish in their bins. ""It's the length of time that's the problem, not the quantity,"" one resident said. ""It festers. It's as simple as that. The whole area is plagued with flies now in the summer. ""We've bought an incinerator so we burn the majority of the rubbish, which is not good for the environment. This video can not be played Homeowners say the four-weekly bin collection pilot has been ""horrendous"" ""But we have animals and they refused to pick up animal waste, so it has to go in black bag. It sits there for a month then."" Families in particular have reported having issues with bins that are too full. ""I think it's dreadful. They should be emptied regularly,"" another resident said. ""It's more than full after two weeks and I burn some of it. You're not supposed to do that, but you have to otherwise the bin is absolutely bursting. ""It is more manageable at three weeks, but I think four weeks is a step too far, especially for families."" The best tip to reduce waste is not to produce it in the first place. Plan what you buy and buy what you plan Get to grips with what your local council recycles - not all recycle the same things Is junk mail a problem for you? De-register yourself from online marketing lists. If you do get junk mail through the door remember to recycle it Think before you throw away an unwanted electrical item. Ask if your friend or family if they want it, sell it or donate to charity Buy a compost bin and make your own compost to enrich your garden and reduce the amount of garden and kitchen waste your throw away Source:Recycle for Wales,external The decision to roll out the four-weekly collections was signed off by the cabinet in January, despite councillors voting toscrap the scheme in November 2017in favour of three-weekly collections. It came despite councillors expressing concern that the county was ""not ready"" for the new system and that more people would struggle with overflowing bins. Blaenau Gwent council recycling letters 'dumped' on hill QUIZ: How rubbish are you at recycling? In response, the cabinet put extra measures in place to help residents recycle, including free collection of large items, free nappy bins for grandparents who look after children and bespoke collections for people who miss having bin collections if they are on holiday. Reports by council officials had previously suggested that four-weekly collections would increase the amount of rubbish that was recycled and also save the council up to Â£390,000 per year. The drive for more recycling is being made across the country, with authorities facing fines if they fail to meet targets. Last year it was announced thata target for 64%of waste to be recycled in Wales by 2019-20 had been met four years early. On itswebsite,external, Conwy council said: ""We currently recycle 64% of our waste, which is really good, but we need to recycle 70% by 2024/25 to meet the Welsh Government's targets. If these targets are not achieved the council may be fined. ""A year long trial of four weekly collections to 10,000 households has led to 14% increase in recycling and 31% decrease in the amount of refuse in the wheelie bins. These items are now being recycled into something new and the food waste is being used to make electricity. As a result of the trial, we are now rolling this out county-wide from September 2018.""

Children 'must be suicidal to get help'Families say children have to be suicidal before they receive help.Health,"Jess, 14, began self-harming at secondary school Children with mental health problems are not receiving treatment until they are in crisis and sometimes suicidal, doctors have told the BBC. A letter leaked to Panorama reveals at least one area's child and adolescent mental health service (Camhs) to be rationing care. Leading psychiatrist Jon Goldin described the service as ""not fit for purpose"". The government said it was investing an extra Â£1.4bn in child mental health. Jess, 14, first began feeling anxious three years ago, shortly after she went to secondary school. ""I felt like everyone was judging me all the timeâ¦ you start to get just horrible, horrible feelings of more and more and more worthlessness."" Her mum, Claire, tried to get help from Camhs, but was refused and Jess's health got worse. Claire began sleeping next to her daughter to try to keep her safe. Jess's mum Claire says she and Jess were ""crying out for help and support"" for a long time ""I was woken by Jess saying, 'I love you mummy'...  I knew that was alarm bells and I ran out of my bedroom door [and] she was standing with the noose around her neck."" Jess was taken to A&E for treatment and was finally seen by a Camhs crisis team. But by this time her health was very bad. Her mother took videos of her having psychotic episodes to show doctors, to prove how ill her daughter was. This video can not be played After Jess developed psychosis, she was taken to a secure child mental health hospital, and later sectioned. Jess tries to describe how these episodes felt, saying it was like ""all your negative thoughts and all your awful things that have happened over the last week all just collapsing into one hour, almost like putting you in a bottle and shaking you up and then letting you out again"". Eventually, Jess was detained at Chalk Hill, a specialist child mental health hospital in Sussex, for her own safety. She spent nine months as an inpatient, and says she was assaulted by a staff member. ""I was having a psychotic episode so I was like running on the floor, he grabbed my legs, pulled me back, did that and shook me upside down."" Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says concerns about treatment are taken ""extremely seriously"" and investigated ""as a matter of urgency"". Earlier this year, Jess was released and is now recovering back at home. She was told by the hospital that she had autism. ""I feel like if it had been diagnosed ages ago I probably would never even have had this journey. I would've just gone, 'OK, I need to do some therapy for Asperger's because it'll help me control my thoughts.'"" Her mum agrees. ""We were crying out for help and support for a very, very long time and she shouldn't have deteriorated to this level."" The number of under-18s seeking help for mental health problems is rising, with at least one in 10 children thought to have a diagnosable condition. Demand for Camhs services is up and some areas are struggling to meet demand. A leaked letter from Waltham Forest service in London, obtained by Panorama, states that for six months earlier this year it raised its threshold for treatment, so that only the most seriously ill children - such as those with psychosis - were treated. Staff at Waltham Forest Camhs were told in January they could only treat 'the most severe cases' North East London Foundation Trust, which runs Waltham Forest Camhs, says it has now lowered the threshold again, saying: ""We do not underestimate the level of challenge we are facing."" Panorama heard similar stories from staff working in other services. Only one in four children with a mental health condition currently receives treatment. One woman interviewed worked in Camhs for decades but recently left because of her concerns about the quality of care she was able to offer. ""My experience in the past eight to 10 years has been a real deterioration in children and adolescents' ability to access services - the thresholds have changed considerably."" The Association of Child Psychotherapists says it has heard of cases of children having to make multiple suicide attempts in order access care. Nick Waggett told Panorama: ""We do hear stories of children and young people having to have attempted suicide on a number of occasions actually before they are seen within the service. ""The problem is that then they're very ill and it actually becomes increasingly difficult to offer them an effective treatment."" The government says it is investing an extra Â£1.4bn in child mental health services, and ""transforming"" the service ""so that 70,000 more children a year have access to specialist mental health care by 2020-21"". But Labour's MP Luciana Berger, who sits on the health and social care committee, believes NHS services are spending the extra money elsewhere. ""In too many cases that money just isn't reaching the front line. I believe urgently we need to see those monies protected and ring-fenced."" According to the Care Quality Commission, evidence suggests the number of children visiting A&E for mental health treatmenthas more than doubled since 2010,external. Many services are failing to meet NHS guidelines for an out-of-hours crisis service. A Freedom of Information request from BBC Panorama has revealed that at least 1.5 million under-18s in England live in areas without 24/7 child mental health crisis care. Dr Jon Goldin, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the system was unable to meet the  demand: ""I have colleagues working all over the country who areâ¦ doing excellent work, the trouble is the services are very stretched.

Migrant rescue ship has registration revoked,"The Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) only registered the ship last month, after the Gibraltar authorities revoked its flag A rescue vessel operating in the central Mediterranean Sea has had its registration revoked, leaving its future operations in jeopardy. When the Aquarius next docks, it will have to remove its Panama maritime flag and cannot set sail without a new one. It is the last private rescue ship operating in the area used for crossings from Libya to Europe. The charities running the vessel accuse the Italian government of pressuring Panama into deflagging the Aquarius. The two groups which lease it, MÃ©decins Sans FrontiÃ¨res (MSF) and SOS MediterranÃ©e, say they were notified of the decision by the Panama Maritime Authority (PMA) on Saturday. The authority is said to have described the ship as a ""political problem"" for the country's government, and said Italian authorities had urged them to take ""immediate action"" against them, according to SOS MediterranÃ©e. Italy's Interior Minister Matteo Salvini, who has previously described the aid boats as a ""taxi service"" for migrants, denies his country put pressure on Panama. On Sunday, he tweeted he didn't even know what prefix Panama has for telephone calls. Migrant taxi service or charitable rescuers? On board the migrant ship Aquarius The man who cut the migrant flow to Italy Mr Salvini has been a prominent figure in a public immigration crackdown in Italy since his government, a coalition between the right-wing League party and the anti-establishment Five Star Movement, came to power in June. He has frequently come into conflicts with rescue ship operators andlast month was involved in a public stand-off about the disembarkation of 150 migrants on a coast guard shipon the island of Sicily. According to the United Nations, more than 1,700 migrants have died trying to cross to Europe in 2018. Karline Kleijer, MSF's Head of Emergencies, accused European leaders of using ""abusive and vicious"" tactics The Aquarius has been operating in the area since February 2016, finding itself at the centre of diplomatic stand-offs in recent months over disembarkation. It was under the flag of the Gibraltar Maritime Administration until August this year, when it was given ""notice of removal"" and re-registered with Panama. Migration to Europe in charts Mediterranean crossings 'deadlier than ever' The ship's operators say they were notified of the new decision while on a current mission, and say they have 58 survivors on board from two boats they found in distress. Once it docks, the vessel will now be de-flagged and will not be able to set sail again without being registered with a new maritime authority. In a joint statement, the charities insisted they were in ""full compliance"" with maritime law and denounced the decision as condemning hundreds to death. The statement asks for European governments to step in to allow the vessel to continue its operations by either reassuring the Panamanian authorities or issuing it a new flag.

Murder arrest over missing student,"Thomas Jones' disappearance was said to be ""extremely out of character"" A 20-year-old man has been arrested on suspicion of murder in connection with the disappearance of a student in his first week at university. Thomas Jones, 18, was last seen near the River Severn in Worcester during the early hours of Wednesday. West Mercia Police had earlier identified two men they wanted to speak to after releasing CCTV images recorded at nearby Velvet nightclub. The arrested man is currently in police custody. Hundreds of volunteers have joined police with the search and officers have been ""working around the clock"" to find Mr Jones, the force said. Det Insp Mark Bellamy said: ""A number of lines of inquiry are currently ongoing and I hope today's developments will assist us in our continued investigation. ""Thomas's family has been made aware of the update and they are being supported by specially trained officers."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Police believe Mr Jones crossed the Sabrina footbridge, near Worcester Racecourse, and then walked on to the footpath that runs along the top of the flood defences on Hylton Road in the direction of Hallow, just before 03:50 BST. The missing teenager's family believe he may have crossed over Sabrina Bridge The force said the hundreds of volunteers supporting the investigation was an ""unprecedented response"". Searches are ongoing, but police have asked people to ""kindly stay away"" from the area so officers and divers can work ""without distraction"". People have been asked to check CCTV video, dashcams and garden sheds. Mr Jones' aunt, Jackie Rogers, said a ""small army"" was carrying out house-to-house inquires in and around Hylton Road and were determined to ""find our boy"". Mrs Rogers said the teenager sent a Facebook message to a friend at 03:46, but no-one had heard from him since. This video can not be played Emergency services are searching for Thomas Jones The student, from Bromsgrove, was starting a primary teaching course at the University of Worcester. He had only moved on 16 September. Divers from South Wales Search and Rescue have searched the river near Worcester Rowing Club on Grandstand Road. Allow Twitter content?

Bodyguard keeps critics on tenterhooks,"The Bodyguard finale saw David Budd (Richard Madden) bloodied but not bowed Hit BBC drama Bodyguard kept an average 10.4 million viewers on tenterhooks as the series drew to a close on Sunday. The audience reached its peak - 11 million - in its final five minutes. The overnight ratings make the show - the brainchild of Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio - the most watched drama of the year so far. In fact, it is the biggest overnight drama figure since 10.5 million saw Downton Abbey's series two finale in November 2011. Allow Instagram content?

Unanswered questions from Bodyguard No BBC drama has drawn a bigger audience since Doctor Who, whose Christmas Day episode in 2008 was seen by 11.7 million people. The most watched programme of 2018 so far is ITV's broadcast of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia, which drew an average audience of 24.3 million. That figure did not take into account the number of people watching in pubs or on outdoor big screens. On the iPlayer, episode one of The Bodyguard had received 7.3m requests by Monday lunchtime, a record for any programme on the BBC's catch-up service. The series finale helped drive BBC iPlayer's biggest day ever with over 12.6m requests on Sunday. Without giving anything away, it's fair to say the Bodyguard finale served up a big helping of shock and suspense. Writer Jed Mercurio told the BBC he was ""humbled, delighted and grateful"" at the show's success and credited ""the magnetism of the leads"". He added: ""I don't think you can plan for success, all you can do is create something you think people will be interested in."" On talk of a second series, he said: ""We're just starting those talks, it's still too early to say."" Star Richard Madden - who played the show's ex-soldier turned protection officer David Budd - retweeted a thank you from the BBC to everyone who was watching the ""epic finale"". Anjli Mohindra, who played suicide bomber Nadia, praised Mercurio for putting so many female actors in powerful roles in the show. ""I do believe Jed Mercurio wrote a list of those roles as gender neutral and the right person with the right energy got the job,"" she told the BBC. This video can not be played Bodyguard actor Ash Tandon, who played DCI Sharma, on whether the series will return Director John Strickland had whipped up fans ahead of the broadcast by tweeting lyrics from Frank Sinatra's My Way. He posted: ""For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels. ""The record shows he took the blows and did it his way."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The director of BBC content, Charlotte Moore, praised the finale for the way it ""gripped the nation and got everyone talking... in a display of masterful storytelling"". Simon Heath the CEO and creative director of World Productions said: ""At a time when we're told that linear TV is dying, it's been thrilling to see the number of viewers flocking to watch Bodyguard live. We're so grateful for all their support."" So what did the critics make of it all? ""If the nation's heart rate could have been monitored during the mind-blowing finale of BBC1's Bodyguard,it would have been off the scale,external."" ""There were moments last night where, for a good 30 seconds or so, I genuinely held my breath... Don't get me wrong, there were moments of genuinely ludicrous action... Butis it the best new drama we've had in years and the best thing on TV in 2018? Yes, ma'am,external."" Was the role of Gina McKee's character Comm Anne Sampson among the loose ends? ""There is a fine line between great drama and absurdity, and there were moments when Bodyguard and its bloodied Caped Crusader nearly fell into total farce. Yet it never did. The tense scenesmanaged to be both gripping and touching,external."" ""Watching the final episode unfold felt a bit like witnessing a grade-A student open up their envelope on exam results day to find a string of Bs. It had tried too hard to impress, andended up collapsing under the weight of its own expectations,external."" ""Hallelujah for that last cracking 10 minutes of Bodyguard. Because up until then - sorry - I was finding this climax a touch underwhelming. There were many plot holes here but this was event TV and Mercurio, skilled at wrongfooting his viewers,gave us two final twists,external."" ""Ithas all been a retro-rush,external. Weekly episodes parcelled out like old times. Cliffhangers you talked about next day by the new watercooler, Twitter."" ""Bear in mind the story still has several tantalising loose ends... Not wishing to put pressure on Mercurio, butseries two can't come quickly enough,external."" Bodyguard has also been a major talking point on social media, with many users wondering about obscure story points and dangling plot threads. Allow Twitter content?

Children 'must be suicidal to get help',"Jess, 14, began self-harming at secondary school Children with mental health problems are not receiving treatment until they are in crisis and sometimes suicidal, doctors have told the BBC. A letter leaked to Panorama reveals at least one area's child and adolescent mental health service (Camhs) to be rationing care. Leading psychiatrist Jon Goldin described the service as ""not fit for purpose"". The government said it was investing an extra Â£1.4bn in child mental health. Jess, 14, first began feeling anxious three years ago, shortly after she went to secondary school. ""I felt like everyone was judging me all the timeâ¦ you start to get just horrible, horrible feelings of more and more and more worthlessness."" Her mum, Claire, tried to get help from Camhs, but was refused and Jess's health got worse. Claire began sleeping next to her daughter to try to keep her safe. Jess's mum Claire says she and Jess were ""crying out for help and support"" for a long time ""I was woken by Jess saying, 'I love you mummy'...  I knew that was alarm bells and I ran out of my bedroom door [and] she was standing with the noose around her neck."" Jess was taken to A&E for treatment and was finally seen by a Camhs crisis team. But by this time her health was very bad. Her mother took videos of her having psychotic episodes to show doctors, to prove how ill her daughter was. This video can not be played After Jess developed psychosis, she was taken to a secure child mental health hospital, and later sectioned. Jess tries to describe how these episodes felt, saying it was like ""all your negative thoughts and all your awful things that have happened over the last week all just collapsing into one hour, almost like putting you in a bottle and shaking you up and then letting you out again"". Eventually, Jess was detained at Chalk Hill, a specialist child mental health hospital in Sussex, for her own safety. She spent nine months as an inpatient, and says she was assaulted by a staff member. ""I was having a psychotic episode so I was like running on the floor, he grabbed my legs, pulled me back, did that and shook me upside down."" Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says concerns about treatment are taken ""extremely seriously"" and investigated ""as a matter of urgency"". Earlier this year, Jess was released and is now recovering back at home. She was told by the hospital that she had autism. ""I feel like if it had been diagnosed ages ago I probably would never even have had this journey. I would've just gone, 'OK, I need to do some therapy for Asperger's because it'll help me control my thoughts.'"" Her mum agrees.

Biggest US tariffs on China take effect,"The latest raft of trade tariffs mark an escalation in the trade war between the US and China China has accused the US of trade bullying after a new round of US tariffs on Chinese goods kicked in. The US imposed tariffs on a further $200bn ($152bn) worth of Chinese products, the largest round yet in the escalating trade war between the economic superpowers. The tariffs are in response to what the US says are unfair trading practices by China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $60bn of US goods. In an official white paper,as reported by Xinhua news agency,external, China said the US was employing ""trade bullyism practices"", ""intimidating other countries through economic measures"", and hurting the global economy. China has also accused the US of starting the ""largest trade war in economic history"". The latest move takes the total amount of Chinese imports hit by US tariffs since July up to $250bn. This means about half of all Chinese imports to the US are now subject to new duties. The latest escalation comes asChina cancelled further trade talks with the US,,externalaccording to media reports. The latest US duties apply to almost 6,000 items, making them the biggest round of trade tariffs yet from Washington. They affect handbags, rice and textiles, although some items such as smart watches and high chairs have been exempted. US companies importing the Chinese products in question will have to pay an additional 10% levy. The tax will rise to 25% from the start of 2019, unless the two countries agree a deal. In contrast, China is placing an additional 5% duty on US products including smaller aircraft, computers and textiles, and an extra 10% on goods such as chemicals, meat, wheat and wine. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? The early victims of Trump's trade war Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war US-China trade war: China fights back In total, the US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling$250bn worth of goods. It placed 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China in two separate rounds. In July, the White House increased charges on $34bn worth of Chinese products. Then last month, the escalating trade war moved up a gear when the US brought in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn. Beijing retaliated in kind. In response to the first two rounds of US tariffs, China imposed duties on $50bn of US products, targeting key parts of the president's political base, such as farmers. President Donald Trump says he wants to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"" and protect jobs. Tariffs, in theory, will make US-made products cheaper than imported ones, thereby encouraging consumers to buy American. The idea is that this will boost local businesses and support the national economy. This video can not be played What are tariffs and how do they affect us? But many US companies and industry groups have testified to the US Trade Representative's Office that theirbusinesses are being harmed.

Women seeking sperm donor online harassed,"Kirsti and Danielle say they have faced pressure Women using unregulated websites to find a sperm donor have been harassed and sent photos of miscarriages, the BBC has found. There are strict criteria for NHS artificial insemination and many women say private treatment is too expensive, so they turn to the internet. One woman told how a potential donor she met turned out to be married and had had a vasectomy. A fertility expert called for unregulated sites to be shut down. Online sperm donation is not illegal but it must be provided free, although expenses can be covered. Some online donors offer artificial insemination (AI) and others natural insemination (NI) - effectively unprotected sex with a stranger. ""Sarah"", 26, from Yorkshire, is single and said she wanted a baby without a partner. She told BBC Inside Out the cost of private treatment was too high and going online meant the treatment was free, although she did experience problems. She said: ""There have been a few idiots that you really wouldn't want to interact with, because they do harass you or start sending you images you really don't need to see."" Couple Kirsti and Danielle, from West Yorkshire, said they had faced pressure from men online to use NI. Kirsti said: ""Some people try to put you off by sending you messages of miscarriages and stuff, like if you do it that way, this will happen. ""So they are trying to change your mind for the method, so then you have sex with them."" Sarah did meet one man online but he was not as he seemed. ""Ultimately it turned out he was married and that he'd actually had a vasectomy, so was in no way viable at all,"" she said. ""It made me feel like I couldn't trust people on the site. ""I think they do need to be policed by a proper organisation, not just some random person out there because you don't know if they're safe because there's no proof of who you are on there."" Registered clinics carry out a strict screening process for sexually transmitted infections and infectious diseases and check potential donors' complete medical history. Alison Lamont, from one of these, Newcastle Fertility Centre, said it was difficult for the clinic to find donors. Dr Larisa Corda believes women are making themselves vulnerable Fertility expert Dr Larisa Corda said the growing trend of online sperm donation was ""really alarming"". She said: ""I think women are putting themselves in an incredibly vulnerable position medically speaking and secondly the potential for abuse."" She said she believed the cost was a real barrier to a lot of women and it meant they were putting themselves in vulnerable situations, such as using unregulated online donors. ""In the ideal world, I'd love to see them shut down because I think women's safety and welfare has to be paramount here,"" she said. Sperm donor hid it from his wife A mother on how she fell in love with her sperm donor Woman's social media search for sperm donor Dr Tamara Turner-Moore, senior lecturer in psychology at Leeds Beckett University, is involved ina study about online sperm donation,external, which she believes will be the first of its kind. It will look at the number of websites offering sperm, what the sites look like and the profiles of men using them and how they present themselves. The study will also look at women's experiences including those who have experienced sexual violence by online sperm donors. It hopes to get an idea of the number of such sites and the problems women face and raise awareness of them.

UN agency acts over unpaid internships row,"For the past 50 years, the WHO had expected its interns to work unpaid for up to six months The World Health Organization (WHO) is to offer paid internships for the first time to boost access for those applying from developing countries, the BBC has learnt. About 1,200 interns are accepted by one of the UN's largest agencies each year to support its work improving public health and tackling global diseases. Yet fewer than one in four of those chosen are from low-income countries. For the past 50 years, the WHO has expected its interns to move to their headquarters in Geneva, or one of its six regional offices, and work unpaid without travel expenses for up to six months, costing each person around Â£5,000 ($6,540). Unpaid internships 'lock some out of careers' Unpaid internships 'favour the rich' But after a campaign led by a former intern, the UN agency has agreed to provide full financial support for its young workers by no later than 2020. It told the BBC that targets are also in place to ensure that 50% of interns come from developing countries by 2022. ""It's unacceptable that 80% of WHO's work goes into supporting people in developing countries, yet only 20% of their interns come from them,"" says Ashton Barnett-Vanes, 29, a British doctor of English and Jamaican heritage from Wolverhampton, who started the campaign after his internship in 2012. He spent six years rallying the international community before eventually working with ministers across the Caribbean and Africa to persuade the 194 members of the UN to reach the agreement. ""All it took was for one country to say 'no' for it to be stopped,"" Dr Barnett-Vanes said. ""If you don't have trained staff, you can't develop an effective health system,"" he added. ""This change could see more than 500 young people each year from developing countries receive professional training that they can invest back into their communities."" Christabel Abewe says she would not been able to participate without the scholarship In 2015, Dr Barnett-Vanes and Tara Kedia, 27, a fellow former intern who now works in health policy in Washington DC, launched a crowdfunding campaign to create a $10,000 scholarship to enable two young people to intern at WHO. Christabel Abewe, 28, from Uganda, and Yassine Kalboussi, now 29, from Tunisia, were chosen. ""I wouldn't have been able to participate without the scholarship,"" Ms Abewe said. Yassine Kalboussi now works at the Tunisian Center for Public Health Dr Kalboussi agreed: ""It would have cost two full years of my salary."" ""Professional public health training is not currently provided in Tunisia,"" he added. ""I was one of only three interns from a low or middle-income country out of my group of 162 people."" Dr Kalboussi now serves on the executive committee of the Tunisian Center for Public Health, and Ms Abewe is researching the early detection of breast cancer in developing countries. More than 100 UN states have no participants each year, while 50 countries - including Angola, Barbados, Cambodia, Cuba and Libya - did not have a single WHO intern between 2015 and 2017, according to WHO data. Jamaica has had one WHO intern in the past two years. Dr Christopher Tufton, the Jamaican health minister, championed the campaign in Geneva. ""We should make it easier for young people to access these facilities and view it as an investment in the people who participate,"" he said. ""They should be valued."" The WHO has admitted its selection process is not ""merit-based"" and told the BBC that it recognised its unpaid internships were unfair. It said that funding for 50 interns per year had already been secured from the Wellcome Trust, a London-based medical research charity, but said ""more support was needed"". ""If we are to nurture the next generation of global leaders who truly come from all four corners of the earth, we need to facilitate them spending time with us,"" the WHO media team said. As a whole, the UN had more than 38,000 interns between 2009 and 2017, but more than 80% (about 30,400) were unpaid. Based on these figures, this would amount to nearly two million interns in the past 50 years - more than the entire population of Trinidad and Tobago. A report by the UN's Joint Inspection Unit found that interns had to ""endure harsh living conditions"" to last the duration of the programme or work ""after hours"" and informal jobs such as dog-walking to make ends meet. Headlines were made in 2015 when former UN intern David Hyde, who was then 22, was found sleeping in a tent on the shores of Lake Geneva after finding the cost of living in the city too expensive. He later admitted it was a stunt to spark a discussion about ""unjust unpaid work"". The WHO is the first UN agency to pass a resolution on internships that was brought about by its member states. As the UN General Assembly is about to start its session, the campaigners hope the issue of unpaid internships will be back on the agenda in light of this year's theme - ""Making the United Nations relevant to all people"". ""It's about time the UN solved this issue,"" said Dr Barnett-Vanes. ""It's within its gift to and it should follow WHO's lead. ""If the UN isn't willing to act, its member states should.""

New allegation against Trump court pick,"Judge Kavanaugh, who is awaiting confirmation, has denied both allegations A second woman has come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against President Donald Trump's US Supreme Court nominee, Brett Kavanaugh. Deborah Ramirez, a Yale university classmate of the judge, told the New Yorker that Mr Kavanaugh had exposed his genitals,externalat a dormitory party. The judge has denied both allegations, labelling the latest ""a smear"". The make-up of the nine-judge Supreme Court is crucial as it has the final say on often highly contentious laws. Before Judge Kavanaugh can take up the vacant seat, he has to be approved by the 21-strong Senate Judiciary Committee and then the whole Senate. Profile: Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's choice for Supreme Court Prof Christine Blasey Ford, who last week came forward alleging Brett Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her in the early 1980s,has agreed to testify before the Senate committee on Thursday. Senator Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the committee, called for the ""immediate postponement of any further proceedings"" relating to Judge Kavanaugh's nomination in an letter sent to the committee's Republican chairman on Sunday evening. Ms Ramirez alleges the incident occurred when she was a freshman at Yale University alongside Judge Kavanaugh during the 1983-4 academic year. She says they were both taking part in a drinking game at a dormitory party where people sat in a circle and selected others to drink. #WhyIDidntReport supports Professor Ford The truth about false assault accusations Could Kavanaugh confirmation be derailed? She says at one point, a plastic penis was pointed in her direction by one man, and later another exposed himself directly. ""I remember a penis being in front of my face,"" she said. ""I knew that's not what I wanted, even in that state of mind."" Ms Ramirez said she was mocked and taunted when she remarked it wasn't real, and then ended up touching the genitals while attempting to push the man away. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out ""I wasn't going to touch a penis until I was married,"" she said, referring to her devout Catholic upbringing. ""I was embarrassed and ashamed and humiliated."" She says she remembers Judge Kavanaugh standing to her right and laughing, pulling up his pants. The article says the 53-year-old acknowledges gaps in her memory caused by alcohol that night, which is said to have made her hesitant to come forward when contacted. The journalists behind the piece, Ronan Farrow and Jane Mayer, say they contacted dozens of classmates to try to corroborate Ms Ramirez's account. Three former students, who were not independent eyewitnesses, recalled being told or discussing the incident in vague terms at the time. Trump challenges Kavanaugh accuser Why is the US top court so important? Who are the justices? Two males allegedly involved in the incident disputed her account, alongside several other classmates, adding the allegation against Judge Kavanaugh was ""completely out of character"". In a statement, the Supreme Court nominee strongly denied the allegation. ""This alleged event from 35 years ago did not happen,"" he said. ""The people who knew me then know that this did not happen, and have said so. ""This is a smear, plain and simple. I look forward to testifying on Thursday about the truth, and defending my good name - and the reputation for character and integrity I have spent a lifetime building - against these last-minute allegations."" A White House spokeswoman says the administration stands by the nominee, labelling the allegation ""the latest in a co-ordinated smear campaign by the Democrats designed to tear a good man down"". The White House then releaseda further statement highlighting perceived weaknesses and uncertainties within the New Yorker's account,external. Prof Ford alleges Judge Kavanaugh tried to drunkenly remove her clothing, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth at a high school party when she was 15 and he was 17. Lawyers for Christine Blasey Ford have spent days negotiating terms for her testimony Some Republicans, including President Trump, have accused her and Democratic politicians of deliberately trying to delay and obstruct the judge's confirmation using the allegations. Michael Avenatti, a US lawyer known for representing adult film actress Stormy Daniels in her cases against President Trump, has alleged on Twitter that he is representing a third woman with ""credible information"" regarding Judge Kavanaugh and the alleged witness to Prof Ford's assault, Mark Judge.

Biggest US tariffs on China to take effect,"The latest raft of trade tariffs mark an escalation in the trade war between the US and China China has accused the US of trade bullying after a new round of US tariffs on Chinese goods kicked in. The US imposed tariffs on a further $200bn ($152bn) worth of Chinese products, the largest round yet in the escalating trade war between the economic superpowers. The tariffs are in response to what the US says are unfair trading practices by China. Beijing has retaliated with tariffs on $60bn of US goods. In an official white paper,as reported by Xinhua news agency,external, China said the US was employing ""trade bullyism practices"", ""intimidating other countries through economic measures"", and hurting the global economy. China has also accused the US of starting the ""largest trade war in economic history"". The latest move takes the total amount of Chinese imports hit by US tariffs since July up to $250bn. This means about half of all Chinese imports to the US are now subject to new duties. The latest escalation comes asChina cancelled further trade talks with the US,,externalaccording to media reports. The latest US duties apply to almost 6,000 items, making them the biggest round of trade tariffs yet from Washington. They affect handbags, rice and textiles, although some items such as smart watches and high chairs have been exempted. US companies importing the Chinese products in question will have to pay an additional 10% levy. The tax will rise to 25% from the start of 2019, unless the two countries agree a deal. In contrast, China is placing an additional 5% duty on US products including smaller aircraft, computers and textiles, and an extra 10% on goods such as chemicals, meat, wheat and wine. US-China trade row: What has happened so far? The early victims of Trump's trade war Six ways China could retaliate in a trade war US-China trade war: China fights back In total, the US has imposed three rounds of tariffs on Chinese products this year, totalling$250bn worth of goods. It placed 25% tariffs on $50bn worth of imports from China in two separate rounds. In July, the White House increased charges on $34bn worth of Chinese products. Then last month, the escalating trade war moved up a gear when the US brought in a 25% tax on a second wave of goods worth $16bn. Beijing retaliated in kind. In response to the first two rounds of US tariffs, China imposed duties on $50bn of US products, targeting key parts of the president's political base, such as farmers. President Donald Trump says he wants to stop the ""unfair transfers of American technology and intellectual property to China"" and protect jobs. Tariffs, in theory, will make US-made products cheaper than imported ones, thereby encouraging consumers to buy American. The idea is that this will boost local businesses and support the national economy. This video can not be played What are tariffs and how do they affect us?

Blood scandal inquiry 'must uncover truth',"This video can not be played ""I hope I'm still alive when this ends"" Emotional testimonies from people infected with HIV and hepatitis have been heard at the start of the inquiry into the contaminated blood scandal. The public inquiry is looking at how thousands of NHS patients were given infected blood products during the 1970s and 1980s in what has been dubbed the worst-ever NHS treatment disaster. In a video played to the inquiry, one man described how he felt he lost his entire life after finding out at the age of 43 that he had been infected with hepatitis C when he was a child. He was given an injection of blood products when he was eight for a swollen knee that was misdiagnosed as haemophilia. ""I lost everything. I lost my whole life the day I found out - everything ended,"" he explained. 'I don't want him to have died in vain' Both my husbands died from scandal 'I gave birth, and got Hepatitis C' With her identity hidden, one woman said she became infected with HIV through her husband who was a haemophiliac, and who had been given contaminated blood. She said when they found out they were left stunned and devastated. ""This was the mid-1980s and the climate of fear, discrimination and stigma associated with HIV and Aids was horrendous,"" she added. ""We coped the best we could. We were silenced, and we kept quiet."" Another victim, a widow, whose husband John died of Aids in 1994 and who also had hepatitis C, said: ""I feel we have been treated very badly. Nobody has listened to us over the years."" There have been previous inquiries into the scandal, but this is the first UK-wide public inquiry that can compel witnesses to testify. It comes after decades of campaigning by victims, who claim the risks were never explained and the scandal was subsequently covered up. This video can not be played Barbara, wife of one of the contaminated blood victims, says the inquiry is ""too little, too late"" About 5,000 people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders are believed to have been infected with HIV and hepatitis viruses over a period of more than 20 years - nearly 3,000 of them have since died. This was because they were injected with blood products used to help their blood clot. It was a new treatment introduced in the early 1970s. Before then patients faced lengthy stays in hospital to have transfusions, even for minor injuries. Britain was struggling to keep up with demand for the treatment - known as clotting agent Factor VIII - and so supplies were imported from the US. But much of the human blood plasma used to make the product came from donors such as prison inmates, who sold their blood. The blood products were made by pooling plasma from up to 40,000 donors, and concentrating it. People who underwent blood transfusions were also exposed to the contaminated blood - as many as 30,000 people may have been infected. By the mid-1980s the products started to be heat-treated to kill the viruses. But questions remain about how much was known before this, and why some contaminated products remained in circulation. Screening of blood products began in 1991 and by the late 1990s, synthetic treatments for haemophilia became available, removing the infection risk. Steve Dymond is now in his early 60s. He initially had only mild symptoms of haemophilia and led an active life. During the 1980s his health began to suffer. His muscles were sore, his joints ached and he was always exhausted. After going to hospital following a minor hand injury in the mid-1980s, he was told he had been treated with Factor VIII that had not been heat-treated. The concern was that he may have been exposed to HIV. At the time it took 18 months to get a diagnosis - a wait that his wife Su Gorman said put their lives on hold. He was given the all-clear, but in the 1990s was diagnosed with hepatitis C. He is now clear of hepatitis C, although his health has continued to suffer. Two years ago he suffered a near-fatal stomach bleed, has suffered hearing loss and has a damaged liver, leaving him at risk of cancer. He said people have been ""betrayed and lied to"" throughout, with the government, health professionals and drug companies all guilty of trying to avoid responsibility. ""It is difficult to try to imagine - even though there is a public inquiry - how they will be able to get past these walls of obfuscation,"" said Mr Dymond. The government has been strongly criticised for dragging its heels. There have been previous inquiries. One was led by Labour peer Lord Archer of Sandwell and was privately funded. It held no official status and was unable to force witnesses to testify or force the disclosure of documents. Meanwhile, the Penrose Inquiry, a seven-year investigation launched by the government in Scotland, was criticised as a whitewash when it was published in 2015. Greater Manchester mayor and former health secretary Andy Burnham has repeatedly called for a probe into what happened. Mr Burnham said he was prepared to approach the police about the issue Mr Burnham claimed in the House of Commons last year that a ""criminal cover-up on an industrial scale"" had taken place. The government announced there would be an inquiry only after it faced a possible defeat in a vote on an emergency motion. The inquiry could last more than two years. Payments have been made to some of the people who were infected - the first fund was set up as long ago as 1989. But if the new inquiry finds culpability, it opens the door to victims seeking large compensation payouts through the courts. Retired judge Sir Brian Langstaff, who is leading the inquiry, said it marked the start of something which several people had campaigned for over many years. He said there had already been more than 100,000 documents submitted, with the prospect of lots more to come. Speaking at the start of the inquiry, he said if the campaigners were right there was a ""real chance"" the numbers affected could rise as there would be people out there who did not yet know they had been infected. ""It is a truly sobering thought,"" he added. Liz Carroll, chief executive of The Haemophilia Society, called on the inquiry to work diligently to ""uncover the truth, bring justice and ultimately closure for victims and their families"". ""This scandal devastated generations of people with haemophilia and other bleeding disorders. ""Our members have waited decades for this to be properly investigated.""

Why it's OK to have 'bad manners'Chloe fulfils fashion dream and film roleInstagram cleaner 'making chores fun',"It is common to hear complaints about the behaviour of others, but who gets to decide what good manners really are? From trains to theatres to restaurants, the rules guiding our actions in public are often described as ""common sense"". And yet the line between ""acceptable"" and ""unacceptable"" behaviour varies across person and place. Think of the rows that frequently crop up about apparently mundane issues likewhether it's OK to apply make-up on trainsor toplay musicoruse your phone in a restaurant.,external Instead of saying that good behaviour is ""simply a question of manners"", should we be asking whether it's reasonable to expect others to conform to our ideals? At their most basic level, manners are a set of shared rules that help us show consideration for other people, rather than acting only in self-interest. This meaning can be traced all the way back to the Dutch scholar Erasmus and his 1530 text On Good Manners for Children, which encouraged an end to unhygienic practices like spitting and touching food. On one level, then, behaviour policing is a way to reinforce social rules that genuinely aim to make public space cleaner, safer and better for all. But manners can also be based on majority opinion and used to exert power. For example, whereas toenail clipping in public is clearly unsavoury, arguing that make-up should only be applied in private has a less rational basis. This can be seen as part of a wider urge to control the way other people use public space. One place where manners come sharply into focus is the theatre, where audiences are usually expected to sit in silence, in close proximity. Historically this was not always the case. In the 19th Century, audiences were retrained with new rules of behaviour favoured by elites. Previously free to engage with performances loudly and spontaneously, suddenly audiences were being told how to behave - through programme notes, posters and even getting lectured by those on stage. Now a similar thing is happening again. Audiences are increasingly being shamed forbringing in food,talking, and even usingiPadsandphones. But in my study of online guides to theatre etiquette, I found that the way people view such rules actually varies widely. For example, although many people think phones must be turned off completely, others say that silent mode is fine. ""Bad"" behaviour in theatre is often met with accusations of selfishness and a lack of consideration for others. Orlando Bloom halted a theatre performance of Killer Joe to ask someone to put away their iPad, according to audience members Yet it was apparent that people have different expectations - with some people preferring a ""dignified"" event, while others want a more ""sociable"" occasion. One of the biggest areas of disagreement is where to draw the line between appropriate and inappropriate levels of enthusiasm. Audiences have been criticised for singing along at musicals, cheering and laughing in the wrong places, or giving too many standing ovations. Those attending the show Motown the Musical in London last year were asked not to sing unless directed by the cast and to""moderate your enthusiasm"" while in the theatre,external. Another problem can be that some theatre-goers are especially quick to judge those who aren't just like them. It is a point illustrated by the American playwright Dominique Morisseau, who wrote about the experience of attending the theatre as a black woman andbeing asked to ""keep it down"",external. Although everyone has a different vision of acceptable behaviour, people tend to believe their own viewpoint is ""common sense"". The word ""obvious"" came up repeatedly when I was researching how people decide what is right and wrong. Discussing theatre food bans, one person might say it is clearly ""totally unacceptable"" to bring in any food or drink, while another might suggest not being allowed to is obviously ""ridiculous"". There is also a danger that rules intended to promote consideration for others actually fail to achieve their aim. For example, expecting theatre audiences to ""go to the toilet before the performance, never during"" ignores those with Crohn's disease, who may need to visit the bathroom regularly. And, astheatre-maker and comedian Jess Thomexplains, staying totally silent is also impossible for people with conditions like Tourette's syndrome, which provokes verbal and physical tics. A response to this has been anew theatre trend for relaxed performances, which allow audiences to speak, eat, drink, and move around as needed. What's wrong with doing make-up on a train? Breastfeeding mum forced to stand on train The lies we tell ourselves to avoid giving up a seat But should we expect people to conform to social norms, even if it means they are excluded as a result? It is a question which goes beyond theatre to all aspects of public life. For example, in America, graduations have resulted infamilies being criticised for cheering too loudly,externaland ""ruining"" the traditional solemnity of the event. Shaming strangers for their behaviour has many unanticipated real-world consequences. A survey of new mothers in Scotland found that a quarter had been made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public. It is a response which could help explain the relatively low rate of breastfeeding in the UK. More like this Would a bigger house make you happier? How a 'concrete floor' could get more women into power Are our online lives about to become 'private' again? What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood There is a clear need to be considerate of others and to conform to social rules, particularly when their behaviour is a risk to others. But deciding what is ""acceptable"" can also mean making a judgement about what we should prioritise when it comes to happily coexisting. Should it be the preferences of those who want their experiences of travel, dining, and art to be free from annoying disturbances? Or the rights of those with noisy young children, disabilities, or simply a different set of values? For most of us, encountering moments of bad behaviour is a fleeting problem. Maybe the most considerate thing we can do is to try not to be so quick to judge. About this piece This analysis piece wascommissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

Chloe fulfils fashion dream and film roleInstagram cleaner 'making chores fun',"On the catwalk: Chloe was proud of herself for getting through a tricky plan The girl who won hearts with her ""wear odd socks for Down's syndrome"" video has landed her first film role. Five year-old Chloe Lennon's video clocked up millions of hits back in March whenshe set out to raise awareness for the condition. Since then she has started working with a model agency and has been proving there is nothing she cannot do. After shooting campaigns for two high-street fashion stores, she has just been signed up for a film. Chloe, from Irvine in North Ayrshire, is preparing to perform in a Scottish short film this month. The casting call did not specify any disability and Chloe beat all the other candidates to the role. Chloe modelled in a show featuring the designs of former Girls Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh Her mum Jade told the BBC: ""Last Monday I got an email saying her agent took a chance with it. They were specifically looking for a little Scottish girl. No mention of disability or a disabled model or Down's syndrome. ""I had to send a video of her reading a bit of the script."" Just two days later, Jade was told Chloe was booked for the job. Jade is determined Chloe's condition won't hold her back She said: ""The agency were so chuffed at another breakthrough for disability - because they hadn't asked for a disabled actor. ""So of all the Scottish five-year-olds, they picked Chloe, not on tokenism but on credit. They liked the way she acted."" ""It'll be another new experience for her - filming over two or three days. She calls it her 'pretending'. ""I can't wait for everyone to find out all about it when we are able to reveal the details."" After starting school in August, Chloe has been fitting modelling assignments into her spare time. Chloe enjoyed the whole backstage experience Chloe took to the model life She walked the runway at London Fashion Week in the Mini-Mode children's fashion show. Her mum said she worked hard to be ready. ""Five minutes a day after school we practised her walk,"" she said. ""Chloe has low muscle tone because of her Down's syndrome and so we practised to make sure she was happy."" And it was just as intense as any fashion show. ""It was hectic, outfits flying around, children running about, hair and make-up going on,"" Jade said.. ""But it was brilliant. Chloe loved it. She knows her model walk, she stands up straight and looks forward with her model face on. ""After she came off she ran up to me and said she'd done so well."" This video can not be played 'Hi everyone, my name is Chloe' She added; ""She knows what's going on, she did everything like she was supposed to, stopped, turned the same way. She knew she had achieved something. She was very proud of herself."" Chloe will become a familiar face when her two fashion campaigns go live. And she is getting more confident by the day. Chloe has done several photo shoots now Chloe is impressing the designers who are booking her She has spent the last six months taking part in photoshoots to give her experience, and according to Jade, she has transformed. She said: ""Chloe has always been sociable but with being in this industry she has just blossomed and it is through getting used to meeting different people. ""And it's helped her speech - I can't explain how much it has helped her. From doing little audition videos, it has helped her in so many other ways in her development."" Chloe's agency - Zebedee models - thinks she has what it takes to be a massive success. Director Zoe Proctor said: ""She has the most adorable personality. She is an open, sweet and very charming little girl. ""In this industry you have got to have personality and take direction well and Chloe has everything going for her. That's why she keeps getting snapped up for things.""

"France dismantles toxic car tyre 'reef'Instead of teeming with marine life, the tyres were leaking toxic chemicals and fish avoided them.Europe","The tyres were sunk in the 1980s but are being removed again in stages Teams of divers are painstakingly lifting an artificial reef made of tens of thousands of old car tyres from the seafloor south of France, after it was found to spread pollution from toxic chemicals. The operation is costing well over a million euros ($1.1m; Â£898,000) and is part-funded by the tyre manufacturer Michelin as well as the French state. The divers are supported by a boat with lifting equipment. Fish had been avoiding the area. Local fishing association leader Denis Genovese told AFP news agency that some types of fish swam around the collection of tyres, while ""no species really got used to it"". Once upon a time it was seen as a double solution - a way to get rid of old tyres, while creating habitats for marine life and stimulating marine organisms to grow on the rubber. In the 1980s local authorities agreed 25,000 tyres should be sunk into the waters 500m (1,640 feet) from the shore between Cannes and Antibes, on the French Riviera. In 2005, researchers found the tyres were leaking chemicals including heavy metals - a risk to human life - into the environment. Tyres 'major source' of ocean pollution All the plastic you can and cannot recycle In 2015, authorities told journaliststhe tyres were thought to be ""completely inert"" and to present no risk at the time they were sunk,external. Another documented issue is that stacks of tyres can collapse or disintegrate, disturbing life in the area. A first set of 25,000 tyres was removed in 2015, with 10,000 set to be lifted in the coming weeks and more next year. The operation is costing well over a million euros Artificial reefs using tyres have also been sunk in other parts of the world. Tens of thousands of tyres have been removed from the seabed at Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Around Gibraltar in the 1970s, the tyres were washed away by currents. Ships, cars and concrete blocks were later used instead.

Bodyguard keeps critics on tenterhooksA spoiler-free round up of reaction to the conclusion of BBC One's hit drama.Entertainment & Arts,"The Bodyguard finale saw David Budd (Richard Madden) bloodied but not bowed Hit BBC drama Bodyguard kept an average 10.4 million viewers on tenterhooks as the series drew to a close on Sunday. The audience reached its peak - 11 million - in its final five minutes. The overnight ratings make the show - the brainchild of Line of Duty creator Jed Mercurio - the most watched drama of the year so far. In fact, it is the biggest overnight drama figure since 10.5 million saw Downton Abbey's series two finale in November 2011. Allow Instagram content?

Unanswered questions from Bodyguard No BBC drama has drawn a bigger audience since Doctor Who, whose Christmas Day episode in 2008 was seen by 11.7 million people. The most watched programme of 2018 so far is ITV's broadcast of England's World Cup semi-final against Croatia, which drew an average audience of 24.3 million. That figure did not take into account the number of people watching in pubs or on outdoor big screens. On the iPlayer, episode one of The Bodyguard had received 7.3m requests by Monday lunchtime, a record for any programme on the BBC's catch-up service. The series finale helped drive BBC iPlayer's biggest day ever with over 12.6m requests on Sunday. Without giving anything away, it's fair to say the Bodyguard finale served up a big helping of shock and suspense. Writer Jed Mercurio told the BBC he was ""humbled, delighted and grateful"" at the show's success and credited ""the magnetism of the leads"". He added: ""I don't think you can plan for success, all you can do is create something you think people will be interested in."" On talk of a second series, he said: ""We're just starting those talks, it's still too early to say."" Star Richard Madden - who played the show's ex-soldier turned protection officer David Budd - retweeted a thank you from the BBC to everyone who was watching the ""epic finale"". Anjli Mohindra, who played suicide bomber Nadia, praised Mercurio for putting so many female actors in powerful roles in the show. ""I do believe Jed Mercurio wrote a list of those roles as gender neutral and the right person with the right energy got the job,"" she told the BBC. This video can not be played Bodyguard actor Ash Tandon, who played DCI Sharma, on whether the series will return Director John Strickland had whipped up fans ahead of the broadcast by tweeting lyrics from Frank Sinatra's My Way. He posted: ""For what is a man, what has he got? If not himself, then he has naught. To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels. ""The record shows he took the blows and did it his way."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Labour members' Brexit vote wording agreed,"Labour's Brexit spokesman has insisted the party could back another referendum that offered voters the chance to stay in the EU. Sir Keir Starmer said the party was ""certainly not ruling out"" such a move. He was speaking after shadow chancellor John McDonnell said he thought any vote should be on the terms of a Brexit deal rather than staying in the EU. Mr McDonnell later said ""all options"" were on the table if it came to another referendum. Kuenssberg: Labour's conference '360' Labour: We'll make firms give staff shares Labour plans to give tenants more power Labour vows to end free schools programme On Tuesday, Labour's conference in Liverpool will debate and vote on a motion to keep a new referendum ""on the table"" if Labour is unable to force a general election. Key delegates - including Sir Keir and leading figures from some trade unions - decided the text at a meeting which lasted several hours on Sunday evening. The final draft for the vote says: ""If we cannot get a general election, Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote."" Since the draft was finalised, key figures have faced questions on whether it will include the option to stay in the EU. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr McDonnell said that Labour would continue to respect the 2016 referendum, in which people voted by 51.9% to 48.1% for the UK to leave the European Union, adding: ""If we are going to respect the referendum it will be about the deal."" And he said a general election was needed so a Labour government could strike a Brexit deal with the EU which ""brings the country together"". But later, Sir Keir told the BBC the party was deliberately not being ""prescriptive"" about the question that could be posed in another referendum, saying it was ""certainly not ruling out"" the option to stay in the EU. Backbench MP David Lammy, a prominent campaigner for a second referendum, said it would be ""farcical"" to have a vote without the option of remaining in the EU. This video can not be played Labour conference: what do party members want? After the late-night meeting on Sunday night, a Labour source told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg: ""There was consensus in the room opposing the Tories' chaotic approach to the Brexit negotiations... and that a general election should be called as soon as any deal is voted down by parliament. ""It was then agreed that if we cannot get a general election Labour must support all options remaining on the table, including campaigning for a public vote."" The Labour Party has never formally rejected the option of a so-called people's vote on Brexit, but both Mr Corbyn and his deputy, Tom Watson, have indicated they would prefer it to be resolved by a general election. On Twitter, Prime Minister Theresa May said Labour's approach sought to ""Britain back to square one - betraying all those who voted in the 2016 EU referendum"". By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent After what I am told was six re-drafts and five and a half hours of discussion, wording that could bridge the gap between campaigners for a new referendum and a reluctant leadership was agreed. But what was left out of the conference motion is as important as what went in. The leadership had to agree that wording which restricted a future referendum to ""the terms of Brexit"" had to go. This means that the party could, in theory, back a referendum that gave voters the option of remaining in the EU and not just a vote on the final deal. Campaigners for a new vote see this as significant step forward. But allies of Jeremy Corbyn say the wording doesn't commit him to backing a referendum as it is still only ""an option on the table"" if Theresa May refuses calls for a general election. So still a fudge of sorts - but one with a slightly sweeter taste for supporters of a new vote who firmly believe that ""all options"" will become their option. However, even the hint of a new referendum will allow the Conservatives to claim that Labour weren't serious enough about respecting the previous one. Pressed on the issue on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, Mr Corbyn, who has said he is not calling for another referendum, said ""our preference"" is for a general election. He said that would then allow a Labour government to negotiate the UK's future relationship with Europe. ""Let's see what comes out of conference. Obviously I'm bound by the democracy of our party,"" he added. This video can not be played David Lammy: ""Can you hear us Jeremy Corbyn?"" Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab ruled out a snap election this autumn, saying the idea was ""for the birds"". The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and Theresa May has been negotiating with other EU leaders on the UK's future relationship with the bloc. Allow Twitter content?

Talks hit a stumbling block at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday when EU leaders rejected Mrs May's plan for Brexit - known as theChequers agreement,external, and she warned them she was ready to walk away rather than accept a ""bad deal"". By Newsnight political editor Nick Watt The wrangling has led to much soul searching in the new Labour movement taking shape under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. The Momentum group, established to shore up his leadership at the grassroots, has been torn between pro-European instincts and loyalty to Corbyn. He is heir to the Bennite tradition which regards the founding principles of the EU as anathema to Socialism. Momentum was thinking of taking a neutral position had the motion been difficult for Jeremy Corbyn. One Momentum source told me that, while the organisation is strongly pro-European, it would do nothing to jeopardise its main goal; the election of a truly Socialist government. The People's Vote campaign are reasonably content. They know their greatest weakness in Liverpool is they are seen as a bunch of unreconstructed Blairites seeking to thwart the will of the people on the EU and undermine Corbyn in the bargain. The campaign believe they have shown they have far wider support. They hope to have created a space in November for Labour to be able to endorse a referendum on the grounds that warring Conservative MPs agree on one thing - there must be no general election before 2022.

Kuenssberg: Does it matter?,"By the time you read this, Labour delegates might have decided what to do. Or perhaps not. Their meetings have form. They've been discussing how to find a decent compromise on a Brexit vote at conference since 18:30 BST. These are issues that have been running hot for months and months, and I am writing this five hours later. What are they arguing about? A significant chunk - polling suggests a hefty majority of members - of the party would like to see another vote on the European Union, with the party's leanings overwhelmingly towards Remain. Jeremy Corbyn vowed he would be a different kind of leader and listen to his party's membership. So what's the problem? Surely he should just say ""sure"", and acquiesce? Guess what, it's not nearly so simple. First, repeat again and again, any party's members are not the same as their voters, and potential voters. That's always so. But it is clear as day now. Because while Labour MPs and members are overwhelmingly among those who voted Remain, millions of people who had voted Labour put their cross in the Leave box. To campaign immediately for another EU referendum risks infuriating huge swathes of voters, and opens Labour up to accusations from their opponents that they are insulting voters and ignoring democracy. The second reason why another referendum is only being reluctantly considered is that it's not clear how you actually get there. Referendums need legislation. They then need a Parliamentary process to decide questions. If there were to be a vote, should it be on the terms of a deal or no deal, or reopen the whole question of staying or leaving? Should it be straight away? Is it possible to do in the time given that we are due to be leaving the EU in about six months. Why does Labour think it would be able to get a better deal than the Tories in any case? Those campaigning for the vote of course say they have answers to those questions. But many senior figures aren't convinced. One member of the shadow cabinet, frustrated, said it's not realistic to see how it could happen, and the People's Vote campaign is just like ""praying for a fairy godmother"". Another told me ""it's just a distraction"", and could even give Theresa May a way out if she ends up completely stuck. They believe the party has to be ""resolute"", and keep pushing, pushing and pushing for a general election instead. Neither of those are in the party's gift. But even theoretical choices matter in a time of such political turmoil. And it's an interesting test for a leader who transformed his party based on the promise of giving members more say. By the early hours, the leadership may have given party members some, but not all of what they want - a compromise motion that will give the party a chance to commit to some kind of vote. It won't be as explicit as some want. But remember last year the debate was not even fully permitted on the conference floor. Jeremy Corbyn's supporters were reluctant to allow any divisions to be displayed. So, however vague the compromise, however late tonight's discussions go, those who've been pushing the party to commit to another referendum for months are encouraged just to have got this far.

Deselecting Labour MPs set to be made easier,"Labour's annual conference is taking place in Liverpool Labour's annual conference has voted to make it easier for local party members to deselect sitting MPs. As well as lowering the threshold for forcing MPs to fight open selection battles, delegates also backed reforms to the rules governing Labour leadership contests. Both changes were comfortably backed at the party conference in Liverpool. But Momentum, which had been pushing for more extensive changes, described the measures as ""meagre"". Labour keeps option of fresh Brexit vote Labour: We'll make firms give staff shares The group, which was set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, backed the package as a compromise but said some key proposals had been ""watered down or blocked"", adding that the outcome ""could have been much worse"". Until now, Labour MPs faced a reselection contest only if 50% of a constituency's local branches and affiliated unions voted for it in a ""trigger ballot"". A proposal to cut this threshold to 33% won the backing of the party conference in Liverpool with 65% of delegates in favour. The deselection campaign is seen by some Labour MPs as an attempt to ""purge"" critics of Jeremy Corbyn. Two MPs on the right of the party - Frank Field, who quit the party's group in Parliament, and John Woodcock, who has resigned from the party - complained of a culture of bullying and intimidation in the party. Those on the left of the party say they are out of step with the direction of Labour and point to the fact Mr Field lost a vote of confidence among members of his local constituency party in Birkenhead in July. Other MPs including Kate Hoey and Gavin Shuker have recently lost no confidence votes, although these have no official force in the party and are not the same as ""trigger ballots"". Supporters of the expected new rules say they will end the ""job for life"" culture, while others said they did not go far enough. But calls during the debate for compulsory open selection contests before every general election were not heeded. Shuker vote 'not start of deselection' Why Corbyn allies want MP selection change Conference delegate Steve Arloff, from Bradford West Labour Party, said Labour MPs should not assume they have ""some God-given right to be selected unopposed, expecting it to be a job for life"". He went on: ""Many sitting MPs who have lost the respect and confidence of local parties cling on to their positions in Parliament with scant regard for the people who work their socks off to put them there. ""Hundreds of thousands of us members demand that things are done differently."" Unite general secretary Len McCluskey explained his union's position by saying it wanted to offer 100% support to Mr Corbyn. He said: ""The proposition being put forward by our leader is something I am prepared to trust. There are certain MPs who are almost asking to be deselected. ""They really don't want to be part of this exciting transformation that is taking place."" Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson pictured at the conference on Sunday Earlier, deputy leader Tom Watson told Sky News's Ridge On Sunday that mandatory reselection would be ""very destabilising for the party"". ""We are potentially close to a general election, maybe any day,"" said Mr Watson. ""What we don't want is MPs having to defend their positions in their local areas when they could be campaigning in Parliament for social policy that affects the many, not the few."" The rule change for future leadership contests does not alter the 10% threshold for the number of MPs' nominations which a candidate must gather to get on to the ballot paper. But it also requires them to get the backing of 5% of constituency parties or 5% of members of trade unions or affiliated organisations. By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent So what was Sunday's row over MP deselections at the Labour Party conference really all about? First, it speaks to the increasing tensions within the party's left wing on how best to solidify the changes Jeremy Corbyn has introduced. But what upset many left wing delegates was what they saw as an old fashioned stitch-up worthy of the Blair era. They were given a straight choice between accepting or rejecting the NEC compromise - and no opportunity to vote for open selections. Which brings us to the second point: the row tells us that there are now far more delegates on the left of the party than in previous years, even after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.

Children 'must be be suicidal to get help',"Jess, 14, began self-harming at secondary school Children with mental health problems are not receiving treatment until they are in crisis and sometimes suicidal, doctors have told the BBC. A letter leaked to Panorama reveals at least one area's child and adolescent mental health service (Camhs) to be rationing care. Leading psychiatrist Jon Goldin described the service as ""not fit for purpose"". The government said it was investing an extra Â£1.4bn in child mental health. Jess, 14, first began feeling anxious three years ago, shortly after she went to secondary school. ""I felt like everyone was judging me all the timeâ¦ you start to get just horrible, horrible feelings of more and more and more worthlessness."" Her mum, Claire, tried to get help from Camhs, but was refused and Jess's health got worse. Claire began sleeping next to her daughter to try to keep her safe. Jess's mum Claire says she and Jess were ""crying out for help and support"" for a long time ""I was woken by Jess saying, 'I love you mummy'...  I knew that was alarm bells and I ran out of my bedroom door [and] she was standing with the noose around her neck."" Jess was taken to A&E for treatment and was finally seen by a Camhs crisis team. But by this time her health was very bad. Her mother took videos of her having psychotic episodes to show doctors, to prove how ill her daughter was. This video can not be played After Jess developed psychosis, she was taken to a secure child mental health hospital, and later sectioned. Jess tries to describe how these episodes felt, saying it was like ""all your negative thoughts and all your awful things that have happened over the last week all just collapsing into one hour, almost like putting you in a bottle and shaking you up and then letting you out again"". Eventually, Jess was detained at Chalk Hill, a specialist child mental health hospital in Sussex, for her own safety. She spent nine months as an inpatient, and says she was assaulted by a staff member. ""I was having a psychotic episode so I was like running on the floor, he grabbed my legs, pulled me back, did that and shook me upside down."" Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, which runs the hospital, says concerns about treatment are taken ""extremely seriously"" and investigated ""as a matter of urgency"". Earlier this year, Jess was released and is now recovering back at home. She was told by the hospital that she had autism. ""I feel like if it had been diagnosed ages ago I probably would never even have had this journey. I would've just gone, 'OK, I need to do some therapy for Asperger's because it'll help me control my thoughts.'"" Her mum agrees. ""We were crying out for help and support for a very, very long time and she shouldn't have deteriorated to this level."" The number of under-18s seeking help for mental health problems is rising, with at least one in 10 children thought to have a diagnosable condition. Demand for Camhs services is up and some areas are struggling to meet demand. A leaked letter from Waltham Forest service in London, obtained by Panorama, states that for six months earlier this year it raised its threshold for treatment, so that only the most seriously ill children - such as those with psychosis - were treated. Staff at Waltham Forest Camhs were told in January they could only treat 'the most severe cases' North East London Foundation Trust, which runs Waltham Forest Camhs, says it has now lowered the threshold again, saying: ""We do not underestimate the level of challenge we are facing."" Panorama heard similar stories from staff working in other services. Only one in four children with a mental health condition currently receives treatment. One woman interviewed worked in Camhs for decades but recently left because of her concerns about the quality of care she was able to offer. ""My experience in the past eight to 10 years has been a real deterioration in children and adolescents' ability to access services - the thresholds have changed considerably."" The Association of Child Psychotherapists says it has heard of cases of children having to make multiple suicide attempts in order access care. Nick Waggett told Panorama: ""We do hear stories of children and young people having to have attempted suicide on a number of occasions actually before they are seen within the service. ""The problem is that then they're very ill and it actually becomes increasingly difficult to offer them an effective treatment."" The government says it is investing an extra Â£1.4bn in child mental health services, and ""transforming"" the service ""so that 70,000 more children a year have access to specialist mental health care by 2020-21"". But Labour's MP Luciana Berger, who sits on the health and social care committee, believes NHS services are spending the extra money elsewhere. ""In too many cases that money just isn't reaching the front line. I believe urgently we need to see those monies protected and ring-fenced."" According to the Care Quality Commission, evidence suggests the number of children visiting A&E for mental health treatmenthas more than doubled since 2010,external. Many services are failing to meet NHS guidelines for an out-of-hours crisis service. A Freedom of Information request from BBC Panorama has revealed that at least 1.5 million under-18s in England live in areas without 24/7 child mental health crisis care. Dr Jon Goldin, of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said the system was unable to meet the  demand: ""I have colleagues working all over the country who areâ¦ doing excellent work, the trouble is the services are very stretched. We're not meeting the need so in that sense it's not fit for purpose."" BBC Panorama, Kids in Crisis is on Monday 24 September at 20:30 BST on BBC One.
