Trump to arrive in UK for state visit,"This video can not be played The Queen: ""I am confident our common values and shared interests will continue to unite us"". President Donald Trump has praised the ""eternal friendship"" between the UK and US as he joined a state banquet at Buckingham Palace. The Queen said the countries were celebrating an alliance which had ensured the ""safety and prosperity of both our peoples for decades"". The president is in the UK for a three-day state visit, which includes the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. Earlier in the day,Mr Trump criticised the mayor of London. Hetweeted that Sadiq Khan,external- who had saidthe UK should ""not roll out the red carpet"",externalfor Mr Trump - was a ""stone cold loser"". But in his speech at the banquet, Mr Trump praised the courage of the British people during World War Two and called the Queen a ""great, great woman"". ""In that dark hour, the people of this nation showed the world what it means to be British,"" he said, adding that their bravery ensured that the destiny of the country ""remained in your own hands"". Mr Trump ended his speech with a toast to ""the eternal friendship of our people, the vitality of our nations and to the long-cherished and truly remarkable reign of Her Majesty the Queen"". The Queen praised the two countries' role in creating an assembly of international institutions that would ensure ""the horrors of conflict would never be repeated"". On Twitter before the banquet, Mr Trumppraised the welcome,externalfrom the Royal Family as ""fantastic"" and said the relationship with the UK is ""very strong"". He also saida post-Brexit trade deal could happen,externalonce the UK removed the ""shackles"", adding: ""Already starting to talk!"" Latest updates on President Trump's first day in UK In pictures: Trump's state visit to the UK Trump's UK visit: What's he bringing? Large-scale protests are planned in several UK cities during the three-day visit, including in London, where a ""national demonstration"" will start at Trafalgar Square at 11:00 on Tuesday. The Duchess of Cambridge was escorted into the banquet by US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace The American national anthem was played and Mr Trump was invited to inspect the guard of honour Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn - who boycotted the state dinner - is due to attend and speak at the London demonstration, a party spokesman has confirmed. Earlier,Mr Corbyn tweeted,external: ""Tomorrow's protest against Donald Trump's state visit is an opportunity to stand in solidarity with those he's attacked in America, around the world and in our own country - including, just this morning, Sadiq Khan."" Mr Trump's tweet about Mr Khan accused him of doing a ""terrible job"" as mayor, adding: ""[He] has been foolishly ""nasty"" to the visiting president of the United States, by far the most important ally of the United Kingdom. He is a stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London, not me."" By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent The contrast could not have been starker. The President of the United States received a warm welcome from the Queen and the Prince of Wales at Buckingham Palace. There were two 41-gun salutes - one for Mr Trump and another marking the 66th anniversary of the Queen's coronation on Sunday - as well as an honour guard of young Grenadiers resplendent in scarlet. At the same time, Mr Trump launched a verbal attack on the mayor of the city in which he is now a guest, calling Sadiq Khan ""a stone cold loser"" for questioning why the president had been granted a state visit. In truth, this is all of a piece for Mr Trump: he gets the pictures and the pageantry that he wants and will look good in his re-election campaign next year, and he gets to pick a fight with a liberal, Muslim politician that will play well with his base. Already this row is forcing those campaigning to be Britain's prime minister to define themselves against Mr Trump. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt criticised Mr Khan for his ""great discourtesy"". But Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the office of the mayor of London should be respected in the same way one respects the office of the president. This visit has only just begun and already the Great Disruptor is tweeting angry thoughts and breaching diplomatic niceties. Business as usual, you might think - only today he also happens to be a guest of the Queen, who rarely tweets and is always diplomatic. A spokesman for Mr Khan said ""childish insults"" should be beneath the US president, adding: ""Sadiq is representing the progressive values of London and our country, warning that Donald Trump is the most egregious example of a growing far-right threat around the globe."" House of Commons Speaker John Bercow and Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also boycotted the state banquet. Trump's visit: A barometer of political power Trump denies calling Meghan Markle 'nasty' Trump visit divides crowds at the palace The Duchess of Sussex did not attend following the birth of her son Archie, who is less than a month old. On Sunday, Mr Trumpdenied calling the duchess ""nasty"", despite him using the word on tape. But the guests included the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge as well as prominent Americans living in Britain. The Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall posed with their visitors in the morning room at Clarence House The president and first lady were given a tour of Westminster Abbey by the Dean of Westminster The US president made his mark in the distinguished visitors' book at Westminster Abbey As he stepped onto UK soil at Stansted Airport, Mr Trump was greeted by US Ambassador to the UK Woody Johnson and Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt. Tory leadership candidate Mr Hunt, who has spoken about the importance of the UK's relationship with the US, said Mr Trump mentioned to him ""some of his very strong views about the mayor of London"". Crowds were gathered outside Buckingham Palace as the president and first lady landed by helicopter shortly after midday. This video can not be played Trump shakes the Queen's hand The Queen presented Mr Trump with a first edition of Sir Winston Churchill's book The Second World War, from 1959, with gilt decorations and hand-sewn bindings in the colours of the US flag. He was also given a three-piece Duofold pen set decorated with an EIIR emblem, in a design made exclusively for the monarch. Mrs Trump received a specially commissioned silver box with a handcrafted enamel lid, decorated in royal blue with roses, thistles and shamrocks to represent the ceiling of Buckingham Palace's music room. After the private lunch, the Queen showed the couple American artefacts and other items from the Royal Collection. In a nod to the US leader's Scottish heritage, he was shown a bolt of Harris tweed.

The president signed the distinguished visitor's book in his customary black marker pen, describing the 13th Century church as a ""special place"". Their next stop was Clarence House, where they joined Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea. By Hamish Mackay, BBC News A quick walk around the crowd outside Buckingham Palace revealed the presence of supporters and detractors of Mr Trump - both equally strong in their views. Phillip Butah, from Essex, wearing a MAGA hat and describing himself and his companion as ""Trump activists"", says: ""We are so happy that he's here - this visit is long overdue."" Asked what they expect the UK to get from this visit, they reply: ""Trade deals."" Corey Wright, a 25-year-old American from Ohio, in London as a tourist, sees the visit in a similar light. ""I think the visit is good for the political environment,"" he says. ""I think that needs to be worked on and that's what he's here to do."" Auriel Granville - a climate activist from Wimbledon, south-west London - came dressed as the Statue of Liberty to protest against the president's visit. ""I don't think he should be received in this way - climate change should be top of our agenda and Donald Trump is a climate change denier,"" she said. Read more about the crowds outside the palace Talks between Mr Trump and outgoing Prime Minister Theresa May will begin on Tuesday. Although Mr Trump has spoken of his admiration for Mrs May, there are expected to be differences of opinion during their talks. The prime minister willraise the issue of climate change, with a government spokesman again saying on Monday the UK was ""disappointed by the US decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017"".

The US has blacklisted the Chinese firm for security reasons, whilethe UK may allow it to supply ""non-core"" components for its 5G network. The president's visit coincides with the commemorations for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings, which the Queen, Mr Trump and other heads of state will attend at Portsmouth on Wednesday. Airmen from the RAF Regiment formed a guard of honour for the couple Before the visit, President Trump toldthe Sunnewspaper he was backing Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson to be the next UK prime minister. He also toldthe Sunday Timesthat Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage - an arch critic of Mrs May - should be involved in the government's negotiations to leave the EU.

Four reasons why this Everest season went wrong,"Climbers pay a premium in order to climb the mountain Over the past two decades, the average annual death rate of climbers on Mount Everest has remained at about six. But this spring, at least10 people have already been reported dead or missing on the world's highest peak. This is also the season that saw a record 381 climbing permits issued by the Nepalese government. In reality, this means about 600 people were preparing to embark on the climb, with permit holders accompanied by support staff up the mountain. While overcrowding has been blamed for the increase in the number of deaths, there are also other factors at play. Many of the climbers began gathering at Everest base camp at the start of May. At the same time, the authorities were concerned about the knock-on effects of Cyclone Faniwhich had already struck India and Bangladesh. The weather deteriorated in the Nepalese Himalayas days after the cyclone, forcing the government to suspend all mountaineering activities for at least two days. Why the summit can get so crowded How deadly is Mount Everest? Queues not 'sole reason' for Everest deaths Nearly 20 tents at the camp were blown away by strong winds and after the warning, several climbers, who were already en route to some of the higher camps, returned to base camp. Prolonged bad weather meant that the practice of fixing bolted rope to assist climbers trying to reach the summit was delayed. British climber Robin Haynes Fisher (pictured) is among those who have died this year Meanwhile the crowd at base camp continued to build. Everest - which lies on the border between Nepal and China - can be reached from the Chinese side as well. However, the Chinese government issues fewer permits, and many mountaineering experts find the climb less interesting. After the ropes were fixed by mid-May, the first feasible clear-weather window was 19 and 20 May. But only a few teams chose to climb then while the majority waited for the second window - from 22 to 24 May. Mountaineering experts say this was when the crowd management went wrong. 23 May saw the maximum number of climbers on one day - more than 250. Climbers had to wait for hours below the summit - both on the way up and on the way down. Many of them were exhausted and their oxygen cylinders were running low. Nepal's mountaineering regulation requires expedition teams to have liaison officers on the mountains. This time 59 of them were appointed to accompany the teams but only five of them stayed until the final part of the climb. Some did not even turn up, while most of those who did went home after a few days at the base camp. A photograph showing a long tailback went viral on the internet These are often regular government officials who have no mountaineering experience, so they find it difficult to cope with the high altitude. They get paid by expedition teams and most of them are happy to stay at home. If all the liaison officials had stayed on the mountain, managing the crowd would have been much easier, a top government source at Everest base camp told the BBC. ""We could have spread the teams so that the first feasible window (19-20 May) would have seen more climbers and the pressure would have been less during the second window,"" they said. ""Since almost none of these liaison officials stayed, it became very difficult for the limited officials to handle this huge number of climbers."" Liaison officials not turning up has been an issue ailing Nepal's mountaineering industry for years now. Meera Acharya, head of the mountaineering section at Nepal's tourism ministry, said 80% of the appointed officials did go to the base camp this time. ""But I admit that not all of our liaison officials stayed there for long. We are aware of this issue and we are working to address it."" ""We do hear of deaths of climbers on Mount Kilimanjaro as well, why is Everest being singled out here?"" Mountaineering experts say there is also an increase in the number of inexperienced climbers joining the growing crowd on Everest. This time round, many of them had just one Sherpa guide with their team, officials at the base camp said. ""When you have a dangerous situation like this, one Sherpa will not be able to help you much because he will have to take care of himself."" Nepal has denied overcrowding is the sole reason for the rise in deaths Some of the mountaineers who successfully returned after summiting said they had seen climbers struggling because they were running out of oxygen - they had to wait much longer. ""This new generation of climbers, eager to bag the top and brag back home, didn't know enough to understand the difference between climbing Everest and Makalu (Mount Makalu, the 5th highest peak southeast of Everest),"" says Alan Arnette, an experienced mountaineer and writer on mountaineering issues. ""They joined a random team of individuals with shared logistics for an independent climb. They didn't understand the word 'independent' and had no experience to evaluate the risks."" Veteran climbers have long suggested Nepal's government should introduce certain criteria, including mandatory experience of having climbed peaks above 6,000m, for issuing Everest climbing permits. The quest to get anyone willing to pay has been mainly down to intense competition between operators, particularly old and new ones. With the entry of new expedition operators offering cheaper prices, mountaineers say even some of the established ones have been forced to cut their fees. ""As a result, you see agencies hiring inexperienced people as guides who cannot offer the right guidance to their clients when they have a situation like this,"" said Tshering Pande Bhote, vice president of Nepal National Mountain Guides Association. ""Unfortunately the competition is for volume and not for quality."" Expedition operators admit there are problems but they argue they also need to increase the number of visitors for the growth of the industry. ""Next year, for example, is Visit Nepal Year (a mega-tourism campaign that aims to bring in two million tourists),"" says Dambar Parajuli, president of the Expedition Operators Association of Nepal. ""So we will need to have more visitors, including mountaineers, but clearly how we manage traffic jams like this remains our major challenge."" How deadly is Mount Everest?

'Queen of Creole' Leah Chase dies aged 96,"Leah Chase, who ran Dooky Chase in New Orleans ""I always say we changed the course of America over a bowl of gumbo."" In the 1950s and 60s at the height of the US civil rights movement, when activists needed somewhere discreet to discuss strategy, they would go to Dooky Chase in New Orleans - meeting in an upstairs room and make plans over generous helpings of the hearty, Creole stew, cooked up by its owner Leah Chase. Known as the Queen of Creole, Chase - who died on Saturday aged 96 - fed Martin Luther King as he organised sit-ins with other civil rights activists. She fed freedom riders - black and white activists who intentionally rode interstate buses into segregated states where it was against the law for them to travel together. Thurgood Marshall, when he was the lawyer for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), is even said to have made an urgent mid-gumbo call to then-attorney general Bobby Kennedy from the restaurant's phone. ""They would eat gumbo, and talk about what they were going to do and how they were going to do it,"" she told the BBC's Dan Saladino in 2016. Leah Chase fed freedom riders, pictured in New Orleans - they were black and white activists who rode buses through segregated states together Decades later, Chase would serve the very same gumbo to Barack Obama, who was soon to become the first black president of the United States - and would slap his hand for adding hot sauce to it. Leah was born in the small town of Madisonville, on the outskirts of New Orleans, in January 1923. Just six years later, the Great Depression would plunge many in the US into abject poverty. Her early years were defined by poverty, and by race. In her BBC interview, she described how black and white people would live next to each other and, although ""whites and blacks didn't mingle"", they would get a sense of what people were like. Growing up, she wasn't a fan of cooking - but she spent years watching her mother at work in the kitchen, picking up recipes and techniques. When she was a teenager Chase moved to New Orleans, and saw a job advert for a ""light-skinned coloured girl"" to work as a waitress at one of the French Quarter's upmarket restaurants that was for white customers only. ""I wasn't light-skinned, but I thought I would give it a try,"" she said. She got the job, and loved it. When she wasn't waiting tables, she would once again stand in the kitchen watching meals being prepared - but this time, they were being cooked up by professional chefs. In 1946 she married the jazz musician, Edgar ""Dooky"" Chase. and started to help out with his parents' business - a sandwich shop in the majority black neighbourhood of TremÃ©. The Iranian artist who worked with Warhol The man who found beauty in megacities The spy who helped mastermind the Sydney Opera House She wanted the business to provide a fine-dining experience, similar to what she'd seen while working in the French Quarter, to her own community. ""I said, well why we can't have that for our people?"" she told the Associated Press news agency in 2015. ""Why we can't have a nice space? So I started trying to do different things."" She introduced silver cutlery and tablecloths, and cooked up Creole dishes. This was how Dooky Chase became the city's first white-tablecloth restaurant for black customers - and shortly afterwards, a safe space for civil rights activists. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina devastated homes and businesses in New Orleans - including Dooky Chase. The iconic dining room was flooded with 1.5 m (5 ft) of water, which sat for weeks. When the waters eventually receded, the restaurant was covered in mould. Although Chase was in her 80s and Dooky was in his late 70s, the couple spent months living in a rescue trailer next to the restaurant while they rebuilt it. After a burst of hard work, they were back and open for business. And within two years, she was serving gumbo to Mr Obama, just a few months before he was elected as president. Mr Obama getting ready to eat gumbo at Dooky Chase - without the nearby hot sauce ""He sits down to the gumbo, and the first thing he does is ask for the hot sauce,"" she recalled. She slapped his hand and told him that adding hot sauce was ""a no-no"". ""He never forgot it,"" she said. In a statement, Leah Chase's family said: ""Her daily joy was not simply cooking, but preparing meals to bring people together. One of her most prized contributions was advocating for the civil rights movement through feeding those on the front lines of the struggle for human dignity."" Indeed, she would often speak of the profound importance of food in bringing people together. Leah with Mr Obama, who would be elected president just months later ""In this business, we as blacks thought 'what am I, just a cook', 'what am I, I wait on tables, I just wait on people, that's nothing',"" she told the BBC. ""But it is something. Everybody's got to eat - whether you're the president if you're the Pope, you've got to eat. ""So if you can feed them, it makes them happy - and that's your part in helping them up.""

Widdecombe sparks fury with gay science comments,"Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe was recently elected as an MEP for the Brexit Party Ann Widdecombe has come under fire after she suggested science could ""produce an answer"" to being gay. In an interview on Sky News,the newly elected Brexit Party MEPwas asked about previous comments she made concerning gay conversion therapy. She said she had ""pointed out that there was a time when it was thought impossible for men to become women"". Labour MP Luke Pollard said Ms Widdecombe was ""continuing her sick anti-LGBT campaign"". During the interview on the Ridge on Sunday programme, Ms Widdecombe, 71, was asked whether people would want to share a platform with her due to her views on homosexuality. After referencing the scientific progress in gender reassignment, she added: ""The fact that we now think it is quite impossible for people to switch sexuality doesn't mean that science may not yet produce an answer at some stage."" Pushed by the presenter on whether she thought it was a real possibility, Ms Widdecombe replied: ""I don't know any more than people once knew whether it was possible for men to become women."" The MEP said she had ""never claimed that such science already exists"" to change someone's sexuality. But she added: ""If you simply rule out the possibility of it, you are denying people who are confused about their sexuality or discontented with it, the chances that you do give to people who want to change gender."" Her comments drew criticism on Twitter, including from Tory MP Justine Greening. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Pollard wrote that he was ""utterly ashamed to be represented by this vile woman. ""Being gay isn't a disease to be cured. Ann Widdecombe is continuing her sick anti-LGBT campaign."" Former Tory MP Nick Boles - who now sits as an independent - accused Ms Widdecombe of ""poisonous bigotry"", while comedian Adi Ray said the comments were ""deplorable"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said she was ""peddling homophobic nonsense"", adding: ""She may have changed her party, but she hasn't changed her stripes."" Ben Hunte, BBC News LGBT correspondent Ann Widdecombe's comments have shocked the LGBT community. Last summer, the government launched an LGBT Action Plan which pledged to bring forward proposals to ban so-called conversion therapy. The report stated, in efforts to become heterosexual, therapies ""can range from pseudo-psychological treatments to, in extreme cases, surgical interventions and 'corrective' rape"". And Ms Widdecombe's stance on gay conversion therapy comes at a time of great celebration for LGBT people globally. The start of June saw the beginning of LGBT Pride Month - a celebration recognised internationally since 1970. Pride events are under way across the UK, with many cities getting on board to recognise how far we have come in terms of visibility and representation of those of different sexualities and genders. It will be deeply disappointing to the UK's LGBT community that elected representatives, and people with large public platforms not only hold these views but actively promote them.

Graduate wins ÃÂ£60k over 'Mickey Mouse' degree,"This video can not be played 'I'm suing my university over Mickey Mouse degree' A graduate who sued her university over her ""Mickey Mouse"" degree has received a Â£60,000 out-of-court settlement. Pok Wong graduated with a first in international business strategy from Anglia Ruskin University in 2013. But she claimed the university ""exaggerated the prospects of a career"" and sued them for false advertising. A spokesperson for Anglia Ruskin University said the settlement was agreed with their insurer's solicitors, and they did not support it. Are students overpaying for tuition fees? Tuition fees 'should be cut to Â£7,500' Graduate loses bid to sue Oxford over 2:1 Pok Wong, also known as Fiona, said claims made in the university's prospectus were untrue. She told the BBC in 2018: ""They think we're international students [and] we come here to pay our money for a piece of paper, for the degree. ""But actually we care about the quality, we care about how much we could learn. ""They exaggerated the prospects of a career studying with them, and also they exaggerate how connected they are."" Last year, the County Court of Central London ruled in the university's favour and ordered Ms Wong to pay Â£13,700 of Anglia Ruskin's legal costs. But the university's insurers wrote to the former student, offering to settle her Â£15,000 claim, plus the payment of her legal costs. An Anglia Ruskin University spokesman said Ms Wong's litigation ""has been rejected numerous times and has never been upheld"". They said they did not support their insurer's solicitors decision, adding: ""We consider that they acted negligently and against the university's interests."" But Ms Wong wrote on Facebook that, despite the university denying any wrongdoing, ""the payout is a proven victory"". Anglia Ruskin University said it believed its insurers acted ""negligently and against the university's interests"" A spokesperson for the National Union of Students (NUS) said: ""Students do have clear rights under law, and the report of the settlement does indicate a way students can seek recourse."" But the spokesperson added that the NUS would prefer students ""to be partners in education"", instead of seeking a financial settlement.

Tuition fees 'should be cut to Â£7,500' Graduate loses bid to sue Oxford over 2:1 Pok Wong, also known as Fiona, said claims made in the university's prospectus were untrue. She told the BBC in 2018: ""They think we're international students [and] we come here to pay our money for a piece of paper, for the degree. ""But actually we care about the quality, we care about how much we could learn. ""They exaggerated the prospects of a career studying with them, and also they exaggerate how connected they are."" Last year, the County Court of Central London ruled in the university's favour and ordered Ms Wong to pay Â£13,700 of Anglia Ruskin's legal costs. But the university's insurers wrote to the former student, offering to settle her Â£15,000 claim, plus the payment of her legal costs. An Anglia Ruskin University spokesman said Ms Wong's litigation ""has been rejected numerous times and has never been upheld"". They said they did not support their insurer's solicitors decision, adding: ""We consider that they acted negligently and against the university's interests.""

Anglia Ruskin University said it believed its insurers acted ""negligently and against the university's interests"" A spokesperson for the National Union of Students (NUS) said: ""Students do have clear rights under law, and the report of the settlement does indicate a way students can seek recourse.""

'Kill Tory' bands to play Glastonbury,"Fat White Family performing at Glastonbury 2015 Two bands who have called for members of the Conservative Party to be killed are to perform at Glastonbury Festival 2019. One of Killdren's best known songs is called Kill Tory Scum while Fat White Family have called for violence against Conservatives on social media. The Jo Cox Foundation said the language was ""completely abhorrent"". ""We're seeing a legitimising and normalising of harmful words and actions,"" it said. Killdren, who are a ""two-bit rave punk band"" and claim to form the ""ideal soundtrack to the worst generation in history"", will play at Glastonbury's Shangri-Hell International TV stage on Friday 28 June. Their lyrics include: ""Even if it's your dad or your mum, kill Tory scum, kill Tory scum...murder them all to the beat of a drum, kill Tory scum, kill Tory scum."" The band also played a graphic set at Boomtown Fair 2018, in which they kicked, punched, and spat at a man dressed in a suit, while wearing Kill Tory Scum clothing. The Glastonbury story wasfirst reported by the Sunday Times.,externalWhen asked about the song, the band told the paper: ""The piece would not exist if the destructive and violent policies of the Tory party hadn't taken such a devastating toll on the UK."" The band's YouTube page claims the song is ""satirical discourse"". Also due to perform at the festival is Fat White Family, who previously played at Glastonbury's Park stage in 2015. Its song topics include abusive relationships, serial killers and addiction to class A drugs. In a 2015 tweet, the punk rock band, from south-east London, said anyone who voted Tory had ""blood"" on their hands, and called for them to be executed. A year earlier, they said Tories should be hanged. Jo Cox sister: Division 'worse than ever' MPs warned over Brexit security fears May: 'Be careful about language' on Brexit Catherine Anderson, chief executive of the Jo Cox Foundation, said the language was ""completely abhorrent"". Jo Cox MP was killed by a right-wing extremist in 2016, days before the Brexit referendum. Ms Anderson told the BBC: ""The direct incitement of violence and abuse, on any platform and in any sector, is wrong and something that we absolutely reject. ""We're seeing a legitimising and normalising of harmful words and actions, and this is leading to a decay in our shared language and ultimately our values, and that concerns us very much. ""We cannot but think of what happened to Jo, after whose murder we believed things would improve; instead, things have got a lot worse."" In a statement, YouTube said it had put an age restriction on the videos - which is the company's policy when videos do not violate its guidelines, but may not be appropriate for all viewers. It added: ""While YouTube is a platform for free and creative expression, we strictly prohibit videos that are abusive or that promote violence. ""All videos uploaded to YouTube must comply with our community guidelines, and we enforce these policies carefully."" The BBC has contacted Glastonbury for its response.

Defeat is 'minor setback' - Joshua,"This video can not be played Anthony Joshua vows to 'get belts back' after 'minor setback' Anthony Joshua vowed to ""get the belts back"" after calling his sensational heavyweight world-title defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr a ""minor setback"". Joshua, 29, was floored four times as Ruiz defied underdog status to win in seven rounds and deliver a true shock to the sport at Madison Square Garden. He said: ""It's a test of character. I'll see what is next and move on."" Promoter Eddie Hearn said a rematch is a ""must win"" because Joshua's options will be ""nothing after that"". A rematch clause was part of the contract and Hearn said he expected it to take place ""in England in November or December"". Ruiz himself says he will take the contest at any time. Joshua sensationally beaten by Ruiz Jr at Madison Square Garden - report BBC Radio 5 Live boxing: Joshua stunned in New York Re-live how Ruiz Jr beat Joshua to shake up the heavyweight division Joshua had a concussion test after falling to a first defeat of his 23-fight career against a man who took the contest at short notice when original opponent Jarrell Miller failed drugs tests. Andy Ruiz Jr now holds three of the four main heavyweight world title belts After scoring a third-round knock down, he was floored twice before the end of the round and put down twice more in the seventh before the bout was waved off. Sitting alongside Joshua at a post-fight news conference, Hearn said his fighter will want the repeat fixture more with ""every day that passes"". Joshua quietly responded: ""I think that's right"". He added: ""Winning is everything. I am not going to sit here and say 'losing is fine'. Not in my book. But if you do happen to lose, adjust and bounce back. But I do not condone losing in any form. This is war, battle, so what's next?"" Joshua, who lost the IBF, WBA and WBO world titles, was asked about potential fights with WBC world champion Deontay Wilder and Tyson Fury. ""I still want to compete with those men but a rematch with Andy Ruiz Jr is where we are at,"" he said. ""I'm still a champ and I will rectify it to get the belts back."" Anthony Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn confirmed there was a rematch clause in the contract of the fight between the Briton and Andy Ruiz Jr Hearn said Joshua got ""sloppy"" and expects the defeat to ""devastate"" his fighter, adding Ruiz had pulled off ""one of those big upsets in heavyweight history"". Much had been made of Joshua competing in the US for the first time, with hopes high he could land an eye-catching win that would build his profile in the country. He was priced at 1-25 with bookmakers, with many pundits expecting Ruiz to struggle to make it past the opening few rounds. ""It was a new environment and that is a factor but he should be beating Andy Ruiz,"" added Hearn. ""AJ must win that rematch in the UK because there is nothing after that."" Ruiz warned he will be ""more motivated as a champion"" and vowed to take the rematch at ""any time"" after turning the heavyweight division on its head. In becoming Mexico's first world heavyweight champion he now holds three of the four major belts, with Wilder in possession of the other. Journalists threw names like James 'Buster' Douglas - who upset Mike Tyson in 1990 - and Hasim Rahman - who beat Lennox Lewis in 2001 - at Ruiz, who simply said: ""I am still pinching myself. ""I wanted to prove everyone wrong, all the doubters, I was looking at comments. ""This is not going to be the only victory. I am not going to let these belts go. ""I am trying to make a legacy and a big name for myself."" Ruiz, who started boxing aged six, told media during fightweek he considered giving up because of criticism of his body shape. At 268lbs, he was the heaviest opponent Joshua has shared a ring with but it was the Briton who looked physically drained early on in the contest. Joshua never recovered after being floored twice in the third round, knock downs made more impressive given Ruiz had been dropped with a left hook moments earlier. ""It was my first time down,"" added Ruiz. ""I was like 'what the hell just happened?' ""I think it was the Mexican blood in me.  I had to return the favour. ""The way that I look, the extra flab I carry. Now I want to get in real good shape and look like a Mexican Anthony. ""Follow your dreams, if someone puts you down don't listen, just keep working like I did. We just made history.""

Britain's Konta into French Open quarters,"Johanna Konta (left) had never won a main-draw singles match at Roland Garros until this year 2019 French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:26 May-9 June Coverage:Live text and radio commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app. British number one Johanna Konta continued her charge through the French Open by impressively beating Croatian 23rd seed Donna Vekic to reach the quarter-finals. Konta, seeded 26th, won 6-2 6-4 in baking conditions at Roland Garros. She is hoping to emulate Jo Durie and become the first British woman to reach the semi-finals since 1983. The 28-year-old will play last year's runner-up andAmerican seventh seed Sloane Stephensin the last eight. ""To be able to win a match like this against a tough opponent is a great feeling. I felt I played well throughout the match,"" said Konta after reaching her first Grand Slam quarter-final since Wimbledon in 2017. ""To win like that in front of a crowd like that gives you goosebumps."" Konta is enjoying a superb clay-court season, reaching WTA finals in Morocco and Rome, and has continued to build on that form in Paris with some assured performances. She wrapped up victory over Vekic on the first of her three match points when the Croat hit long. Re-live Konta's impressive victory Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Konta had never won a main-draw match at Roland Garros before this year and appears to be reaping the rewards of her work with coach Dimitri Zavialoff, whom she employed at the end of last year. She is trusting her ability on a surface where she has had little previous success and against Vekic, this was again evident. Konta produced 33 winners and seven aces on her way to victory, improving her tallies in these areas from each of her previous three matches. Former world number four Konta was rarely flustered against Vekic, who she memorably beat in a three-set thriller on her way to the Wimbledon semi-finals two years ago. After bouncing straight back from losing her opening service game, the Briton broke again for a 5-2 lead and kept a measure of calm to see off four break points before sealing the set with an ace down the middle. Serve ruled at the start of the second set - with only eight receiving points won in the opening six games - before Konta struck first for a 4-3 advantage. For the first time she wobbled as three unforced errors handed the break straight back, but she managed to reset again in the next game. Two whopping forehands, which dusted the baseline, set the tone, forcing Vekic into a panicked backhand volley wide that brought up three break points for the Briton. Vekic saved two of them, only for Konta to take the third when she pulled off an outrageous backhand drop shot from the back of the court. Konta took her first match point when she expertly judged a Vekic return was going long, breaking out into a broad smile and raising both arms skywards in celebration. ""I was definitely pleased with how I was playing and the kind of problem-solving I was doing out there. I felt I was being very effective,"" Konta said. ""I thought I had very few drops in my level, which I think definitely kept the pressure on her and in trying to find a solution. ""I was able to identify where I was getting points and what was making her feel uncomfortable on court. I thought I played into the open spaces quite well and was able to find opportunities to do that."" Konta is not alone in being a quarter-final debutant at this year's French Open. Croatian 31st seedPetra Marticand Czech 19-year-oldMarketa Vondrousovaare both in the last eight at Roland Garros for the first time and one of them will be Konta's semi-final opponent if she is victorious in the next round. Neither player has made it to a Grand Slam quarter-final before, but Martic reached this stage after beating Kaia Kanepi 5-7 6-2 6-4, while Vondrousova came through after a 6-2 6-0 win against 12th seed Anastasija Sevastova. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Tennis can sometimes be a very simple game. Fuelled by confidence, and playing with the utmost fluency, Johanna Konta looked in little doubt that a quarter-final spot was hers for the taking. Konta arrived in the Moroccan capital Rabat at the end of April with some fine Fed Cup wins for GB under her belt, but a very sketchy career record on clay. She saved three match points in the first round there, and has not looked back. The win over Vekic was Konta's 14th in four tournaments, but she will have to play exceptionally well for a 15th. She has two victories on tour this year against Sloane Stephens, but knows last year's runner up is an altogether different prospect when a Grand Slam title is on the line. Konta was not the only Briton in action at Roland Garros, asJoe Salisburymade it to the men's doubles quarter-finals alongside AmericanRajeev Ram. The 11th seeds came back from a set down to beat eighth seeds Henri Kontinen and John Peers 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-5). Salisbury and Ram will face unseeded French pair Fabrice Martin and Jeremy Chardy - who was beaten by British number one Kyle Edmund in the first round of the singles - in the last eight.

Bangladesh shock SA in World Cup,"This video can not be played Cricket World Cup: Bangladesh beat South Africa - highlights ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, The Oval Bangladesh 330-6 (50 overs):Mushfiqur 78, Shakib 75 South Africa 309-8 (50 overs):Du Plessis 62, Mustafizur 3-67 Bangladesh won by 21 runs Scorecard;Table;Schedule Bangladesh stunned South Africa to start their World Cup campaign with a fine 21-run victory at The Oval. Bangladesh made 330-6 - their highest one-day total - with Mushfiqur Rahim scoring 78 and Shakib Al Hasan 75 in front of a passionate crowd strongly in their favour. The pair put on 142 for the third wicket and, although both fell in the final 15 overs, Mahmudullah helped power his side to the highest total of the tournament with an unbeaten 46 off 33 balls. South Africa, who were sloppy in the field, lost crucial wickets as they rarely threatened to complete the highest World Cup chase in history. Opener Quinton de Kock fell to a shambolic run-out early on, captain Faf du Plessis was bowled for 62 and Rassie van der Dussen was dismissed for 41 in the 40th over. The Proteas still had slim hope with three overs left, JP Duminy at the crease and 44 needed - but he played on off Mustafizur Rahman to depart for 45. The defeat means South Africa have lost their opening two matches in the competition, having been beaten by England in the opener on Thursday. TMS podcast: Time for South Africa to press the panic button? This video can not be played Faf du Plessis' towering six takes him to fifty - and is taken brilliantly by a cameraman Bangladesh are a much-improved team in recent years - they won a tri-series against West Indies and Ireland before this tournament and have series wins over India and Pakistan since the last World Cup - but this result still saw the side ranked seventh in the world beat the one ranked third. Bangladesh were given a solid start by Tamim Iqbal and Soumya Sarkar, who shared a stand of 60, but the experienced pair of Shakib and Mushfiqur rebuilt excellently after both openers fell. They rotated the strike and scored freely through extra cover and square leg, scoring at close to a run a ball. It looked like Bangladesh would let a good position slip when Mushfiqur departed soon after Shakib, but Mahmudullah's late hitting, which included three fours and a big six over mid-wicket, and support from Mosaddek Hossain, who made 26, regained momentum as 54 runs came from the last four overs. With the ball, Bangladesh were more disciplined than the Proteas, with their spinners economical on the same pitch used for England's win over South Africa. Shakib bowled opener Aiden Markram through the gate for 45 and Mehedi Hasan turned one between Du Plessis' bat and pad as he advanced down the pitch. Seamers Mohammad Saifuddin and Mustafizur Rahman returned later in the innings to seal victory, with the former bowling a wicket maiden that included the scalp of the well-set Van der Dussen. Bangladesh play New Zealand in a day-night game on Wednesday, again at The Oval. This video can not be played A catastrophic mix-up sees Quinton de Kock lose his wicket For all Bangladesh's good play, they were helped by South Africa's flat and untidy showing. The Proteas showed little evidence of learning from the defeat by England, even though the match was played on the same pitch. In the fifth over they missed an opportunity with an edge from Soumya going between Markram at first slip and Du Plessis at second, with neither making a real effort to go for the catch. In the overs that followed there were a number of misfields and, in the 47th over Kagiso Rabada put down Mahmudullah when he was on 12, which proved costly. This video can not be played Watch Rabada's terrible dropped catch South Africa lost fast bowler Lungi Ngidi to a hamstring injury after he bowled only four overs, but they also disappointed with the bat. Every member of the top six faced at least 30 balls but no-one showed sustained aggression to reduce the increasing required run-rate. De Kock was out in comical fashion, being called for a run by Markram before both stopped midway down the pitch and the left-hander was stranded when wicketkeeper Mushfiqur threw down the stumps. South Africa face India, one of the main contenders for the tournament, at Southampton on Wednesday. South Africa captain Faf du Plessis:""Today didn't go according to plan - 330 was a little over par. Everyone chipped in with the bat but it was not enough. ""Looking back on it, I wouldn't have bowled first. But the thinking was speaking to all the local guys who said there would be more pace and bounce in it. ""There are a few areas where we weren't great today. To go for so many runs at the end, those last five overs were very bad. ""We're a proud sporting nation. The skills weren't here today but I can promise there will be fight against India on Wednesday."" Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza:""Mushy always plays that kind of innings, and Shakib batted so well. ""That was a good wicket to bat on, and we knew we had to bowl in the right areas. We were able to get wickets in patches. ""The crowd was behind us - thanks to all the Bangladeshi crowd."" Former England captain Alec Stewart on TMS:""An outstanding performance. South Africa were favourites but haven't been allowed to show how good they are. ""Bangladesh have dominated proceedings and will upset at least a couple of other sides, especially if they play on used pitches more."" Test Match Special's Dan Norcross:""The way Bangladesh played today, I can see them beating other sides in this tournament and not in a giant-killing. They have a clear plan, good batsmen, terrific spin bowlers and The Fizz [Mustafizur Rahman].""

Britain's Konta into French Open quartersBritish number one Johanna Konta continues her charge through the French Open by impressively beating Croatian 24th seed Donna Vekic to reach the quarter-finals.BBC Sport,"Johanna Konta (left) had never won a main-draw singles match at Roland Garros until this year 2019 French Open Venue:Roland Garros, ParisDates:26 May-9 June Coverage:Live text and radio commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app. British number one Johanna Konta continued her charge through the French Open by impressively beating Croatian 23rd seed Donna Vekic to reach the quarter-finals. Konta, seeded 26th, won 6-2 6-4 in baking conditions at Roland Garros. She is hoping to emulate Jo Durie and become the first British woman to reach the semi-finals since 1983. The 28-year-old will play last year's runner-up andAmerican seventh seed Sloane Stephensin the last eight. ""To be able to win a match like this against a tough opponent is a great feeling. I felt I played well throughout the match,"" said Konta after reaching her first Grand Slam quarter-final since Wimbledon in 2017. ""To win like that in front of a crowd like that gives you goosebumps."" Konta is enjoying a superb clay-court season, reaching WTA finals in Morocco and Rome, and has continued to build on that form in Paris with some assured performances. She wrapped up victory over Vekic on the first of her three match points when the Croat hit long. Re-live Konta's impressive victory Live scores, schedule and results Alerts: Get tennis news sent to your phone Konta had never won a main-draw match at Roland Garros before this year and appears to be reaping the rewards of her work with coach Dimitri Zavialoff, whom she employed at the end of last year. She is trusting her ability on a surface where she has had little previous success and against Vekic, this was again evident. Konta produced 33 winners and seven aces on her way to victory, improving her tallies in these areas from each of her previous three matches. Former world number four Konta was rarely flustered against Vekic, who she memorably beat in a three-set thriller on her way to the Wimbledon semi-finals two years ago. After bouncing straight back from losing her opening service game, the Briton broke again for a 5-2 lead and kept a measure of calm to see off four break points before sealing the set with an ace down the middle. Serve ruled at the start of the second set - with only eight receiving points won in the opening six games - before Konta struck first for a 4-3 advantage. For the first time she wobbled as three unforced errors handed the break straight back, but she managed to reset again in the next game. Two whopping forehands, which dusted the baseline, set the tone, forcing Vekic into a panicked backhand volley wide that brought up three break points for the Briton. Vekic saved two of them, only for Konta to take the third when she pulled off an outrageous backhand drop shot from the back of the court. Konta took her first match point when she expertly judged a Vekic return was going long, breaking out into a broad smile and raising both arms skywards in celebration. ""I was definitely pleased with how I was playing and the kind of problem-solving I was doing out there. I felt I was being very effective,"" Konta said. ""I thought I had very few drops in my level, which I think definitely kept the pressure on her and in trying to find a solution. ""I was able to identify where I was getting points and what was making her feel uncomfortable on court. I thought I played into the open spaces quite well and was able to find opportunities to do that."" Konta is not alone in being a quarter-final debutant at this year's French Open. Croatian 31st seedPetra Marticand Czech 19-year-oldMarketa Vondrousovaare both in the last eight at Roland Garros for the first time and one of them will be Konta's semi-final opponent if she is victorious in the next round. Neither player has made it to a Grand Slam quarter-final before, but Martic reached this stage after beating Kaia Kanepi 5-7 6-2 6-4, while Vondrousova came through after a 6-2 6-0 win against 12th seed Anastasija Sevastova. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Tennis can sometimes be a very simple game. Fuelled by confidence, and playing with the utmost fluency, Johanna Konta looked in little doubt that a quarter-final spot was hers for the taking. Konta arrived in the Moroccan capital Rabat at the end of April with some fine Fed Cup wins for GB under her belt, but a very sketchy career record on clay. She saved three match points in the first round there, and has not looked back. The win over Vekic was Konta's 14th in four tournaments, but she will have to play exceptionally well for a 15th. She has two victories on tour this year against Sloane Stephens, but knows last year's runner up is an altogether different prospect when a Grand Slam title is on the line. Konta was not the only Briton in action at Roland Garros, asJoe Salisburymade it to the men's doubles quarter-finals alongside AmericanRajeev Ram. The 11th seeds came back from a set down to beat eighth seeds Henri Kontinen and John Peers 3-6 6-3 7-6 (7-5).

MEP sparks fury with gay science comments,"Former Tory MP Ann Widdecombe was recently elected as an MEP for the Brexit Party Ann Widdecombe has come under fire after she suggested science could ""produce an answer"" to being gay. In an interview on Sky News,the newly elected Brexit Party MEPwas asked about previous comments she made concerning gay conversion therapy. She said she had ""pointed out that there was a time when it was thought impossible for men to become women"". Labour MP Luke Pollard said Ms Widdecombe was ""continuing her sick anti-LGBT campaign"". During the interview on the Ridge on Sunday programme, Ms Widdecombe, 71, was asked whether people would want to share a platform with her due to her views on homosexuality. After referencing the scientific progress in gender reassignment, she added: ""The fact that we now think it is quite impossible for people to switch sexuality doesn't mean that science may not yet produce an answer at some stage."" Pushed by the presenter on whether she thought it was a real possibility, Ms Widdecombe replied: ""I don't know any more than people once knew whether it was possible for men to become women."" The MEP said she had ""never claimed that such science already exists"" to change someone's sexuality. But she added: ""If you simply rule out the possibility of it, you are denying people who are confused about their sexuality or discontented with it, the chances that you do give to people who want to change gender."" Her comments drew criticism on Twitter, including from Tory MP Justine Greening. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Pollard wrote that he was ""utterly ashamed to be represented by this vile woman. ""Being gay isn't a disease to be cured. Ann Widdecombe is continuing her sick anti-LGBT campaign."" Former Tory MP Nick Boles - who now sits as an independent - accused Ms Widdecombe of ""poisonous bigotry"", while comedian Adi Ray said the comments were ""deplorable"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said she was ""peddling homophobic nonsense"", adding: ""She may have changed her party, but she hasn't changed her stripes."" Ben Hunte, BBC News LGBT correspondent Ann Widdecombe's comments have shocked the LGBT community. Last summer, the government launched an LGBT Action Plan which pledged to bring forward proposals to ban so-called conversion therapy. The report stated, in efforts to become heterosexual, therapies ""can range from pseudo-psychological treatments to, in extreme cases, surgical interventions and 'corrective' rape"". And Ms Widdecombe's stance on gay conversion therapy comes at a time of great celebration for LGBT people globally. The start of June saw the beginning of LGBT Pride Month - a celebration recognised internationally since 1970. Pride events are under way across the UK, with many cities getting on board to recognise how far we have come in terms of visibility and representation of those of different sexualities and genders. It will be deeply disappointing to the UK's LGBT community that elected representatives, and people with large public platforms not only hold these views but actively promote them.

Uncovering Pakistan's secret human rights abuses,"For more than a decade Pakistan has kept Waziristan under tightly regulated travel restrictions Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Pakistan's long battle with militants as part of the post-9/11 ""war on terror"". Evidence of murder and torture by soldiers and insurgents is emerging only now. The BBC has gained rare access to some of the victims. It was early in 2014 when TV news networks trumpeted a major victory in the war against the Pakistani Taliban - the killing of one of the group's most senior commanders in a night-time air raid. Adnan Rasheed and up to five members of his family were reported to have died in the strikes in the North Waziristan tribal area, near the Afghan border. Rasheed, a former Pakistan Air Force technician, was well-known. He had written an extraordinary letter to Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl and activist shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in 2012, attempting to justify why it had happened. He'd also been in prison for trying to assassinate former President Pervez Musharraf - until he broke out. Now it appeared that his luck had run out. Quoting security officials, news channels reported on 22 January 2014 that Adnan Rasheed's hideout had been targeted two nights earlier in the Hamzoni area. Waziristan and other parts of the vast mountainous tribal region have been controlled and locked-down by the Pakistani military since the US invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11, which saw Taliban fighters, al-Qaeda jihadists and other militants flee over the porous border. Outsiders, including journalists, cannot get in - so verifying claims from the security forces is extremely difficult. Those who have reported stories from Waziristan that don't reflect well on the military have found themselves punished. It turned out a year later that the jets had hit the wrong target - Rasheed confirmed this when he emerged in a video to prove he was alive. Adnan Rasheed had been sentenced to death for trying to kill former president Pervez Musharraf Instead of taking out a top militant, Pakistan's military had actually killed the family of a local man who had his home blown to pieces. The authorities have never acknowledged they made a mistake. The BBC travelled to Dera Ismail Khan, a town on the banks of the river Indus that is the gateway to the remote and forbidding tribal areas, to meet the man whose house was hit. ""It must have been 11pm or thereabouts,"" recalls Nazirullah, who was 20 at the time. He and his wife had recently married and had the rare privilege of a room to themselves. The rest of their large family slept in the only other room in their house in Khatei Kalay village. ""It was as if the house had exploded. My wife and I were shaken out of our sleep. There was a strong smell of gunpowder in the air. Both of us rushed to the door and stepped out, only to discover that the entire roof of our room had already collapsed, except a corner where our bed was."" Nazirullah and his niece Sumayya survived but four members of the family were killed The roof of the second room had also collapsed, and a fire was raging across the compound. Nazirullah heard cries from the rubble and, with his wife, frantically tried to help those they could see in the glow of the fire. Neighbours helped them dig out the injured and the dead. Four of Nazirullah's family died, including a three-year-old girl. His niece Sumayya, whose mother was among those killed, was then just a year old, and survived with a fractured hip. Another four members of the family were rescued from the rubble. All suffered fractures and other injuries. Nazirullah's family has since moved back to Dera Ismail Khan, where life is more peaceful. Like many others in this part of Pakistan, they have had to move several times to escape an insurgency that has been raging in the tribal areas for nearly two decades. According to authorities and independent research groups, militant violence since 2002 has forced more than five million people in Pakistan's north-west to leave their homes to seek refuge either in government-run refugee camps or rented houses in peaceful areas. There are no official figures of the total death toll of this war but estimates from academics, local authorities and activists put the number of civilians, militants and security forces killed at well over 50,000. A protest Pakistan wants to hide from the world The young tribesman rattling Pakistan's army Pakistan's undeclared war,external Local rights activists say scores of civilians have been killed in successive air campaigns and ground operations by the military. They have been collecting video and documentary evidence to back up their claims. These activists are linked to a prominent new rights campaign called the Pashtun Tahaffuz (Protection) Movement (PTM) which emerged early last year and has since been publicising alleged rights abuses in the tribal region that victims had previously been too scared to report. ""It has taken us almost 15 years of suffering and humiliation to gather courage to speak up, and to spread awareness about how the military trampled our constitutional rights through both direct action and a policy of support for the militants,"" said Manzoor Pashteen, the top leader of the PTM. But the group is under pressure. The PTM says 13 of its activists were killed on 26 May when the army opened fire on a large group of protesters in North Waziristan. The army said at least three activists were shot dead after a military checkpoint was attacked. The PTM denies this but two of its leaders, who also serve as MPs, have been arrested. Pashtun Protection Movement leader Manzoor Pashteen has helped publicise rights abuses A number of cases highlighted by the PTM - and which the BBC investigated independently - were shared with a Pakistani military spokesman but he declined to respond, calling such allegations ""highly judgmental"". There was no response to BBC requests for comment from the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, even though Mr Khan raised the issue of rights abuses in the tribal areas when he was an opposition politician. It all started with the al-Qaeda attacks in September 2001 in New York and Washington. When the US attacked Afghanistan in October 2001, the Taliban forces that had sheltered al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden melted away without a fight. Armed Pakistani Taliban at a hideout in the tribal district of Orakzai in 2009 Pakistan, which was one of only three countries to have recognised the Taliban when they seized power in Kabul in 1996, had an interest in keeping the movement alive as part of its efforts to prevent Indian influence from spreading in Afghanistan. So while Pakistan had been dependent on US military aid for decades and the then military regime of Gen Pervez Musharraf had joined the US ""war on terror"", it also allowed the Taliban to carve out sanctuaries in Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal areas, notably the districts of North and South Waziristan. But the Afghan Taliban did not cross the border alone. Militants from a complex array of different groups poured into the tribal region and some were far more hostile to the Pakistani state. Viewpoint: Will Pakistan mend its ways on terror? Jihadists with global ambitions also began plotting attacks from Waziristan, prompting demands from Washington that Pakistan do more to crush Islamist militancy. As violence spread, Pakistan was caught ""between an inclination to fight militant forces and yet having to partner with some to strengthen its future bargaining position"", said Ayesha Siddiqa, a security analyst and author of the book Military Inc: Inside Pakistan's Military Economy. In 2014, Pakistan launched a new operation in North Waziristan that increased pressure on militant groups and their safe havens and was credited with reducing attacks elsewhere in the country. When the Taliban arrived in the tribal areas in 2001, they were given a cautious welcome by the local people. But this quickly turned into disillusionment when they started to take over tribal society by enforcing their strict religious codes. During the first phase of that relationship, local youths joined the militants' ranks in their hundreds, thereby causing tribal rivalries to seep into the militant network. This was reflected in subsequent factional wars. In the second stage, the Taliban embarked on a campaign to eliminate officially recognised tribal elders who were a hurdle in the way of the insurgents' drive to subjugate the tribes. At least 1,000 tribal elders have been killed by militants since 2002 and some estimates from non-governmental organisations put the figure at nearly 2,000. Waziristan is rugged, inhospitable terrain - and closed to outsiders and journalists One such assassination in North Waziristan in July 2007 is emblematic of how militants were able to subjugate the tribes. ""When they kidnapped and killed my brother, the tribe in our region was still strong, but because the military allowed [the militants] the freedom to move against our people, it broke our back,"" says Mohammad Amin, a Wazir tribesman from Razmak area of North Waziristan. His brother's body was found dumped in an abandoned truck the day after he was kidnapped by militants. Mohammad Amin and other tribesmen were able to trace the attackers and confronted them. The ensuing gunfight left Mr Amin's son, Asadullah, a cousin and all four Taliban fighters dead. Asadullah was shot dead by Taliban fighters trying to subdue his tribe The tribe's subsequent calls on military officials in the garrison town of Razmak to curb Taliban violence were frustrated when militant leaders based in that very town threatened reprisal. A decade on, Mr Amin is in no doubt that ""despite occasional clashes with each other, the Taliban and the military are doing the same thing"". PTM activists have also documented several cases in which the security forces appear to have treated the local population brutally. In May 2016, for example, an attack on a military post in the Teti Madakhel area of North Waziristan triggered a manhunt by troops who rounded up the entire population of a village. An eyewitness who watched the operation from a wheat field nearby and whose brother was among those detained told the BBC that the soldiers beat everyone with batons and threw mud in children's mouths when they cried. A pregnant woman was one of two people who died during torture, her son said in video testimony. At least one man remains missing. Many tribal residents ended up in camps for displaced people in Peshawar and other places The stories of survivors are painful too. I met Satarjan Mahsud in the town of Ramak, 100km (60 miles) further south down the Indus river from Dera Ismail Khan. We sat inside a white tent and he told me his story over tea, with two young children at his side One evening in April 2015 militants fired at a military post in Shaktoi, South Waziristan. Satarjan says troops responded by capturing suspects from a nearby village and shooting two of them dead. Early the next morning, on 21 April, they extended their search across the valley to Satarjan's village where they found weapons stashed on a hill behind his house. ""The only people present in the house at that time were my brother Idarjan, his wife and two daughters-in-law,"" Satarjan says. Satarjan has spent four years trying to trace his brother and nephews - to no avail The soldiers knocked at the door. His brother answered and was immediately overpowered, tied up and blindfolded. The troops asked where other male members of the family were and rounded up Idarjan's four sons from elsewhere in the valley. Witnesses later told Satarjan that the boys had been beaten, and his eldest nephew, Rezwarjan, received a lethal blow to the head. All of them were thrown in the back of a pick-up truck which the soldiers had commandeered, and driven away to the army camp in the area. The driver of the truck later told Satarjan that Rezwarjan was ""already half dead and couldn't hold himself in a sitting position, so the soldiers decided not to take him to the camp"". He told Satarjan: ""They asked me to stop the truck, shot Rezwarjan in the head and threw his body on the road."" Satarjan was working at a factory in Dubai at the time. He heard about what had happened and began the journey home. He took a flight, a bus and then walked for 15 hours to reach the village where Rezwarjan's body was found on 23 April. People in the tribal areas have protested - but they are still waiting for justice Locals there told him they hadn't been able to take the body across the valley to his family home because of a curfew, so they had buried it there on the hill. He then walked across to his own village where he found his house deserted. The wives of Satarjan's brother and nephews had been taken in by relatives. Satarjan knew the women wouldn't know the whole story because the curfew forbade travel between villages and there was no mobile network in the area. When he met his sister-in-law, she told him what she knew: that her husband had been taken away by the army and that the younger men were missing. ""I was in two minds about whether to tell her. But then I thought it would be easier to give her the bad news about Rezwarjan once my brother and the boys had returned. I knew the army had nothing against them and would let them go soon."" So he made up a story, telling her that when the army raided their house, the boys got away to safety in Karachi, far away in southern Pakistan. He assured her that her husband would soon be released. On 26 April 2015, he moved the family to Ramak. Since then he's had no word from the military on the fate of his brother and three nephews. Weeks have turned into months, and months into years. He is not alone. Local activists say more than 8,000 people picked up by the army since 2002 remain unaccounted for. Meanwhile, Satarjan has been dodging questions from the women about why they can't visit their village. ""I tell them our house in Shaktoi has been demolished by the army, which is partly true. But the real reason is that if they go there, neighbours will come for condolences and they will find out."" He says it would be better if he knew his brother and nephews had been jailed, or even killed. But not knowing anything is agony. ""I can't tell my sister-in-law her sons are missing, or dead. I can't tell the two young wives that they have been widowed,"" he says. The long road to justice for student stabbed 23 times How a 9-year-old exposed police for killing his family The Pakistan poet who dared talk of female desire Shock over raid on Karachi's âisland of freedomâ These individual stories are shocking but they are not unique. The PTM alleges that hundreds of people from the tribal areas could tell similar stories. But they remain officially unacknowledged. They are the consequences of a war Pakistan has gone to great lengths to hide from the world. This conflict on the Afghan border has for years been an information black hole. And when the PTM broke through this chokehold last year, its media coverage was put under a comprehensive ban. Those in the media who have not heeded the ban have faced physical threats and financial pressure. The military has openly called the PTM's patriotic credentials into question,external, accusing it of links to ""hostile"" intelligence agencies in Afghanistan and India. And somePTM activists who were documenting cases of abuse and running the group's social media campaign have been jailed,external. The treatment of the activists who are finally, after years of silence, raising the alarm on the abuses of a long and secret war suggests that those who have suffered in the conflict face an uphill battle for justice.

China defends Tiananmen crackdown in rare comments,"This video can not be played Tiananmen's tank man: The image that China forgot China has defended the crackdown on the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in a rare public acknowledgement of events. Defence Minister Wei Fenghe told a regional forum that stopping the ""turbulence"" was the ""correct"" policy. In spring 1989, students and workers occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square in a massive pro-democracy protest. Many were killed in a brutal clampdown by the communist authorities. Reporting on the events is heavily censored in China. Timeline: Tiananmen protests Tiananmen: China's great act of 'forgettance' Tuesday marks 30 years since six weeks of demonstrations ended with the Beijing massacre of 3-4 June. Workers and students shouted pro-democracy slogans Public discussions of the 1989 pro-democracy protests and their suppression are strictly taboo in China. But after a wide-ranging speech about trade and security at a regional forum in Singapore, General Wei Fenghe was asked about Tiananmen by a member of the audience. Mr Wei questioned why people still said China had not handled the events properly. ""That incident was a political turbulence and the central government took measures to stop the turbulence, which is a correct policy,"" he told the forum. ""The past 30 years have proven that China has undergone major changes,"" he said, adding that because of the government's action at that time ""China has enjoyed stability and development"". His remarks came afterTwitter issued an apology for suspending a number of accounts posting about China,externalahead of the Tiananmen Square anniversary. A tweet on their public policy account said the company was working to challenge accounts that engage in ""platform manipulation, including spam and other inauthentic behaviours"". ""Sometimes our routine actions catch false positives or we make errors,"" the tweet read, adding that Twitter was trying to correct the mistakes. Users had criticised the platform for blocking the accounts, using the hashtag #TwitterMassacre.Republican Senator Marco Rubio accused the company of becoming a Chinese government censor,external. There are no official acts of remembrance for the events of 1989 in Beijing. But that statement, although factually correct, is far too neutral. In truth, what happened in Tiananmen Square is marked faithfully each year by a massive, national act of what might more properly be called ""forgettance"". In the weeks leading up to 4 June, the world's biggest censorship machine goes into overdrive as a huge dragnet of automated algorithms and tens of thousands of human expurgators cleanse the internet of any reference, however oblique. Those deemed to have been too provocative in their attempts to evade the controls can be jailed - with sentences of up to three and a half years recently handed down to a group of men who had tried to commemorate the anniversary with a product label. Read more from John This video can not be played Kate Adie reports as Chinese troops fire on protesters More than one million pro-democracy protesters occupied Tiananmen Square in April 1989 and began the largest political demonstration in communist China's history. It lasted six weeks. Protests spread to cities and universities across the country. The demonstrators called for greater freedom and democracy and an end to what they called dictatorship - others complained about inflation, salaries and housing. On the night of 3 June tanks moved in and troops opened fire, killing and injuring many unarmed people in and around Tiananmen Square. Afterwards the authorities claimed no-one had been shot dead in the square itself.

Trump: Prepare for no deal and send in Farage,"Donald Trump and Nigel Farage during a campaign rally at the Mississippi Coliseum in August 2016 Nigel Farage should be involved in the government's Brexit negotiations and the UK should be prepared to leave the EU with no deal, Donald Trump has said. In a Sunday Times interview,,externalthe US president was critical of government's Brexit negotiations, saying it left the EU ""with all the cards."" The interview comes before his state visit to the UK begins on Monday. On Saturday Mr Trump alsosaid Boris Johnson would be an ""excellent"" Conservative Party leader. Breaking with diplomatic convention, Mr Trump said the leader of the Brexit Party - an arch critic of Prime Minister Theresa May - ""has a lot to offer"" in negotiations with the EU, and should be included. ""Think how well they would do if they did,"" he added. He also said the UK should walk away if it does not get what it wants from EU negotiations. ""If you don't get the deal you want, if you don't get a fair deal, then you walk away."" Meanwhile, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has marked Mr Trump's visit by calling him ""one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat"". In an article forthe Observer,external, Mr Khan said: ""The far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms and the values that have defined our liberal, democratic societies for more than 70 years."" In April, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was boycotting Mr Trump's state banquet at Buckingham Palace, in protest at the president's""racist and misogynistic rhetoric"". But the US Ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said he believed ""everything is going to go great"" on the trip. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson also talked about potential future trade agreements between the two countries after Brexit. He said the UK would not have to accept US agriculture standards to get a deal - although he said the ""American food supply is as safe as anything in Europe"". And while he called the NHS the ""pride of the country"", he said that in order to strike a deal, ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson Jeremy Corbyn:Asked if he would share US intelligence with a Corbyn government, the US president said: ""I would have to know him, I would have to meet."" Brexit:On paying a Â£39bn ($50bn) divorce bill: ""I wouldn't pay $50bn. That is me. I would not pay - that is a tremendous number."" Nigel Farage:""I got to know him when he liked my campaign and he actually came to a speech and I met him. I think he is a terrific person. Really, a terrific person."" A US-UK trade deal:""One of the advantages of Brexit is the fact that now you can deal with the No 1 country by far."" Boris Johnson as PM:""[He] would do a very good job - he would be excellent. He has been very positive about me and our country."" The US president also reiterated his praise for Boris Johnson - who is willing to leave the EU with no deal. Mr Johnson is one of the candidates inTory leadership contestto replace Prime Minister Theresa May. Sajid Javid, Esther McVeyandDominic Raabhave said the UK should leave the EU on the current planned departure date of 31 October with or without an agreement. ButRory Stewart does not back a no-deal Brexit - and Matt Hancocksays politicians must be honest about the trade-offs involved in getting a deal approved by MPs. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said trying to push througha no-deal Brexit would be committing ""political suicide"",although he agreed the option had to remain on the negotiating table. Gyimah announces Tory leadership bid To compensate for lost trade with the EU, Mr Trump vowed to ""go all out"" to secure a free trade deal between the UK and US within months of Britain leaving the bloc. The first day of Mr Trump's state visit to the UK will include a private lunch with the Queen, tea with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the state banquet at Buckingham Palace.

Crazy Golf just got (a bit) serious," By Kevin Peachey The family-favourite seaside pastime has dreams of Olympic representation, players bordering on obsessive, and supports hundreds of jobs in multi-million pound businesses. No wonder they call it “serious fun”. Amid the towering pines of the Augusta National Golf Club in Georgia, Tiger Woods slips on the Masters Green Jacket to mark one of the most astonishing sporting victories of the decade. The new US Masters champion also receives a sparkling trophy and a winner’s cheque for just over $2m (£1.6m). A few days earlier, thousands of miles away in the UK, amid the rumble of traffic on the A20 Sidcup bypass, Mark Wood was also presented with a jacket as a Masters champion golfer. This one - a tweed blazer - was bought from a charity shop in Southend, Essex. Messrs Woods and Wood are similar in name but orbit different golfing planets. Just competing with a Bridgestone golf ball pays Tiger Woods a seven-figure sum from the manufacturer. In Mark Wood’s sport, players are known to keep their ball in a sock tucked in their trousers, to maintain its even temperature so it rolls at a consistent speed. And, for the Hackney Council finance manager, winning minigolf’s British Masters at Mr Mulligan’s Dino Adventure Golf has netted him just £50 in prize money. “The prize isn’t fantastic, but it is more the camaraderie and being competitive,” says Mark. “It does cost me with my wife though. She hates sport.” Following the Sidcup tournament, the British Minigolf Association caravan moves on. The next competition is in Norfolk, then Solihull. All roads on this player pilgrimage lead to Hastings in East Sussex, for the weekend of 8 and 9 June, and the big one – the World Crazy Golf Championships. Anyone can enter, and the victor will take home £1,000. An archer’s exact strike helped the Norman conquerors to victory at the Battle of Hastings in 1066. Will, Martin, Marion and David are among the players aiming for similar, if less deadly, accuracy at the so-called World Crazies. Just days before the competition, the quartet agreed to share some of the secrets of top-level crazy golf with me.     Martin became hooked on the sport after playing as an alternative to a cancelled cricket match in 2012. Representing his country in the sport has taken the 50-year-old across Europe. Preparation is key, he says. He is an accountant so, appropriately, he carries a golfing ledger. He has a little red notebook for each course he plays. In it he makes notes, and marks where to aim his ball from different points on each hole. Many of the top players have similar guides. This forethought extends to deciding what is best to wear. “The most important thing is comfortable shoes. It is amazing how many miles you can clock up,” says Martin, also dressed in his GB T-shirt. “Then you need protection from the sun and, as it is England, we all have a full set of waterproofs.” Europe’s best players often have a coach to carry an umbrella over them, not to shelter them from rain, but to stop their ball heating up too much in the sun, and to avoid distracting shadows. There is something else vital for women who want to win. “I’ve got a new golfing bra,” says Marion, a 67-year-old who plays every week in retirement. “Otherwise it is distracting if the straps fall down.” Will shows off his specialist putter. Each player has something similar. It is rubber-headed, and weighted at the bottom. This leads to a smoother, cleaner, strike, he tells me, and allows you to put some spin on the ball. A specialist putter is the first major investment made by regular players, generally ordered from Sweden or Germany and costing about £80. The next are balls. Minigolfers don’t use regular golf balls. The ones from the kiosk hardly bounce (a safety feature to protect occasional players from ricocheting shots). Instead, they use balls shipped over from Europe. A little smaller than regular golf balls, they look more like squash balls, cost £10 to £15 each, and are perfect for bouncing off obstacles into the hole. “You can get a bit obsessive about them,” says Martin. “I have about 100.” Uniquely, the World Crazy Golf Championships have a standard-issue ball each year. It is a well-guarded secret. Competitors can only use it for the first time on Friday’s official practice day. In other competitions, the rules state you can use a different ball on any hole, but you must complete a hole with the same ball that you started with. So, in theory, players can use 18 different balls on an 18-hole course. Some are heavier, some have more bounce, some just look good. The choice of which one to use depends on weather conditions, a touch of superstition, and the obstacles that need to be negotiated. The classic courses – like the Hastings crazy golf course, designed by “big golf” legend Arnold Palmer – have lots of obstacles, from wind and water mills to bridges and cliffs. In crazy golf, these are found on the playing surface, and players have to putt their ball through or over them. In adventure golf, the features are often next to the holes, with players instead having to negotiate humps, bumps and big slopes. Minigolf is the umbrella term for the sport as a whole. Stepping up to the first hole, I wonder what kind of score I should be aiming for to compete with the best. The answer is two shots or fewer on each hole – a total score of 36 or fewer. Last year’s World Crazies champion averaged a score of 32 on his seven, 18-hole rounds. The world regulations state each player starts and completes the hole separately, and in turn. Only on the final round of the World Crazies does everyone play each hole at the same time – known as “crazy, crazy rules”. I am last to play but the quartet nod in approval as I roll my first shot up close to the hole. My score of two on the first is repeated on the second hole. I watch as Martin’s ball bounces in and then out of the hole on the third. My kiosk-issue safety ball drops on my first shot, and stays there. A hole-in-one! Except it is not. It is called an ace in crazy golf. Will has been telling me where to aim my ball. The 20-year-old student and part-time football referee is not only the highest-ranked player in attendance, but also the Great Britain coach at the next international tournament in Gothenburg. I ignored his advice, aiming to ricochet off a side wall instead of playing safe and straight. On the fourth hole, I listen to Will’s guidance and in it goes - again. A second straight ace, and I sit top of the leaderboard. I raise my arms aloft and yell in delight, only to learn that cheering is “a very touchy subject” in tournament minigolf. “Some people like to announce to the world if they get an ace. Sometimes very loudly. It is not always approved of,” says David, a pensioner and former manager at the Hastings course. Off we go to the fifth hole – the most iconic of all, the windmill. The best players used to avoid its rotating blades by sending their ball around it. A rule change, and a newly-added wooden board, mean they have to go underneath it, with good timing as well as accuracy. We all send our balls through without embarrassment. It is the last time my luck holds. The slide in my score coincides with the actual slide on the seventh hole. The ramp is steeper than expected and my ball rolls back down past my feet. At the end of hole nine, Will adds up the halfway scores. “You were on two under [a par score],” he says. “But you are not anymore.” Total humiliation is avoided thanks to some global rules. The maximum number of shots allowed on each hole is six, after which an automatic score of seven is recorded. Any ball resting against the side can be moved eight inches onto the playing surface – the length of a scorecard – to allow for some kind of putting backswing. However, there are some common mistakes among the inexperienced. Firstly, there are no “gimmes”. Never pick up your ball, even if it is next to the hole. “Putt with both hands - and bending your knees a bit helps,” says Marion. “Pace control of the ball is just as important, if not more so, than accuracy,” says David. So, should we take it seriously? “It’s Crazy Golf. Of course it’s not serious,” says reigning champion Marc Chapman. “But it is. I’m a world champion. That’s quite a serious thing for me.” Only a select few players have ever won the World Crazies. Only one of them – Olivia Prokopova, from the Czech Republic and who started playing the sport at the age of nine - is a woman. But this is not a male-dominated sport. Far from it. That might just be because it was only women who played when it all began. It was unbecoming of a lady to swing a club violently in the 1860s, so a minigolf course was created at the home of golf. The St Andrews Ladies' Putting Club, later known as the Putting Club,  in Scotland is thought to be the first minigolf course ever made. It is now commonly known as The Himalayas owing to its tricky peaks and troughs. It is open to the public (of all sexes) nowadays, but when it was founded in 1867, it was designed as entertainment for the sisters and daughters of the golf club’s members. The sport of golf has had a well-documented representation issue. Some of the most high-profile courses, hosting the biggest tournaments in the world, have only recently ended men-only membership. Minigolf has no such problem. Some of the world’s best minigolf players are women, and while some tournaments distinguish between male and female competitions, many do not. “This is what Emmeline Pankhurst was fighting for all those years ago,” says enthusiast Marion Hartley. To play minigolf? “Among other things. It was for the vote, of course, but it was to make women as equal as men. This is a sport where it does not matter,” she says . The St Andrews Ladies' Golf Club was formed in 1867.

PHOTO: Women and children play golf at the historic course in the late 19th Century (Print Collector/Getty Images) Forty years after the ladies of St Andrews started playing the game, the emergence of a more recognisable form of crazy golf began. Gofstacle required coloured golf balls and putters, and players negotiated hoops, rings, a tunnel and a bridge. “It is played like golf croquet,” the London Illustrated News explained to the curious reader of 1907. ""Its popularity is undoubted.” Then the craze swept America. It began with a course built at the North Carolina home of the English shipping magnate James Wells Barber, called Thistle Dhu. It was described as “the world’s craziest, most scientific, and most aggravating golf course” by an article in the Altoona Mirror in 1928. Soon there were courses everywhere. There were 150 rooftop courses in New York alone. It was a minigolfing golden age. But then popularity sunk with the economy and it would be decades before the sport was widely played again in the US. Thistle Dhu Putting Course, Pinehurst Resort Golf Course, North Carolina. PHOTO: Alamy Thistle Dhu Putting Course, Pinehurst Resort Golf Course, North Carolina. PHOTO: Alamy So the putter was passed back to Europe. Sweden emerged as a centre of minigolf as courses were set up in public parks. It took until the 1960s for courses across Europe to look more like the ones we see in the UK today. Felt became the common playing surface from the 1960s. The reason for that, as any seaside holidaymaker will know, is that rain was spoiling the fun. On harder surfaces rainwater collects in puddles and stops a rolling ball. With felt, rain can be absorbed into the ground. Nowadays, the World Minigolf Sport Federation approves four different types of course and surface. Fibre cement, or eternite, courses are the most popular worldwide. Players cannot stand on the surface, but the holes are very short. More than 1,000 players have officially recorded a perfect 18 on this type of course. Nowhere else have 18 consecutive aces been scored in national or international tournaments. So the quest for perfection remains on the rest: the beton concrete courses of Switzerland, Austria and southern Germany, the felt courses of Sweden and Finland, and the artificial grass of the UK and the US. The world federation is on a quest too. It has an official strategic goal of “working towards inclusion in international multi-sports games”. In other words, the Olympics. Anyone tempted to train for potential Olympic glory may want a course at home. A self-assembly “supersize” nine-hole crazy golf course, with assorted obstacles, 18 putters, 18 balls and 1,000 scorecards certainly sounds like the ultimate kidult gift. But it does not come at pocket money prices. It is yours for £3,000. More affordable, perhaps, is hiring a four-hole course for just over £200. Selling and renting these courses is Putter Fingers, a business based in Thetford in Norfolk, which bizarrely is an off-shoot of a software company which started selling courses mainly to show off its ability to make websites. “The business of crazy golf has a fair bit of growth left in it,” says logistics manager Richard Clarke, explaining that putters are the biggest seller. Schools, corporate event organisers, couples looking to entertain their guests at a wedding, and birthday entertainers are all regular customers. But the really crazy money is being made in big cities like London – all because of a phenomenon called competitive socialising. People playing at golf activity bar, Swingers, West End. PHOTO:  Luke Dyson /Swingers People playing at golf activity bar, Swingers, West End. PHOTO:  Luke Dyson /Swingers “People don’t just want to go to a restaurant or a bar and just eat or drink, they want something else,” says Matt Grech-Smith, co-founder of the crazy golf activity bar Swingers, which employs 250 people. “Social media is playing a role in that. People want to show off the experiences they are having. Something visually appealing works.” Swingers – with a name squarely aimed at its over-18 clientele – has two sites in London, a turnover of £18m a year, and a “healthy” profit margin, according to Mr Grech-Smith. The next market to crack, he says, is that original minigolf mecca - New York. Each site has two nine-hole courses, not-so-subtle mid-round bars to replenish visitors, and choice of meals from burgers to burritos. People typically spend £30 to £50 a night – a lot more than they would for a game of crazy golf and chips on the beach in Hastings. Even early on a Wednesday afternoon there was huge corporate group eating pizza, drinking beer, and cheering or bemoaning each other’s putting skills. The booze would get them disqualified from official minigolf tournaments, but it is integral to these adult-only venues. To the converted, including some commercial landlords, this kind of place is a saviour for the troubled High Street. The theory is strengthened by the fact that Swingers is located in the old flagship store of collapsed retail giant BHS. People playing at golf activity bar, Swingers, West End. PHOTO:  Luke Dyson /Swingers People playing at golf activity bar, Swingers, West End. PHOTO:  Luke Dyson /Swingers Elsewhere, the owner of Paradise Island Adventure Golf – which has seven indoor courses in UK shopping centres – was bought in late 2017 for more than £10m. The worlds of retail and entertainment are colliding, and are in direct competition with the theatre, concerts, and even home entertainment like Netflix, says Mr Grech-Smith. “Lots of retail brands are making their shopping experience much more immersive and experience based. The tastes of the consumer are clearly changing,” he says. “Those destinations that can offer as many different experiences as possible are going to win.” To the less convinced, competitive socialising faces an uphill struggle in attracting repeat visitors. But, for now, business is booming and the game has momentum. The St Andrews Ladies' Putting Club started the ball rolling, it gathered pace in the US in the 1920s, was carried forward by enthusiasts across Europe, and has landed straight into the social media feeds of millennials enjoying a competitive night out. Plenty of economic obstacles may stop this becoming a second golden age for the game. But there are supposed to be obstacles. This is crazy golf. "
Joshua beaten in one of boxing's biggest upsets,"Joshua suffered his first defeat as a professional in his first fight in the United States Andy Ruiz Jr produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of heavyweight boxing to rip Anthony Joshua's IBF, WBO and WBA world heavyweight titles from him and tear up the division's proposed plot lines. In a truly remarkable fight at New York's Madison Square Garden, Ruiz floored Joshua four times en route to a seventh-round stoppage, which stunned this famous arena and handed the Briton his first defeat as a professional. Joshua was a 1-25 favourite with bookmakers, with 22 wins - 21 by knockout - going into the fight. He will now join the likes of Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson as dominant champions to suffer losses which brought the sport to a standstill. ""I got beaten by a good fighter,"" said 29-year-old Joshua. ""It will be interesting to see how far he goes, but this is all part of the journey. ""He's a champion for now, I shall return."" Joshua vows to 'get the belts back' after 'minor setback' BBC 5 Live boxing: Joshua stunned in New York Re-live how Ruiz Jr beat Joshua to shake up the heavyweight division This was no fluke, no punch from the ages, it was the breakdown of a fighter who looked shattered from an early stage. After flooring Ruiz with a left hook in the third round, Joshua hit the canvas when a right crashed against his temple. By the time a sensational three minutes was up he had been down again thanks to a flurry when cornered. It created an electric buzz amongst the 19,000 or so in the arena. Just what was happening? Were they going to see the unthinkable? Ruiz, 29, was not even supposed to be here. He took the bout at six weeks' notice and tickets were being collected by fans 24 hours before the bout which still had the name of Jarrell Miller - Joshua's original opponent - printed on them. By the seventh round, when Joshua touched down under a flurry of shots again, the game looked up. Seconds later he was down on all fours again and spat his gum shield out, perhaps to buy time. He simply did not have it. The bout was waved off and all that was planned for the glamour division was ripped up thanks to a man who had been dubbed unglamorous because of his rounded physique. Ruiz, from appearance to pedigree, was an underdog in every sense of the word. When Britons wake up on Sunday morning, they will read of a truly iconic upset. Ruiz Jr had won 32 of his 33 fights before this bout Ruiz, American born but with Mexican parents, becomes Mexico's first heavyweight world champion, just as he said he would. When Joshua sat down with the media on Wednesday, virtually every question directed at him was about his future, not this bout. He said he was ""seeing the bigger picture"" and maybe therein lies the problem. After six fairly tentative minutes from both men he scored his knockdown from a crisp left hook as the pair boxed up close. Normal order appeared set to play out. Moments later when he himself hit the deck, we were taken back to histitanic struggle with Wladimir Klitschko.The night was on a cliff edge, simply do not blink. And from that first knock down, he never appeared comfortable. Whether it be stamina, a lack of focus or a lack of preparation for his late stand-in, this was not the Joshua the travelling 8,000 strong army of British fans had grown to know. In the sixth round there were warning signs. After a smart left hook and right hand combination from Ruiz early on, he went on to take pot shots at Joshua's head, with the champion seemingly too fatigued to even muster a guard while his legs appeared confused below him. And then came the finish, mainly built from punch volume as Ruiz overwhelmed his vulnerable opponent with two knock downs in quick succession. The crowd seemed frozen. Surely not? Yes, it was over. There will be questions because Joshua is his own biggest analyst. For now, there is only disbelief. This video can not be played Anthony Joshua vows to 'get belts back' after 'minor setback' Joshua was down on two cards and up on one when the stoppage came but, according to promoter Eddie Hearn, he will get his chance to rectify things in a rematch in London, in November or December. ""This will devastate him,"" said Hearn. ""He will come back. It's now down to the rematch and winning that fight. ""To get back to the heights he has been, he must win that rematch."" For now, all talk of facing Tyson Fury or WBC champion Deontay Wilder can stop. Ruiz, who now has 33 wins and one loss can temporarily bask in the glory of his glorious night. He joins James 'Buster' Douglas - who humbled Tyson in 1990 - and Hasim Rahman who beat Lewis in 2001 as men to land colossal upsets. Lewis of course responded by winning a rematch. Ruiz though showed plenty here to suggest Joshua will have to find plenty to do the same. Ruiz was calm and calculated in staying away from Joshua's obvious power early on. When he stepped forward he did so with conviction and threw plenty, ensuring he got shots off to justify the risk of making himself vulnerable. When he did take shots after being floored, he took them and ploughed on gamely. This bout changed his and his five children's lives financially. The rematch will do so even more. ""This is what I have been dreaming about and I cannot believe I made my dreams come true,"" he said. ""That was my first time getting dropped on the floor but it made me want it even more."" From starting boxing aged six, to being taunted and doubted because of his weight, he has now come up trumps to deliver the ultimate 'I told you so' moment. He rightly said ""the sky is the limit now"", while Joshua will look back on a US bow which was wrecked. BBC Radio 5 Live boxing pundit Steve Bunce:""Anthony Joshua was a broken man in that seventh round. He spat his gum shield out and went back to the ropes. The referee had no option but to stop the fight. ""Anthony Joshua is not going to be able to get away with saying 'what a great fight that was - everyone was entertained'. ""That is not good enough."" Former world heavyweight champion and BBC Radio 5 Live pundit, David Haye:""If Anthony Joshua is as healthy and fit as he says he is, then there is something wrong. He needs something in his camp that he didn't have. ""I thought it was a fantastic night of boxing and unfortunately the Brit lost his belts, but this is why I love heavyweight boxing because anything can happen on the night. ""His invincibility has gone and he is now just a mere mortal. Now, fighters know they have just got to stick in there against him and keep throwing body shots."" Former featherweight and super-bantamweight world champion, and Radio 5 Live pundit Carl Frampton:""This is the biggest shock I have ever seen in my whole days in boxing, and it's live. I liked Eddie Hearn's honesty by saying Anthony Joshua must win the rematch. Where does he stand if he loses that?""

Trump visit: All you need to know,"This video can not be played The BBC's Jonny Dymond on what to expect from President Trump's visit to the UK US President Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Trump are making a state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June. Here's a rundown of what we can expect. It's a formal trip to the UK by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. Although they're grand occasions, they're not just ceremonial affairs - they're also used by the government to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state per year and has hosted 112 of these visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Familyhas a full list of all the other state visits,external, and details ofhow the ceremonies unfold,external. Visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle, but because Buckingham Palace is being renovated the US president is not expected to stay there. While Mr Trump is only the third US president to make a state visit to the UK, the Queenhas met almost all the US presidents in office during that time, either in the UK or in the US. On Monday, the first day of Mr Trump's three-day trip, a ceremonial welcome attended by the Queen, Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall was held in the Buckingham Palace garden. After the welcome, the Duke of Sussex joined the group for a private lunch at the palace. This video can not be played Here's what happened on day one of Donald Trump's state visit to the UK (tweets not included). Mr and Mrs Trump then visited Westminster Abbey for a tour and met Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall for tea at Clarence House. Astate banquet in the palace's ballroom took place on Monday evening, with Mr Trump, the Queen, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, along with other UK public figures and prominent Americans living in Britain. The banquet was held in the ballroom at Buckingham Palace On Tuesday, Mr Trump and Prime Minister Theresa May will host a business breakfast attended by the Duke of York at St James's Palace. Business leaders understood to be attending include Barclays CEO Jes Staley, GlaxoSmithKline chief executive Emma Walmsley, BAE Systems chairman Sir Roger Carr and the National Grid's John Pettigrew. Mr Trump will then visit Downing Street for talks with Theresa May. They are expected to discuss a range of issues on which they hold differing views - includingclimate changeandHuawei. Trump visit: A barometer of political power The talks will be followed by a joint press conference. Mrs May is due to step down as prime minister on 7 June. Thousands of people are expected to join protests against Mr Trump's visit in UK cities on Tuesday. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is due to address the London rally in Trafalgar Square, where he will be joined by members of other political parties including the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. In the evening, the Trumps will host a dinner at the residence of the US ambassador attended by Charles and Camilla on behalf of the Queen. The trip is expected to culminate on Wednesday 5 June with Mr Trump, the Queen and Prince Charles attending the national commemorative event in Portsmouth for the 75th anniversary of the D-Day landings. More than 300 veterans will be at the ceremony, which will feature musical performances, testimonial readings and military displays. Trump visit 'will detract from D-Day event' Following the D-Day event Mr Trump will travel to his hotel and golf resort in Doonbeg, in the Republic of Ireland. He will hold a meeting with Irish premier Leo Varadkar at Shannon Airport. A visiting leader will sometimes speak at the Houses of Parliament during a state visit, but Commons Speaker John Bercow said on Tuesday he had not received a request for Mr Trump to do so. The president has suggested he ""may"" meet Conservative MP and leadership hopeful Boris Johnson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage during his visit -both of whom he described as ""friends"" and ""good guys"". The prime minister says the visit is a chance for the UK and the US to strengthen their ""already close relationship"". Talks will cover areas such as trade, investment, security and defence. But Mr Trump is a controversial figure and many have opposed the visit. Thousands gathered to protest against President Trump's policies when he visited the UK in 2018 His policies - from the executive order that restricts entry to the US from certain countries, to the wall with Mexico, and his rejection of the Paris climate deal - have provoked criticism, both domestically and internationally. And that is to say nothing about some of the comments he's made - including outspoken attacks against political opponents, the media, and his critics - and the investigation into his links to Russia. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn refused to attend Mr Trump's state banquet, accusing the president of using ""racist and misogynist rhetoric"", while Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable also declined an invitation. Others argue that the US is a key ally of the UK and that Mr Trump should be welcomed accordingly. When the president's on the move - you know about it The security operation surrounding Mr Trump's visit could cost more than Â£18m. It is intended to createan impenetrable ring of steelaround the US president. The president arrived in the UK on his customised, high-spec aircraft Air Force One. Inside, the president and his travel companions enjoy 4,000 sq ft of floor space on three levels, with space for conference and dining rooms and a medical facility with an operating table. The presidential motorcade, which includes two identical limousines nicknamed The Beast and other security and communications vehicles, was flown across ahead of the president by United States Air Force transport aircraft. In 2018, almost 10,000 officers from the UK were deployed for Mr Trump's trip, with nearly every force in the country providing staff to support the operation. This video can not be played Dinner, talks and golf: A look back at President Trump's last visit to the UK It was certainly eventful. As well as holding talks with Mrs May at her country residence, Chequers, and having tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle, the trip was marked by demonstrations. Tens of thousands of peoplegathered in central London to protest against him. There was also a six-metre ""Trump baby"" blimp - depicting the president as a nappy-wearing infant - inflated outside Parliament. And at his golf resort at Turnberry, Ayrshire,one protester paraglided over the hotelas Mr Trump played the course. Campaigners have claimed they will mobilise ""huge numbers"" in response to Mr Trump's arrival. On Monday supporters of the human rights charity Amnesty unfurled five banners facing the US embassy on Vauxhall Bridge, reading ""Resist sexism"", ""Resist racism"", ""Resist hate"", ""Resist cruelty"" and ""Resist Trump"". A ""national demonstration"" in London's Trafalgar Square will start at 11:00 BST on Tuesday, while protests are also planned in Birmingham, Stoke, Sheffield, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Chester, Leicester, Oxford and Exeter. A 16ft talking robot of Mr Trump sitting on a golden toilet is also expected to make an appearance. Trump visit: A barometer of power Trump's UK visit: Whatâs he bringing?

'US wants to see Brexit happen',"John Bolton said Brexit was a chance for the UK to become a ""strong and independent country"" The Trump administration wants the UK to follow the 2016 referendum result and leave the European Union, National Security Advisor John Bolton said. Speaking to the UK's Telegraph, Mr Bolton said Brexit was an opportunity for the UK to become a ""strong and independent country"". His remarks came ahead of a UK visit by President Trump, who has previously stated his support for Brexit. Mr Trump was critical of Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiations with the EU. The president's three-day trip, from 3 to 5 June, includes a Buckingham Palace dinner and breakfast with Mrs May, who has hailed the visit as an opportunity for the UK and US ""to strengthen our already close relationship"". Speaking ahead of his visit,President Trump praised the UK Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson, saying he would make ""excellent"" choice. In an interview published on Friday, Mr Bolton - a former ambassador to the UN who is considered one of the more hawkish members of the Trump administration - said the world and the Nato military alliance would benefit from the UK being outside the EU. ""As a separate nation again, Britain's impact on the world has the prospect of being even greater...,externalI think it will help us in Nato in particular to have another strong and independent country that will help Nato to be more effective, and that has to be a plus."" He added: ""The US preference is for Britain to follow the course of what the people asked for and leave the EU. It's a lesson for everyone in the triumph of democracy."" Trump says Boris Johnson would be 'excellent' Tory leader What's Trump bringing with him to the UK? What can we expect from the visit? Mr Bolton said the first step towards a closer relationship was for the next prime minister to finish the Brexit process and negotiate a new trade deal with the US. Theresa May has resigned as prime minister over her Brexit deal Last week, Mrs May - whose withdrawal agreement with the EU was rejected by the UK Parliament three times - announced thatshe would quit as Conservative party leader on 7 Junebut stay in office until a successor was found. ""[Mr Trump] wants to make a deal with Britain that will leave both of us better off, and free Britain from the regulatory constraints it faces with the EU,"" Mr Bolton said. The US president, who has previously said Mrs May had not listened to his advice on how to negotiate a deal with the EU, said the agreement reached by the prime minister sounded ""like a great deal for the EU"". He had also raised fears that, under Mrs May's Brexit deal,the US and the UK would not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement. Mr Trump has said he might meet Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Conservative MP Boris Johnson - one of the 11 contenders to replace Mrs May as Conservative leader - during his trip to the UK. This video can not be played Donald Trump in March: ""I'm surprised at how badly Brexit negotiations have all gone"" Meanwhile, there are growing signs that President Trump will warn British authorities that the US government is prepared to limit intelligence sharing if the UK allows Chinese technology giant Huawei to build part of its 5G network Washington believes the technology could be used by China to spy, a claim Huawei has denied. Speaking in Germany, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The risk that we'll have to change our behaviour in light of the fact that we can't permit private citizen data from the US or national security data from the US to go across networks that we don't have confidence, that we don't view as trusted networks."" The UK, where 5G was launched in six cities on Thursday, is moving towards letting Huawei build certain parts of its network - non-core elements, such as transmission equipment rather than information infrastructure.

"Trump: Prepare for no deal and send in FarageBritain should walk away from the EU unless it secures the deal it wants, the US president says.","Donald Trump and Nigel Farage during a campaign rally at the Mississippi Coliseum in August 2016 Nigel Farage should be involved in the government's Brexit negotiations and the UK should be prepared to leave the EU with no deal, Donald Trump has said. In a Sunday Times interview,,externalthe US president was critical of government's Brexit negotiations, saying it left the EU ""with all the cards."" The interview comes before his state visit to the UK begins on Monday. On Saturday Mr Trump alsosaid Boris Johnson would be an ""excellent"" Conservative Party leader. Breaking with diplomatic convention, Mr Trump said the leader of the Brexit Party - an arch critic of Prime Minister Theresa May - ""has a lot to offer"" in negotiations with the EU, and should be included. ""Think how well they would do if they did,"" he added. He also said the UK should walk away if it does not get what it wants from EU negotiations. ""If you don't get the deal you want, if you don't get a fair deal, then you walk away."" Meanwhile, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has marked Mr Trump's visit by calling him ""one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat"". In an article forthe Observer,external, Mr Khan said: ""The far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms and the values that have defined our liberal, democratic societies for more than 70 years."" In April, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was boycotting Mr Trump's state banquet at Buckingham Palace, in protest at the president's""racist and misogynistic rhetoric"". But the US Ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said he believed ""everything is going to go great"" on the trip. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson also talked about potential future trade agreements between the two countries after Brexit. He said the UK would not have to accept US agriculture standards to get a deal - although he said the ""American food supply is as safe as anything in Europe"". And while he called the NHS the ""pride of the country"", he said that in order to strike a deal, ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson Jeremy Corbyn:Asked if he would share US intelligence with a Corbyn government, the US president said: ""I would have to know him, I would have to meet."" Brexit:On paying a Â£39bn ($50bn) divorce bill: ""I wouldn't pay $50bn. That is me. I would not pay - that is a tremendous number."" Nigel Farage:""I got to know him when he liked my campaign and he actually came to a speech and I met him. I think he is a terrific person. Really, a terrific person."" A US-UK trade deal:""One of the advantages of Brexit is the fact that now you can deal with the No 1 country by far."" Boris Johnson as PM:""[He] would do a very good job - he would be excellent. He has been very positive about me and our country."" The US president also reiterated his praise for Boris Johnson - who is willing to leave the EU with no deal. Mr Johnson is one of the candidates inTory leadership contestto replace Prime Minister Theresa May.

Joshua beaten in one of boxing's biggest upsetsAnthony Joshua loses his world heavyweight titles after being stopped by Mexican Andy Ruiz Jr.BBC SportComments,"Joshua suffered his first defeat as a professional in his first fight in the United States Andy Ruiz Jr produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of heavyweight boxing to rip Anthony Joshua's IBF, WBO and WBA world heavyweight titles from him and tear up the division's proposed plot lines. In a truly remarkable fight at New York's Madison Square Garden, Ruiz floored Joshua four times en route to a seventh-round stoppage, which stunned this famous arena and handed the Briton his first defeat as a professional. Joshua was a 1-25 favourite with bookmakers, with 22 wins - 21 by knockout - going into the fight. He will now join the likes of Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson as dominant champions to suffer losses which brought the sport to a standstill. ""I got beaten by a good fighter,"" said 29-year-old Joshua. ""It will be interesting to see how far he goes, but this is all part of the journey. ""He's a champion for now, I shall return."" Joshua vows to 'get the belts back' after 'minor setback' BBC 5 Live boxing: Joshua stunned in New York Re-live how Ruiz Jr beat Joshua to shake up the heavyweight division This was no fluke, no punch from the ages, it was the breakdown of a fighter who looked shattered from an early stage. After flooring Ruiz with a left hook in the third round, Joshua hit the canvas when a right crashed against his temple. By the time a sensational three minutes was up he had been down again thanks to a flurry when cornered. It created an electric buzz amongst the 19,000 or so in the arena. Just what was happening? Were they going to see the unthinkable? Ruiz, 29, was not even supposed to be here. He took the bout at six weeks' notice and tickets were being collected by fans 24 hours before the bout which still had the name of Jarrell Miller - Joshua's original opponent - printed on them. By the seventh round, when Joshua touched down under a flurry of shots again, the game looked up. Seconds later he was down on all fours again and spat his gum shield out, perhaps to buy time. He simply did not have it. The bout was waved off and all that was planned for the glamour division was ripped up thanks to a man who had been dubbed unglamorous because of his rounded physique. Ruiz, from appearance to pedigree, was an underdog in every sense of the word. When Britons wake up on Sunday morning, they will read of a truly iconic upset. Ruiz Jr had won 32 of his 33 fights before this bout Ruiz, American born but with Mexican parents, becomes Mexico's first heavyweight world champion, just as he said he would. When Joshua sat down with the media on Wednesday, virtually every question directed at him was about his future, not this bout. He said he was ""seeing the bigger picture"" and maybe therein lies the problem. After six fairly tentative minutes from both men he scored his knockdown from a crisp left hook as the pair boxed up close. Normal order appeared set to play out. Moments later when he himself hit the deck, we were taken back to histitanic struggle with Wladimir Klitschko.The night was on a cliff edge, simply do not blink. And from that first knock down, he never appeared comfortable. Whether it be stamina, a lack of focus or a lack of preparation for his late stand-in, this was not the Joshua the travelling 8,000 strong army of British fans had grown to know. In the sixth round there were warning signs. After a smart left hook and right hand combination from Ruiz early on, he went on to take pot shots at Joshua's head, with the champion seemingly too fatigued to even muster a guard while his legs appeared confused below him. And then came the finish, mainly built from punch volume as Ruiz overwhelmed his vulnerable opponent with two knock downs in quick succession. The crowd seemed frozen. Surely not? Yes, it was over. There will be questions because Joshua is his own biggest analyst. For now, there is only disbelief. This video can not be played Anthony Joshua vows to 'get belts back' after 'minor setback' Joshua was down on two cards and up on one when the stoppage came but, according to promoter Eddie Hearn, he will get his chance to rectify things in a rematch in London, in November or December. ""This will devastate him,"" said Hearn. ""He will come back. It's now down to the rematch and winning that fight. ""To get back to the heights he has been, he must win that rematch."" For now, all talk of facing Tyson Fury or WBC champion Deontay Wilder can stop. Ruiz, who now has 33 wins and one loss can temporarily bask in the glory of his glorious night. He joins James 'Buster' Douglas - who humbled Tyson in 1990 - and Hasim Rahman who beat Lewis in 2001 as men to land colossal upsets. Lewis of course responded by winning a rematch. Ruiz though showed plenty here to suggest Joshua will have to find plenty to do the same. Ruiz was calm and calculated in staying away from Joshua's obvious power early on. When he stepped forward he did so with conviction and threw plenty, ensuring he got shots off to justify the risk of making himself vulnerable. When he did take shots after being floored, he took them and ploughed on gamely. This bout changed his and his five children's lives financially. The rematch will do so even more. ""This is what I have been dreaming about and I cannot believe I made my dreams come true,"" he said. ""That was my first time getting dropped on the floor but it made me want it even more."" From starting boxing aged six, to being taunted and doubted because of his weight, he has now come up trumps to deliver the ultimate 'I told you so' moment. He rightly said ""the sky is the limit now"", while Joshua will look back on a US bow which was wrecked. BBC Radio 5 Live boxing pundit Steve Bunce:""Anthony Joshua was a broken man in that seventh round. He spat his gum shield out and went back to the ropes. The referee had no option but to stop the fight. ""Anthony Joshua is not going to be able to get away with saying 'what a great fight that was - everyone was entertained'. ""That is not good enough."" Former world heavyweight champion and BBC Radio 5 Live pundit, David Haye:""If Anthony Joshua is as healthy and fit as he says he is, then there is something wrong. He needs something in his camp that he didn't have. ""I thought it was a fantastic night of boxing and unfortunately the Brit lost his belts, but this is why I love heavyweight boxing because anything can happen on the night. ""His invincibility has gone and he is now just a mere mortal. Now, fighters know they have just got to stick in there against him and keep throwing body shots."" Former featherweight and super-bantamweight world champion, and Radio 5 Live pundit Carl Frampton:""This is the biggest shock I have ever seen in my whole days in boxing, and it's live. I liked Eddie Hearn's honesty by saying Anthony Joshua must win the rematch. Where does he stand if he loses that?"" BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello:""Anthony Joshua looked vacant in the ring after the fight.""

'Shameful' funeral sale tactics targetedCompanies that pressure people into buying funeral plans could face criminal charges in future.,"Companies that use high-pressure or bullying tactics to sell funeral plans could face fines and criminal charges, the government says. The Treasury has announced proposals to regulate UK funeral providers through the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), offering protection to customers. Evidence shows some providers have used misleading sales tactics, costing vulnerable customers up to Â£5,000. In 2018 about 177,000 pre-paid funeral plans were sold. A spokesperson for the Treasury said there were ""widespread concerns around the conduct of funeral providers"" and the sales tactics used to ""get customers to sign up to plans"". Providers breaching the regulations could also have their authorisation revoked. A consultation on the proposals is now taking place. City minister John Glen said: ""It's shameful that there are those out there who look to prey on people when they are in this often emotional and vulnerable state. ""That's why I've taken the decision to regulate pre-paid funeral plans, so people can have more confidence in the products they're being offered and peace of mind that their affairs will be handled correctly."" The funeral plan industry has grown nearly 200% between 2006 and 2018. It comes as the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) saidessential costs of a funeral have increased by 6% each year,for the last 14 years. Currently funeral plan providers can sign up to an industry regulator voluntarily - so firms can also choose not to sign up to the rules. Under the proposals the FCA would oversee regulation of the sector, and customers would have access to the Financial Ombudsman Service. Funeral Service provider Dignity welcomed the call for greater regulation, saying it would ""protect consumers from misleading advertising and aggressive sales methods"".

Uncovering Pakistan's secret human rights abusesCrazy Golf just got (a bit) serious,"For more than a decade Pakistan has kept Waziristan under tightly regulated travel restrictions Tens of thousands of people have been killed in Pakistan's long battle with militants as part of the post-9/11 ""war on terror"". Evidence of murder and torture by soldiers and insurgents is emerging only now. The BBC has gained rare access to some of the victims. It was early in 2014 when TV news networks trumpeted a major victory in the war against the Pakistani Taliban - the killing of one of the group's most senior commanders in a night-time air raid. Adnan Rasheed and up to five members of his family were reported to have died in the strikes in the North Waziristan tribal area, near the Afghan border. Rasheed, a former Pakistan Air Force technician, was well-known. He had written an extraordinary letter to Malala Yousafzai, the schoolgirl and activist shot in the head by Taliban gunmen in 2012, attempting to justify why it had happened. He'd also been in prison for trying to assassinate former President Pervez Musharraf - until he broke out. Now it appeared that his luck had run out. Quoting security officials, news channels reported on 22 January 2014 that Adnan Rasheed's hideout had been targeted two nights earlier in the Hamzoni area. Waziristan and other parts of the vast mountainous tribal region have been controlled and locked-down by the Pakistani military since the US invasion of Afghanistan after 9/11, which saw Taliban fighters, al-Qaeda jihadists and other militants flee over the porous border. Outsiders, including journalists, cannot get in - so verifying claims from the security forces is extremely difficult. Those who have reported stories from Waziristan that don't reflect well on the military have found themselves punished. It turned out a year later that the jets had hit the wrong target - Rasheed confirmed this when he emerged in a video to prove he was alive. Adnan Rasheed had been sentenced to death for trying to kill former president Pervez Musharraf Instead of taking out a top militant, Pakistan's military had actually killed the family of a local man who had his home blown to pieces. The authorities have never acknowledged they made a mistake. The BBC travelled to Dera Ismail Khan, a town on the banks of the river Indus that is the gateway to the remote and forbidding tribal areas, to meet the man whose house was hit. ""It must have been 11pm or thereabouts,"" recalls Nazirullah, who was 20 at the time. He and his wife had recently married and had the rare privilege of a room to themselves. The rest of their large family slept in the only other room in their house in Khatei Kalay village. ""It was as if the house had exploded. My wife and I were shaken out of our sleep. There was a strong smell of gunpowder in the air. Both of us rushed to the door and stepped out, only to discover that the entire roof of our room had already collapsed, except a corner where our bed was."" Nazirullah and his niece Sumayya survived but four members of the family were killed The roof of the second room had also collapsed, and a fire was raging across the compound. Nazirullah heard cries from the rubble and, with his wife, frantically tried to help those they could see in the glow of the fire. Neighbours helped them dig out the injured and the dead. Four of Nazirullah's family died, including a three-year-old girl. His niece Sumayya, whose mother was among those killed, was then just a year old, and survived with a fractured hip. Another four members of the family were rescued from the rubble. All suffered fractures and other injuries. Nazirullah's family has since moved back to Dera Ismail Khan, where life is more peaceful. Like many others in this part of Pakistan, they have had to move several times to escape an insurgency that has been raging in the tribal areas for nearly two decades. According to authorities and independent research groups, militant violence since 2002 has forced more than five million people in Pakistan's north-west to leave their homes to seek refuge either in government-run refugee camps or rented houses in peaceful areas. There are no official figures of the total death toll of this war but estimates from academics, local authorities and activists put the number of civilians, militants and security forces killed at well over 50,000. A protest Pakistan wants to hide from the world The young tribesman rattling Pakistan's army Pakistan's undeclared war,external Local rights activists say scores of civilians have been killed in successive air campaigns and ground operations by the military. They have been collecting video and documentary evidence to back up their claims. These activists are linked to a prominent new rights campaign called the Pashtun Tahaffuz (Protection) Movement (PTM) which emerged early last year and has since been publicising alleged rights abuses in the tribal region that victims had previously been too scared to report. ""It has taken us almost 15 years of suffering and humiliation to gather courage to speak up, and to spread awareness about how the military trampled our constitutional rights through both direct action and a policy of support for the militants,"" said Manzoor Pashteen, the top leader of the PTM. But the group is under pressure. The PTM says 13 of its activists were killed on 26 May when the army opened fire on a large group of protesters in North Waziristan. The army said at least three activists were shot dead after a military checkpoint was attacked. The PTM denies this but two of its leaders, who also serve as MPs, have been arrested. Pashtun Protection Movement leader Manzoor Pashteen has helped publicise rights abuses A number of cases highlighted by the PTM - and which the BBC investigated independently - were shared with a Pakistani military spokesman but he declined to respond, calling such allegations ""highly judgmental"". There was no response to BBC requests for comment from the government of Prime Minister Imran Khan, even though Mr Khan raised the issue of rights abuses in the tribal areas when he was an opposition politician. It all started with the al-Qaeda attacks in September 2001 in New York and Washington. When the US attacked Afghanistan in October 2001, the Taliban forces that had sheltered al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden melted away without a fight. Armed Pakistani Taliban at a hideout in the tribal district of Orakzai in 2009 Pakistan, which was one of only three countries to have recognised the Taliban when they seized power in Kabul in 1996, had an interest in keeping the movement alive as part of its efforts to prevent Indian influence from spreading in Afghanistan. So while Pakistan had been dependent on US military aid for decades and the then military regime of Gen Pervez Musharraf had joined the US ""war on terror"", it also allowed the Taliban to carve out sanctuaries in Pakistan's semi-autonomous tribal areas, notably the districts of North and South Waziristan. But the Afghan Taliban did not cross the border alone. Militants from a complex array of different groups poured into the tribal region and some were far more hostile to the Pakistani state. Viewpoint: Will Pakistan mend its ways on terror? Jihadists with global ambitions also began plotting attacks from Waziristan, prompting demands from Washington that Pakistan do more to crush Islamist militancy. As violence spread, Pakistan was caught ""between an inclination to fight militant forces and yet having to partner with some to strengthen its future bargaining position"", said Ayesha Siddiqa, a security analyst and author of the book Military Inc: Inside Pakistan's Military Economy. In 2014, Pakistan launched a new operation in North Waziristan that increased pressure on militant groups and their safe havens and was credited with reducing attacks elsewhere in the country. When the Taliban arrived in the tribal areas in 2001, they were given a cautious welcome by the local people. But this quickly turned into disillusionment when they started to take over tribal society by enforcing their strict religious codes. During the first phase of that relationship, local youths joined the militants' ranks in their hundreds, thereby causing tribal rivalries to seep into the militant network. This was reflected in subsequent factional wars. In the second stage, the Taliban embarked on a campaign to eliminate officially recognised tribal elders who were a hurdle in the way of the insurgents' drive to subjugate the tribes. At least 1,000 tribal elders have been killed by militants since 2002 and some estimates from non-governmental organisations put the figure at nearly 2,000. Waziristan is rugged, inhospitable terrain - and closed to outsiders and journalists One such assassination in North Waziristan in July 2007 is emblematic of how militants were able to subjugate the tribes. ""When they kidnapped and killed my brother, the tribe in our region was still strong, but because the military allowed [the militants] the freedom to move against our people, it broke our back,"" says Mohammad Amin, a Wazir tribesman from Razmak area of North Waziristan. His brother's body was found dumped in an abandoned truck the day after he was kidnapped by militants. Mohammad Amin and other tribesmen were able to trace the attackers and confronted them. The ensuing gunfight left Mr Amin's son, Asadullah, a cousin and all four Taliban fighters dead. Asadullah was shot dead by Taliban fighters trying to subdue his tribe The tribe's subsequent calls on military officials in the garrison town of Razmak to curb Taliban violence were frustrated when militant leaders based in that very town threatened reprisal. A decade on, Mr Amin is in no doubt that ""despite occasional clashes with each other, the Taliban and the military are doing the same thing"". PTM activists have also documented several cases in which the security forces appear to have treated the local population brutally. In May 2016, for example, an attack on a military post in the Teti Madakhel area of North Waziristan triggered a manhunt by troops who rounded up the entire population of a village. An eyewitness who watched the operation from a wheat field nearby and whose brother was among those detained told the BBC that the soldiers beat everyone with batons and threw mud in children's mouths when they cried. A pregnant woman was one of two people who died during torture, her son said in video testimony. At least one man remains missing. Many tribal residents ended up in camps for displaced people in Peshawar and other places The stories of survivors are painful too. I met Satarjan Mahsud in the town of Ramak, 100km (60 miles) further south down the Indus river from Dera Ismail Khan. We sat inside a white tent and he told me his story over tea, with two young children at his side One evening in April 2015 militants fired at a military post in Shaktoi, South Waziristan. Satarjan says troops responded by capturing suspects from a nearby village and shooting two of them dead. Early the next morning, on 21 April, they extended their search across the valley to Satarjan's village where they found weapons stashed on a hill behind his house. ""The only people present in the house at that time were my brother Idarjan, his wife and two daughters-in-law,"" Satarjan says. Satarjan has spent four years trying to trace his brother and nephews - to no avail The soldiers knocked at the door. His brother answered and was immediately overpowered, tied up and blindfolded. The troops asked where other male members of the family were and rounded up Idarjan's four sons from elsewhere in the valley. Witnesses later told Satarjan that the boys had been beaten, and his eldest nephew, Rezwarjan, received a lethal blow to the head. All of them were thrown in the back of a pick-up truck which the soldiers had commandeered, and driven away to the army camp in the area. The driver of the truck later told Satarjan that Rezwarjan was ""already half dead and couldn't hold himself in a sitting position, so the soldiers decided not to take him to the camp"". He told Satarjan: ""They asked me to stop the truck, shot Rezwarjan in the head and threw his body on the road."" Satarjan was working at a factory in Dubai at the time. He heard about what had happened and began the journey home. He took a flight, a bus and then walked for 15 hours to reach the village where Rezwarjan's body was found on 23 April. People in the tribal areas have protested - but they are still waiting for justice Locals there told him they hadn't been able to take the body across the valley to his family home because of a curfew, so they had buried it there on the hill. He then walked across to his own village where he found his house deserted. The wives of Satarjan's brother and nephews had been taken in by relatives. Satarjan knew the women wouldn't know the whole story because the curfew forbade travel between villages and there was no mobile network in the area. When he met his sister-in-law, she told him what she knew: that her husband had been taken away by the army and that the younger men were missing. ""I was in two minds about whether to tell her. But then I thought it would be easier to give her the bad news about Rezwarjan once my brother and the boys had returned. I knew the army had nothing against them and would let them go soon."" So he made up a story, telling her that when the army raided their house, the boys got away to safety in Karachi, far away in southern Pakistan. He assured her that her husband would soon be released. On 26 April 2015, he moved the family to Ramak. Since then he's had no word from the military on the fate of his brother and three nephews. Weeks have turned into months, and months into years. He is not alone. Local activists say more than 8,000 people picked up by the army since 2002 remain unaccounted for. Meanwhile, Satarjan has been dodging questions from the women about why they can't visit their village. ""I tell them our house in Shaktoi has been demolished by the army, which is partly true. But the real reason is that if they go there, neighbours will come for condolences and they will find out."" He says it would be better if he knew his brother and nephews had been jailed, or even killed. But not knowing anything is agony. ""I can't tell my sister-in-law her sons are missing, or dead. I can't tell the two young wives that they have been widowed,"" he says. The long road to justice for student stabbed 23 times How a 9-year-old exposed police for killing his family The Pakistan poet who dared talk of female desire Shock over raid on Karachi's âisland of freedomâ These individual stories are shocking but they are not unique. The PTM alleges that hundreds of people from the tribal areas could tell similar stories. But they remain officially unacknowledged. They are the consequences of a war Pakistan has gone to great lengths to hide from the world. This conflict on the Afghan border has for years been an information black hole. And when the PTM broke through this chokehold last year, its media coverage was put under a comprehensive ban. Those in the media who have not heeded the ban have faced physical threats and financial pressure. The military has openly called the PTM's patriotic credentials into question,external, accusing it of links to ""hostile"" intelligence agencies in Afghanistan and India. And somePTM activists who were documenting cases of abuse and running the group's social media campaign have been jailed,external. The treatment of the activists who are finally, after years of silence, raising the alarm on the abuses of a long and secret war suggests that those who have suffered in the conflict face an uphill battle for justice.

Bolton says US wants to see Brexit happen,"John Bolton said Brexit was a chance for the UK to become a ""strong and independent country"" The Trump administration wants the UK to follow the 2016 referendum result and leave the European Union, National Security Advisor John Bolton said. Speaking to the UK's Telegraph, Mr Bolton said Brexit was an opportunity for the UK to become a ""strong and independent country"". His remarks came ahead of a UK visit by President Trump, who has previously stated his support for Brexit. Mr Trump was critical of Prime Minister Theresa May's negotiations with the EU. The president's three-day trip, from 3 to 5 June, includes a Buckingham Palace dinner and breakfast with Mrs May, who has hailed the visit as an opportunity for the UK and US ""to strengthen our already close relationship"". Speaking ahead of his visit,President Trump praised the UK Conservative Party leadership contender Boris Johnson, saying he would make ""excellent"" choice. In an interview published on Friday, Mr Bolton - a former ambassador to the UN who is considered one of the more hawkish members of the Trump administration - said the world and the Nato military alliance would benefit from the UK being outside the EU. ""As a separate nation again, Britain's impact on the world has the prospect of being even greater...,externalI think it will help us in Nato in particular to have another strong and independent country that will help Nato to be more effective, and that has to be a plus."" He added: ""The US preference is for Britain to follow the course of what the people asked for and leave the EU. It's a lesson for everyone in the triumph of democracy."" Trump says Boris Johnson would be 'excellent' Tory leader What's Trump bringing with him to the UK? What can we expect from the visit? Mr Bolton said the first step towards a closer relationship was for the next prime minister to finish the Brexit process and negotiate a new trade deal with the US. Theresa May has resigned as prime minister over her Brexit deal Last week, Mrs May - whose withdrawal agreement with the EU was rejected by the UK Parliament three times - announced thatshe would quit as Conservative party leader on 7 Junebut stay in office until a successor was found. ""[Mr Trump] wants to make a deal with Britain that will leave both of us better off, and free Britain from the regulatory constraints it faces with the EU,"" Mr Bolton said. The US president, who has previously said Mrs May had not listened to his advice on how to negotiate a deal with the EU, said the agreement reached by the prime minister sounded ""like a great deal for the EU"". He had also raised fears that, under Mrs May's Brexit deal,the US and the UK would not be able to negotiate a free trade agreement. Mr Trump has said he might meet Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage and Conservative MP Boris Johnson - one of the 11 contenders to replace Mrs May as Conservative leader - during his trip to the UK. This video can not be played Donald Trump in March: ""I'm surprised at how badly Brexit negotiations have all gone"" Meanwhile, there are growing signs that President Trump will warn British authorities that the US government is prepared to limit intelligence sharing if the UK allows Chinese technology giant Huawei to build part of its 5G network Washington believes the technology could be used by China to spy, a claim Huawei has denied. Speaking in Germany, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said: ""The risk that we'll have to change our behaviour in light of the fact that we can't permit private citizen data from the US or national security data from the US to go across networks that we don't have confidence, that we don't view as trusted networks."" The UK, where 5G was launched in six cities on Thursday, is moving towards letting Huawei build certain parts of its network - non-core elements, such as transmission equipment rather than information infrastructure.

Boxing: Anthony Joshua loses sensationally,"Joshua suffered his first defeat as a professional in his first fight in the United States Andy Ruiz Jr produced one of the biggest shocks in the history of heavyweight boxing to rip Anthony Joshua's IBF, WBO and WBA world heavyweight titles from him and tear up the division's proposed plot lines. In a truly remarkable fight at New York's Madison Square Garden, Ruiz floored Joshua four times en route to a seventh-round stoppage, which stunned this famous arena and handed the Briton his first defeat as a professional. Joshua was a 1-25 favourite with bookmakers, with 22 wins - 21 by knockout - going into the fight. He will now join the likes of Lennox Lewis and Mike Tyson as dominant champions to suffer losses which brought the sport to a standstill. ""I got beaten by a good fighter,"" said 29-year-old Joshua. ""It will be interesting to see how far he goes, but this is all part of the journey. ""He's a champion for now, I shall return."" Joshua vows to 'get the belts back' after 'minor setback' BBC 5 Live boxing: Joshua stunned in New York Re-live how Ruiz Jr beat Joshua to shake up the heavyweight division This was no fluke, no punch from the ages, it was the breakdown of a fighter who looked shattered from an early stage. After flooring Ruiz with a left hook in the third round, Joshua hit the canvas when a right crashed against his temple. By the time a sensational three minutes was up he had been down again thanks to a flurry when cornered. It created an electric buzz amongst the 19,000 or so in the arena. Just what was happening? Were they going to see the unthinkable? Ruiz, 29, was not even supposed to be here. He took the bout at six weeks' notice and tickets were being collected by fans 24 hours before the bout which still had the name of Jarrell Miller - Joshua's original opponent - printed on them. By the seventh round, when Joshua touched down under a flurry of shots again, the game looked up. Seconds later he was down on all fours again and spat his gum shield out, perhaps to buy time. He simply did not have it. The bout was waved off and all that was planned for the glamour division was ripped up thanks to a man who had been dubbed unglamorous because of his rounded physique. Ruiz, from appearance to pedigree, was an underdog in every sense of the word. When Britons wake up on Sunday morning, they will read of a truly iconic upset. Ruiz Jr had won 32 of his 33 fights before this bout Ruiz, American born but with Mexican parents, becomes Mexico's first heavyweight world champion, just as he said he would. When Joshua sat down with the media on Wednesday, virtually every question directed at him was about his future, not this bout. He said he was ""seeing the bigger picture"" and maybe therein lies the problem. After six fairly tentative minutes from both men he scored his knockdown from a crisp left hook as the pair boxed up close. Normal order appeared set to play out. Moments later when he himself hit the deck, we were taken back to histitanic struggle with Wladimir Klitschko.The night was on a cliff edge, simply do not blink. And from that first knock down, he never appeared comfortable. Whether it be stamina, a lack of focus or a lack of preparation for his late stand-in, this was not the Joshua the travelling 8,000 strong army of British fans had grown to know. In the sixth round there were warning signs. After a smart left hook and right hand combination from Ruiz early on, he went on to take pot shots at Joshua's head, with the champion seemingly too fatigued to even muster a guard while his legs appeared confused below him. And then came the finish, mainly built from punch volume as Ruiz overwhelmed his vulnerable opponent with two knock downs in quick succession. The crowd seemed frozen. Surely not? Yes, it was over. There will be questions because Joshua is his own biggest analyst. For now, there is only disbelief. This video can not be played Anthony Joshua vows to 'get belts back' after 'minor setback' Joshua was down on two cards and up on one when the stoppage came but, according to promoter Eddie Hearn, he will get his chance to rectify things in a rematch in London, in November or December. ""This will devastate him,"" said Hearn. ""He will come back. It's now down to the rematch and winning that fight. ""To get back to the heights he has been, he must win that rematch."" For now, all talk of facing Tyson Fury or WBC champion Deontay Wilder can stop. Ruiz, who now has 33 wins and one loss can temporarily bask in the glory of his glorious night. He joins James 'Buster' Douglas - who humbled Tyson in 1990 - and Hasim Rahman who beat Lewis in 2001 as men to land colossal upsets. Lewis of course responded by winning a rematch. Ruiz though showed plenty here to suggest Joshua will have to find plenty to do the same. Ruiz was calm and calculated in staying away from Joshua's obvious power early on. When he stepped forward he did so with conviction and threw plenty, ensuring he got shots off to justify the risk of making himself vulnerable. When he did take shots after being floored, he took them and ploughed on gamely. This bout changed his and his five children's lives financially. The rematch will do so even more. ""This is what I have been dreaming about and I cannot believe I made my dreams come true,"" he said. ""That was my first time getting dropped on the floor but it made me want it even more."" From starting boxing aged six, to being taunted and doubted because of his weight, he has now come up trumps to deliver the ultimate 'I told you so' moment. He rightly said ""the sky is the limit now"", while Joshua will look back on a US bow which was wrecked. BBC Radio 5 Live boxing pundit Steve Bunce:""Anthony Joshua was a broken man in that seventh round. He spat his gum shield out and went back to the ropes. The referee had no option but to stop the fight. ""Anthony Joshua is not going to be able to get away with saying 'what a great fight that was - everyone was entertained'. ""That is not good enough."" Former world heavyweight champion and BBC Radio 5 Live pundit, David Haye:""If Anthony Joshua is as healthy and fit as he says he is, then there is something wrong. He needs something in his camp that he didn't have. ""I thought it was a fantastic night of boxing and unfortunately the Brit lost his belts, but this is why I love heavyweight boxing because anything can happen on the night. ""His invincibility has gone and he is now just a mere mortal. Now, fighters know they have just got to stick in there against him and keep throwing body shots."" Former featherweight and super-bantamweight world champion, and Radio 5 Live pundit Carl Frampton:""This is the biggest shock I have ever seen in my whole days in boxing, and it's live. I liked Eddie Hearn's honesty by saying Anthony Joshua must win the rematch. Where does he stand if he loses that?"" BBC Sport boxing correspondent Mike Costello:""Anthony Joshua looked vacant in the ring after the fight.""

The tablet computer pulled by donkey,"Mobility via donkey - a simple but effective way of sharing content in remote communities Back in 2016, mobile technology the like of which had not been seen before rolled into the remote community of Funhalouro, in Mozambique. Pulled by donkey, the container consisted of four LCD screens, powered by solar panels. It was a mobile roadshow, starting with music to draw a crowd and then switching to a three-minute film on the biggest of the screens. While the topic - digital literacy - was not the most entertaining, it was engaging for the audience, many of whom had never seen a screen or moving images before. After the film, the audience was invited to use smaller touchscreen tablets to answer a series of questions about what they had seen. There were prizes of T-shirts and caps for those with the highest scores. For those who couldn't read, the questions were posed in diagram form. One important element of the project is to test to see how much people have understood ""When we arrive in a community, we try and make it a party,"" said Dayn Amade, founder of theCommunity Tablet.,external ""We want to attract people and we do it with music."" Sub-Saharan Africa is projected to have 634 million mobile users by 2025, up from 250 million at the end of 2017, according to GSM Association, the trade body for mobile carriers. Adoption of mobile technology has transformed lives, from providing people with a way to bank for the first time to helping farmers improve their crop yield. But some countries fare better than others. While in Kenya mobile penetration is at 91%, in Mozambique less than half of its 31 million population have mobile connections. For some, the tablet is their first ever interaction with a screen The project starts with music to bring the crowds The Community Tablet aims to fill this gap and the entertainment is just the precursor to the real point of the roadshow - to educate and empower remote and rural communities on a range of topics, from public health to mobile banking to why it is important to take part in elections. Mr Amade, who was born in Mozambique, got the idea as he watched his two young sons and saw how addicted to their tablets they were and how quickly they learned how to build things by watching YouTube tutorials. ""I said to myself that this can be used in rural communities where people aren't able to do basic things because they have never had a tutorial,"" he said. Dayn Amade got the idea for a community tablet watching his own kids use their devices There have been plenty of initiatives to increase the use of technology in countries such as Mozambique, often with patchy results. The One Laptop Per Child initiative, for instance, aimed to transform education but failed to deliver on its promises. The challenge in developing start-ups in Africa The airport that welcomes drone flights Jumia first African start-up on NY stock exchange ""The reality of Africa means that experiments like One Laptop per child or other ways of distributing smartphones unfortunately for various reasons do not work out,"" said Mr Amade. ""It's impossible to give a tablet to everybody - it is too expensive and you don't know if they are going to use it or are going to sell it."" Traditionally, educational material is passed on via community theatre or cinema. One blogger in Liberia used to painstakingly write out the news on a blackboard for those in his community without phones or access to newspapers, radio or TV. Sometimes, the simple ideas were the best, said Ken Banks, an innovator in mobile for Africa and head of social impact at digital ID company Yoti. ""Projects like the Community Tablet are a great example of appropriate, almost frugal innovation - focusing on what works rather than what looks good,"" he said. ""We have the ability to solve many development problems with tools available today - but often we're too busy chasing the next shiny innovation."" Mr Amade agrees his is a very simple solution, describing it as ""an adequate way of supplying digital education to people in rural communities"". ""It is safe and robust. It cannot be broken and it cannot be stolen,"" he said. People are tested after shows to see how much they understood and rewarded with prizes such as caps and T-shirts The project makes money from non-government organisations (NGOs), many of which have been trying to reach remote communities via more traditional methods, such as lecturers and handing out pamphlets. ""If people get a pamphlet, they throw it away. And most people don't listen after two or three minutes,"" said Mr Amade. ""NGOs go to these communities to solve specific problems but the problems remain because people have not understood. With our system, people listen, interact and then we test them."" Many of the projects have seen tangible results, according to Mr Amade: after a civic education campaign, voting increased by 45% a family planning campaign saw a 27% increase in contraceptive intake in health centres a financial inclusion campaign resulted in 68% more new bank accounts being opened Mr Amade has been on the road for the past three years, visiting 90 communities in Mozambique's remotest areas. And he has learned lessons along the way, including how to adapt the technology to account for the country's potholed and dusty roads and how to alter content to suit specific communities. One animated video, explaining the importance of hygiene to prevent cholera, horrified one largely Muslim community because it showed someone wiping their bottom with their right hand, the same hand used to eat with. ""I've made mistakes along the way and sometimes content can offend,"" Mr Amade said. Now, all content is shown to anthropologists and psychologists based at Universidade Eduardo Mondlane, a university in Maputo. ""The use of anthropologists is very refreshing and a big part of the story,"" said Mr Banks. ""Anthropology is ideally placed to help us understand local contexts, cultures, economics and geographies - yet many projects fail to engage them."" After viewing films, individuals are encouraged to share what they have learned with the audience The Community Tablet has been granted a UK patent and Mr Amade is now looking to franchise it. He hopes to expand beyond Mozambique and to make inroads into more urban communities. Already, he is experimenting with using the system in schools to offer children careers advice. And for those who did not have the luxury of an education, the tablet could be an incredibly powerful tool, he said. ""The reality of Mozambique is that the quality of education is extremely poor and that is why we remain poor because people are not being empowered properly,"" Mr Amade said. ""By explaining to people and showing them, you can solve many problems, including the poverty we live in.""

Leave EU if deal not right says Trump,"Donald Trump and Nigel Farage during a campaign rally at the Mississippi Coliseum in August 2016 Nigel Farage should be involved in the government's Brexit negotiations and the UK should be prepared to leave the EU with no deal, Donald Trump has said. In a Sunday Times interview,,externalthe US president was critical of government's Brexit negotiations, saying it left the EU ""with all the cards."" The interview comes before his state visit to the UK begins on Monday. On Saturday Mr Trump alsosaid Boris Johnson would be an ""excellent"" Conservative Party leader. Breaking with diplomatic convention, Mr Trump said the leader of the Brexit Party - an arch critic of Prime Minister Theresa May - ""has a lot to offer"" in negotiations with the EU, and should be included. ""Think how well they would do if they did,"" he added. He also said the UK should walk away if it does not get what it wants from EU negotiations. ""If you don't get the deal you want, if you don't get a fair deal, then you walk away."" Meanwhile, the Mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, has marked Mr Trump's visit by calling him ""one of the most egregious examples of a growing global threat"". In an article forthe Observer,external, Mr Khan said: ""The far right is on the rise around the world, threatening our hard-won rights and freedoms and the values that have defined our liberal, democratic societies for more than 70 years."" In April, Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said he was boycotting Mr Trump's state banquet at Buckingham Palace, in protest at the president's""racist and misogynistic rhetoric"". But the US Ambassador to the UK, Woody Johnson, said he believed ""everything is going to go great"" on the trip. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Johnson also talked about potential future trade agreements between the two countries after Brexit. He said the UK would not have to accept US agriculture standards to get a deal - although he said the ""American food supply is as safe as anything in Europe"". And while he called the NHS the ""pride of the country"", he said that in order to strike a deal, ""all things that are traded would be on the table"" - including healthcare. Jeremy Corbyn, Nigel Farage and Boris Johnson Jeremy Corbyn:Asked if he would share US intelligence with a Corbyn government, the US president said: ""I would have to know him, I would have to meet."" Brexit:On paying a Â£39bn ($50bn) divorce bill: ""I wouldn't pay $50bn. That is me. I would not pay - that is a tremendous number."" Nigel Farage:""I got to know him when he liked my campaign and he actually came to a speech and I met him. I think he is a terrific person. Really, a terrific person."" A US-UK trade deal:""One of the advantages of Brexit is the fact that now you can deal with the No 1 country by far."" Boris Johnson as PM:""[He] would do a very good job - he would be excellent. He has been very positive about me and our country."" The US president also reiterated his praise for Boris Johnson - who is willing to leave the EU with no deal. Mr Johnson is one of the candidates inTory leadership contestto replace Prime Minister Theresa May. Sajid Javid, Esther McVeyandDominic Raabhave said the UK should leave the EU on the current planned departure date of 31 October with or without an agreement. ButRory Stewart does not back a no-deal Brexit - and Matt Hancocksays politicians must be honest about the trade-offs involved in getting a deal approved by MPs. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said trying to push througha no-deal Brexit would be committing ""political suicide"",although he agreed the option had to remain on the negotiating table. Gyimah announces Tory leadership bid To compensate for lost trade with the EU, Mr Trump vowed to ""go all out"" to secure a free trade deal between the UK and US within months of Britain leaving the bloc. The first day of Mr Trump's state visit to the UK will include a private lunch with the Queen, tea with the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the state banquet at Buckingham Palace.

The actor behind Hollywood's monsters,"The Spanish actor, 41, has become well-known within the horror industry On first glance, you probably wouldn't recognise Javier Botet. Though not a household name, the Spaniard has a portfolio that many in the movie business would kill for. Over the last few years, the 6ft 6in actor has starred in some of Hollywood's biggest horror and fantasy productions. From It to Mama to Slender Man - with a Game of Thrones cameo along the way - Javier has forged a reputation as one of the best creature actors in the industry. Spending his childhood in a small city north of Madrid, Javier developed a love of science fiction and the supernatural. He grew up drawing monsters and eventually moved to the capital to pursue art. While there, he started getting interested in cinema and producing short films. At one point, he went along to a special effects workshop. Both he and the tutor suggested his frame would be perfect to try out monster make-up on. ""I didn't realise but I was born to perform,"" Javier says. Javier was diagnosed with the genetic condition in childhood ""I have a disease called Marfan syndrome. It makes people skinnier, taller, and very flexible."" ""So I was all my life very flexible, all my life doing weird tricks and things to enjoy with my friends [using] very creepy movement."" His condition means his limbs and fingers are longer than average and are able to move in unusual ways. 'How my horror make-up helped my depression' Using make-up to turn myself invisible The tutor put him forward for roles, and within a couple of months he got a small part in his first Spanish film. This set the ball rolling for exposure. His ""lucky break"" into Hollywood came while advertising his work in a Spanish horror film series, Rec 2, at a 2009 convention in Texas. There, he met Argentine director AndrÃ©s Muschietti promoting a short, called Mama, that he hoped to turn into a full feature. Javier relaxing on-set as the Crooked Man in the Conjuring 2 He told Javier he'd be perfect in the title role - and one year later, with Guillermo del Toro on-board as the film's producer, Javier was officially asked. But when the film came out in 2013, many fans assumed Mama - a female ghost - was created digitally. ""So nobody really knew that 90% of what they saw was totally mine, was physical work,"" he says. In response, the makers decided to upload Javier's movement test, showing him moving eerily, utilising his hyper-flexibility. The clip has been viewed hundreds of thousands of times since. Many directors and producers have credited it for why they hired him. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

He laughs when joking that his ""best work"" was probably the YouTube clip. ""So that was the real point that makes my career grow,"" he says. ""Because a lot of people knew that my work without CGI is almost as good - it doesn't need much more help in digital."" Since, he has starred in massive horror franchises like Insidious, Alien and The Conjuring. He also played parts in The Mummy, The Revenant and made a particularly memorable appearance as a leper in the 2017 remake of Steven King's It. In costume on set as a leper, alongside the cast-member playing Eddie in It Javier (background) is seen in character on the set of Insidious: The Last Key The film became a break-out box office success in 2017 - and later this year he will also star in the sequel with a new adult cast. Most recently, he was seen as a member of the un-dead stalking Arya Stark in an epic episode of Game of Thrones' final series. As a life-long fan of the genre, he describes working on these productions with major Hollywood stars as ""like a gift"". Javier says he never gets scared by what he sees in the mirror. His social media accounts are full of funny behind-the-scenes photographs and videos, often in full costume. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

His mother, in her 60s, has become a horror movie convert. After initially being scared, she now even takes friends along to the cinema to see Javier's films when he is working out of the country. ""In the beginning it was a little harder. She'd say 'I want you to play drama roles and a nice guy',"" Javier says. In Spain, it isn't all horror though - Javier stars in comedies and writes and directs his own work, too. But he still really enjoys his Hollywood horror roles - and always tries to learn new techniques, like dance, to enrich his performances. Transforming into these roles can involve hours and hours in the make-up chair. Some of his character costumes (like Slender Man) restrict his senses One of the people responsible for bringing his characters to life is Spanish make-up artist David MartÃ­ from DDTSFX. He has worked with Javier on several films, including Crimson Peak, which also starred another ""monster"" actor heavyweight in Doug Jones. David won an Oscar for his work on Jones in Pan's Labyrinth. Having also grown up in Spain in the 1980s, David recalls trying to teach himself how to create horror looks, inspired by imported US magazines like Fangoria. It was a lot of trial and error. In one example, he remembers not understanding what ""foam latex"" was and tried to use sofa filling to recreate a look. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

""It was all, you know, research and you know, and a lot of accidents at that beginning because obviously there was no internet, there was no information,"" he says. He describes the final product of creatures and characters as often a collaboration - with some directors more involved in the concept than others. He says the final look can be a development process, with designs often changing throughout production. David has high praise for the actors, including Javier, beneath all the make-up. ""A lot of times they call them creature performers or monster guy - which is not correct, they are actors,"" David says. ""I see people like Doug or Javier and it's like 'What the hell?' You should not wear a mask."" David (right) seen transforming Javier into a red ghost character for Crimson Peak DDTSFX transforming Javier on the set of Mama He says he briefly considered whether he should switch professions to CGI in the 1990s after seeing its pioneering use in productions like Jurassic Park - assuming his job would eventually become redundant. ""But CGI didn't take us out of a job, it's actually giving us more of a job and that's a good thing,"" David says. Often the two skills can complement each other. On Mama and Crimson Peak, digital effects were added to enhance DDTSFX's work. Javier believes that no matter how far technology goes, actors like himself will always have value in the industry. ""When there's something digital, anything can happen. It's like a cartoon - you lose the scare and the fear,"" he says. ""I'd rather 100 times that you feel something is real, you can touch it, it exists and it can happen."" Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

"Finally, 5G is here - but so what?","EE's 5G launch is initially limited to six cities, including Edinburgh, Cardiff, Belfast and London After years of hype - and sometimes confusion - the UK finally has a 5G network. BT's EE subsidiary is the first to launch a service - and if you're feeling wealthy enough and live in the right place, you can sign up. The lowest-priced deal is Â£54 a month plus a one-off Â£170 fee for a compatible handset. But bear in mind that buys you only 10GB of data a month, which you will be likely to chew through fairly quickly if you take advantage of the next-generation technology to download lots of media. For many people, it may make sense to wait - and not just to take advantage of rival offers from Vodafone, which starts its own 5G service in about five weeks. The two operators are launching in select cities only. And even there, the connectivity will be patchy, sometimes offering only outdoor connectivity, sometimes none at all - so customers will probably default to a slower 4G signal much of the time. EE's coverage map of Manchester shows that only some areas - marked dark green - will get a 5G signal Chip-maker Qualcomm has promised the first 5G phones will offer ""all-day battery life"" - but second- and third-generation modems will inevitably be more energy-efficient and thus allow handset-makers to offer either longer life between charges or thinner phones. What's more, many of the innovations that promise to make 5G truly disruptive have yet to arrive. But more on that in a bit. The communications watchdog Ofcom suggests that in time5G could offer speeds of 20Gbps,external. That is fast enough to download an ultra-high definition 4K movie in less time than it takes to read its description. But for now, you should temper your expectations. To start with, the fibre lines EE is using to link each 5G site to its network have a total capacity of only 10Gbps, which must be shared around. EE to launch UK's first 5G service Huawei's Android loss: How it affects you What is 5G and what does it mean to you? The network has suggested that, on average, users will achieve about 150-200Mbps downloads at launch, with lucky individuals hitting about 1Gbps at quiet times. Samsung's S10 5G is the premium handset choice on offer from the networks after they pulled sales of a rival device from Huawei So, wait times for such big files will still be measured in minutes rather than seconds. Even so,this would still be an improvement,externalon the 29.6Mbps that OpenSignal said that EE typically provided via its 4G network. Of course, there's another way to measure speed and that is in terms of latency - the lag between sending a command and getting a response. In time, 5G is supposed to provide latencies of one millisecond or less, compared with the 20-70 milliseconds on offer today. That will make playing videos games powered by a cloud-based service a more responsive experience and will pave the way for new use cases - such as remote-controlled vehicles, surgical robots, and live-streamed virtual reality. To start with, however, things won't be close to that level. EE says to expect latency of about 20 milliseconds at launch, falling to 10 milliseconds within the next decade. No - though that's undoubtedly the short-term hook to attract subscribers. One of the biggest long-term benefits of 5G will be the ability for mobile networks to provide more connections at once. In theory, 5G will be able to simultaneously supportmore than a million devices per sq km (0.4 sq miles),external, a big jump over the 60,000-odd devices that 4G technology maxes out at. But to make this possible, antennas will be needed all over the place - from lamp-posts to bus shelters, in addition to more of the rooftop masts we're already used to. These in turn will support hundreds of thousands of data-capturing sensors that will allow the authorities and businesses to gain deeper insights about behaviour and provide ""smarter"" services. Futurists envisage benefits such as a customer's smart-home automatically ordering the ingredients for meals that have been nutritionally tailored to their activities, while retailers make use of related data to ensure they have the right amount of stock to hand, thus minimising lost sales and goods going to waste. 5G makes it possible to support millions of sensors tracking behaviour, the environment and other devices So, while 4G made it possible to start controlling internet-connected devices from afar, 5G should enable a multitude of machine-to-machine communications, allowing decisions to be made for people rather than by them. Technology analyst Stephanie Hare says: ""5G will make our physical world go from 'dumb' to 'smart'. ""It raises questions about how much choice and agency we will have, as companies and governments will have more information with which to target messages and options to us. ""The risk is that we won't be able to opt out."" A little down the line, expect ""network slicing"" to become a new buzz-phrase. This will allow operators to tailor different 5G contracts to different types of client by carving up their network into a variety of ""virtual"" slices, each of which will be isolated from the others and can be adjusted to guarantee different download speeds, latencies and bandwidth. For example, a cloud gaming service provider might pay more for a contract that guarantees it super-low latencies, while the emergency services and broadcasters could be guaranteed that their 5G-based communications would not be disrupted by lots of people trying to watch YouTube at once. EE suggests it will introduce this functionality in 2023. Mobile networks are also likely to try to use the extra capacity they gain to offer a one-stop service that does away with the need for a separate home broadband connection. Three's boss told BBC News last year that many customers had no need for the kind of speeds a fibre-optic cable delivered but would find 5G superior to what was possible over a copper phone line. ""It's expensive to dig up roads. It takes a lot of time and money,""he said. ""It's much cheaper and quicker to provide that connectivity via a wireless connection."" A shadow hanging over all the networks' 5G plans is a possible ban on the use of Huawei's telecoms equipment because of security concerns. Last month, it lookedlike the UK was about to green light useof the Chinese company's 5G antennas and masts - but Prime Minister's Theresa May's resignation means things are now less clear. Three has said its 5G rollout could be delayed by 18 months if the government bans Huawei's equipment Barring the company's infrastructure would prove a major headache for the operators. EE and Vodafone would have to strip out some of their existing Huawei kit, which does double-duty for both 4G and 5G. Both have indicated that if their engineers had to replace it, that would slow their ability to roll out 5G. Telefonica's O2 hasn't widely deployed Huawei's equipment to date but is engaged in a network-sharing agreement with Vodafone, so would still be affected. And Threehas signalled that it plans,externalto use the Shenzhen-based company's 5G products. All of which means that while the UK is one of the first European countries to launch 5G, it could still end up taking longer to expand it nationwide than many of its continental counterparts. China warns UK against Huawei 5G ban EE to launch UK's first 5G service in May Vodafone to launch 5G UK service in July 'Like Armageddon': Five fires rage in Los Angeles, with whole communities destroyed What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?
