Brazil looks to loosen gun laws,"Practice at a Rio de Janeiro gun club: shares in one manufacturer have recently jumped Brazil's incoming far-right president has said he will seek to issue a decree loosening the country's gun laws. Jair Bolsonaro, who takes over on 1 January, had made the pledge a key part of his presidential campaign. Brazil currently has strict gun ownership laws, requiring any prospective owners to undergo psychological tests. But Mr Bolsonaro has said more guns would allow ""good people"" in Brazil help combat violent crime. In response to Brazil having one of the world's highest murder rates, the Senate passed the Disarmament Statute in 2003. Under the statute, which stands to this day: only strictly defined groups of people, including police and security officials are able to obtain a gun licence anyone using a gun without a licence could face four years in jail proof of residence, employment, technical and psychological capacity are needed to get a licence. In the first year after the statue was introduced, the murder rate in Brazil dropped by 8%. In the same time, about 500,000 guns were seized by police under a buy-back scheme. Since that drop, murder rates have started to climb again. According to the World Bank, Brazil has the eighth highest murder rate in the world, behind countries such as El Salvador and Jamaica. The Brazilian Public Security Forum, which collects and analyses crime data from state and federal government,there were 63,880 homicides in Brazil last year,external(equivalent to 175 a day) - an increase of2.9%on the previous year. A number of factors have been identified, including Brazil's role as a hub in the international cocaine trade, and dwindling police resources. Why are there so many murders in Brazil? Impoverished parts of north-east Brazil in particular has seen a large increase in recent years. Over the past decade the murder rate in Rio Grande do Norte state has soared by more than250%, according to the government-affiliated IPEA research body. Between 2016 and 2017, there was also a significant jump in the number of people killed by police in Brazil -up 20% to 5,144. Security became one of the key themes of the presidential campaign, which Mr Bolsonaro won in October with 55.2% of the vote. This video can not be played Far-right politician Jair Bolsonaro will be Brazil's new president. But who is he? During his campaign, he would often make the case for more people owning guns, adding that gangs had continued to obtain guns despite strict legislation. ""Every honest citizen, man or woman, if they want to have a weapon in their homes - depending on certain criteria - should be able to have one,"" he said. Mr Bolsonaro, a former paratrooper, is an avid supporter of America's National Rifle Association, and the door of his campaign office was emblazoned with the slogan: ""If guns are outlawed, only outlaws will have guns."" Reuters reports that shares in Brazilian gun maker Taurus Armas SA climbed by about 88% year-on-year amid expectation gun rights would be relaxed. In his tweet on Saturday announcing the decree,external, Mr Bolsonaro said those with criminal records would continue to be prevented from owning guns. A poll last August found that 58% of Brazilians believed that restrictions should continue on gun ownership. But any decree Mr Bolsonaro puts before Congress is likely to pass with a majority.

BBC complains to Russia over staff leak,"The BBC has formally complained to Russia's ministry of foreign affairs, after a list of BBC staff working in Russia, including their personal data, was leaked online. The 44 journalists' full names and photographs were published on social media by the For Mother Russia group on 25 December. The list also appeared on Russian sites pikabu.ru and segodnya.ru. Many of the 44 are Russian citizens working for the BBC World Service. Segodnya.ru stated that the Western media had recently published a similar list of Russian journalists, saying, ""to find a list of THEIR journalists who work in Russia and interpret everything as a plot against them has been as easy as pie"". The BBC has published no such list. The site appears to be referring to a publication in the Sunday Times, which carried the names and photographs of eight Sputnik UK staff members. Sputnik, a Kremlin-backed news agency, has an outpost in Edinburgh. Scots outlet for Russian news agency Responding to the Sunday Times report, Russian foreign ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova announced that ""Russian diplomats are working on reciprocal counter-measures"". The leak of journalists' details came less than a week after UK media watchdog Ofcom ruled that Russian news channel RT, formerly known as Russia Today, broke TV impartiality rules in seven programmes afterthe Salisbury nerve agent attacks. Russian news channel RT 'broke TV rules' Russia's media regulator retaliated by announcing it would investigate whether the BBC's operations in Russia complied with Russian law. In its complaint, the BBC stressed it was an independent media organisation with no influence over British government policy or other UK media outlets. Jamie Angus, director of the BBC World Service, said the welfare of the corporation's Moscow staff was its overriding concern. ""We've asked the Russian authorities to investigate this worrying development,"" he said. President Vladimir Putin's press-secretary, Dmitry Peskov, said on Friday that the Kremlin did not necessarily approve of the publication of the list of BBC Moscow reporters, but treated it ""with understanding"". In an interview with the Govorit Moskva (Moscow Calling) radio station, Ms Zakharova said the data was all in the public domain. ""Is it classified? No, not at all. You can find it all on social media,"" she said. However, this does not seem to be the case. The BBC has studied the leak and compared it with the data available on social media. At least part of the information is only possessed by the Russian authorities. The list fully corresponds to the roster of BBC staff officially accredited to work in Russia. That list is not published anywhere. Only the names of the bureau chiefs are openly available. On Friday, Ms Zakharova was asked by the Kommersant newspaper about Russian authorities being implicated in the leak. She replied that it was more likely ""tricks of British hackers"". Russia's ministry of foreign affairs told the BBC it initially deemed the suggestion it had leaked the data ""a misplaced joke due to its obvious absurdity"". It said the website of the Russian Embassy in London had been hacked on 17 December. ""We cannot rule out that hackers could get access to various data, including the information about representatives of the British media in Russia, as Russian embassies are engaged in monitoring publications by foreign journalists, issuing journalistic visas, etc,"" it said. As of 29 December, pikabu.ru had deleted the page with the BBC list. The BBC has screenshots and archived pages of all the relevant publications.

Police 'sorry' for drone arrest distress,"This video can not be played Elaine Kirk and Paul Gait were questioned over the drone disruption but released without charge Sussex Police's chief constable has said he feels ""really sorry"" for the couple who were held for 36 hours over the Gatwick Airport drones chaos. Paul Gait and Elaine Kirk, who were released without charge, said they felt ""violated"" after their home was searched and their identities exposed. Giles York told the BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""convinced the grounds for arrest were well-founded"". Two drones found near the airport have been ruled out of being involved. Mr York defended the decision to hold Mr Gait for an extended period, despite his employer saying he was at work during the drone flights. He added: ""I'm really sorry for what [Mr Gait] has experienced and the feeling of violation around it. ""[But] what might have been worse as an experience for him would have been to be released under investigation still. ""We were able to exhaust all our lines of inquiry on that first instance and were able to release him from police custody saying he was no longer a suspect."" Anti-drone equipment is now being used at Gatwick Airport About 1,000 flights were affected during the chaos between 19 and 21 December when drones were seen near the runway. A suggestion by a senior Sussex police officer that there may have been no drones was later dismissed as a ""miscommunication"". Mr York said police received 115 reports of sightings, including 93 confirmed as coming from ""credible people"", which he later said included a pilot, airport staff and police officers. He admitted police drones launched to investigate could have caused ""some level of confusion"". However, the Sussex force later denied the use of police drones had caused any disruption.

Mr York revealed two drones found by police near the airport had now been ruled out of causing the chaos, which saw flights cancelled or diverted. Despite searches of 26 potential sites, he said: ""I don't think we have found the drone responsible."" However, he said he was ""absolutely certain that there was a drone flying throughout the period that the airport was closed"". Miscommunication blamed for drone confusion Gatwick drones pair 'no longer suspects' Labour calls for inquiry into Gatwick drones He confirmed military technology had been installed following the incidents, ""dramatically"" improving security at the airport, but said he could not rule out future disruption of the same kind. Sussex Police has renewed its appeal for help to find ""the criminal whose activities led to widespread disruption"". Mr York said: ""Public safety remains a priority and what we are dealing with is both unprecedented and challenging. ""There will be information relevant to this inquiry within the community and, with a Â£50,000 reward on offer for information from Gatwick Airport Limited, it is vital that people come forward so we can bring to justice the person responsible for this criminal act.""

Hanover airport closed by car near runway,"Hanover Airport closed to flights for several hours on Saturday after a man drove a car through a fence onto the tarmac. The incident happened at around 15:40 local time (14:40 GMT). Hanover police said officials were able to stop the car, ""overpower"" the driver and take him into custody. Flights in and out were suspended during their investigation, but resumed on Saturday evening after the man's vehicle was declared safe. The incident came just over a week after German police announced they were tightening airport securityover terrorism fears. Police have said there was no indication that Saturday's incident was terror-related, and are reportedly investigating whether the man was under the influence of drugs. The driver, who has not been named, is said to have driven through a perimeter fence onto the apron area of tarmac, where flights typically park and unload. Images from the airport showed a vehicle and security response close to an Aegean Airlines aircraft. Some passengers faced delays The car is reported to have had Polish number plates, but no information about the man's nationality is known. Inbound planes were diverted to nearby locations during the closure. Police said flights resumed just after 20:00 (19:00 GMT) after the vehicle was searched and no danger found. Hanover Airport is located 11km (6 miles) from the city centre. Millions of people fly through it every year, but it is not considered one of Germany's major hubs.

Race row erupts on Cape Town beach,"Activists say that black visitors were asked to leave by a private security firm Protesters have taken to one of Cape Town's most picturesque beaches after private security guards were accused of ordering black visitors to leave. The guards, hired by local residents, allegedly cleared the Clifton 4th beach of tourists last Sunday evening. Demonstrators say black beachgoers were unfairly targeted, but the firm denies closing the beach and says it only acts to protect residents from crime. Beaches and other public areas were segregated during the apartheid era. South Africa's 'toxic' race relations SA man sacked after viral racist rant Why SA's born-free generation is unhappy Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato said that the security firm ""had no authority to ask anyone to leave Clifton beach"". ""We will not allow any private organisations to limit access to our public spaces,"" he said in a statement. Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkongi vowed to ""go hard on the security company"". ""This is a property of the state, property of the people and therefore we don't need security companies here,"" he said. Mayor Plato said that the guards had ""asked people of all races to leave"" and had not targeted black people specifically. Animal rights activists clashed with protesters who sacrificed a sheep on the beach Demonstrators, who converged on the beach on Friday evening, disputed this assertion. ""These private security guards... are actually briefed to not allow black people who appear to look like they are from the townships on to the beach,"" local activist Chumani Maxwele told the News 24 website. Mr Maxwele, who instigated a social media protest under the hashtag #ReclaimClifton, oversaw the slaughter of a sheep in a ritual that protesters said would cleanse the beach of racism. A small number of animal rights activists protested against the act. Alwyn Landman, chief executive of the PPA security firm, whose job he said was to protect residents from criminal activity, denied that the company had closed the beach at all. He told News 24 that police had cleared the area after a crime had been committed. ""It was absolute mayhem and [the police] were really doing a great job to stabilise the situation,"" he said. However, the police said they had not received any reports of criminal activity on the beach on Sunday evening.

Minister defends migrant 'crisis' handling,"Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said the home secretary would be back at his desk on Monday Immigration minister Caroline Nokes has defended the government's handling of the rise in migrants crossing the Channel during a visit to Dover. More than 220 people have attempted the crossing in small boats since November. Ms Nokes said Home Secretary Sajid Javid would cut short a family holiday to deal with the ""major incident"". Dover MP Charlie Elphicke called for more patrol boats and accused the Home Office of letting the ""crisis"" escalate. The Conservative MP said the Home Office was not taking the matter ""seriously enough"". It comes after another 12 people were detained off the coast of Dover in the early hours of Friday morning. Only one of the Border Force's fleet of five cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - is currently operational in the Dover Strait. Ms Nokes said the number of patrol boats was being ""constantly reviewed"", but it was ""feasible that were we to put additional craft they might act as a magnet - encouraging people to make a perilous crossing"". She said the UK was working with France to try to prevent migrants from setting out in the first place, and there was an ""enormous"" ongoing intelligence-led operation to deter people traffickers. ""It is really important to remember that we are dealing with people's lives, people who have taken a terrible, terrible risk, but that we are working with the French to find the most effective route for returns for those who it is appropriate for."" Channel migrants declared major incident Twelve migrants detained off Dover coast The National Crime Agency said that tackling the criminals behind these ""extremely dangerous"" attempted crossings was an ""operational priority"" and significant resources were devoted to them. Chris Hogben, from the NCA, said its work with French colleagues had resulted in dozens of attempted crossings being prevented. He said that over the last three weeks French colleagues have recovered at least 95 migrants including nine children, and arrested seven people caught attempting to facilitate these crossings. He added that he anticipated further arrests in the coming weeks and thought more attempts to reach the UK were likely. Mr Javid has appointed a""gold commander"",externalto take overall charge of the situation and make strategic decisions about the response. He was due to talk to his French counterpart about the situation over the weekend. Mr Elphicke said ""we need a clear strategy to defeat the traffickers"", adding that the French authorities should step up action on their side of the Channel. British fisherman Matt Coaker first saw an overloaded three-man dinghy in September, carrying four adults trying to make it to UK shores. ""They started waving their oars and tying T-shirts on the oars to get our attention,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the dinghy had a lot of water inside and that the migrants ""just looked like they had had enough"", adding: ""They had been drifting about for some time, they had no engine and just a few oars. ""They were desperate for a bit of water, a bit of food and possibly just to get on to dry land."" The fisherman pulled his boat alongside them to check how they were, and one of the men made a jump for it. ""Luckily the customers I had on-board managed to grab him before he went back in the water, because the last thing you want is someone going down underneath the propeller,"" said Mr Coaker. ""They got him over the side and, as they did, the others made a jump and we had all four on-board within minutes."" He has seen a number of dinghies since, including one at night carrying two families with an 18-month-old girl in tow. And while he said it wasn't the norm, it now ""doesn't surprise you if you go out and see a rescue taking place"". Officials on both sides of the Channel have warned of the dangers of crossing what is the world's busiest shipping lane in a small boat. Police have likenedthe journey to trying to ""cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". The 12 detained on Friday were brought to shore and given a medical assessment in Dover before being transferred to immigration officials The latest detention comes after 40 migrants were rescued from the Channel on Christmas Day Many of the migrants are Iranian or Syrian. ABBC South East investigation last monthfound that people smugglers were telling migrants they must enter before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit. British and French authorities have both said the rise in crossings is the result of ""organised criminality"" and ""mafia networks"".

Liverpool thrash Arsenal to extend lead,"Roberto Firmino has scored eight Premier League goals against Arsenal - only Robbie Fowler (nine) has a better record for Liverpool against the Gunners Liverpool extended their lead at the top of the Premier League to an imposing nine points with a devastating attacking dismissal of Arsenal at Anfield - with hat-trick hero Roberto Firmino the inspiration. Arsenal took the lead after only 11 minutes when Ainsley Maitland-Niles slid in at the far post to score from Alex Iwobi's cross - but it was a false dawn for Unai Emery's side. Liverpool, lifted after title rivals Tottenham's home defeat by Wolves earlier, responded with an explosive display that saw them 4-1 up by the interval and on their way to extending their unbeaten league run to 20 games. Firmino took advantage of Arsenal's defensive confusion to quickly equalise then slalom past a posse of defenders to put Liverpool in front after Lucas Torreira lost possession, all in the space of two minutes. Sadio Mane extended Liverpool's lead after 32 minutes when Andrew Robertson's long cross exposed Arsenal after they needlessly conceded a corner. Mohamed Salah then effectively ended the contest from the penalty spot in first-half stoppage time, having been fouled by Sokratis. Liverpool cruised to close out the win in the second half, Firmino completing his hat-trick from the spot after 65 minutes following Sead Kolasinac's push on Dejan Lovren. Manchester City, 10 points adrift, will attempt to close the gap at Southampton on Sunday before they meet Liverpool in a pivotal encounter at the Etihad Stadium on Thursday, 3 January. 'Liverpool have had chances before - this time feels different' 'Crazy for fans not to enjoy lead' - but Klopp deflects title talk 13 touches - and six of them from kick-offs, Aubameyang's difficult day Liverpool v Arsenal as it happened What happened in the Premier League? This video can not be played Liverpool 5-1 Arsenal: Jurgen Klopp delighted to win 'wild' game When Liverpool went behind to Maitland-Niles' 11th minute strike, it was the first time they had trailed at Anfield in the Premier League since Leicester City led here on 30 December last year. If there were any nerves troubling the new Premier League pace-setters, this might have been the moment for them to show - but not a bit of it. Liverpool, admittedly helped by Arsenal and by a huge roar that swept around Anfield, were ahead in five minutes thanks to two Firmino goals and never looked back. Instead of shrinking in the face of a setback, it was simply a case of Arsenal prodding the beast as Liverpool swarmed forward in the style that has become their trademark under Jurgen Klopp to record another statement win in this hugely impressive season. After a period earlier in the campaign when the sparkle of last season was not quite there, Liverpool's stardust is being sprinkled once more, in the main by that potent attacking trident of Firmino, Mane and Salah. And the signs are ominous for the chasing pack, effectively Spurs and Manchester City, who are out to deprive Liverpool of their first title since 1990. They have won 88 points from 37 league games in this calendar year - the highest points ratio in that spell in the club's history at 2.38 points per game. This statistic alone outlines the scale of their performances and means they are now rightly title favourites. Liverpool's greatest test of the season now awaits when they travel to Manchester City - but such is the level of confidence surging through a team that looks more like the complete package with every passing week, it is a challenge they will accept without any degree of concern. This video can not be played Liverpool 5-1 Arsenal: Gunners must learn from defeat - Unai Emery Arsenal, in spells in the first half, posed a genuine threat to Liverpool and even had the brief hope given to them when Maitland-Niles put them ahead early on. The Gunners, however, were let down by defending that threatened to give farce a bad name and they were blown away by half-time. From Torreira's clearance that allowed Firmino to waltz past a statuesque selection of Arsenal defenders as Liverpool went ahead, to keeper Bernd Leno's cheap concession of a corner that eventually ended in Mane's crucial third, Arsenal were complicit in allowing Klopp's side to inflict damage on them. Emery has produced much to admire in the early phases of his succession to Arsene Wenger but Arsenal have stumbled since Southampton ended their 22-match unbeaten run with a 3-2 defeat at St Mary's. The Gunners lost in the Carabao Cup at home to Tottenham and were held to a draw by Brighton before this loss - and it is clear where Emery's problems lie. Arsenal have potency going forward, particularly in the shape of Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang and Alexandre Lacazette - on the bench here - but keeper Leno looks vulnerable and Liverpool's quality and intensity going forward hurt them as they are so defensively flawed against top-class opposition. They were the first visitors to concede four first-half goals since they themselves were the victims of another Liverpool blitz in February 2014. In the final reckoning, this was why this was yet another tale of Arsenal misery at Anfield. Man of the match - Roberto Firmino (Liverpool) Liverpool's Brazilian forward scored a hat-trick from his five shots, with his second a sublime solo goal, and covered more ground than any other player on the pitch (11.92km). Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""It's clear it was a wide game. We were really good and did exactly what we wanted to do. We wanted to press them and cut off their build-up. They pressed us as well so it was wild. But then when you get the ball you need to calm down. ""The response was world-class. We knew in the second half that the game wasn't finished so we wanted to control it. Mo Salah gave the penalty to Bobby and I almost cried because we all know how much Mo wants to score goals. It was really nice. ""Overall 5-1 against Arsenal doesn't happen too often so I'm really happy with the boys. In 2018 I have nothing to moan about."" Arsenal manager Unai Emery:""We need to be serious but continue. The result here is difficult. It was a big test and how the difference is between Liverpool and us, I don't think it is as much as the score. ""Getting into the box against them was hard with their quality and determination. We need to do better work defensively. We are scoring a lot of goals but conceding more than we would want to. ""We are going to play Fulham next and we must recover our mentality in front of our supporters and try to win."" Arsenal versus Liverpool, with 155 goals, is now the highest scoring fixture in Premier League history. Liverpool have accrued 54 points from their opening 20 Premier League games this season; under the system of three points for a win, only Chelsea (55 in 2005-06) and Manchester City (58 in 2017-18) have ever had more at this stage in English top-flight history. Jurgen Klopp's side are now unbeaten in 31 Premier League games at Anfield, their joint-longest ever unbeaten home run in the competition, having also gone 31 without defeat between December 2007 and August 2009. The Reds fell behind in a Premier League game at Anfield for the first time since 30 December, 2017 against Leicester City, 364 days ago. Arsenal conceded four goals in the first half of a Premier League game for the fourth time, with Liverpool responsible for two of those - also in February 2014. Arsenal are now without a win in their last 20 away league games against fellow ""big-six"" opposition, losing 10 of their last 12 such matches. Roberto Firmino has been directly involved in 11 goals in his eight Premier League games against Arsenal for Liverpool, more than he has against any other opponent in the competition. Firmino's hat-trick is the sixth to have been scored in fixtures between Arsenal and Liverpool in the Premier League - the most hat-tricks in a single fixture in Premier League history. He becomes the third Brazilian player to score a Premier League hat-trick. Mohamed Salah has both scored and assisted in the same Premier League game for the 10th time since the start of last season for Liverpool; only Neymar (11) has done so on more occasions in the big-five European leagues in that time. Arsenal host Fulham on New Year's Day (15:00 GMT) while Liverpool travel to Etihad Stadium to face reigning champions Manchester City on Thursday, 3 January (20:00).

Video shows US school shooting 'errors',"This video can not be played CCTV shows gunman before and after incident New footage from this year's deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, shows officials were ""underprepared"" and ""overwhelmed"", local media say. Surveillance footage from inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was revealed on Friday,externalas part of a 10-month investigation by the South Florida Sun Sentinel. The footage shows ""58 minutes of chaos"" on the campus, the Sun Sentinel says. Seventeen people died in the shooting in February, including 14 students. ""A gunman with an AR-15 fired the bullets, but a series of blunders, bad policies, sketchy training and poor leadership helped him succeed,"" the Sun Sentinel says, after it reconstructed events using surveillance footage and official reports. Its investigation comes as a preliminary report into the shooting is set to be delivered to state officials on 1 January. A draft version, from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, was released earlier this month. The local news website uses footage from inside the school to explore, minute-by-minute, the events of 14 February. The shooting, one of the deadliest in US contemporary history, prompted national protests and walkouts by students over school safety. A former student of the school, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged over the attack. Florida school shooting: What happened next? One mother, two gun attacks Why are mass shootings getting more deadly? The Sun Sentinel's timeline shows that despite the suspect entering the school campus with a rifle bag, several members of staff appear to fail to promptly report a Code Red - a measure that could have put school students into lockdown. Six students died on the third floor outside of classrooms Instead the building's fire alarm went off, prompting some students to leave their classrooms, heading towards harm's way, footage shows. Authorities say Nikolas Cruz, a former student of the school, killed 11 on the school's first floor and six more on the school's third floor. Video shows cop lingering outside Four dates that explain the US gun debate The students on the third level died outside classrooms in the corridor and stairwell, officials say. One student, Joaquin Oliver, died outside a toilet that had been locked, apparently due to recurring problems with students vaping inside them. The 407-page draft document collates more than nine months of timelines and testimony,external. Its contents touch on failures like closing school gates, and detail the online activity of the suspect strongly hinting toward his intentions in advance of the attack. Scot Peterson, an armed officer stationed at the school, received heavy criticism, including from the President Donald Trump, for failing to enter the school building and engage the shooter. But both the Sun Sentinel's investigation and the commission have pointed to wider policing failures. Footage from inside the school shows the gunman shooting in corridors Seven officers who arrived on the scene were recommended by the preliminary report for further internal review. ""Since Columbine, officers are taught to rush toward gunshots and neutralize the killer. But the first Broward deputies don't rush in,"" the Sentinel reports, referring to the 1999 Colorado school shooting that left 13 people and two perpetrators dead. The newspaper uses diagrams and body-cam footage to show the police delays outside the building. America's gun culture in 10 charts Does the media have a problem with mass shootings? The draft report also revealed this may have been compounded by confusion involving the rewinding of surveillance footage. Some officials believed that footage being played back was live, meaning their timeline of where the gunman was was distorted. As the Sun Sentinel put it, ""Cruz has already walked to a nearby Walmart and ordered a drink at Subway"" while police believed he was on the building's second floor. Cruz's lawyers have said he will plead guilty if he can avoid the death penalty The newspaper's investigation included newly available footage of the gunman running away from the school after he discarded his weapon, in an attempt to blend in with evacuating students. Andrew Pollack, whose daughter died in the shooting, shared the Sun Sentinel's piece on Twitter - describing the alleged failures it laid out as ""heartbreaking"". He also called for Broward County's Sheriff, Scott Israel, to resign from office. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The sheriff has faced mounting pressure regarding his office's handing of the shooting. Following the draft report,Mr Israel released a document detailing changes implemented already,external- including additional training for its officers. In a statement this week, he asserted the reforms were ""not the end of the process"", insisting it would also implement recommendations from the commission. The commission's panel voted 13-1 in favour of state lawmakers allowing trained teachers to carry firearms in school. The proposal is backed by President Trump, and earlier this month his administration's Federal Commission on School Safety also threw its support behind it. In 14 US states, there are already some teachers that carry guns- but a wider policy remains politically divisive. Some parents of victims and surviving students have spoken out against it in recent days. One of school's students who helped lead national protests in the aftermath,Cameron Kasky, wrote for CNN that he was ""shocked"" by the recommendation,externaland denied it would make him feel safer.

Minister defends migrant 'crisis' handlingCaroline Nokes insists the government is taking control amid a rise in people crossing the Channel.UK,"Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said the home secretary would be back at his desk on Monday Immigration minister Caroline Nokes has defended the government's handling of the rise in migrants crossing the Channel during a visit to Dover. More than 220 people have attempted the crossing in small boats since November. Ms Nokes said Home Secretary Sajid Javid would cut short a family holiday to deal with the ""major incident"". Dover MP Charlie Elphicke called for more patrol boats and accused the Home Office of letting the ""crisis"" escalate. The Conservative MP said the Home Office was not taking the matter ""seriously enough"". It comes after another 12 people were detained off the coast of Dover in the early hours of Friday morning. Only one of the Border Force's fleet of five cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - is currently operational in the Dover Strait. Ms Nokes said the number of patrol boats was being ""constantly reviewed"", but it was ""feasible that were we to put additional craft they might act as a magnet - encouraging people to make a perilous crossing"". She said the UK was working with France to try to prevent migrants from setting out in the first place, and there was an ""enormous"" ongoing intelligence-led operation to deter people traffickers. ""It is really important to remember that we are dealing with people's lives, people who have taken a terrible, terrible risk, but that we are working with the French to find the most effective route for returns for those who it is appropriate for."" Channel migrants declared major incident Twelve migrants detained off Dover coast The National Crime Agency said that tackling the criminals behind these ""extremely dangerous"" attempted crossings was an ""operational priority"" and significant resources were devoted to them. Chris Hogben, from the NCA, said its work with French colleagues had resulted in dozens of attempted crossings being prevented. He said that over the last three weeks French colleagues have recovered at least 95 migrants including nine children, and arrested seven people caught attempting to facilitate these crossings. He added that he anticipated further arrests in the coming weeks and thought more attempts to reach the UK were likely. Mr Javid has appointed a""gold commander"",externalto take overall charge of the situation and make strategic decisions about the response. He was due to talk to his French counterpart about the situation over the weekend. Mr Elphicke said ""we need a clear strategy to defeat the traffickers"", adding that the French authorities should step up action on their side of the Channel. British fisherman Matt Coaker first saw an overloaded three-man dinghy in September, carrying four adults trying to make it to UK shores. ""They started waving their oars and tying T-shirts on the oars to get our attention,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the dinghy had a lot of water inside and that the migrants ""just looked like they had had enough"", adding: ""They had been drifting about for some time, they had no engine and just a few oars. ""They were desperate for a bit of water, a bit of food and possibly just to get on to dry land."" The fisherman pulled his boat alongside them to check how they were, and one of the men made a jump for it. ""Luckily the customers I had on-board managed to grab him before he went back in the water, because the last thing you want is someone going down underneath the propeller,"" said Mr Coaker. ""They got him over the side and, as they did, the others made a jump and we had all four on-board within minutes."" He has seen a number of dinghies since, including one at night carrying two families with an 18-month-old girl in tow. And while he said it wasn't the norm, it now ""doesn't surprise you if you go out and see a rescue taking place"". Officials on both sides of the Channel have warned of the dangers of crossing what is the world's busiest shipping lane in a small boat. Police have likenedthe journey to trying to ""cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". The 12 detained on Friday were brought to shore and given a medical assessment in Dover before being transferred to immigration officials The latest detention comes after 40 migrants were rescued from the Channel on Christmas Day Many of the migrants are Iranian or Syrian. ABBC South East investigation last monthfound that people smugglers were telling migrants they must enter before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit. British and French authorities have both said the rise in crossings is the result of ""organised criminality"" and ""mafia networks"". Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies Syrian refugees: The people who want four things before they go home This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 Responding to the suggestion that bringing rescued migrants to the UK could encourage people to attempt the journey, Steve Valdez-Symonds, from Amnesty International, said that was ""nonsense"".

Video shows US school shooting 'errors'A media investigation using new footage alleges officials were underprepared for the Parkland attack.US & Canada,"This video can not be played CCTV shows gunman before and after incident New footage from this year's deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida, shows officials were ""underprepared"" and ""overwhelmed"", local media say. Surveillance footage from inside Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School was revealed on Friday,externalas part of a 10-month investigation by the South Florida Sun Sentinel. The footage shows ""58 minutes of chaos"" on the campus, the Sun Sentinel says. Seventeen people died in the shooting in February, including 14 students. ""A gunman with an AR-15 fired the bullets, but a series of blunders, bad policies, sketchy training and poor leadership helped him succeed,"" the Sun Sentinel says, after it reconstructed events using surveillance footage and official reports. Its investigation comes as a preliminary report into the shooting is set to be delivered to state officials on 1 January. A draft version, from the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Public Safety Commission, was released earlier this month. The local news website uses footage from inside the school to explore, minute-by-minute, the events of 14 February. The shooting, one of the deadliest in US contemporary history, prompted national protests and walkouts by students over school safety. A former student of the school, Nikolas Cruz, has been charged over the attack. Florida school shooting: What happened next? One mother, two gun attacks Why are mass shootings getting more deadly? The Sun Sentinel's timeline shows that despite the suspect entering the school campus with a rifle bag, several members of staff appear to fail to promptly report a Code Red - a measure that could have put school students into lockdown. Six students died on the third floor outside of classrooms Instead the building's fire alarm went off, prompting some students to leave their classrooms, heading towards harm's way, footage shows. Authorities say Nikolas Cruz, a former student of the school, killed 11 on the school's first floor and six more on the school's third floor. Video shows cop lingering outside Four dates that explain the US gun debate The students on the third level died outside classrooms in the corridor and stairwell, officials say. One student, Joaquin Oliver, died outside a toilet that had been locked, apparently due to recurring problems with students vaping inside them. The 407-page draft document collates more than nine months of timelines and testimony,external. Its contents touch on failures like closing school gates, and detail the online activity of the suspect strongly hinting toward his intentions in advance of the attack. Scot Peterson, an armed officer stationed at the school, received heavy criticism, including from the President Donald Trump, for failing to enter the school building and engage the shooter. But both the Sun Sentinel's investigation and the commission have pointed to wider policing failures. Footage from inside the school shows the gunman shooting in corridors Seven officers who arrived on the scene were recommended by the preliminary report for further internal review. ""Since Columbine, officers are taught to rush toward gunshots and neutralize the killer. But the first Broward deputies don't rush in,"" the Sentinel reports, referring to the 1999 Colorado school shooting that left 13 people and two perpetrators dead. The newspaper uses diagrams and body-cam footage to show the police delays outside the building. America's gun culture in 10 charts Does the media have a problem with mass shootings? The draft report also revealed this may have been compounded by confusion involving the rewinding of surveillance footage. Some officials believed that footage being played back was live, meaning their timeline of where the gunman was was distorted. As the Sun Sentinel put it, ""Cruz has already walked to a nearby Walmart and ordered a drink at Subway"" while police believed he was on the building's second floor. Cruz's lawyers have said he will plead guilty if he can avoid the death penalty The newspaper's investigation included newly available footage of the gunman running away from the school after he discarded his weapon, in an attempt to blend in with evacuating students. Andrew Pollack, whose daughter died in the shooting, shared the Sun Sentinel's piece on Twitter - describing the alleged failures it laid out as ""heartbreaking"". He also called for Broward County's Sheriff, Scott Israel, to resign from office. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The sheriff has faced mounting pressure regarding his office's handing of the shooting. Following the draft report,Mr Israel released a document detailing changes implemented already,external- including additional training for its officers. In a statement this week, he asserted the reforms were ""not the end of the process"", insisting it would also implement recommendations from the commission. The commission's panel voted 13-1 in favour of state lawmakers allowing trained teachers to carry firearms in school. The proposal is backed by President Trump, and earlier this month his administration's Federal Commission on School Safety also threw its support behind it. In 14 US states, there are already some teachers that carry guns- but a wider policy remains politically divisive. Some parents of victims and surviving students have spoken out against it in recent days. One of school's students who helped lead national protests in the aftermath,Cameron Kasky, wrote for CNN that he was ""shocked"" by the recommendation,externaland denied it would make him feel safer.

Two-year-old in US travel-ban row dies,"Ali Hassan at his son's bedside A terminally ill boy in the US whose Yemeni mother fought a high-profile battle to see him has died, the Council on American Islamic Relations says. Two-year-old Abdullah Hassan was born with a brain disease. His mother, Shaima Swileh, who currently lives in Egypt, was barred from visiting her son under the Trump administration's travel ban on people from mainly majority-Muslim countries. She was eventually granted permission to enter the US days before his death. What is the Trump travel ban? Abdullah Hassan died at a children's hospital in Oakland, California, the Council on American Islamic Relations (Cair), said in a statement. ""We are heartbroken.,externalWe had to say goodbye to our baby, the light of our lives,"" his father, Ali Hassan, said. Abdullah and his father are US citizens but Ms Swileh is a citizen of Yemen. The family had moved to Cairo, Egypt, in order to escape civil war in Yemen when Abdullah was eight months old. Abdullah was diagnosed with hypomyelination - a brain disease affecting his ability to breathe. About three months ago, Mr Hassan brought his son to California for treatment. When doctors in Oakland informed him Abdullah's condition was terminal, Ms Swileh applied for a visa to join her husband and son. The family say they received a rejection letter from the state department, citing the US president's travel ban, and then fought for a waiver. Ms Swileh arrived in the US on 19 December. The Trump administration's ban affects nationals from seven countries, five of which are majority Muslim: Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen. The other two are North Korea and Venezuela. The state department said it was a ""very sad case"" and that the US tried to allow legitimate travel while protecting national security. What is the Trump travel ban?

Dramatic collapse of Indonesian volcanoSatellite images indicate Anak Krakatau lost over two-thirds of its height and volume when it erupted.Science & Environment,"Radar satellites are one of the few ways of assessing the volcano currently The scale of the dramatic collapse of the Indonesian volcano that led to last Saturday's devastating tsunami in the Sunda Strait is becoming clear. Researchers have examined satellite images of Anak Krakatau to calculate the amount of rock and ash that sheared off into the sea. They say the volcano has lost more than two-thirds of its height and volume during the past week. Much of this missing mass could have slid into the sea in one movement. It would certainly explain the displacement of water and the generation of waves up to 5m high that then inundated the nearby coastlines of Java and Sumatra. How volcanoes can trigger tsunamis Indonesia tsunami: 'I clung to a bench' Indonesia's disaster agency says more than 400 people are confirmed dead with 20 or so still missing. In excess of 40,000 have been displaced. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Scientists may have a better idea once they have had a chance to visit the volcano and conduct more extensive surveys. But with the eruptions still ongoing and a safety exclusion zone in force - no-one is going near Anak Krakatau. Cone collapse with tsunami generation was considered a potential hazard before last Saturday. Scientists had modelled the possibility six years ago, even identifying the western flank of Anak Krakatau as the section of the volcano most likely to fail.

Veteran Tory Redwood knighted,"Sir John has said the UK will be better-off outside the European Union Veteran Conservative MP John Redwood has been knighted in the New Year Honours List. The former cabinet minister and leading Brexiteer is among a number of MPs to be recognised for their political and public service. Sir John, who has represented the Berkshire town of Wokingham since 1987, is opposed to Theresa May's EU deal. Tory ex-minister Gary Streeter and long-serving Labour MP Alan Campbell have also received knighthoods. Decisions on awards for political and public service are made by a committee independent of government. While senior Conservative and Labour figures sit on the body, and it is chaired by a Conservative peer Lord Sherbourne, it has a majority of members who are not affiliated to any political party. Nevertheless, in past years, the committee has been criticised for approving honours to party donors. Palin, Twiggy and Southgate among honours Veteran Tory Eurosceptic given knighthood The unexpected award of a knighthood last month to the Conservative MP Sir John Hayes prompted speculation that Downing Street would seek to use honours as an incentive to persuade sceptical MPs to back the prime minister's Brexit deal. But the 2018 New Year's List features comparatively few politicians compared with previous years and their positions on the Brexit deal are already well-known. One of the most familiar figures in British politics, Sir John Redwood has played a leading role in Conservative debates over Europe and internal battles over four decades. The 67-year old stood against John Major for the Conservative leadership in 1995, losing by 129 votes. Two years earlier, the prime minister had described the then Welsh Secretary and other Eurosceptics in his cabinet as ""bastards"", in unguarded comments picked up by a microphone. Sir John has been at the heart of Conservative battles over Europe for four decades Sir John, who became a councillor at the age of 21 and headed Margaret Thatcher's policy unit in the 1980s, is one of the leading free-market voices in his party and opponents of the UK's membership of the EU. He has said he will vote against the terms of the UK's exit from the EU even if the controversial Northern Ireland backstop is removed, arguing that Brexit should be regarded as an opportunity not a threat. Writing in his blog on Friday, he said the UK would ""cash in"" if it left without an agreement as it would not have to hand over Â£39bn to the EU and would be able to spend the money instead on public services. Sir Gary Streeter, the MP for South West Devon since 1992, has already made clear that he will vote for the PM's Brexit agreement when it comes before Parliament next month. A committed Christian, he told the Press Association that he hoped his honour came, in part, in recognition of his work over the past decade as chairman of the all-party group on Christians in Parliament and mentoring new MPs after their arrival at Westminster. Sir Alan Campbell has been the Labour MP for Tynemouth since 1997. The former history teacher served as a minister under Gordon Brown and, for the past eight years, has been the party's deputy chief whip. ""My first priority has always been and still is my constituency and that includes issues around the regeneration of seaside and coastal towns,"" he told PA. ""If this award is a recognition of that, then that is great."" Other recipients of awards include Andrew Fender, who served as a Labour member on Greater Manchester Council for 40 years, Gurinder Singh Josan, a member of the West Midlands Police and Crime strategy board and the long-serving Conservative MEP Geoffrey Van Orden. Each has become a CBE.

'I thought it was a tax return',"The headlines will be dominated by celebs like Harry Kane, Geraint Thomas and Phillip Pullman receiving honours from the Queen. But the New Year Honours list also recognises the work of people across the UK who've made big contributions to their communities. From setting up charities to running local magazines, there are plenty of young people being acknowledged for their hard-work this year. Here are some of their stories. Adam Black has been teaching children in Scotland that it's ok to be different Adam Black Adam received the British Empire Medal for services to raising awareness of stammering. He told Radio 1 Newsbeat: ""A letter arrived on my doorstep and it had Cabinet Office written on it, and to be honest I thought it might be something to do with my tax returns or something! ""When I opened it up and read the news I was blown away by it."" Adam has been teaching children in schools around Glasgow that it's ok to be different. He said: ""I meet as many children as I can and get them to embrace their quirks. ""I've found that by embracing my stutter it made me who I am and helped me be the person I want to be."" Adam, who's 29-years-old, hopes his award will help him keep raising awareness of people who stammer. ""I never ever had an idea in my head that perhaps I might get a nomination for a Queen's honour,"" he told Newsbeat. ""But I do think things like this can encourage people to put their best foot forward, and make others stand up and take notice of the work they do."" Stephen Addison Stephen was awarded an MBE (Member of the British Empire) for services to young people in Barking and Dagenham. After losing a friend to gang violence and being involved in gangs himself, Stephen decided to set up a social enterprise called Box Up Crime. Since 2013 his organisation has been teaching non-contact boxing skills in schools, pupil referral units and community centres across London. The 28-year-old has been recognised because he's an example of how drive and ambition can be re-focussed away from crime. Saeed Atcha Twenty-two-year-old Saaed was given an MBE for services to young people and the community in Greater Manchester. Saeed set up his own magazine in 2011 called Xplode, it focuses on social issues and is designed to help young people improve their job prospects. More than 50,000 across Greater Manchester read it and it has more than 100 volunteers putting it together. A registered charity, the magazine is being used to teach journalism and media skills to primary school children. Cairn Newton-Evans set-up an LGBT social and support project and works with the police Cairn Newton-Evans Cairn received a British Empire Medal for services to policing and the LGBT community in Wales. He told Newsbeat: ""I was speechless, absolutely in shock. ""The letter looks really important when it comes through the post, it says 'On Her Majesty's Service'. ""I was a bit apprehensive about opening it to be honest but then I felt so proud to have been recognised for the work I've done."" Needing surgery after a homophobic attack, the 27-year-old felt let down by the police and so decided to set-up an LGBT support group and became a special constable in the town where he was attacked. ""Knowing that people saw me getting attacked and nobody phoned the police or for an ambulance meant I lost confidence in my local community,"" he said. ""The way the attack was dealt with meant I lost confidence in the police service too. ""I had massive anxiety issues, I was scared to leave the house on my own, it had a big impact on my mental health. ""By joining the police I wanted to turn a negative experience into a positive one, and try to make sure no one else went through what I did."" James Alexander Threlfall Twenty-five-year-old James was awarded an MBE for services to young people in Wiltshire. He set up and organises the Wiltshire Skate Series, a local skateboarding competition for the community's benefit. There have been nearly 30 events to date with James sorting out serious commercial sponsors and partners. He's also an ambassador for the mental health charity CALM.

UK to spend ÃÂ£108m on no-deal ferries,"The UK will spend more than Â£100m chartering extra ferries to ease ""severe congestion"" at Dover, in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Over the last few months, additional ferry contracts were awarded to French, Danish and British companies. The contingency plans allow for almost 4,000 more lorries a week to come and go from other ports, including Plymouth, Poole, and Portsmouth. The UK Chamber of Shipping said customs procedures were a bigger problem. Chief executive Bob Sanguinetti said: ""Government is rightly preparing for every eventuality... but it is not clear that government-chartered ships can move goods faster or more efficiently than the private sector."" ""Those goods will still need to go through the same customs procedures in ports - which is where the real problems would be."" The Department for Transport (DfT) said the awards were ""a small but important element"" of its no-deal planning. In documents outlining the agreements, the DfT states that an ""unforeseeable"" situation of ""extreme urgency"" meant there was no time for the contracts to be put out to tender - the standard practice for public procurements. However, the BBC understands that a number of firms were considered and there was a private negotiation process. The department also states that increased border checks by EU countries in the case of a no-deal Brexit could ""cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed"", and ""significant wider disruption to the UK economy and to the road network in Kent"". Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called the move ""complete madness"". ""The government has the power to stop ""no deal"" at any time but instead is spending millions on last minute contracts,"" he said. ""The fact that this money is predominantly going to European companies is nothing short of ironic, reducing Britain to a laughing stock on the global stage."" In a statement, a spokesperson for the DfT said the contracts would provide ""significant extra capacity"" to UK ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but stressed that the government remained committed to reaching a deal with the EU. Three suppliers were awarded a total of Â£102.9m: Â£46.6m to the French company Brittany Ferries Â£42.5m (â¬47.3m) to Danish shipping firm DFDS Â£13.8m to British firm Seaborne Freight All three businesses will expand services on their fleets of ""roll-on/roll-off"" vessels, designed to carry lorries across the Channel. The additional crossings - equivalent to about 10% of existing traffic across the Dover strait - will provide up to half a million tonnes a month in extra capacity. Lorries diverted to other ports may be expected to pay the standard rate for their altered journeys. The contingency plans allow for almost 4,000 more lorries a week to cross at ports including Plymouth, Poole, and Portsmouth. The BBC understands that the three firms chosen will retain a portion of their award even if their services are no longer needed, due to a deal being reached with Brussels. However, in that event, the government would then seek to sell the extra capacity back to the market. Brittany Ferries told the BBC it was contracted to add 19 weekly return sailings to three of its routes: Roscoff to Plymouth, Cherbourg to Poole and Le Havre to Portsmouth - a 50% increase on its current schedule. The other firms are understood to be adding services at Immingham and Felixstowe too. Gus Tugendhat, the founder of data firm Tussell, which brought the contracts to the BBC's attention, criticised their late arrival. ""This provides further evidence of the last-minute rush to implement Brexit no-deal contingency planning,"" he said. ""With time so short, it appears that normal tendering procedures couldn't be followed.""

Dover visit for minister amid migrant row,"Immigration minister Caroline Nokes said the home secretary would be back at his desk on Monday Immigration minister Caroline Nokes has defended the government's handling of the rise in migrants crossing the Channel during a visit to Dover. More than 220 people have attempted the crossing in small boats since November. Ms Nokes said Home Secretary Sajid Javid would cut short a family holiday to deal with the ""major incident"". Dover MP Charlie Elphicke called for more patrol boats and accused the Home Office of letting the ""crisis"" escalate. The Conservative MP said the Home Office was not taking the matter ""seriously enough"". It comes after another 12 people were detained off the coast of Dover in the early hours of Friday morning. Only one of the Border Force's fleet of five cutters -specialist boats,externalwhich the force describes as being capable of rescuing several migrant boats at the same time - is currently operational in the Dover Strait. Ms Nokes said the number of patrol boats was being ""constantly reviewed"", but it was ""feasible that were we to put additional craft they might act as a magnet - encouraging people to make a perilous crossing"". She said the UK was working with France to try to prevent migrants from setting out in the first place, and there was an ""enormous"" ongoing intelligence-led operation to deter people traffickers. ""It is really important to remember that we are dealing with people's lives, people who have taken a terrible, terrible risk, but that we are working with the French to find the most effective route for returns for those who it is appropriate for."" Channel migrants declared major incident Twelve migrants detained off Dover coast The National Crime Agency said that tackling the criminals behind these ""extremely dangerous"" attempted crossings was an ""operational priority"" and significant resources were devoted to them. Chris Hogben, from the NCA, said its work with French colleagues had resulted in dozens of attempted crossings being prevented. He said that over the last three weeks French colleagues have recovered at least 95 migrants including nine children, and arrested seven people caught attempting to facilitate these crossings. He added that he anticipated further arrests in the coming weeks and thought more attempts to reach the UK were likely. Mr Javid has appointed a""gold commander"",externalto take overall charge of the situation and make strategic decisions about the response. He was due to talk to his French counterpart about the situation over the weekend. Mr Elphicke said ""we need a clear strategy to defeat the traffickers"", adding that the French authorities should step up action on their side of the Channel. British fisherman Matt Coaker first saw an overloaded three-man dinghy in September, carrying four adults trying to make it to UK shores. ""They started waving their oars and tying T-shirts on the oars to get our attention,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. He said the dinghy had a lot of water inside and that the migrants ""just looked like they had had enough"", adding: ""They had been drifting about for some time, they had no engine and just a few oars. ""They were desperate for a bit of water, a bit of food and possibly just to get on to dry land."" The fisherman pulled his boat alongside them to check how they were, and one of the men made a jump for it. ""Luckily the customers I had on-board managed to grab him before he went back in the water, because the last thing you want is someone going down underneath the propeller,"" said Mr Coaker. ""They got him over the side and, as they did, the others made a jump and we had all four on-board within minutes."" He has seen a number of dinghies since, including one at night carrying two families with an 18-month-old girl in tow. And while he said it wasn't the norm, it now ""doesn't surprise you if you go out and see a rescue taking place"". Officials on both sides of the Channel have warned of the dangers of crossing what is the world's busiest shipping lane in a small boat. Police have likenedthe journey to trying to ""cross the M25 at rush-hour on foot"". The 12 detained on Friday were brought to shore and given a medical assessment in Dover before being transferred to immigration officials The latest detention comes after 40 migrants were rescued from the Channel on Christmas Day Many of the migrants are Iranian or Syrian. ABBC South East investigation last monthfound that people smugglers were telling migrants they must enter before ""the borders shut properly"" after Brexit. British and French authorities have both said the rise in crossings is the result of ""organised criminality"" and ""mafia networks"". Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies Syrian refugees: The people who want four things before they go home This video can not be played A migrant rescue off the coast of Dover in November 2018 Responding to the suggestion that bringing rescued migrants to the UK could encourage people to attempt the journey, Steve Valdez-Symonds, from Amnesty International, said that was ""nonsense"".

First Briton crosses Antarctica solo,"This video can not be played Capt Rudd: 'It's been pretty brutal at times' An Army officer has become the first Briton in history to trek unaided across Antarctica. Capt Lou Rudd, 49, finished the solo 921-mile (1,482km) journey at 19:21 GMT on Friday after 56 days. He was just two days behind the American explorer Colin O'Brady, who became the first person to complete the feat on Wednesday. Capt Rudd, from Hereford, said it was a ""minor miracle"" both had done it and he was delighted. He said he did the trek in memory of his friend, explorer Henry Worsley, who died in 2016 attempting the trek. Capt Rudd added: ""What matters most to me is that I've completed my expedition and honoured Henry's memory by carrying his family crest across Antarctica. ""I know he would have appreciated that. That's what is really important to me."" Lou Rudd said it was a ""huge relief"" to finish after enduring some ""pretty brutal"" conditions Capt Rudd and Mr O'Brady, 33, both set out from the Ronne Ice Shelf on 3 November after poor weather delayed their start. The trek saw Capt Rudd haul a 140kg (308lb) sled without a rest day and endure gales up to 60mph and temperatures of minus 30C. The father of three documented his ""Spirit of Endurance"" expedition in blog posts where he said things that helped him through included a Winston Churchill audio book, an 1980s music playlist and a ""grazing bag"" including chocolate, nuts, cheese and salami.

UK to spend Â£108m on no-deal ferries,"The UK will spend more than Â£100m chartering extra ferries to ease ""severe congestion"" at Dover, in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Over the last few months, additional ferry contracts were awarded to French, Danish and British companies. The contingency plans allow for almost 4,000 more lorries a week to come and go from other ports, including Plymouth, Poole, and Portsmouth. The UK Chamber of Shipping said customs procedures were a bigger problem. Chief executive Bob Sanguinetti said: ""Government is rightly preparing for every eventuality... but it is not clear that government-chartered ships can move goods faster or more efficiently than the private sector."" ""Those goods will still need to go through the same customs procedures in ports - which is where the real problems would be."" The Department for Transport (DfT) said the awards were ""a small but important element"" of its no-deal planning. In documents outlining the agreements, the DfT states that an ""unforeseeable"" situation of ""extreme urgency"" meant there was no time for the contracts to be put out to tender - the standard practice for public procurements. However, the BBC understands that a number of firms were considered and there was a private negotiation process. The department also states that increased border checks by EU countries in the case of a no-deal Brexit could ""cause delivery of critical goods to be delayed"", and ""significant wider disruption to the UK economy and to the road network in Kent"". Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable called the move ""complete madness"". ""The government has the power to stop ""no deal"" at any time but instead is spending millions on last minute contracts,"" he said. ""The fact that this money is predominantly going to European companies is nothing short of ironic, reducing Britain to a laughing stock on the global stage."" In a statement, a spokesperson for the DfT said the contracts would provide ""significant extra capacity"" to UK ports in the event of a no-deal Brexit, but stressed that the government remained committed to reaching a deal with the EU. Three suppliers were awarded a total of Â£102.9m: Â£46.6m to the French company Brittany Ferries Â£42.5m (â¬47.3m) to Danish shipping firm DFDS Â£13.8m to British firm Seaborne Freight All three businesses will expand services on their fleets of ""roll-on/roll-off"" vessels, designed to carry lorries across the Channel. The additional crossings - equivalent to about 10% of existing traffic across the Dover strait - will provide up to half a million tonnes a month in extra capacity. Lorries diverted to other ports may be expected to pay the standard rate for their altered journeys. The contingency plans allow for almost 4,000 more lorries a week to cross at ports including Plymouth, Poole, and Portsmouth. The BBC understands that the three firms chosen will retain a portion of their award even if their services are no longer needed, due to a deal being reached with Brussels. However, in that event, the government would then seek to sell the extra capacity back to the market. Brittany Ferries told the BBC it was contracted to add 19 weekly return sailings to three of its routes: Roscoff to Plymouth, Cherbourg to Poole and Le Havre to Portsmouth - a 50% increase on its current schedule. The other firms are understood to be adding services at Immingham and Felixstowe too. Gus Tugendhat, the founder of data firm Tussell, which brought the contracts to the BBC's attention, criticised their late arrival.

Race row erupts on Cape Town beachDemonstrators allege black beachgoers were asked to leave the area by private security guards.Africa,"Activists say that black visitors were asked to leave by a private security firm Protesters have taken to one of Cape Town's most picturesque beaches after private security guards were accused of ordering black visitors to leave. The guards, hired by local residents, allegedly cleared the Clifton 4th beach of tourists last Sunday evening. Demonstrators say black beachgoers were unfairly targeted, but the firm denies closing the beach and says it only acts to protect residents from crime. Beaches and other public areas were segregated during the apartheid era. South Africa's 'toxic' race relations SA man sacked after viral racist rant Why SA's born-free generation is unhappy Cape Town Mayor Dan Plato said that the security firm ""had no authority to ask anyone to leave Clifton beach"". ""We will not allow any private organisations to limit access to our public spaces,"" he said in a statement. Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkongi vowed to ""go hard on the security company"". ""This is a property of the state, property of the people and therefore we don't need security companies here,"" he said. Mayor Plato said that the guards had ""asked people of all races to leave"" and had not targeted black people specifically. Animal rights activists clashed with protesters who sacrificed a sheep on the beach Demonstrators, who converged on the beach on Friday evening, disputed this assertion. ""These private security guards... are actually briefed to not allow black people who appear to look like they are from the townships on to the beach,"" local activist Chumani Maxwele told the News 24 website. Mr Maxwele, who instigated a social media protest under the hashtag #ReclaimClifton, oversaw the slaughter of a sheep in a ritual that protesters said would cleanse the beach of racism. A small number of animal rights activists protested against the act. Alwyn Landman, chief executive of the PPA security firm, whose job he said was to protect residents from criminal activity, denied that the company had closed the beach at all. He told News 24 that police had cleared the area after a crime had been committed. ""It was absolute mayhem and [the police] were really doing a great job to stabilise the situation,"" he said. However, the police said they had not received any reports of criminal activity on the beach on Sunday evening.

Egyptian police 'kill 40 militants',"The raids came hours after a tourist bus was hit by a roadside bomb near the Giza pyramids Police in Egypt have killed dozens of militants during security raids on their hideouts, the interior ministry has said. The raids killed ""40 terrorists"" in Giza and North Sinai on Saturday morning, according to a statement from the ministry. It said the militants were planning a series of attacks on tourist sites, churches and military personnel. The raids followed Friday'sroadside bomb attack on a tour bus in Giza. No group has yet said it was behind the blast, which killed three Vietnamese tourists and an Egyptian tour guide, but Islamist militants have targeted tourists in Egypt in the past. What you need to know about Egypt Police killed 30 militants during two early morning raids in Giza, while the remaining 10 were killed in El-Arish, the capital of North Sinai province, the interior ministry said. ""A group of terrorists were planning to carry out a series of aggressive attacks targeting state institutions, particularly economic ones, as well as tourism... and Christian places of worship,"" the ministry statement said. It added that police had seized bomb-making materials, ammunition and a large number of weapons during the raids. Security is already tight in Egypt, with the tourist season at its height and the country's main Christian minority, the Copts, preparing to celebrate Orthodox Christmas on 7 January. The roadside bomb went off at about 18:15 (16:45 GMT) on Maryoutiya Street in Giza's Haram district as the bus carrying 14 Vietnamese tourists was passing, according to official accounts. Four people were killed and eleven others were injured in the incident, which is the first affecting foreign tourists in Egypt in more than a year. Prime Minister Mostafa Madbouly has said the bus deviated from its planned route without alerting security forces, although the driver has denied this. The pyramids of Giza are a major draw Tourism is a mainstay of Egypt's economy. It peaked in 2010, when the country saw more than 14 million visitors, but fell sharply after the turmoil of the Arab Spring the following year. Worse was to come aftermilitants bombed a Russian passenger jet in 2015as it left Sharm el Sheikh, killing 224 people. The following year just 5.3 million tourists visited, according to the World Bank. However, the sector has since recovered and 8.3 million people visited in 2017, the Financial Times reports.

Key vote in nation that powers your mobile phoneFive things to know about the DR Congo and its vital role in the world economy.Africa,"The Democratic Republic of Congo - the world's leading producer of cobalt, used to power mobile phones and electric cars - holds landmark elections in most of the country on Sunday. Three frontrunners have emerged in the race to succeed President Joseph Kabila. Here are five things to know about the country that through its mineral resources plays a vital role in the world economy: Since independence in 1960 violence has always accompanied the transfer of power from one leader to another. Joseph Kasavubu became president following the 1960 election, held a month before independence, and Patrice Lumumba became the prime minister. But Lumumba was later sacked after a power struggle. In 1961, interference by former colonial power Belgium led to him being handed over to rebels who executed him, cut up his body and dissolved it in acid. The power behind the throne in the early years was army chief Mobutu Sese Seko, who became president following a coup in 1965. Mobutu Sese Seko was overthrown in 1997 after 32 years in power After 32 years in power he was ousted by rebels supported by neighbouring countries. His successor, rebel-leader Laurent Kabila, was assassinated by his bodyguard in 2001. His son, Joseph Kabila, replaced him at the age of 29, making him the world's youngest leader at the time. Two years after he was supposed to leave power, Mr Kabila is standing down. Many Congolese hope that Sunday's vote will see a peaceful transfer of power to his successor. The country is central to the boom in electric car sales. Among a wealth of other metals, DR Congo is thought to have more than half of the world's supply of cobalt - an essential ingredient in the batteries that power electric vehicles and mobile phones. In theory, the reserves of cobalt and other minerals like diamonds, copper and gold, should make DR Congo one of the richest countries in Africa, but its people are among the poorest. DR Congo has been exploited for its wealth since the first European explorers arrived in the 15th Century. This video can not be played Why are people in mineral-rich DR Congo among the world's poorest? In the 19th Century, King Leopold II of Belgium ran the country as his own personal colony, forcing people to collect wild rubber for tyres, feeding Europe's hunger for bicycles and, in the next century, cars. Later, copper became a major export for the colonisers. In the post-independence era, Mobutu got rich as the country became poor. Today corruption and mismanagement prevents the wealth being used to lift people out of poverty. DR Congo is about the size of mainland western Europe. Its poor infrastructure makes it very difficult to get around and presents logistical challenges to organising the election. The country's only super-highway is the Congo River, and there are no major roads linking the west to the east. The government has not taken up the offer of logistical help from the United Nations, which has had a peacekeeping force in the country for nearly 20 years. It has been a big challenge to make sure everything is delivered to the 75,000 polling stations in time - and the election commission had to delay the poll by a week Congo - a river journey Large parts of DR Congo are without running water or regular power, and that is a concern when ballots are cast using electronic voting machines. Though electronic voting has been used elsewhere, this is the first time this exact machine will be tried, raising worries that it is untested in an election scenario. The e-voting machine are controversial Each voter will enter the polling booth to make a choice by selecting candidates on a tablet-like device. This choice will then be printed on a ballot paper, and submitted by the voter. It is these paper ballots that will then be counted. The machines will also keep an electronic tally to help verify the results. Opposition parties have questioned whether they will deliver a free and fair election. There are also concerns that given the challenges of the poor infrastructure and the short time the machines have been in the country the system may not be robust enough. As if to underline the problems, weeks before the vote, a fire gutted one of the main electoral commission warehouses, destroying ballot papers and more than two-thirds of the voting machines allocated for the capital, Kinshasa. This led the vote to be delayed for a week. Why do voters mistrust electronic voting? The eastern area of DR Congo has been worst-affected by war over the past two decades. Scores of militant groups operate across the country but the biggest security challenge at the moment is Beni in North Kivu. It not only has the dangerous Ugandan Islamist militia group, the Allied Democratic Forces (ADF), launching attacks on civilians, government forces and the UN, but it is also an active Ebola zone. The electoral commission blamed the insecurity and the Ebola outbreak for the postponement of the vote in two areas of the east. The outbreak of Ebola was confirmed earlier this year and nearly 500 people have been infected so far. The combination of instability and a lack of faith in UN aid workers - because ADF attacks are going on despite the presence of peacekeepers - means the outbreak is particularly hard to tackle. It is the second largest outbreak since the virus was first discovered in 1976 in DR Congo, then known as Zaire. The largest killed more than 11,000 in West Africa between 2013 and 2016 - mostly in Liberia, Guinea and Sierra Leone.

Galapagos fireworks ban to save wildlife,"The study of the local fauna helped the development of Darwin's Theory of Evolution The authorities in the Galapagos islands have banned the sale and use of fireworks in the archipelago to protect its unique fauna. Fireworks that produce light but no sound have been excluded from the ban. Conservationists say that animals suffered from elevated heart rates, trembling and anxiety after pyrotechnic events. Thousands of people visit the islands every year, drawn by its biodiversity and pristine environment. The Galapagos are located about 1,000km (621 miles) off the coast of mainland Ecuador. World's most beautiful places under threat of tourism ""This is a gift to conservation for Ecuador and the world,"" the president of the local council, Lorena Tapia, wrote on Twitter. ""Ecosystems as sensitive as that of the Galapagos Islands are affected [by fireworks], especially its fauna, which is unique,"" she added. The Cumbre is one of many active volcanoes on the 21 islands The authorities also said that fireworks caused many injuries every year, particularly among children. The campaign against fireworks began in 2017. The measure, which takes immediate effect, bans transportation of fireworks to the islands as well as their sale or use. There is increasing pressure on the Ecuadorean government to do more to protect its sensitive ecosystems. Single-use plastics have also been banned on the islands, which have a population of 25,000 people. The indigenous species found on the Galapagos islands, including iguanas and tortoises, played a key role in the development of Charles Darwin's Theory of Evolution.

German IS member 'let child die of thirst'Woman faces war crimes charges for failing to save an enslaved girl chained in scorching sunlight.,"IS captured Mosul in 2014 A female Islamic State group member accused of letting a five-year-old girl die of thirst in scorching sunlight is facing war crimes charges in Germany. The 27-year-old German, identified as Jennifer W, and her husband bought the child as a house ""slave"" in the IS-occupied Iraqi city of Mosul 2015. Her husband chained the girl up outside after she fell ill and Jennifer W did nothing to save her, prosecutors say. She also faces murder and weapons offences charges. If found guilty in the terrorism court in the city of Munich she faces a maximum sentence of life in jail. 'I met my IS captor on a German street' The 'forgotten' people of an unforgettable story From rape survivor in Iraq to Nobel Peace Prize The five-year-old girl was among a group of prisoners-of-war when Jennifer W and her husband bought her. German media say the child may have been a member of the Yazidi minority, many of whom were captured and enslaved by IS as the militant group swept across northern Iraq in 2014. ""After the girl fell ill and wet her mattress, the husband of the accused chained her up outside as punishment and let the child die in agony of thirst in the scorching heat,"" prosecutors said in a statement. ""The accused allowed her husband to do so and did nothing to save the girl."" Jennifer W travelled to Iraq in 2014, where she became a member of IS's self-styled morality police, the allegations against her say. Her role saw her patrol parks in Mosul and another IS-occupied city, Fallujah, armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, a pistol and an explosives vest, prosecutors said. ""Her task was to ensure that women comply with the behavioural and clothing regulations established by the terrorist organisation,"" said the statement. What was life like in Mosul under IS? 'I paid $90,000 to free my family from IS' After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Jennifer W was arrested by Turkish police months after the girl's death after she visited the German embassy in the capital Ankara to renew her identity papers. She was extradited to Germany, where she was initially allowed to return to her home in the state of Lower Saxony because of a lack of evidence against her. German police arrested her in June as she tried to travel to Syria and she has been in custody since then. No date has yet been set for the trial. Mosul was liberated from IS last year after a three-year occupation and the group has now lost almost all the territory it controlled in Iraq and Syria.

Indonesian volcano's lost stature,"Radar satellites are one of the few ways of assessing the volcano currently The scale of the dramatic collapse of the Indonesian volcano that led to last Saturday's devastating tsunami in the Sunda Strait is becoming clear. Researchers have examined satellite images of Anak Krakatau to calculate the amount of rock and ash that sheared off into the sea. They say the volcano has lost more than two-thirds of its height and volume during the past week. Much of this missing mass could have slid into the sea in one movement. It would certainly explain the displacement of water and the generation of waves up to 5m high that then inundated the nearby coastlines of Java and Sumatra. How volcanoes can trigger tsunamis Indonesia tsunami: 'I clung to a bench' Indonesia's disaster agency says more than 400 people are confirmed dead with 20 or so still missing. In excess of 40,000 have been displaced. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Centre of Volcanology and Geological Hazard Mitigation (PVMBG) has been studying pictures from a number of radar satellites, including the European Union's Sentinel-1 constellation and the German TerraSAR-X platform. Radar has the advantage of being able to see the ground day or night, and to be able to pierce cloud. The capability has allowed some initial measurements to be made of Anak Krakatau's lost stature, in particular on its western side. Fears of new tsunami as volcano seethes Endangered Javan rhino at risk from tsunami What was once a volcanic cone standing some 340m high is now just 110m tall, says the PVMBG. In terms of volume, 150-170 million cubic metres of material has gone, leaving only 40-70 million cubic metres still in place. The Japanese Alos-2 radar satellite is also being used to monitor Anak Krakatau Quite how much mass was lost on 22 December itself and how much in the following days is unknown. Scientists may have a better idea once they have had a chance to visit the volcano and conduct more extensive surveys. But with the eruptions still ongoing and a safety exclusion zone in force - no-one is going near Anak Krakatau. Cone collapse with tsunami generation was considered a potential hazard before last Saturday. Scientists had modelled the possibility six years ago, even identifying the western flank of Anak Krakatau as the section of the volcano most likely to fail. The study, although simulating a larger event, predicted wave heights and coastal inundation times that were remarkably similar to what actually happened.

Armed standoff ends after officer singsA police officer in Pennsylvania brings a standoff to a close with his rendition of White Christmas.US & Canada,"The police negotiator sang four verses of the festive classic White Christmas (file image) A successful police negotiator needs some key qualities. Calmness under pressure, a reassuring presence, and a knack for listening to name just a few. But it turns out that a decent singing voice can also come in handy. One Swat team negotiator in the US state of Pennsylvania brought an armed standoff to a close with his version of the festive classic White Christmas. But it is not clear whether the man surrendered due to the perfection or the sheer awfulness of the rendition. The nine-hour standoff began late on Christmas Day when a man in Chester County began behaving erratically and barricaded himself into his home. A worried family member called the police when the man allegedly armed himself with a rifle. But when officers arrived he reportedly opened fire, damaging a number of police vehicles. ""Over a long and cold night, they kept negotiating with the man,"" District Attorney Thomas Hogan wrote in a Facebook post. He said that he arrived on the scene with (Reindeer-shaped) Christmas biscuits to boost the morale of the officers before one negotiator made a sudden breakthrough. New York awe-struck as sky turns blue World's rarest bird gets new home Ill cricket fan is Australia captain for a day After prolonged talks, the man reportedly demanded that a police officer sing him White Christmas. A negotiator then sang four verses of the hit, thought to be the biggest-selling single of all time, before the man surrendered at 06:00 local time and was taken into custody. ""You can't make this stuff up,"" Mr Hogan wrote. ""This being Swat, they ate the cookies, made fun of each other, and went home to their families, quietly satisfied with a job well done.""

"Speeding lie MP 'to stay in Parliament'Fiona Onasanya vows to stay on in the House of Commons, despite facing a possible jail term.","Fiona Onasanya has said she plans to stay on in the House of Commons An MP who lied to police about a speeding offence has said she plans to stay on in the House of Commons, despite facing a possible jail term. Writing in her local newspaper, Fiona Onasanya said constituents should ""rest assured"" she will remain their MP. The Peterborough MP, 35, wasconvicted of perverting the course of justiceat the Old Bailey earlier this month. She has been expelled by Labour, but will only lose her seat in the Commons if she is jailed for more than a year. In the article in thePeterborough Telegraph,external, Ms Onasanya did not mention her conviction for lying to police to avoid a speeding charge. The piece, headlined ""I will continue to fight against injustices"", focused instead on her ""successful year"" in politics. Ms Onasanya wrote: ""It's an honour to be your voice for change over an incredibly consequential period of British politics. ""You can rest assured that I will continue to do so as your representative in the corridors of power."" The paper's editor, Mark Edwards, said it would have been ""wrong"" to deny readers the chance to read what Ms Onasanya had submitted. He said: ""While she is still the MP - and therefore the elected representative - to censor the column would, in my view, be wrong."" Ms Onasanya will be sentenced in January.
