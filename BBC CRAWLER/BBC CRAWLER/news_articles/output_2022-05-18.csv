NY investigates social media role in Buffalo attack,"New York state's top prosecutor has launched an investigation into the role social media companies played in Saturday's mass shooting in Buffalo. The inquiry will look at the extent that social platforms were ""used to stream, promote, or plan the event"", the attorney general's office said. The state's governor has argued tech firms share some blame for the attack. Critics say the companies were too slow to remove the alleged gunman's violent posts. Announcing the investigation on Wednesday, Attorney General Letitia James said: ""The terror attack in Buffalo has once again revealed the depths and danger of the online forums that spread and promote hate."" The suspect, who is white, allegedly posted a manifesto on Google and livestreamed the fatal shooting of 10 people at a supermarket in a predominantly black neighbourhood on Twitch, a company owned by Amazon. ""The fact that an individual can post detailed plans to commit such an act of hate without consequence, and then stream it for the world to see is bone-chilling and unfathomable,"" Ms James said.Â Platforms' Buffalo attack action called inadequate How far-right killers are radicalised online The stream was taken down less than two minutes after the violence began, Twitch said, but was duplicated on other streaming sites despite the removal. Facebook did not remove a link to the copied video for more than 10 hours, by which time it had been shared more than 46,000 times on the platform. A copy uploaded elsewhere was viewed more than three million times before being taken down. Ms James said the investigation would also target online forums 4chan, 8chan, and Discord where the gunman reportedly posted about his plans. The inquiry was ordered by Democratic Governor Kathy Hochul, who also directed the New York State Police to create a unit dedicated to monitoring social media for extremist threats. She is also asking the state legislature to pass tougher gun control measures. Her Republican critics in the state assembly have condemned her for not doing more to prevent mass shootings ahead of the attack. The US Department of Justice is investigating the attack as a hate crime.

ScotRail cuts 700 daily services in driver pay row,"Cuts are also expected to be made to the Saturday and Sunday timetables ScotRail will cut almost 700 services a day from Monday, due to a shortage of drivers in an ongoing pay dispute. Evening trains on many routes across Scotland will terminate hours earlier. It comes just a week after the operator, which was nationalised last month, launched a new timetable. Hundreds of trains have been cancelled since 8 May when many drivers opted not to work overtime. Drivers' union Aslef had balloted members for strike action after rejecting a 2.2% pay offer. The May 2022 timetable had approximately 2,150 weekday services. From next week this will be reduced by a third to 1,456. ScotRail plans to cut third of services - union Train driver shortage causes wave of cancellations Similar cuts are expected to be made to the Saturday and Sunday timetables with details expected to be made public in the coming days. David Simpson, ScotRail service delivery director, said: ""We are very sorry to customers for the disruption of recent days. ""We know what customers want more than anything is certainty and reliability, which is why we are introducing a temporary timetable. ""We want to resolve this dispute with the trade unions and move forward together to provide the safest, greenest, and most reliable railway we can for Scotland."" Mr Simpson said the company remained open to further talks with the unions. He urged customers tocheck their journey times,external. Evening travel has been affected on many routes, with last trains departing hours earlier. Edinburgh to North Berwick currently departs at 23:14. From Monday the last train will be at 19:40. The last train from Glasgow to Stirling is currently 23:51. From Monday it will be at 19:49. ScotRail goes back into public ownership The Aslef union accused the Scottish government of ""industrial vandalism"" over the cuts. Kevin Lindsay, Aslef Scotland organiser, said: ""This is what happens when you have political interference in industrial relations. ""It's time the Scottish government allowed ScotRail and Aslef to negotiate in a fair and open manner. ""These cuts will have a devastating effect on passengers and their confidence in our railway."" ScotRail has been run by a company owned by the Scottish government since 1 April. The previous operator Abellio had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. The Scottish government took over ScotRail from Abellio on 1 April Opposition parties also condemned the service cuts. Scottish Conservative transport spokesman, Graham Simpson, said: ""It is damning, but not surprising, that the first thing the SNP do with the newly nationalised ScotRail is slash almost one third of services. Scottish Labour's transport spokesman, Neil Bibby, said: ""Services are being plunged into chaos, workers are being treated with contempt, and passengers are being left in the lurch. The SNP must take responsibility for fixing this mess."" Scottish Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman, Jill Reilly, said it was an ""ill omen"" for the newly nationalised service. She added: ""Scotland should be encouraging people onto the most environmentally friendly form of mass transportation. You don't do that by making rail travel less convenient for users. The new timetable comes after significant number of drivers declined to make themselves available for overtime or Sunday working  during a pay dispute. The Aslef union rejected a 2.2% pay rise and balloted drivers over strike action. ScotRail had been relying on drivers working extra hours, following delays in training new staff during the Covid pandemic. On Monday, Mick Hogg of the RMT union, described the situation as an ""absolute shambles"". He said he had recommended that the RMT ballot members for action short of a strike, with any action co-ordinated with Aslef. Scotland's transport minister, Jenny Gilruth, described the practice of rest day working as ""outdated"" and said the Scottish government was looking to phase it out. She said the delayed driver training was expected to take a few months. BBC Scotland has approached Transport Scotland for comment.

Sunak warns of tough few months as inflation soars,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned the next few months ""will be tough"" after it was revealed prices are rising at the fastest rate for 40 years. In a speech to businesses, he said the government was ""ready to do more"" to help households facing soaring energy, fuel and food costs. He also said he would cut taxes for businesses to encourage them to invest. It comes as a think tank said the poorest were being hit hardest by steep rises in energy bills. UK inflationjumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, up from 7% in March and the highest level it has reached since 1982. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 9p, then milk inflation is 9%. April's jump in inflation came as millions of people saw an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in energy costs last month. When might the inflation rate come down? UK inflation: 'I'm batch cooking and freezing food' Why are prices rising so quickly? At the annual CBI dinner, the chancellor told businesses the economic situation was ""extremely serious"", with the country facing ""a perfect storm of global supply shocks"", including the impact of the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. ""There is no measure any government could take, no law we could pass, that can make these global forces disappear overnight,"" he said. ""The next few months will be tough. But where we can act, we will."" However, he added that he ""cannot pretend"" it will be easy to cut costs for families. Mr Sunak also called on businesses to boost investment and training in order to grow the economy and help ease the cost of living crunch. ""And as I've said previously, our firm plan is to reduce and reform your taxes to support you to do all three of those things,"" he said. ""That is the path to higher productivity, higher living standards, and a more prosperous and secure future."" The chancellor and business leaders agreed on one thing - the economy is taking a turn for the worse. Mr Sunak conceded things are going to be tough in the months ahead and the CBI president Karan Bilimoria said firms were worried about stalling growth, rampant inflation and high taxes. But while the chancellor said his response to the cost of living crisis would evolve, business leaders said waiting for an autumn Budget would be too late. The chancellor challenged business to do their part by increasing investment levels which were lower than other developed economies. Business leaders at the event felt there were mixed messages from the government. The president of the CBI pointed to the highest tax burden in 70 years with corporation tax and national insurance contributions set to rise further next April. With business and consumer confidence evaporating fast, their message was if you are going to do something, do it now. Around three quarters of the rise in inflation in April came from higher electricity and gas bills, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). A higher energy price cap - which is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers - kicked in last month, meaning homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying Â£1,971 per year on average. Fuel prices have also surged, with the RAC motoring group warning on Wednesday that petrol and diesel prices have hit new records of Â£1.68 and Â£1.81 per litre respectively. The prices of most other goods and services have risen as well, the ONS said, while wages arefailing to keep pace with inflation and falling in real terms. Up until now households of all incomes had faced similar rates of inflation, but the poorest are now being hit hardest by rising prices because they have to spend far more of their household budgets on gas and electricity, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Retail Economics, a research consultancy, said the poorest people were experiencing a drop of Â£59 per month in their discretionary spending budgets compared to this time last year. Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" and the government needed to offer households more support. ""There are desperate stories behind these figures,"" Dame Clare Moriarty, the charity's chief executive, said. ""People washing in their kitchen sinks because they can't afford a hot shower; parents skipping meals to feed their kids; disabled people who can't afford to use vital equipment because of soaring energy bills."" Cheryl Holmes said there was not much more she could do to save money as her bills rose and salary stayed the same Health analyst Cheryl Holmes, a mother-of-two, said she was trying to keep her living costs ""as low as possible"" by spending less on food and clothes, and cancelling TV subscriptions. ""I've already for several years been turning the lights off in each room, setting the heating on a timer, making sure I'm using a full dishwasher and washing machine and I'm running out of ideas. ""It's a battle and it seems like there's not really much more that I can do.""

The rising cost of living is already seeing peoplespending less money and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs.And it is impacting the economy, which shrank in March. The Bank has raised interest rates four times since December to try to cool prices, but MPs have accused it of not doing enough. This week Governor Andrew Bailey defended its response,insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited the Bank's room for manoeuvre.

'There's not much more I can do to save money',"Cheryl Holmes said there was not much more she could do to save money as her bills rose and salary stayed the same Prices in the UK are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years. Higher energy and food bills, partly driven by the war in Ukraine, are pushing the cost of living up. UK inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, up from 7% in March. We asked people across the country how they are coping with the rising costs. Why are prices rising so quickly? When might the inflation rate come down? Energy bills push inflation to 40-year high Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spending Cheryl, 33, lives in a rented house with her husband, nine-year-old son and one-year-old daughter. She said: ""Over the last few months especially since April I've really noticed a massive increase in my bills. ""My salary has remained the same but there's a little bit less because of National Insurance,"" she said. ""My energy bill has increased by Â£52 a month, which is just over Â£600 a year, so I really notice the difference and then on top of that I've got annual increases like car insurance. ""I've cancelled my Disney Plus tv subscription. I'm trying to keep what clothes we are buying and my grocery spend down, across the budget I'm trying to keep my cost of living as low as possible. I don't really feel I can do much more. I've already for several years been turning the lights off in each room, setting the heating on a timer, making sure I'm using a full dishwasher and washing machine and I'm running out of ideas. It's a battle and it seems like there's not really much more that I can do. "" She said her main goal is to save towards buying a house and the cost of living crisis was slowing her down. Mrs Holmes, who works as a health analysist, shares her money saving tips on her Instagram account Frugal Me Free. She is concerned about further rises in energy bills in August when the next price cap is set. ""It can feel a little bit distressing you feel a bit helpless but I'm just trying my best to stay optimistic."" Kira Hayward Kira Hayward, 19, from Hull is a second year student at Salford University and rents with her partner Josh. She also works part time for a production company in Manchester. She gets a student loan and the highest grant and pays rent four times a year. ""I don't expect my parents to help me out, they're not the highest earners in the world and I'd rather be independent,"" she said. She said rising food prices mean her money does not stretch as far. ""My shopping is Â£10 more per week, the bread that I have has gone up about 50p,"" she said. ""I used to shop every week but I do it every 10 days or two weeks now and at the cheaper places and I try and get a big batch of chicken and freeze it all and make sure I split them up and make a batch meal like spaghetti bolognese. It is frustrating that even though I'm putting money aside I'm having to cap what I spend on everything. ""I went on Instagram and YouTube and I saw these physical budget binders. I take the money out of the bank and I budget for things like my shopping. ""If I know I have Â£80 in my personal shopping for the month I know I can't go over that. ""Before my student loan came in in April I had Â£17 in my bank. No savings, no nothing. I felt disappointed in myself. I don't want to get an overdraft. This has definitely taught me you need to budget."" Ms Hayward has tried to sell things online but has noticed, due to the higher cost of postage, she no longer makes any money from doing this compared to what it costs to post. Ev and Mike Mike Gibbons 75 and his wife Ev, 72, are pensioners living in Southampton. They have six daughters between them and while hers live not too far away his are in Newcastle-under-Lyme and Milton Keynes. The rise in petrol prices and energy bills means they've had to reduce how often they see their children and grandchildren. Mrs Gibbons said: ""They only have little houses so we can't stay so we have hotel bills and petrol on top of it is a bit of a killer at the moment so we are budgeting and we are not going so often. Mr Gibbons said their energy bills had gone up by Â£88 a month after their provider PurePlanet went bust and they moved to Shell. He said each 450-500 mile trip to see his family in Newcastle-under-Lyme now cost Â£25 more in petrol. Mrs Gibbons said: ""It's making it more difficult to see our family on a regular basis because you just can't afford it anymore the money's not there. We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to."" Clive Watson, executive chairman of the City Pub Group, said that despite rising costs, he doesn't believe that raising prices for customers is the ""right thing to do at the moment"". Electricity has more than doubled, while food costs have gone up by around 15% and labour costs have risen by 7 - 8% for the pub chain. Mr Watson said the business, which has 45 pubs across the south of England, was ""trying not to put prices up"" and had not shrunk portions to cut costs. While menu changes can reduce costs, for instance by offering more pork dishes as it is cheaper than chicken, Mr Watson explained this was  ""just tinkering at the edges"" and ""doesn't disguise"" the rapid supplier cost increases. ""We are having to take a lot of these costs on the chin which obviously affects the bottom line,"" he said. Mr Watson explained that the government had supported hospitality during the pandemic but that his main concern now was its support for his customers. Food and fuel poverty left unchecked he said, meant that people would not be able to afford to go out and spend their money. ""There is a crisis in consumer confidence and the government has got to address that,"" he said. Energy bills push price rises to 40-year high Why are prices rising in the UK?

Mariupol: 80 days that left a flourishing city in ruinsThe Ukrainian port which has seen some of the most intense fighting is now under Russian control.,"The theatre has often been described as the heart of the city After almost three months of relentless assault, Mariupol has fallen. Ukraine's military says its combat mission in the besieged port is over. More than any other Ukrainian city, Mariupol has come to symbolise the ferocious brutality of Russia's assault and the stubbornness of Ukraine's resistance. On Wednesday 23 February, Ivan Stanislavsky left his camera bag at the office. He was on his way to see the layout of his new book on Mariupol's Soviet-era murals at a colleague's house, and didn't want to lug the gear around. He could always pick it up the next day. But on Thursday, as he stood in the street outside his locked and deserted office, he could hear thunderous sounds rolling in from the east. The city was under fire. As the conflict intensified, and gunfire became audible to the west too, Ivan moved his mattress into the hall. He piled up his large collection of art books - including the Encyclopaedia of Ukrainian Rock Music - against the windows of his flat in the district of Primorsky. ""Let's say it was not a waste of a library,"" says the 36-year-old photographer, who is also a press officer at Ukrainian premier league football club FC Mariupol. Ivan Stanislavsky loved to photograph his city of Mariupol Across town in the neighbourhood of Kalmiusky, businessman Yevhen was also taking precautions. The 47-year-old had told his family to pack so they could escape the city. But when he returned from the office, he found no packing had been done. His family refused to leave. In an apartment in the same block, metallurgists from the nearby steelworks, Nataliia, 43, and Andrii, 41, were already slicing the last two loaves they had been able to buy, leaving them to dry out so they could eat them piece by piece over the weeks ahead. The Illich steel plant dominates this view of Mariupol Volodymyr, a 52-year-old paramedic in Kalmiusky, was also in his kitchen, trying to absorb the news. When reports came in of Russians marching through the village of Chonhar - on a strategic road out of Crimea to the west - he choked. This was a coordinated attack, he realised. The ambulance dispatcher was on the phone. She instructed Volodymyr to ignore routine calls. ""Find the wounded"", he was told. Twenty-two-year-old engineering graduate Mariia thought the first explosion she heard was simply a storm. Then she heard a second. ""We didn't know what to do,"" says Mariia, who like Ivan, lived in Primorsky. ""I didn't have time to think about my future, my plans. I had to think about what I'd eat and drink... [And] what to do with the cats."" It suddenly dawned on her why, in the past few days, soldiers had appeared in the paint shop where she worked, asking to buy blue and yellow tape. They needed it to mark their uniforms. The Mariupol seafront was a beloved destination Four days into the war, with the fighting closing in, Ivan and his wife sought shelter in a basement underneath his local supermarket. It offered good protection, and Ivan found that the muffling of sound dulled his sense of mounting anxiety. Daily life was being stripped down to bare essentials. ""We lived like primitive people,"" he told the BBC from Lviv, where he has now fled. ""We broke trees, made fires, cooked food on fires. I even heard of people eating pigeons."" He watched as order gradually broke down all around him. He kept avivid diary, later published online,external. ""The Stone Age has arrived,"" he says in his 6 March entry. He writes of watching his fellow Ukrainian citizens raiding abandoned shops, making off with everything from computers and freezers to swimsuits and underwear. One evening a drunk woman interrupts a session of evening gossip in the basement. ""Treat yourself,"" she says, as a flashlight revealed a bottle of Californian Merlot, taken from Wines of the World on nearby Italiiska Street. But aware that even medical supplies and cash tills were being taken, Ivan says he felt disgust. ""We are our own worst enemies,"" he writes. But is this, he wonders, how the fittest survive? After a while, each day became a ""combat mission"". Over a few short weeks, Mariupol fell apart. The Russian military laid siege to the city, attacking power and water supplies. A Russian airstrike hit the maternity hospital on 9 March, and a plane bombed its theatre - clearly marked as a civilian shelter - a week later. Ivan was stunned at how quickly it all happened. The theatre after it was bombed ""The whole city, all its infrastructure, supply system, logistics, energy supply were destroyed in a matter of days,"" he says. Sitting underground at night, he sensed people becoming passive. ""You can only wait in the shelter,"" he writes in his diary. ""Some are waiting for spring, some - for the morning to come, some - for the end of the war. And someone is waiting for the bomb to come and kill everyone."" And all this just as Mariupol had seemed destined to turn a corner. Money began to pour in, adding lustre to a city previously associated mainly with heavy industry - and war. ""It was a city aspiring to something,"" Ivan says. It hadn't always been this way. Long before this year's invasion, Mariupol had a ringside seat to Ukraine's simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions that make up the neighbouring area known as Donbas. An activist guards a barricade outside the Mariupol government building seized by pro-Russia activists on 17 April 2014 When fighting first broke out there in 2014, the government briefly lost control of Mariupol after clashes with pro-Russian protesters. In January 2015, a devastating rocket attack by the rebels on the eastern edge of the city killed almost 30 civilians. Even though the war gradually receded, the sound of artillery booming in the distance was part of Mariupol's daily soundscape. But the city moved on. The Ukrainian government briefly made Mariupol the administrative capital of the Donetsk Oblast. People migrated from rebel-held areas and the city started attracting investment. ""It started receiving all of the resources and all of the attention,"" Ivan says. A view of Mariupol along its coast Public buildings were renovated, cafÃ©s opened, and new parks created. In a podcast last October, the city's mayor Vadym Boychenko boasted of creating the best municipal services in the country, opening an IT school, and promoting contemporary art and sports. Plans were afoot, he said, for the largest water park in Ukraine and a version of Disneyland ""which will probably be called Mariland"". In fact, Mariupol was declared Ukraine's ""Big Capital of Culture"" in 2021. But while Mariupol flourished, rebel-held Donetsk mouldered. When the rebels returned to Mariupol, Volodymyr, the paramedic, believed they were driven by revenge to destroy the city. ""'If we live in shit, then you will live in shit as well,'"" Volodymyr says they told him at a checkpoint as he finally escaped the city. ""They just looked at us and envied how we lived."" Volodymyr thinks the Russian-backed separatists were motivated by revenge Yevhen, the businessman, describes life in Mariupol in the past five years as ""a fairytale"". ""The city was being reconstructed,"" he says, ""all roads were renovated, public transport was improved."" His buildings restoration firm was responsible, among other projects, for the reconstruction of Mariupol's iconic water tower in time for the city's 240th birthday. ""This is a city of hard workersâ¦ It was hard for me to explain that my workers should finish at 6pm - they wanted to work longer."" Ivan's photograph of Mariupol's iconic water tower Like many others, weekends would be spent with family in the city's revived parks or on the seafront. ""For me, this is a [key] question - if you want to capture the city, why destroy it? [The Russians] don't need thinking people, they need territory,"" he says. And, he adds, he is now getting calls from the Russians to return to Mariupol to help rebuild it. ""But if Mariupol is occupied by Russia, there will be no future thereâ¦ there will be nothing to live for. To live in unrecognised territory is to bury your children's future."" About 150,000 people remain in the city, from a population of almost half a million. Most of those left there, he says, are also trying to escape. ""I left Mariupol but my soul is there,"" he says, tears in his eyes. Businessman Yevhen is already getting calls from Russians to rebuild Mariupol Nataliia and her husband Andrii worked at the Illich plant, one of two iron and steel works which tower over the city's skyline and loom large in Ivan Stanilavsky's photographs. They spent long days at work, and leisure time was precious. ""The city authorities laid out marble tiles, made piers [so that] it was possible to sit on a bench right in the sea,"" Andrii says. ""It was a wonderful warm city with parks, concerts, fountains,"" his wife says. ""A European city."" Mariupol's industry makes for a dramatic backdrop This recent blossoming was captured by Ivan, but as a photographer with a passion for his city's past, his pet project was documenting Mariupol's remarkable collection of Soviet murals, one of the most extensive in Ukraine. The cultural importance of preserving such remarkable works seems undeniable, but in Mariupol nostalgia for the Soviet Union jostled uneasily with Ukraine's modern, increasingly European identity, Ivan says. ""Politics was already preventing this cultural heritage from being integrated into Ukraine's artistic context,"" he says. A mosaic picturing three strong youths So inevitably, when the war came, culture found itself fought over too. On 28 April, Mariupol's city council denounced the alleged theft by Russia of more than 2,000 exhibits from the city's museums, including ancient icons, a handwritten Torah scroll and more than 200 medals. The director of Mariupol's Local History Museum, Natalia Kapustnikova, later told Russian newspaper Izvestia that she had personally handed over paintings to the Russians by Ivan Aivazovsky and Arkhip Kuindzhi, and claimed that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" had burned 95% of the museum's exhibits. She wasn't the only local official harbouring pro-Russian sentiments. On 9 April, Ukraine's prosecutor general charged a member of Mariupol's city council, Kostyantyn Ivashchenko, with treason after he was declared mayor by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk. Ivashchenko's pro-Russian party had been well supported in the city's last elections, coming second, while President Volodymyr Zelensky's party came a distant fifth place. In a poll conducted just before the elections by the Kyiv-based Centre for Social Indicators, almost half the city's population identified themselves as ""Russian"", though 80% also described themselves as ""Ukrainian"". More tellingly, perhaps, fewer than 20% self-identified as ""European"", while more than 50% said they were ""Soviet"". Mariia says that after the invasion she began to hate all things Russian Nataliia, whose father is Russian, says she asked her husband for forgiveness when the bombing started. ""I was ashamed that I was Russian."" Mariia, the engineer, says that before the war her first language was Russian, but when the bombing began ""I started to hate all things Russian - language, movies, objects"". Mariupol's complex identity is hardly unique in today's Ukraine, a country which formed an integral part of the Soviet Union until the collapse of communism at the end of the 1980s. And it's doubtful that any of those who described themselves as ""Russian"" or ""Soviet"" wanted to see their city destroyed in a violent effort to pull it back into Moscow's orbit. Ironically, when the moment arrived to defend the city from Russian invaders, it was another part of Mariupol's Soviet-era legacy that came to play an almost iconic role. This legacy, buried deep underground, is the maze of bunkers beneath Mariupol's other steel works, Azovstal, built by the Soviet authorities during the Cold War. The 36 bomb shelters provided room for more than 12,000 people. After independence in 1991, no-one thought that much about them. But then the fighting in 2014 began. ""We started thinking about what we would do if fighting spread further into the city,"" Enver Tskitishvili, Azovstal's director general, says. Training on the use of the bunkers and their connecting tunnels went on every day for years. In early February, as the fear of renewed conflict loomed larger, preparations swung into high gear. Food and water were brought in the week before Russia's invasion. Officials at the plant knew the bomb shelters would soon be occupied, but had little idea that Azovstal, surrounded by water on three sides, would become the scene of Mariupol's last stand. An injured Ukrainian serviceman inside the Azovstal iron and steel works factory As the days went by, the war got closer and closer to Ivan Stanislavsky's apartment. Excursions in search of food, even to the nearby Dzerkalnyy store, just 400m up the road, were increasingly perilous. Sometimes, a Ukrainian mortar team would arrive by truck, fire off a few rounds, and leave before the inevitable Russian reply. There was little communication between civilians and soldiers. One day, a tank from the Azov Regiment arrived near Dzerkalnyy, sending locals running, fearful of an impending battle. The regiment emerged in 2014 as a highly effective volunteer militia with far right and, in some cases, neo-Nazi affiliations, before being folded into Ukraine's National Guard. Vladimir Putin has made extensive use of the Azov's controversial origins, in an effort to bolster his argument that he is trying to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities say the regiment's origins are a thing of the past and points out that far-right parties have had very little electoral success. In his diary Ivan describes the members he knows as a motley assortment of Mariupol natives - bikers, lawyers, football hooligans, and an amateur actor -  driven not by ideology, but by a fierce hatred of those who were trying to ruin their lives. ""Together they formed a 'Nazi' battalion and intimidated the entire Russian army,"" he writes. Intimidating and effective, but not enough, eventually, to stem the Russian tide. While the city's defenders fought their losing battle, Ivan heard voices in his basement starting to curse President Zelensky for leaving Mariupol to its own devices. President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and children play in a fountain during his first official visit to Mariupol on 15 June 2019 For all the praise heaped on the city's defenders, it was clear from the start that Mariupol was not the government's main priority. Faced with Russian threats on a number of fronts, the Zelensky government chose to secure the capital, thwarting what was arguably Vladimir Putin's top priority. Ultimately, that meant letting Russian forces achieve another of their pre-war goals: the establishment of a land corridor between Crimea - annexed by Moscow in 2014 - and the separatists in the Donbas. But for those trapped in the city, fighting or just trying to survive, it was a bitter pill. ""Some say Mariupol was given the status of a hero city,"" Ivan wrote in his diary on 13 March. ""It looks like the award will be posthumous."" Ivan's photo of the inside of the water tower By now, Ivan couldn't stand any more. Outside Dzerkalnyy supermarket, he saw corpses neatly stacked under a wall. People who once queued for food were now in ""the queue of the dead"", waiting to be buried. So on 15 March Ivan bundled four family members and his cat into his miraculously unscathed Skoda Fabia and joined a convoy for the tortuous journey north-west to government-held Zaporizhzhia. At an observation point on Markelova St looking towards the port and the beach, Ivan allowed himself a brief moment of reflection. ""In my head I'm saying goodbye to this place,"" he writes in his diary. ""I have a feeling we will never return here."" A day later, Mariia and five relatives also left by car, carrying just personal belongings and the family's dog. As they made their way out of Mariupol, their convoy came under attack and the cars had to accelerate out of danger, headed first to Zaporizhzhia, then to Dnipro. The following day, Nataliia and Andreii left, after a neighbour offered them a space in his car. The couple eventually reached the city of Khmelnytskyi where they have been selling the family's coin collection in order to survive. In that same convoy, Yevhen travelled with his wife and two other relatives. He's now in Dnipro, helping other residents who escaped Mariupol, and trying to reach those who remain. The apartment block where Ivan lived has been destroyed Volodymyr, the paramedic, stayed in Mariupol as long as he could, to look after his elderly mother. But deprived of food and special medicine, she died. He then left the city on 21 April, and is volunteering at a hospital in Dnipro. ""There are thousands and thousands of families like mine,"" he says. ""How many people have died? How many families have been lost?"" Two months after escaping, Ivan is still watching the death throes of Mariupol from the relative safety of Lviv. In his diary's poignant epilogue, he writes of flashbacks, text messages about deaths or lucky escapes, and phone calls that go unanswered. ""The subscriber is out of range.""

Mariupol: 80 days that left a flourishing city in ruins,"The theatre has often been described as the heart of the city After almost three months of relentless assault, Mariupol has fallen. Ukraine's military says its combat mission in the besieged port is over. More than any other Ukrainian city, Mariupol has come to symbolise the ferocious brutality of Russia's assault and the stubbornness of Ukraine's resistance. On Wednesday 23 February, Ivan Stanislavsky left his camera bag at the office. He was on his way to see the layout of his new book on Mariupol's Soviet-era murals at a colleague's house, and didn't want to lug the gear around. He could always pick it up the next day. But on Thursday, as he stood in the street outside his locked and deserted office, he could hear thunderous sounds rolling in from the east. The city was under fire. As the conflict intensified, and gunfire became audible to the west too, Ivan moved his mattress into the hall. He piled up his large collection of art books - including the Encyclopaedia of Ukrainian Rock Music - against the windows of his flat in the district of Primorsky. ""Let's say it was not a waste of a library,"" says the 36-year-old photographer, who is also a press officer at Ukrainian premier league football club FC Mariupol. Ivan Stanislavsky loved to photograph his city of Mariupol Across town in the neighbourhood of Kalmiusky, businessman Yevhen was also taking precautions. The 47-year-old had told his family to pack so they could escape the city. But when he returned from the office, he found no packing had been done. His family refused to leave. In an apartment in the same block, metallurgists from the nearby steelworks, Nataliia, 43, and Andrii, 41, were already slicing the last two loaves they had been able to buy, leaving them to dry out so they could eat them piece by piece over the weeks ahead. The Illich steel plant dominates this view of Mariupol Volodymyr, a 52-year-old paramedic in Kalmiusky, was also in his kitchen, trying to absorb the news.

Two more monkeypox cases take UK total to nine,"Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion Two more people with monkeypox have been identified, taking the total number of cases in the UK to nine. Both live in the South East of England - where most of the cases have been identified - and it is thought they got the infection through spread in the community, rather than travel. Monkeypox is usually linked with travel to West Africa. The UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA) says the virus does not usually spread easily and the risk to people is low. Most of the cases so far are in men who are gay, bisexual or who have sex with men. What is monkeypox? UKHSA says people in these communities should be alert to unusual rashes or lesions on any part of their body, especially their genitalia, and contact a sexual health service if they have concerns. Monkeypox is not normally a sexually-transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. It can also be spread through: touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash All those diagnosed in the UK are in England and most are based in London, andthe city's public health director said plans were in place to stock up on treatmentsin case infections rise further. Prof Kevin Fenton said treatments for monkeypox included vaccines and antiviral agents, and the current strategy was to ""vaccinate the highest priority people"", such as household contacts of those infected. ""We're watching closely to see how this spreads over the next week or two and then we'll get a better sense of how to project and plan for the month ahead,"" he added. Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser at UKHSA, said: ""These latest cases, together with reports of cases in countries across Europe, confirms our initial concerns that there could be spread of monkeypox within our communities. ""UKHSA has quickly identified cases so far and we continue to rapidly investigate the source of these infections and raise awareness among healthcare professionals."" Health officials are contacting anyone who is a close contact of those infected by monkeypox to provide health information and advice. Doctors are being asked to be alert to people coming forward with rashes without any clear diagnosis. Monkeypox signs can include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body including the genitals. The rash changes - it can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab which later falls off. It is usually a mild illness and most people recover within a few weeks.

"John Peel's family selling rare items from archiveThey say the veteran DJ collected a ""wealth of souvenirs"" while launching the careers of many stars.Suffolk","John Peel was the longest serving of the original BBC Radio 1 DJs, broadcasting from 1967 until his death in 2004 Rare items from the late veteran BBC DJ John Peel's collection - including a signed record from John Lennon and Yoko Ono - are to go under the hammer. John Peel was BBC Radio 1's longest-serving original DJ until his sudden death in 2004 at the age of 65, and lived near Stowmarket, Suffolk. His radio shows helped many music careers, including those of David Bowie, Queen and the Sex Pistols. His family said items had been carefully chosen for the14 June sale,external. The music legend would broadcast from his home studio in Suffolk - with his old gramophone one of the treasured pieces for sale Peel's real name was John Ravenscroft and he was born in Heswall, Cheshire and went to Shrewsbury School as a boarder. His widow and children said he had collected a ""wealth of souvenirs"" through his close access to stars and events. ""In going through the accumulation of 40 years of pop music moments, we decided that some of the most interesting items might find a home, with fans of his programme or of the artists whose music he played,"" they said. ""We hope these items find the attention and appreciation that we're sure John/Dad would feel they warranted. ""We had no desire to split up his beloved record collection but have included in the sale a selection of particularly rare or unique records that do not take away from the integrity of his archive."" Peel had amassed thousands of records in his personal home collection, with some items now being auctioned off In the 1980s, the broadcaster was a presenter on Top Of The Pops and regularly covered the Glastonbury Festival, with The John Peel Stage being dedicated to him in 2004. Objects from his collection, including records, personal correspondence and memorabilia, will be auctioned at Bonhams Knightsbridge on 14 June - the week before Glastonbury's 50th anniversary. John Lennon and Yoko Ono signed the inner sleeve of their specially-pressed album One item, with an estimate of between Â£15,000 and Â£20,000, is a mono pressing of Lennon and Ono's 1968 LP Two Virgins, 1968, which famously had them pictured naked on the cover. Other pieces include a signed Rolling Stones 1969 promo LP, estimated to go for Â£6,000-8,000, a Queen LP that comes with a letter from Freddie Mercury, with an estimate of Â£1,000-1,500, and a Joy Division single and letter - estimated at Â£4,000-Â£6,000. Katherine Schofield, of Bonhams, said: ""John Peel had an incredible impact on the new music landscape.

"Mariupol: 80 days that left a flourishing city in ruinsLine-up revealed for Queen's Jubilee concertDiana Ross, Eurovision star Sam Ryder and Queen and Adam Lambert will perform at Buckingham Palace.Entertainment & Arts","The theatre has often been described as the heart of the city After almost three months of relentless assault, Mariupol has fallen. Ukraine's military says its combat mission in the besieged port is over. More than any other Ukrainian city, Mariupol has come to symbolise the ferocious brutality of Russia's assault and the stubbornness of Ukraine's resistance. On Wednesday 23 February, Ivan Stanislavsky left his camera bag at the office. He was on his way to see the layout of his new book on Mariupol's Soviet-era murals at a colleague's house, and didn't want to lug the gear around. He could always pick it up the next day. But on Thursday, as he stood in the street outside his locked and deserted office, he could hear thunderous sounds rolling in from the east. The city was under fire. As the conflict intensified, and gunfire became audible to the west too, Ivan moved his mattress into the hall. He piled up his large collection of art books - including the Encyclopaedia of Ukrainian Rock Music - against the windows of his flat in the district of Primorsky. ""Let's say it was not a waste of a library,"" says the 36-year-old photographer, who is also a press officer at Ukrainian premier league football club FC Mariupol. Ivan Stanislavsky loved to photograph his city of Mariupol Across town in the neighbourhood of Kalmiusky, businessman Yevhen was also taking precautions. The 47-year-old had told his family to pack so they could escape the city. But when he returned from the office, he found no packing had been done. His family refused to leave. In an apartment in the same block, metallurgists from the nearby steelworks, Nataliia, 43, and Andrii, 41, were already slicing the last two loaves they had been able to buy, leaving them to dry out so they could eat them piece by piece over the weeks ahead. The Illich steel plant dominates this view of Mariupol Volodymyr, a 52-year-old paramedic in Kalmiusky, was also in his kitchen, trying to absorb the news. When reports came in of Russians marching through the village of Chonhar - on a strategic road out of Crimea to the west - he choked. This was a coordinated attack, he realised. The ambulance dispatcher was on the phone. She instructed Volodymyr to ignore routine calls. ""Find the wounded"", he was told. Twenty-two-year-old engineering graduate Mariia thought the first explosion she heard was simply a storm. Then she heard a second. ""We didn't know what to do,"" says Mariia, who like Ivan, lived in Primorsky. ""I didn't have time to think about my future, my plans. I had to think about what I'd eat and drink... [And] what to do with the cats."" It suddenly dawned on her why, in the past few days, soldiers had appeared in the paint shop where she worked, asking to buy blue and yellow tape. They needed it to mark their uniforms. The Mariupol seafront was a beloved destination Four days into the war, with the fighting closing in, Ivan and his wife sought shelter in a basement underneath his local supermarket. It offered good protection, and Ivan found that the muffling of sound dulled his sense of mounting anxiety. Daily life was being stripped down to bare essentials. ""We lived like primitive people,"" he told the BBC from Lviv, where he has now fled. ""We broke trees, made fires, cooked food on fires. I even heard of people eating pigeons."" He watched as order gradually broke down all around him. He kept avivid diary, later published online,external. ""The Stone Age has arrived,"" he says in his 6 March entry. He writes of watching his fellow Ukrainian citizens raiding abandoned shops, making off with everything from computers and freezers to swimsuits and underwear. One evening a drunk woman interrupts a session of evening gossip in the basement. ""Treat yourself,"" she says, as a flashlight revealed a bottle of Californian Merlot, taken from Wines of the World on nearby Italiiska Street. But aware that even medical supplies and cash tills were being taken, Ivan says he felt disgust. ""We are our own worst enemies,"" he writes. But is this, he wonders, how the fittest survive? After a while, each day became a ""combat mission"". Over a few short weeks, Mariupol fell apart. The Russian military laid siege to the city, attacking power and water supplies. A Russian airstrike hit the maternity hospital on 9 March, and a plane bombed its theatre - clearly marked as a civilian shelter - a week later. Ivan was stunned at how quickly it all happened. The theatre after it was bombed ""The whole city, all its infrastructure, supply system, logistics, energy supply were destroyed in a matter of days,"" he says. Sitting underground at night, he sensed people becoming passive. ""You can only wait in the shelter,"" he writes in his diary. ""Some are waiting for spring, some - for the morning to come, some - for the end of the war. And someone is waiting for the bomb to come and kill everyone."" And all this just as Mariupol had seemed destined to turn a corner. Money began to pour in, adding lustre to a city previously associated mainly with heavy industry - and war. ""It was a city aspiring to something,"" Ivan says. It hadn't always been this way. Long before this year's invasion, Mariupol had a ringside seat to Ukraine's simmering conflict with Russian-backed separatists in Donetsk and Luhansk, the two regions that make up the neighbouring area known as Donbas. An activist guards a barricade outside the Mariupol government building seized by pro-Russia activists on 17 April 2014 When fighting first broke out there in 2014, the government briefly lost control of Mariupol after clashes with pro-Russian protesters. In January 2015, a devastating rocket attack by the rebels on the eastern edge of the city killed almost 30 civilians. Even though the war gradually receded, the sound of artillery booming in the distance was part of Mariupol's daily soundscape. But the city moved on. The Ukrainian government briefly made Mariupol the administrative capital of the Donetsk Oblast. People migrated from rebel-held areas and the city started attracting investment. ""It started receiving all of the resources and all of the attention,"" Ivan says. A view of Mariupol along its coast Public buildings were renovated, cafÃ©s opened, and new parks created. In a podcast last October, the city's mayor Vadym Boychenko boasted of creating the best municipal services in the country, opening an IT school, and promoting contemporary art and sports. Plans were afoot, he said, for the largest water park in Ukraine and a version of Disneyland ""which will probably be called Mariland"". In fact, Mariupol was declared Ukraine's ""Big Capital of Culture"" in 2021. But while Mariupol flourished, rebel-held Donetsk mouldered. When the rebels returned to Mariupol, Volodymyr, the paramedic, believed they were driven by revenge to destroy the city. ""'If we live in shit, then you will live in shit as well,'"" Volodymyr says they told him at a checkpoint as he finally escaped the city. ""They just looked at us and envied how we lived."" Volodymyr thinks the Russian-backed separatists were motivated by revenge Yevhen, the businessman, describes life in Mariupol in the past five years as ""a fairytale"". ""The city was being reconstructed,"" he says, ""all roads were renovated, public transport was improved."" His buildings restoration firm was responsible, among other projects, for the reconstruction of Mariupol's iconic water tower in time for the city's 240th birthday. ""This is a city of hard workersâ¦ It was hard for me to explain that my workers should finish at 6pm - they wanted to work longer."" Ivan's photograph of Mariupol's iconic water tower Like many others, weekends would be spent with family in the city's revived parks or on the seafront. ""For me, this is a [key] question - if you want to capture the city, why destroy it? [The Russians] don't need thinking people, they need territory,"" he says. And, he adds, he is now getting calls from the Russians to return to Mariupol to help rebuild it. ""But if Mariupol is occupied by Russia, there will be no future thereâ¦ there will be nothing to live for. To live in unrecognised territory is to bury your children's future."" About 150,000 people remain in the city, from a population of almost half a million. Most of those left there, he says, are also trying to escape. ""I left Mariupol but my soul is there,"" he says, tears in his eyes. Businessman Yevhen is already getting calls from Russians to rebuild Mariupol Nataliia and her husband Andrii worked at the Illich plant, one of two iron and steel works which tower over the city's skyline and loom large in Ivan Stanilavsky's photographs. They spent long days at work, and leisure time was precious. ""The city authorities laid out marble tiles, made piers [so that] it was possible to sit on a bench right in the sea,"" Andrii says. ""It was a wonderful warm city with parks, concerts, fountains,"" his wife says. ""A European city."" Mariupol's industry makes for a dramatic backdrop This recent blossoming was captured by Ivan, but as a photographer with a passion for his city's past, his pet project was documenting Mariupol's remarkable collection of Soviet murals, one of the most extensive in Ukraine. The cultural importance of preserving such remarkable works seems undeniable, but in Mariupol nostalgia for the Soviet Union jostled uneasily with Ukraine's modern, increasingly European identity, Ivan says. ""Politics was already preventing this cultural heritage from being integrated into Ukraine's artistic context,"" he says. A mosaic picturing three strong youths So inevitably, when the war came, culture found itself fought over too. On 28 April, Mariupol's city council denounced the alleged theft by Russia of more than 2,000 exhibits from the city's museums, including ancient icons, a handwritten Torah scroll and more than 200 medals. The director of Mariupol's Local History Museum, Natalia Kapustnikova, later told Russian newspaper Izvestia that she had personally handed over paintings to the Russians by Ivan Aivazovsky and Arkhip Kuindzhi, and claimed that Ukrainian ""nationalists"" had burned 95% of the museum's exhibits. She wasn't the only local official harbouring pro-Russian sentiments. On 9 April, Ukraine's prosecutor general charged a member of Mariupol's city council, Kostyantyn Ivashchenko, with treason after he was declared mayor by pro-Russian separatists in Donetsk. Ivashchenko's pro-Russian party had been well supported in the city's last elections, coming second, while President Volodymyr Zelensky's party came a distant fifth place. In a poll conducted just before the elections by the Kyiv-based Centre for Social Indicators, almost half the city's population identified themselves as ""Russian"", though 80% also described themselves as ""Ukrainian"". More tellingly, perhaps, fewer than 20% self-identified as ""European"", while more than 50% said they were ""Soviet"". Mariia says that after the invasion she began to hate all things Russian Nataliia, whose father is Russian, says she asked her husband for forgiveness when the bombing started. ""I was ashamed that I was Russian."" Mariia, the engineer, says that before the war her first language was Russian, but when the bombing began ""I started to hate all things Russian - language, movies, objects"". Mariupol's complex identity is hardly unique in today's Ukraine, a country which formed an integral part of the Soviet Union until the collapse of communism at the end of the 1980s. And it's doubtful that any of those who described themselves as ""Russian"" or ""Soviet"" wanted to see their city destroyed in a violent effort to pull it back into Moscow's orbit. Ironically, when the moment arrived to defend the city from Russian invaders, it was another part of Mariupol's Soviet-era legacy that came to play an almost iconic role. This legacy, buried deep underground, is the maze of bunkers beneath Mariupol's other steel works, Azovstal, built by the Soviet authorities during the Cold War. The 36 bomb shelters provided room for more than 12,000 people. After independence in 1991, no-one thought that much about them. But then the fighting in 2014 began. ""We started thinking about what we would do if fighting spread further into the city,"" Enver Tskitishvili, Azovstal's director general, says. Training on the use of the bunkers and their connecting tunnels went on every day for years. In early February, as the fear of renewed conflict loomed larger, preparations swung into high gear. Food and water were brought in the week before Russia's invasion. Officials at the plant knew the bomb shelters would soon be occupied, but had little idea that Azovstal, surrounded by water on three sides, would become the scene of Mariupol's last stand. An injured Ukrainian serviceman inside the Azovstal iron and steel works factory As the days went by, the war got closer and closer to Ivan Stanislavsky's apartment. Excursions in search of food, even to the nearby Dzerkalnyy store, just 400m up the road, were increasingly perilous. Sometimes, a Ukrainian mortar team would arrive by truck, fire off a few rounds, and leave before the inevitable Russian reply. There was little communication between civilians and soldiers. One day, a tank from the Azov Regiment arrived near Dzerkalnyy, sending locals running, fearful of an impending battle. The regiment emerged in 2014 as a highly effective volunteer militia with far right and, in some cases, neo-Nazi affiliations, before being folded into Ukraine's National Guard. Vladimir Putin has made extensive use of the Azov's controversial origins, in an effort to bolster his argument that he is trying to ""de-Nazify"" Ukraine. Ukrainian authorities say the regiment's origins are a thing of the past and points out that far-right parties have had very little electoral success. In his diary Ivan describes the members he knows as a motley assortment of Mariupol natives - bikers, lawyers, football hooligans, and an amateur actor -  driven not by ideology, but by a fierce hatred of those who were trying to ruin their lives. ""Together they formed a 'Nazi' battalion and intimidated the entire Russian army,"" he writes. Intimidating and effective, but not enough, eventually, to stem the Russian tide. While the city's defenders fought their losing battle, Ivan heard voices in his basement starting to curse President Zelensky for leaving Mariupol to its own devices. President Volodymyr Zelensky (L) and children play in a fountain during his first official visit to Mariupol on 15 June 2019 For all the praise heaped on the city's defenders, it was clear from the start that Mariupol was not the government's main priority. Faced with Russian threats on a number of fronts, the Zelensky government chose to secure the capital, thwarting what was arguably Vladimir Putin's top priority. Ultimately, that meant letting Russian forces achieve another of their pre-war goals: the establishment of a land corridor between Crimea - annexed by Moscow in 2014 - and the separatists in the Donbas. But for those trapped in the city, fighting or just trying to survive, it was a bitter pill. ""Some say Mariupol was given the status of a hero city,"" Ivan wrote in his diary on 13 March. ""It looks like the award will be posthumous."" Ivan's photo of the inside of the water tower By now, Ivan couldn't stand any more. Outside Dzerkalnyy supermarket, he saw corpses neatly stacked under a wall. People who once queued for food were now in ""the queue of the dead"", waiting to be buried. So on 15 March Ivan bundled four family members and his cat into his miraculously unscathed Skoda Fabia and joined a convoy for the tortuous journey north-west to government-held Zaporizhzhia. At an observation point on Markelova St looking towards the port and the beach, Ivan allowed himself a brief moment of reflection. ""In my head I'm saying goodbye to this place,"" he writes in his diary. ""I have a feeling we will never return here."" A day later, Mariia and five relatives also left by car, carrying just personal belongings and the family's dog. As they made their way out of Mariupol, their convoy came under attack and the cars had to accelerate out of danger, headed first to Zaporizhzhia, then to Dnipro. The following day, Nataliia and Andreii left, after a neighbour offered them a space in his car. The couple eventually reached the city of Khmelnytskyi where they have been selling the family's coin collection in order to survive. In that same convoy, Yevhen travelled with his wife and two other relatives. He's now in Dnipro, helping other residents who escaped Mariupol, and trying to reach those who remain. The apartment block where Ivan lived has been destroyed Volodymyr, the paramedic, stayed in Mariupol as long as he could, to look after his elderly mother. But deprived of food and special medicine, she died. He then left the city on 21 April, and is volunteering at a hospital in Dnipro. ""There are thousands and thousands of families like mine,"" he says. ""How many people have died? How many families have been lost?"" Two months after escaping, Ivan is still watching the death throes of Mariupol from the relative safety of Lviv. In his diary's poignant epilogue, he writes of flashbacks, text messages about deaths or lucky escapes, and phone calls that go unanswered. ""The subscriber is out of range.""

"Windfall tax U-turn inevitable, says Starmer","This video can not be played The Labour leader wants to know if Boris Johnson backs his party's plan for a one-off tax on oil and gas companies. Boris Johnson has been urged by Labour to stop dithering and impose a one-off windfall tax on energy giants' profits to tackle the cost of living crisis. Sir Keir Starmer said that every day the PM delays his ""inevitable U-turn"" he was ""choosing to let people struggle when they don't need to"". The PM accused the Labour leader of having a ""lust to raise taxes"". But he did not rule out a windfall tax, telling MPs he would ""look at all sensible measures"" to help families. The pair clashed at Prime Minister's Questions as UK inflation rose to 9%, the highest rate for 40 years, on the back of soaring energy bills. Energy bills push price rises to 40-year high How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Chancellor hints again at windfall tax u-turn Chancellor Rishi Sunak has repeatedly hinted at the introduction of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas firms, who have seen a sharp rise in profits since Russia invaded Ukraine. But there have been mixed signals from other members of the cabinet over the policy, which is backed by Labour, the SNP and Liberal Democrats. Among Tory MPs, Conservative chair of the Treasury Committee Mel Stride has said that although he would normally oppose it, the current ""extraordinary circumstances"" meant there was a case for looking at ""a one-off windfall tax"". At PMQs, Sir Keir said ""a one-off tax on huge oil and tax profits would raise billions of pounds, cutting energy bills across the country"". He accused Mr Johnson of doing the ""hokey-cokey"", ruling it out one minute and backing it the next, adding: ""Whilst he dithers British households are slapped with an extra Â£53m on their energy bills every single day. This video can not be played Ian Blackford calls for Rishi Sunak to be sacked if he does not deliver an emergency budget ""Meanwhile, every single day North Sea oil and gas giants rake in Â£32m in unexpected profits. ""Doesn't he see that every single day he delays his inevitable U-turn - he's going to do it - he's choosing to let people struggle when they don't need to."" During the leaders' exchanges, one Labour frontbencher even taunted Boris Johnson, spelling out the letter 'U' with their finger, our political correspondent David Wallace Lockhart reports. Mr Johnson said: ""We're already helping people with the cost of living in any way that we can."" He added: ""In July, we will have the biggest tax cut for 10 years, Â£330 cut on average for 30 million people who are paying National Insurance contributions and the reason we can do that is because we have a strong and robust economy. ""I'm going to look at all measures in future to support, of course I am, but the only reason we can do that, the only reason our companies are in such robust health is because of the decisions that this government has taken."" But he also stressed that the Conservatives were ""not in principle in favour of higher taxation"", in contrast to what he said was Labour's ""lust to raise taxes"". ""We don't relish it, we don't want to do it, of course we don't want to do it, we believe in jobs and we believe in investment and we believe in growth,"" he added. Ministers are still weighing up the idea of a windfall tax on energy companies. The idea is a one-off levy on extra profits, which could be used to help people struggling with energy bills. The Conservative party has been debating the merits. And we know that because ministers and MPs have been doing it in public. The businesses secretary told the BBC on Sunday that they're a bad idea, the prime minister agrees in principle but isn't taking it off the table, the chancellor won't rule it out and appears to be coming around to the idea, while a few Tory MPs have broken rank to back one. Labour is absolutely convinced the government will agree in the next few weeks. A considerable number of Conservative backbenchers now believe the same - and were less than happy at having to vote against the proposal in Parliament on Tuesday evening. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said that if Chancellor Rishi Sunak does not deliver an emergency budget to address the cost of living crisis, the prime minister should sack him. ""For weeks the prime minister has been briefing that it is the Treasury who are to blame for blocking financial support for struggling families. ""Well, prime minister, it's time to stop sniping from the side lines. If this chancellor won't deliver an emergency budget, it's time for the prime minister to sack the Treasury, to sack the chancellor, and to put somebody else in office that will act."" MPs clashed over economic growth after PMQs, on the final day of debate on the Queen's Speech. A Labour amendment calling for an emergency budget to tackle the cost of living crisis was defeated by 312 votes to 229. A Lib Dem amendment calling for VAT to be reduced from 20% to 17.5% was also rejected.

"Girls see physics as for white men only, MPs told","MPs are trying to tackle the low uptake of physics and maths A-levels by young women Girls do not take physics at A-level because they think the subject is only for white boys, MPs have been told. No mention of female scientists in the national curriculum contributes to ""the message society gives"" to discourage girls from picking physics, leading physicist Prof Dame Athene Donald said. ""If you are black or if you are a woman, you don't see yourself fitting in,"" she said. In 2021, 23% of physics A-level entrants were female. This is a slight increase on previous years. Prof Donald, from the University of Cambridge, told the Commons Science and Technology Committee it was ""relevant"" that ""most of the images one sees of scientists, physicists, are white males"". Teachers should try to ""actively counter"" messages from wider society that may discourage girls and children belonging to ethnic minorities from certain subjects, she added. ""In my generation I know lots of women who said 'I would have loved to do sciences at A-level, but my school discouraged me'. I don't for one moment expect that still to be true, but there's a difference between active discouragement and no active encouragement."" Girls dislike hard maths, says education adviser How physics gender gap starts in class Brownies to learn coding to get girls into science The panel session comes aftera government adviser was criticisedfor saying girls avoid physics because of its ""hard maths"". Social mobility adviser and head teacher Katharine Birbalsingh said physics was not a subject girls ""tend to fancy"", adding: ""I just think they don't like it."" The IOP said it was alarmed by the comments, and Ms Birbalsingh later said her language had been ""clunky"". Prof Donald said Ofsted could help encourage girls to choose A-level physics by tracking the gender balance of subjects as part of its school inspections. ""If Ofsted made gender equity an issue then every school would have to think, in primary school as well, 'what are we doing, without thinking about it are we giving boys different games to play, or different tasks?'."" This video can not be played Katharine Birbalsingh admits her language was clunky and clarified her A-level comments In response, Ofsted's Dr Jasper Green told the committee that school inspectors were already addressing how to improve girls' participation in science and maths, ""but we are focusing on the quality of education, on early education, on subjects, and all of those moves are the right ones to encourage wider participation at A-level"". He said gender balance could become something for Ofsted to consider assessing in the future, but that there were ""challenges"" in both measuring and improving it.

John Peel's family selling rare items from archive,"John Peel was the longest serving of the original BBC Radio 1 DJs, broadcasting from 1967 until his death in 2004 Rare items from the late veteran BBC DJ John Peel's collection - including a signed record from John Lennon and Yoko Ono - are to go under the hammer. John Peel was BBC Radio 1's longest-serving original DJ until his sudden death in 2004 at the age of 65, and lived near Stowmarket, Suffolk. His radio shows helped many music careers, including those of David Bowie, Queen and the Sex Pistols. His family said items had been carefully chosen for the14 June sale,external. The music legend would broadcast from his home studio in Suffolk - with his old gramophone one of the treasured pieces for sale Peel's real name was John Ravenscroft and he was born in Heswall, Cheshire and went to Shrewsbury School as a boarder. His widow and children said he had collected a ""wealth of souvenirs"" through his close access to stars and events. ""In going through the accumulation of 40 years of pop music moments, we decided that some of the most interesting items might find a home, with fans of his programme or of the artists whose music he played,"" they said. ""We hope these items find the attention and appreciation that we're sure John/Dad would feel they warranted. ""We had no desire to split up his beloved record collection but have included in the sale a selection of particularly rare or unique records that do not take away from the integrity of his archive."" Peel had amassed thousands of records in his personal home collection, with some items now being auctioned off In the 1980s, the broadcaster was a presenter on Top Of The Pops and regularly covered the Glastonbury Festival, with The John Peel Stage being dedicated to him in 2004. Objects from his collection, including records, personal correspondence and memorabilia, will be auctioned at Bonhams Knightsbridge on 14 June - the week before Glastonbury's 50th anniversary. John Lennon and Yoko Ono signed the inner sleeve of their specially-pressed album One item, with an estimate of between Â£15,000 and Â£20,000, is a mono pressing of Lennon and Ono's 1968 LP Two Virgins, 1968, which famously had them pictured naked on the cover. Other pieces include a signed Rolling Stones 1969 promo LP, estimated to go for Â£6,000-8,000, a Queen LP that comes with a letter from Freddie Mercury, with an estimate of Â£1,000-1,500, and a Joy Division single and letter - estimated at Â£4,000-Â£6,000. Katherine Schofield, of Bonhams, said: ""John Peel had an incredible impact on the new music landscape.

Price rises reach 40-year high,"Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years as higher energy bills hit millions of households. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9% in the12 months to April, up from 7% in March.,external The surge came as millions of people saw an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in energy costs last month. Higher fuel and food prices, driven by the Ukraine war, are also pushing the cost of living up, with inflation expected to continue to rise this year. Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" for the government to offer more support for households, and debt charities urged anyone finding it difficult to pay bills to seek help earlier rather than later in the year. Live updates: Inflation hits 9% as cost of living crisis deepens When might the inflation rate come down? Around three quarters of the rise in inflation in April came from higher electricity and gas bills, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ""There are desperate stories behind these figures,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""People washing in their kitchen sinks because they can't afford a hot shower; parents skipping meals to feed their kids; disabled people who can't afford to use vital equipment because of soaring energy bills."" Cheryl Holmes said there was not much more she could do to save money as her bills rose and salary stayed the same Health analyst Cheryl Holmes, a mother-of-two, said she was trying to keep her living costs down to ""as low as possible"" by spending less on food and clothes, and cancelling TV subscriptions. ""I've already for several years been turning the lights off in each room, setting the heating on a timer, making sure I'm using a full dishwasher and washing machine and I'm running out of ideas. ""It's a battle and it seems like there's not really much more that I can do."" UK inflation: 'I'm batch cooking and freezing food' A higher energy price cap - which is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers - kicked in last month, meaning homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying Â£1,971 per year on average. Up until now households of all incomes had faced similar rates of inflation, but the poorest are now being hit hardest by rising prices because they have to spend far more of their household budgets on gas and electricity, think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. The ONS, which publishes the UK's inflation rate, said the costs of food, machinery, furniture and other household goods also rose in April. ""All items"" on the menus of restaurants and cafes went up too, due to the VAT rate for hospitality returning to 20% after being cut during the pandemic to help businesses. Meanwhile, average petrol prices stood at Â£1.62 per litre in April 2022, the highest on record, compared with Â£1.26 per litre a year earlier. Why are prices rising so quickly? Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spending Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 9p, then milk inflation is 9%. Prices have been rising for months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and the Ukraine war, andwages are failing to keep pace. The ONS estimated inflation is now at its highest level since March 1982, when it stood at 9.1%. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch could leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year amid further expected rises in energy bills. UK inflation is simply not supposed to hit levels this high. And as the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said, these sorts of rises hit the poorest the hardest. 9% is an average across the population. The older Retail Prices Index measure is already at 11%. But Mr Bailey's institution has a battle on now to get this under control. The really painful issue is that this rate will sustain and is on course to get higher over the course of this year. And only this week he acknowledged that there was ""not a lot"" the Bank could do about four-fifths of the anticipated rise, as it is being imported from globally rising prices for energy and food . Read morehere. With households under increasing pressure, the government faces growing calls to offer more help. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he ""cannot protect people completely"" from rising inflation as it was a global problem. Mr Sunak is expected to call on businesses at the CBI's annual dinner later to boost investment and training in order to grow the economy and help ease the cost of living crunch. He will pledge that he will cut taxes on firms in the Autumn to ""invest more, train more, and innovate more"". Meanwhile, at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all the measures"" needed to help people struggling with rising bills. Sir Keir Starmer pressed the PM on Labour's call for a one-off tax on oil and gas profits, arguing it would raise ""billions"" to help. The PM replied that the government was ""not in principle in favour of higher taxation"". The rising cost of living is already seeing peoplespending less money and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. It's impacting the economy, which shrank in March and risks falling into recession next year, according to the Bank of England. The Bank's response has been to raise interest rates to try and cool prices. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend which dampens demand. However, it the Bank has faced criticism from MPs for not doing enough to tackle the crisis. This week Governor Andrew Bailey defended its response,insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited what the Bank could do. But UK now has the highest rate of inflation (9%) of any G7 country, including Germany (7.4%) and France (4.8%). Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said higher prices in the UK risked becoming embedded due to wages ""spiralling upwards"" as firms fought for talent. There are currently more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began, partly because many people dropped out of the labour market during the pandemic. Ms Streeter said prices across the hospitality and leisure industries were now at a 30-year high. ""So far companies have succeeded in passing on higher costs to customers keeping margins resilient, but worries do linger about just how long consumers will continue to pay the price,"" she added.

Sunak warns of tough few months as inflation soarsThe chancellor says it won't be easy to tackle cost of living crisis as inflation hits 40-year high.Business,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned the next few months ""will be tough"" after it was revealed prices are rising at the fastest rate for 40 years. In a speech to businesses, he said the government was ""ready to do more"" to help households facing soaring energy, fuel and food costs. He also said he would cut taxes for businesses to encourage them to invest. It comes as a think tank said the poorest were being hit hardest by steep rises in energy bills. UK inflationjumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, up from 7% in March and the highest level it has reached since 1982. Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 9p, then milk inflation is 9%. April's jump in inflation came as millions of people saw an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in energy costs last month. When might the inflation rate come down? UK inflation: 'I'm batch cooking and freezing food' Why are prices rising so quickly? At the annual CBI dinner, the chancellor told businesses the economic situation was ""extremely serious"", with the country facing ""a perfect storm of global supply shocks"", including the impact of the war in Ukraine and lockdowns in China. ""There is no measure any government could take, no law we could pass, that can make these global forces disappear overnight,"" he said. ""The next few months will be tough. But where we can act, we will."" However, he added that he ""cannot pretend"" it will be easy to cut costs for families. Mr Sunak also called on businesses to boost investment and training in order to grow the economy and help ease the cost of living crunch. ""And as I've said previously, our firm plan is to reduce and reform your taxes to support you to do all three of those things,"" he said. ""That is the path to higher productivity, higher living standards, and a more prosperous and secure future."" The chancellor and business leaders agreed on one thing - the economy is taking a turn for the worse. Mr Sunak conceded things are going to be tough in the months ahead and the CBI president Karan Bilimoria said firms were worried about stalling growth, rampant inflation and high taxes. But while the chancellor said his response to the cost of living crisis would evolve, business leaders said waiting for an autumn Budget would be too late. The chancellor challenged business to do their part by increasing investment levels which were lower than other developed economies. Business leaders at the event felt there were mixed messages from the government. The president of the CBI pointed to the highest tax burden in 70 years with corporation tax and national insurance contributions set to rise further next April. With business and consumer confidence evaporating fast, their message was if you are going to do something, do it now. Around three quarters of the rise in inflation in April came from higher electricity and gas bills, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). A higher energy price cap - which is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers - kicked in last month, meaning homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying Â£1,971 per year on average. Fuel prices have also surged, with the RAC motoring group warning on Wednesday that petrol and diesel prices have hit new records of Â£1.68 and Â£1.81 per litre respectively. The prices of most other goods and services have risen as well, the ONS said, while wages arefailing to keep pace with inflation and falling in real terms. Up until now households of all incomes had faced similar rates of inflation, but the poorest are now being hit hardest by rising prices because they have to spend far more of their household budgets on gas and electricity, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. Retail Economics, a research consultancy, said the poorest people were experiencing a drop of Â£59 per month in their discretionary spending budgets compared to this time last year. Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" and the government needed to offer households more support. ""There are desperate stories behind these figures,"" Dame Clare Moriarty, the charity's chief executive, said.

Tesco shopper's plea to bring back till staff,"Pat McCarthy started a petition called ""Tesco to stop the replacement of people by machines"" A Tesco shopper is urging the supermarket to ""stop replacing people with machines"" after she struggled to use the store's self-service checkouts. Pat McCarthy, 69, started a petition calling for more cashiers on tills because ""you can't speak to a machine"". She is one of the many who complain self-service tills are too slow or hard to use, and her petition has beensigned by more than 100,000 people,external. Tesco said staff were always on hand to help at either type of checkout. Ms McCarthy, from Brentford in west London, said she began her campaign after visiting the Tesco Extra in Osterley, west London where she said three quarters of the tills were self-service. ""These new tills are not accessible for people who don't have credit cards and can only use cash or those with little confidence to use these self-service card-only tills - myself included,"" she wrote on her Change.org page. The volunteer, who helps people with disabilities, told the BBC there were five or six staffed tills but she faced a 30 minute wait due to queues. ""You do need some self-service for the people who find them more convenient but just fewer,"" she said. Tesco opens its first checkout-free store Amazon opens a supermarket with no checkouts The unpopular rise of self-checkouts (and how to fix them) Ms McCarthy said she loved chatting with checkout staff as she lives on her own, but ""now that experience has been taken away from me"". A Tesco spokesperson said: ""Our colleagues and the friendly service they provide are absolutely vital to our stores and will always be on hand to help our customers, whether they are checking out at one of our colleague-operated or self-service checkouts."" Ms McCarthy is not alone.Some customers have complained that self-service tills are slowerthan staffed ones despite being billed as being faster. Others find them annoying. In 2015, Morrisons brought back staff at 1,000 ""express"" checkouts after finding that 67% of customers felt nervous using self scanning tills. Tesco introduced self-service tills in its stores 20 years ago The Twitter hashtag #BringBackTescoStaff has been used more than 3,000 times as shoppers share Ms McCarthy's petition and their own experiences.

Another customer Steve tweeted: ""Being on the autistic spectrum, I find self service tills a godsend as I don't have to queue anxiously waiting, knowing I have to speak to someone."" Tesco said it introduced self-service checkouts nearly 20 years ago to give customers a choice and all of its stores had both options. In October, the supermarket converted its store in High Holborn in central London into aTesco GetGowhich allows customers to shop and pay without using a checkout. At the time Richard Lim, chief executive of retail analyst group Retail Economics, said the move was ""reflective of the way the wider industry is heading"". According to one estimate, the number of self-service checkouts in stores worldwide was forecast at 325,000 in 2021 - up from around 200,000 in 2013. Adam Leyland, editor of The Grocer magazine, said the decline in the number of staffed tills in supermarkets reflected shopper preference for getting in and out quickly. He said: ""On my High Street, the new Amazon Fresh store with the fancy just-walk-out tech is always empty, whereas the new deli, four doors down employs six to eight people on each shift and is rammed to the gills. ""It shows that many shoppers still value great customer service and human interaction and technology won't always win. So supermarkets will need to listen hard as the market evolves and cater for all needs.""

Refugees say they receive worrying messages,"This video can not be played Ukraine war: 'My previous life was stolen,' says refugee When Alina started checking Beth's Instagram, there was far more at stake than seeing what she was wearing, or which restaurants she'd visited. For the student fleeing Odesa in Ukraine it presented vital information on whether she could trust a stranger. After registering with websites linking Ukrainians with UK hosts, the 21-year-old noticed ""a lot of people"" looking to ""take advantage of refugees"". More than 87,000 people from Ukraine have applied to the sponsorship scheme. It requires the support of a host in the UK. Wales refugee family thwarted by paperwork Granddaughter, daughter and dog rescued Along with plenty of presumably genuine messages from well-meaning families, Alina, a linguistics student, also began to receive ""worrying"" messages sent directly to her email and WhatsApp. ""I was faced with a lot of people who wanted to take advantage of me,"" explained Alina, who woke to the sound of bombing near her university halls on the first day of the Russian invasion. ""I got a couple of messages that made me feel not very comfortable and I got a couple of messages saying 'we can hire you as a babysitter or to walk the dogs'. It made me really suspicious. ""I'm a refugee, I need a safe place to stay - I'm not looking for money or for a job."" Hundreds of miles away in Cardiff, prospective host Beth was having similar concerns. The 33-year-old hoped the spare room in her flat in the Welsh capital could offer safety to someone who needed it, but worried that refugees and hosts were expected to help match themselves under the UK government scheme. Some online investigating reassured Alina her host was sincere ""I didn't feel comfortable choosing someone to live with me through Facebook,"" she explained. ""It felt like a meat market. There were loads of other families advertising themselves. It was like open season for traffickers, I wanted to keep myself and whoever I was hosting safe. ""I heard there were a lot of people, girls, who were being offered room with basically sex as payment. ""It meant that when I was offering a room it felt like it was on me to prove I would provide a safe space."" When Beth, a biomedical scientist and Brownie leader, matched with Alina, she immediately sent her a link to her Instagram. She said it was one of the easiest ways she could think of to help Alina trust her. Alina relaxes at home with Beth's cat Barry Beth's first message also included her Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check from Brownies - and explicit confirmation that she was offering the room ""for free"". In other words, nothing would be expected of Alina. ""It was a huge letter through WhatsApp,"" remembers Alina. ""The thing that I liked was that she described all her safety checks. Her letter made me feel really comfortable. She was a real person. I thought, 'I feel safe with this girl'."" Millions of people have fled Ukraine since the start of the war Home Office data suggests more than 46,000 Ukrainian refugees have already travelled to the UK under family and sponsorship schemes. There have been more than 45,000 applications for visas under the Ukraine Family Scheme and almost 90,000 applications for visas under the sponsorship scheme which Alina travelled on. TheUkraine Sponsorship Scheme,externalallows Ukrainians and their family members to come to the UK if they can find a named host who will be providing accommodation for them. Data from the Office for National Statistics has suggested only 2% of the UK's Ukrainian refugees are living in Wales, despite an offer from the Welsh government to act as a host itself - and supply up to 1,000 people with accommodation. Figures suggest there are more than 1,100 Ukrainian refugees staying in Wales, but just 184 of them have come under Welsh government sponsorship. A Welsh government spokesman said UK-wide delays processing visas had meant a ""significant lag"" in the recorded data. Alina with her mum and Beth, after they arrived in the UK After spending some time Googling each other, messages between Alina and Beth ""started flying"". ""I was very insistent on her mum being there for the first video call,"" said Beth. ""I knew that my mum would be absolutely terrified if things were the other way around - so I wanted to provide that reassurance. ""I was showing views out my window, this is Cardiff, this is where I live, this is somewhere safe."" Alina's mum also travelled to the UK, but her host family are in Yorkshire. When their flight arrived at Heathrow Airport earlier this month, it was Beth who went to pick them up, complete with a selection of biscuits and crisps in case they were hungry. ""I was so nervous, but when we met Beth she was so nice, she was worrying about us and all my anxiety just went,"" said Alina, who still thinks more should be done to help refugees know potential hosts are ""safe"". ""The main thing is to choose your host carefully and to listen to your heart and your brain,"" she said. ""I need to build a new life, my previous life was stolen. I still have hopes I will be able to come back to Ukraine. ""But life is still going on and I have a lot of plans, I want to finish university and then I want to find work - and meet new people and just live.""

Energy bills push price rises to 40-year high,"Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years as higher energy bills hit millions of households. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9% in the12 months to April, up from 7% in March.,external The surge came as millions of people saw an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in energy costs last month. Higher fuel and food prices, driven by the Ukraine war, are also pushing the cost of living up, with inflation expected to continue to rise this year. Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" for the government to offer more support for households, and debt charities urged anyone finding it difficult to pay bills to seek help earlier rather than later in the year. Live updates: Inflation hits 9% as cost of living crisis deepens When might the inflation rate come down? Around three quarters of the rise in inflation in April came from higher electricity and gas bills, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ""There are desperate stories behind these figures,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""People washing in their kitchen sinks because they can't afford a hot shower; parents skipping meals to feed their kids; disabled people who can't afford to use vital equipment because of soaring energy bills."" Cheryl Holmes said there was not much more she could do to save money as her bills rose and salary stayed the same Health analyst Cheryl Holmes, a mother-of-two, said she was trying to keep her living costs down to ""as low as possible"" by spending less on food and clothes, and cancelling TV subscriptions. ""I've already for several years been turning the lights off in each room, setting the heating on a timer, making sure I'm using a full dishwasher and washing machine and I'm running out of ideas. ""It's a battle and it seems like there's not really much more that I can do."" UK inflation: 'I'm batch cooking and freezing food' A higher energy price cap - which is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers - kicked in last month, meaning homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying Â£1,971 per year on average. Up until now households of all incomes had faced similar rates of inflation, but the poorest are now being hit hardest by rising prices because they have to spend far more of their household budgets on gas and electricity, think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. The ONS, which publishes the UK's inflation rate, said the costs of food, machinery, furniture and other household goods also rose in April. ""All items"" on the menus of restaurants and cafes went up too, due to the VAT rate for hospitality returning to 20% after being cut during the pandemic to help businesses. Meanwhile, average petrol prices stood at Â£1.62 per litre in April 2022, the highest on record, compared with Â£1.26 per litre a year earlier. Why are prices rising so quickly? Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spending Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 9p, then milk inflation is 9%. Prices have been rising for months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and the Ukraine war, andwages are failing to keep pace. The ONS estimated inflation is now at its highest level since March 1982, when it stood at 9.1%. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch could leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year amid further expected rises in energy bills. UK inflation is simply not supposed to hit levels this high. And as the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said, these sorts of rises hit the poorest the hardest. 9% is an average across the population. The older Retail Prices Index measure is already at 11%. But Mr Bailey's institution has a battle on now to get this under control. The really painful issue is that this rate will sustain and is on course to get higher over the course of this year. And only this week he acknowledged that there was ""not a lot"" the Bank could do about four-fifths of the anticipated rise, as it is being imported from globally rising prices for energy and food . Read morehere. With households under increasing pressure, the government faces growing calls to offer more help. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he ""cannot protect people completely"" from rising inflation as it was a global problem. Mr Sunak is expected to call on businesses at the CBI's annual dinner later to boost investment and training in order to grow the economy and help ease the cost of living crunch. He will pledge that he will cut taxes on firms in the Autumn to ""invest more, train more, and innovate more"". Meanwhile, at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all the measures"" needed to help people struggling with rising bills. Sir Keir Starmer pressed the PM on Labour's call for a one-off tax on oil and gas profits, arguing it would raise ""billions"" to help. The PM replied that the government was ""not in principle in favour of higher taxation"". The rising cost of living is already seeing peoplespending less money and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. It's impacting the economy, which shrank in March and risks falling into recession next year, according to the Bank of England. The Bank's response has been to raise interest rates to try and cool prices. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend which dampens demand. However, it the Bank has faced criticism from MPs for not doing enough to tackle the crisis. This week Governor Andrew Bailey defended its response,insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited what the Bank could do. But UK now has the highest rate of inflation (9%) of any G7 country, including Germany (7.4%) and France (4.8%). Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said higher prices in the UK risked becoming embedded due to wages ""spiralling upwards"" as firms fought for talent. There are currently more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began, partly because many people dropped out of the labour market during the pandemic. Ms Streeter said prices across the hospitality and leisure industries were now at a 30-year high. ""So far companies have succeeded in passing on higher costs to customers keeping margins resilient, but worries do linger about just how long consumers will continue to pay the price,"" she added.

"Girls see physics as for white boys only, MPs told","MPs are trying to tackle the low uptake of physics and maths A-levels by young women Girls do not take physics at A-level because they think the subject is only for white boys, MPs have been told. No mention of female scientists in the national curriculum contributes to ""the message society gives"" to discourage girls from picking physics, leading physicist Prof Dame Athene Donald said.

When might the inflation rate come down?,"Prices in the UK have already risen by 9% over the last year - the highest rate of inflation for 40 years. Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey has told MPs he is unable to stop inflation reaching 10%, whilewarning of an ""apocalyptic"" rise in global food prices. But how long is inflation likely to remain this high, and what can the government do to fight back? A 9% annual rate of inflation means - in the most basic terms - that if a loaf of bread cost Â£1 this time last year, it now costs Â£1.09. But inflation is spread unevenly across sectors in the economy - so while some prices have grown a little or stayed the same, others have rocketed upwards. This is because inflation is being driven by the rising costs of fuel and food, and some product supply chains are more affected than others. A 54% increase in the energy price cap has caused almost three-quarters of the jump in inflation, according to the Office for National Statistics. Over the winter, demand for oil and gas shot up as industries in Asia returned to full capacity after the pandemic and began consuming more energy. Russia's invasion of Ukraineput further pressure on energy prices as countries around the world scrambled to find alternatives to Russian oil and gas. Meanwhile, Ukrainian farms have been left unattended - and its wheat exports have been disrupted - putting pressure on global food supplies. ""Inflation is mostly driven by labour market shortages and supply chain disruptions,"" says Prof Riccardo Crescenzi, an economist at the London School of Economics. These are made worse in the UK by significant uncertainty over trade and investment conditions, and restrictions on international labour mobility in a variety of key sectors, he says. Why are prices rising so quickly? Seven reasons living costs are rising around the world The Bank of England expects the UK's energy price cap to rise again in October, which will push inflation up to 10% this autumn. Despite this, it says that the ""current high rates of inflation are not likely to last"". It forecasts inflation will peak this winter - then come down to be close to 2% in about two years. Not all economists are so sure. Historically, when inflation has risen above 9% it has taken years, not months, to recover. Maria Demertzis, an economist at Bruegel, the Brussels-based think tank, says as long as the war in Ukraine continues, and there are concerns about where the UK will get its oil and gas from, ""that's going to put a lot of pressure on prices."" To combat the effects of inflation, companies are offering higher wages to workers. But to pay for this, they often have to raise the prices of their own products and services, which fuels further inflation. This creates what economists call an inflationary spiral. ""Inflation is likely to remain a problem in 2023 because its root causes are unlikely to change in the near future"" says Prof Crescenzi. What will it take to get inflation under control? By raising interest rates, the Bank of England can make borrowing more expensive - encouraging people to save instead of spend. It also means some people with mortgages see their monthly payments go up. So far, this hasn't reversed inflation, but central banks argue that without such measures, inflation would be rising faster. The Labour Party is calling for a one-offwindfall taxon oil and gas firms to help households cope with higher bills. BP's underlying profit more than doubled to Â£4.9bn in the first quarter of 2022, while Shell's profits almost tripled to over Â£7bn - both helped by the rising price of energy. Labour say a windfall tax would raise Â£1.2bn but the government argues that such a tax could discourage crucial investments that would eventually bring down energy costs and so make the UK less sensitive to global oil and gas prices. Governments can also give direct support to households by giving cash handouts, and placing caps on energy prices. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said ""we cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we can."" France Announced a one-off â¬100 (Â£84) payment to the 5.8 million households that already receive energy vouchers, last year. Since then, it has reduced taxes on electricity and capped rises in energy bills to 4%. These measures are estimated to have cost up to â¬15.5bn (Â£13bn). Italy It is raising taxes on energy companies that have seen profits rise thanks to surging prices. Also announced a â¬14bn fuel subsidy and investment plan - allowing families to keep their fuel bills similar to 2021 levels, while also investing in renewable energy. Germany It has already brought in subsidies for low-income households and is now spending an extra â¬15bn - on fuel subsidies through cutting petrol and diesel taxes, providing people with one-off â¬300 pay outs, extra child support payments and public transport discounts. The total cost for these measures is about â¬30bn.

"Stormont crisis 'will demoralise health staff'It is disappointing and shocking that the system is in crisis again, a former health chief says.Northern IrelandComments","John Compton, a former chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said the health minister was powerless A former health chief has warned that workers will feel ""demoralised, leaderless and disrespected"" without a functioning government. John Compton, former chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said it was ""disappointing and shocking"" that the system was in crisis again. He said staff needed encouragement as we emerged from the pandemic. Mr Compton also said the present health minister remained powerless to take major decisions. Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Compton said: ""It requires political leadership, political accountability, clarity over the management of money and the strategic reshaping of services."" The Department of Health said it was committed to delivering change and added that ""standing still and accepting the status quo is not an option"". There is currently no power-sharing government in Northern Ireland after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said it would not go into the executive until there are significant changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. How events at Stormont will pause political life Stormont paralysis puts patients at risk say health leaders Stormont crisis 'bursts balloon' of health progress Caretaker ministers, who were in post before the collapse of Stormont in February, can keep running their respective departments but no new decisions, such as agreeing a budget, can be taken. If subsequently the Northern Ireland Assembly is put into long-term cold storage, the system would be led by the permanent health secretary, Peter May, who would also become the chief executive of the health and social care system. According to Mr Compton, while anyone can take care of the system, what was needed was ""someone in charge and who has power to facilitate change"". Mr Compton left the health board in 2014 and was responsible for producing one of several health reports around reform called Transforming Your Care. Without a functioning executive, Northern Ireland will not obtain a multi-year budget which prevents reformation of services, changes to how hospitals deliver those services and any decisions around the workforce. This impacts actions to tackle hospital waiting lists - and there are questions being raised around accountability. The Department of Health told BBC News NI that the issues facing health and social care ""are well known and require sustained investment and reform"". ""Political and budgetary certainty are highly important when it comes to rebuilding services,"" the department said. The protection of health and social care featured on all political manifestos in the most recent election In March this year, the Health and Social Care Board closed. The board held the health purse strings, trusts would have gone to it to ask for money - money to pay wages, operations and medical equipment. It was held to account during monthly meetings by its board, other public bodies and via published minutes which could be read by journalists. Now the Department of Health takes the lead on the day-to-day running of the health service and the minister is ultimately responsible for everything. Ann Watt, director of the independent think tank Pivotal, said accountability was a big issue. ""There had been an expectation that if there was no executive there would be an assembly and the minister (for health) would therefore be held to account in the chamber and in committees,"" she said. ""Unfortunately that is not in place so accountability will have to be directly through the public, the media, through professional bodies and clinicians."" The Department of Health said that ""the former functions of HSCB (Health and Social Care Board) are now departmental responsibility and subject to departmental governance and accountability arrangements"". ""Following the closure of the board, the department is accountable to the minister for all of the functions delivered by the former board staff under the direction of the department."" It added that the delivery of functions is ""subject to the appropriate level of scrutiny"". Last week Northern Ireland's Health leaders called on assembly members to ""get back to work"" In the recent assembly election, the protection of health and social care featured on all political manifestos. When the public went to the polls, it was the expectation of most voters that a government would follow - but that has not happened. Pivotal's Ann Watt said not having a brand new government in place was ""unfair on voters and unfair on the people who are going to suffer most ie those on waiting lists, children who won't get free school meals and the most vulnerable"". Last week, Northern Ireland's health leaders called on the recently elected assembly members to ""get back to work"". While meeting the political parties on Monday, the prime minister repeated the call. The Royal College of Surgeon's Mark Taylor said we are already seeing the ""impact of a process that needs radically changed"". ""Is it acceptable to sit eight hours in the back of an ambulance? Is it acceptable to wait five years on your hip replacement? Is it acceptable to wait on a trolley for 24 - 48 hours? Is it acceptable to have a two-tier system of health in Northern Ireland - is it acceptable to keep kicking the can down the road? ""The answer is no."" In a statement, the Department of Health added: ""The Departmental Management Board includes two non-executive members appointed through the public appointments system and scrutiny includes the delivery of the functions transferred to the department. ""The department's Audit and Risk Assurance Committee was established to advise the accounting officer, through the departmental board, on the quality of assurances they receive about strategic processes for risk management, governance, internal control and the integrity of financial statements."" It said the committee comprises of two non-executives from the board and two independent external members. The committee's oversight ""extends to those former functions of the board which are now under the direction of the senior civil servant"".

Breaking|Breaking newsScotRail cuts 700 daily services in driver pay rowThe operator apologised for cutting a third of trains and blamed an ongoing shortage of drivers.Scotland,"Cuts are also expected to be made to the Saturday and Sunday timetables ScotRail will cut almost 700 services a day from Monday, due to a shortage of drivers in an ongoing pay dispute. Evening trains on many routes across Scotland will terminate hours earlier. It comes just a week after the operator, which was nationalised last month, launched a new timetable. Hundreds of trains have been cancelled since 8 May when many drivers opted not to work overtime. Drivers' union Aslef had balloted members for strike action after rejecting a 2.2% pay offer. The May 2022 timetable had approximately 2,150 weekday services. From next week this will be reduced by a third to 1,456. ScotRail plans to cut third of services - union Train driver shortage causes wave of cancellations Similar cuts are expected to be made to the Saturday and Sunday timetables with details expected to be made public in the coming days. David Simpson, ScotRail service delivery director, said: ""We are very sorry to customers for the disruption of recent days. ""We know what customers want more than anything is certainty and reliability, which is why we are introducing a temporary timetable. ""We want to resolve this dispute with the trade unions and move forward together to provide the safest, greenest, and most reliable railway we can for Scotland."" Mr Simpson said the company remained open to further talks with the unions. He urged customers tocheck their journey times,external. Evening travel has been affected on many routes, with last trains departing hours earlier. Edinburgh to North Berwick currently departs at 23:14. From Monday the last train will be at 19:40. The last train from Glasgow to Stirling is currently 23:51. From Monday it will be at 19:49. ScotRail goes back into public ownership The Aslef union accused the Scottish government of ""industrial vandalism"" over the cuts. Kevin Lindsay, Aslef Scotland organiser, said: ""This is what happens when you have political interference in industrial relations. ""It's time the Scottish government allowed ScotRail and Aslef to negotiate in a fair and open manner. ""These cuts will have a devastating effect on passengers and their confidence in our railway."" ScotRail has been run by a company owned by the Scottish government since 1 April. The previous operator Abellio had its franchise ended early amid criticism of the quality of the service. The Scottish government took over ScotRail from Abellio on 1 April Opposition parties also condemned the service cuts. Scottish Conservative transport spokesman, Graham Simpson, said: ""It is damning, but not surprising, that the first thing the SNP do with the newly nationalised ScotRail is slash almost one third of services. Scottish Labour's transport spokesman, Neil Bibby, said: ""Services are being plunged into chaos, workers are being treated with contempt, and passengers are being left in the lurch. The SNP must take responsibility for fixing this mess."" Scottish Liberal Democrat transport spokeswoman, Jill Reilly, said it was an ""ill omen"" for the newly nationalised service. She added: ""Scotland should be encouraging people onto the most environmentally friendly form of mass transportation. You don't do that by making rail travel less convenient for users. The new timetable comes after significant number of drivers declined to make themselves available for overtime or Sunday working  during a pay dispute. The Aslef union rejected a 2.2% pay rise and balloted drivers over strike action. ScotRail had been relying on drivers working extra hours, following delays in training new staff during the Covid pandemic. On Monday, Mick Hogg of the RMT union, described the situation as an ""absolute shambles"". He said he had recommended that the RMT ballot members for action short of a strike, with any action co-ordinated with Aslef. Scotland's transport minister, Jenny Gilruth, described the practice of rest day working as ""outdated"" and said the Scottish government was looking to phase it out. She said the delayed driver training was expected to take a few months. BBC Scotland has approached Transport Scotland for comment.

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion. Ukrainian volunteers prepare to deliver food inside a complex set up as a shelter in Zaporizhzhya We've been reporting onthe growing food crisis in Ukraineand accusations thatRussia is using food as a weapon of war, including by blocking ports in Ukraine's Black Sea. Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information.

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate.

McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad.

China plane crash likely intentional - US reports,"Emergency workers at the site of the China Eastern Airlines plane crash Flight data indicates a China Eastern Airlines plane that crashed in March was intentionally put into a nose-dive, according to US media reports. Investigators have so far not found any mechanical or technical faults with the jet, the reports say, citing a preliminary assessment by US officials. The Boeing 737-800 was flying between the southern Chinese cities of Kunming and Guangzhou when it crashed. All 132 passengers and crew on board the plane died in the crash. ""The plane did what it was told to do by someone in the cockpit,"" according to the Wall Street Journal, which first reported the story, citing a person familiar with US officials' preliminary assessment of the cause of the crash. Data from one of the plane's ""black box"" flight recorders, which was recovered from the crash site, suggested that inputs to the controls pushed the plane into a near-vertical dive, the report said. ABC News, citing US officials, also reported that the crash was believed to have been caused by an intentional act. Investigators looking into the crash are examining whether it was due to intentional action on the flight deck, with no evidence found of a technical malfunction, according to Reuters, which cited two people briefed on the matter. China confirms no survivors in plane crash China plane crash: What do we know so far? China Eastern Airlines previously said the three pilots on board were qualified and in good health. The airline separately told the Wall Street Journal that there was no indication that any of the pilots was in financial trouble. China Eastern Airlines did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. The Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), which is leading investigations into the crash, also did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment. Last month, the CAAC said reports that the plane may have been crashed deliberately had ""gravely misled the public"" and ""interfered with accident investigation work"". Investigators are still in the process of analysing flight data and the wreckage from the crash, Chinese state media outlet the Global Times reported on Wednesday. It also said the CAAC will continue to ""carry out the accident investigation in a scientific, rigorous and orderly manner"". The Chinese embassy in Washington, the US National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), and plane maker Boeing declined to comment on the Wall Street Journal's report, due to guidelines set out by the United Nations' International Civil Aviation Organization. ""Under the rules regarding crash investigations... only the investigating agency can comment on an open air accident investigation,"" a Boeing spokesperson told the BBC on Wednesday. The company previously said it was assisting investigations in China and communicating with the NTSB. Chinese airlines generally have a good safety record - the last major accident took place 12 years ago. The China Eastern Airlines plane that crashed was less than seven years old.

Half of new nurses and midwives come from abroad,"Nearly half of the new nurses and midwives registered to work in the UK in the past year have come from abroad. The total - more than 23,000 - is a record high and comes as the UK has struggled to increase the number of home-grown nurses joining the register. Nurse leaders questioned whether international recruitment on this scale was sustainable. The Nursing and Midwifery Council data for 2021-22 also showed the numbers leaving the profession had risen. More than 27,000 left the register last year, up 13% on the year before and reversing a downward trend in leavers over recent years. In many ways this was always expected as significant numbers of staff put off retirement to help out in the emergency phase of the pandemic. And retirement was certainly the main factor - more than four in 10 cited this - although nearly one in five also blamed too much pressure. Call for long-term plan to help 'burnt-out' nurses Nursing shortage warning as winter looms Overall the numbers on the register, which also includes a small number of nursing associates, rose by nearly 26,500 to more than 758,000, the highest number ever. One in five are from abroad. Nearly all of the international recruits that have arrived in the past year were trained in countries from outside Europe - before Brexit Europe supplied more than the rest of the world. India and the Philippines are the countries which are supplying the most. The register covers those qualified to work in the UK - it is not the same as the numbers working in the NHS. Currently around one in 10 nursing posts are unfilled. Nursing and Midwifery Council chief executive Andrea Sutcliffe said it was ""good news"" that the register was at the highest level ever, given the pressures of the past two years. But she added that there were some ""warning signs"", saying the numbers leaving because of work pressure was troubling. And she said the extent to which the UK had become reliant on internationally trained staff was another ""note of caution"". ""These professionals make a welcome and vital contribution, but we can't take them for granted."" She said the supply of international recruits could always be disrupted by global events or even another pandemic. Royal College of Nursing general secretary Pat Cullen questioned the sustainability and ethics of such a level of recruitment from abroad, and called for increased investment in domestic training and better pay for staff. The government said the NHS followed ethical recruitment practices, by not recruiting from a red list of countries which have declared shortages of health care staff. All parts of the UK have set out plans to increase the number of nurses and midwives in the NHS. There are signs that is having an impact on domestic supply routes. The overall number of nurses currently in training has started to rise after the reintroduction of some funding support for student nurses in England in 2020, three years after bursaries were scrapped. In theory that should boost the domestic supply route. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said the overall rise in nurse numbers was pleasing - and continued progress would help England achieve the government's manifesto promise to recruit 50,000 more nurses by 2024. ""I'm determined to continue growing the workforce,"" he added.

LiveLiveJohnson under pressure on cost of living at PMQs1 minute ago,"Boris Johnson tells Prime Minister's Questions he will ""look at all the measures"" needed to help people struggling with rising bills Sir Keir Starmer presses him on Labour's call for a one-off tax on oil and gas profits, arguing it would raise ""billions"" to help with energy bills But the PM replies ""this government is not in principle in favour of higher taxation"" Meanwhile, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford calls for an emergency budget The Commons debate comes as the UK's rate of inflation reaches 9% as prices rise at the highest rate for 40 years Soaring energy bills are the main driver, after the UK's energy price cap increased in April. Covid-19 and the Ukraine war have also hit global supply chains Inflation is expected to continue to rise, and Citizens Advice has urged anyone finding it difficult to pay bills to seek help Edited by Emma Owen We're finishing our coverage of the rise in inflation now - thanks for joining us. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Jen Meierhans, Charley Adams, Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon and Doug Faulkner. The page was edited by Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien.  We'll be finishing up our live coverage of the rise in inflation and PMQs shortly. Here's a brief recap of what's happened:  If you'd like to delve deeper into the issue of inflation, you can find coverage, analysis and explainers on ourpoliticsandbusinesspages. And we'll leave you as we started, with this graph showing inflation rates over the years.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak issued a few words on inflation earlier today, saying the government ""stood ready to take further action"". This evening, he's due to speak at the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry, and is expected to warn that it will not be easy for the government to address the rising cost of living. According to extracts of his speech released in advance by the Treasury, Sunak will tell businesses that government plans to deliver tax cuts in the autumn budget should encourage them to ""invest more, train more, and innovate more"". Sunak will also say the government cannot make ""global forces disappear overnight"" and ""the next few months will be tough"". Reality Check Earlier today at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson told MPs: âIn July, we will have the biggest
tax cut for 10 years, Â£330 cuts for 30 million people who are paying national
insurance contributions.â The Â£330 cut he is talking about is because the point at which people
start paying National Insurance is rising from earnings of Â£9,570 to Â£12,570 a
year. The Treasury says this â along
with a plan to cut income tax in 2024 â will be the biggest tax âgiveawayâ
since 1995. But â if you look beyond these
measures - the reductions are actually smaller than the increases in taxes the
chancellor announced in the previous year. And the governmentâs independent
forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility says the overall tax burden is
going to rise from 33% of GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) in 2019-20
to 36.3% of GDP in 2026-27. This would be the highest since
the late 1940s. You can read more about it here.  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Younger people looking for even the smallest crumb of
comfort in todayâs figures can look to the cost of buying a home - even if the overall trend continues to be of properties becoming more expensive and out of reach for many. The price of the average home still rose by Â£24,000 in the
year to March - bringing it to Â£278,000, according to the Office for National
Statistics (ONS). However, the pace of increase is slowing. In March, the
annual increase was 9.8% compared with 11.3% in February. Thatâs still extremely high but forecasts suggest thathouse price growth will slow in the next year or two. The difficulty for many first-time buyers is that their
savings are being eaten away by inflation, rather than growing and ready to use as
a deposit when getting a mortgage. The chief secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said Rachel Reeves' speech âfailed to rise to the magnitude of the momentâ. As expected, he did not give his backing for Labour's call for an emergency budget. Instead, he said the government had âresponded quickly and comprehensively to the greatest challenge of our generationâ with what he said was a package of financial support. He said the government was creating the conditions for growth by investing in skills and infrastructure. Returning now to the Commons, where MPs have been concluding their debate on the government's Queen's Speech, and Labour has called for an emergency budget to address the rising cost of living. In a speech, Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves criticised the Conservative governmentâs handling of the economy, accusing ministers of failing businesses and consumers. She cited a survey by the Food Foundation think tank, which suggested two million people were skipping meals because they cannot afford to eat every day. âThis is not normal,â Reeves said. âIt is the consequence of Conservative government choices.â A retired couple have told us the rise in petrol prices and energy bills means they've had to cut down on how often they see their children and grandchildren. Mike Gibbons 75 and his wife Ev, 72, from Southampton have six daughters between them, and while hers live not too far away, his are in Newcastle-under-Lyme and Milton Keynes. Mrs Gibbons said: ""They only have little houses, so we can't stay so we have hotel bills and petrol on top of it. It's a bit of a killer at the moment so we are budgeting and we are not going so often."" Mr Gibbons said their energy bills had gone up by Â£88 a month after their provider PurePlanet went bust and they moved to Shell. He said each 450-500 mile trip to see his family in Newcastle-under-Lyme now cost Â£25 more in petrol. Mrs Gibbons said: ""It's making it more difficult to see our family on a regular basis because you just can't afford it any more - the money's not there.We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to."" We've just heard the British Chamber of Commerce talk of the possibility of a recession in the UK later this year - somethinganalysts last week warned aboutas well. So, what does a recession actually mean? Clothes, food, cars... we make and sell loads of things in the UK. The more we sell, the more money the country makes. When that happens, the economy grows. People, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services we produce - our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes, this falls instead, which means our economy is shrinking. If this happens for a period of six months in a row, then this is called a recession. When the economy shrinks, some people may lose their jobs, struggle to find new ones or find it harder to get promotions or pay rises. However, the impact of a recession is usually not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Could there be a recession soon? It's possible. The economy grew by 0.8% over the first three months of the year, but in March it shrank by 0.1% as people cut back due to rising prices. Speaking last week, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures ""suggest the economy had less momentum than we thought"" and that the risk of recession ""has just risen"". More reaction now to news today that UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in the12 months to April, up from 7% in March.,external The British Chamber of Commerce has described the rise as ""eye-watering"" and has warned there is a real chance of a recession by the third quarter of the year. The BCC's head of economics, Surenâ¯Thiru, said inflation may ""moderate a little over the summer"" but was likely to increase even further in October to above 10% when the energy price cap rises. He said a June interest rate rise was inevitable. ""However, higher interest rates will do little to address the global factors driving this inflationary surge and risks undermining confidence and aggravating the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses,"" he said. The BCC is calling for the government to reverse the rise in National Insurance contributions and cut VAT on business energy bills to 5%.,external A senior Conservative MP has backed a windfall tax on oil and gas giants - a move Labour has repeatedly called for - saying ""desperate times call for desperate measures"". Robert Halfon accused oil companies of ""ripping off"" customers by not passing on the 12-month fuel duty cut that came into effect in March, making life ""very difficult for millions of people across the country"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, the chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee suggested money raised from a windfall tax and from scrapping green levies, could be put towards a further rebate on people's energy bills. ""I reckon there are arguments on both sides on this in terms of employment and investment, I get it,"" he says. ""But I think desperate times call for desperate measures and we must do this, and we must do it quickly."" Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all measures in future"" when asked about a windfall tax on oil and gas companies MPs in the Commons are now debating the Queen's Speech, which was announced last week and sets out the government's agenda. In case you missed it, here's a quick recap of Prime Minister's Questions earlier, which was dominated by the rising cost of living: Taxing times:Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked the PM if he was for or against his party's plan for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Boris Johnson said ""in principle"" the government doesn't want to raise taxes Wind of change:Sir Keir predicted an ""inevitable"" U-turn on the proposed tax, saying oil and gas companies were making extra profits worth Â£32m a day. Johnson said he would ""look at all measures in future"" Boom or gloom:The Labour leader said Johnson was pretending the economy was booming, which showed the PM had his âhead in the sandâ. But Johnson said his government had got more people into work and that was the answer to stimulate the economy Call for support:In his final question, Sir Keir said working people felt abandoned by the government. In reply, the PM reminded him that investment in public services wouldnât be possible without a strong economy Poor punished:The SNP's Ian Blackford said under the Tories the ""poorest are punished the most"". Johnson disputed that and said raising the living wage and helping people on benefits was creating a strong economic foundation Farmed out:Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey used his question to draw attention to farmers, whose state subsidies are being cut as production costs rise. The PM said he recognised the challenges farmers were facing and was championing the food export market Sir Keir Starmer accused Johnson of having his âhead in the sandâ The marked rise in inflation has been disconcerting to watch in recent months, as global economic shocks send living costs skyrocketing. As we've been reporting, Labour is calling for a one-offwindfall taxon oil and gas firms. They say a windfall tax would raise Â£1.2bn, but the government argues that such a tax could discourage crucial investments that would eventually bring down energy costs. But there are ways of counteracting inflation and helping households deal with the fallout, for example: Bank intervention By raising interest rates, the Bank of England can make borrowing more expensive - encouraging people to save instead of spend. So far, this hasn't reversed inflation, but central banks argue that without such measures, inflation would be rising faster. Direct support Governments can also give direct support to households by giving cash handouts, and placing caps on energy prices. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said âwe cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we canâ. Read more:When might the inflation rate come down? With prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, debt charities are warning there is an urgent need for extra support to help people struggling with the rising cost of living. StepChange Debt Charity says the surging cost of living is now the third most common reason people are giving for their debts. The charity's director of external affairs, Richard Lane, says there needs to be targeted support for those on low incomes, who rely on social security, or have vulnerabilities that mean they have specific needs and cannot cut their spending in areas such as food and energy. Michael Clarke, of Turn2us, says the increase in cost of living was going to ""plunge thousands more people into financial insecurity"", adding that intervention was ""urgently needed"" to catch people before they fall into crisis in the months to come. Jane Tully, director of external affairs and partnerships at the Money Advice Trust, says today's figures should ""raise the alarm"" on the need for support to help households that are struggling. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The raw headline
figures among the major economies now show the UK has the highest inflation in the G7. Now, it is important to note that this is just a single month and there are
important methodological differences in how inflation is calculated, especially
with the US. However, the comparison tells a broad story - for example, versus
France, where inflation is about half the level in UK. This is a direct result
of the French government forcing mainly state-owned energy companies to limit
electricity bill rises to single digits, rather close to the presidential
election. The shareholders of EDF paid the price.  It is well worth watching if the UK stays at the wrong end of this league table. The IMF recently predicted UK high inflation would linger for longer - over the course of next year being the highest in the G7 - and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. Many economists predicted that as a result of the post-Brexit end to free-flowing trade with the EU, and a shortage of European workers, that the UK would be more inflation-prone. So far the UK record has, more or less, moved in line with the rest of the world. The question is if this might be the start of a divergence. Student Kira Hayward has been telling us the practical things she's been doing to cope with rising prices, from batch- cooking to putting cash into a budget binder. The 19-year-old from Hull works part-time for a production company in Manchester but says rising food prices mean her money does not stretch as far. She said her shopping now costs Â£10 more per week. ""I used to shop every week, but I do it every 10 days or two weeks now, and at the cheaper places. And I try and get a big batch of chicken and freeze it all and make sure I split them up and make a batch meal like spaghetti bolognese. ""It is frustrating that even though I'm putting money aside I'm having to cap what I spend on everything."" Kira has started putting cash into plastic wallets labelled with what it is to be spent on. You can read more of people's spending solutionshere. It's not just Labour calling for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help with the cost of living. The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) - the UK's umbrella group for unions - also says it is urgently needed. A windfall tax is aone-off tax imposed by a government on a company or group of companies. ""With inflation so high, the crisis is cold, hard reality, and families are desperate for the government to help with an emergency budget"", said Frances O'Grady. ""The chancellor must step up with an emergency budget that helps families with a boost to Universal Credit and the minimum wage, and we urgently need a windfall tax on oil and gas to fund energy grants for struggling households."" This video can not be played PMQs: Starmer and Johnson on windfall tax on oil firms' excess profits During Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer questioned Boris Johnson's position on a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help fund extra support towards the cost of living. The Labour leader reiterated that he was in favour of the tax. In response, the prime minister did not give a direct answer on whether the government might implement the measure, and went on to accuse Labour of wanting to raise taxes. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The Labour leader, the SNP leader and the Lib Dem leader all got the opportunity to put questions to the Prime Minister this afternoon. They all raised, in one way or another, the cost of living. Itâs no secret that this is the key issue facing the government. And theyâve made clear that more help will be coming. And the prime minister stressed the help thatâs already out there, such as rises to the minimum wage. The potential interventions floating around government range from a windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, to making MOTs for cars less frequent. Boris Johnson faces pressure not just to act, but to do so in a way that makes a difference to those finding life most difficult. And thereâs only so long he can say more help is on the way, before he has to deliver. With that, Prime Minister's Questions has finished and MPs are leaving the chamber. A Home Office minister is answering questions now, but MPs will continue debating the Queen's Speech, which sets out the government legislative agenda, in a bit. Labour is planning to use the debate to put their call for an emergency budget to a vote. However the government has not backed the plan and it is unlikely to be supported by Conservative MPs either. We'll turn our focus back to the latest updates on inflation and the cost of living now, but you can continue to follow proceedings in Parliament onBBC iPlayer. And we'll bring you lines on that emergency budget call when it happens. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Energy bills push price rises to 40-year highUK inflation rises at its fastest rate for 40 years in the year to April, jumping to 9% from 7%.","Prices are rising at their fastest rate for 40 years as higher energy bills hit millions of households. UK inflation, the rate at which prices rise, jumped to 9% in the12 months to April, up from 7% in March.,external The surge came as millions of people saw an unprecedented Â£700-a-year increase in energy costs last month. Higher fuel and food prices, driven by the Ukraine war, are also pushing the cost of living up, with inflation expected to continue to rise this year. Citizens Advice said ""the warning lights could not be flashing brighter"" for the government to offer more support for households, and debt charities urged anyone finding it difficult to pay bills to seek help earlier rather than later in the year. Live updates: Inflation hits 9% as cost of living crisis deepens When might the inflation rate come down? Around three quarters of the rise in inflation in April came from higher electricity and gas bills, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). ""There are desperate stories behind these figures,"" said Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice. ""People washing in their kitchen sinks because they can't afford a hot shower; parents skipping meals to feed their kids; disabled people who can't afford to use vital equipment because of soaring energy bills."" Cheryl Holmes said there was not much more she could do to save money as her bills rose and salary stayed the same Health analyst Cheryl Holmes, a mother-of-two, said she was trying to keep her living costs down to ""as low as possible"" by spending less on food and clothes, and cancelling TV subscriptions. ""I've already for several years been turning the lights off in each room, setting the heating on a timer, making sure I'm using a full dishwasher and washing machine and I'm running out of ideas. ""It's a battle and it seems like there's not really much more that I can do."" UK inflation: 'I'm batch cooking and freezing food' A higher energy price cap - which is the maximum price per unit that suppliers can charge customers - kicked in last month, meaning homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying Â£1,971 per year on average. Up until now households of all incomes had faced similar rates of inflation, but the poorest are now being hit hardest by rising prices because they have to spend far more of their household budgets on gas and electricity, think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies said. The ONS, which publishes the UK's inflation rate, said the costs of food, machinery, furniture and other household goods also rose in April. ""All items"" on the menus of restaurants and cafes went up too, due to the VAT rate for hospitality returning to 20% after being cut during the pandemic to help businesses. Meanwhile, average petrol prices stood at Â£1.62 per litre in April 2022, the highest on record, compared with Â£1.26 per litre a year earlier. Why are prices rising so quickly? Recession fears grow as rising prices hit spending Inflation is the rate at which prices are rising. For example, if a bottle of milk costs Â£1 and that rises by 9p, then milk inflation is 9%. Prices have been rising for months, as fuel, energy and food prices surge higher due to the pandemic and the Ukraine war, andwages are failing to keep pace. The ONS estimated inflation is now at its highest level since March 1982, when it stood at 9.1%. The Bank of England warned earlier this month that the cost crunch could leave the UK on the brink of recession, with inflation peaking at over 10% later this year amid further expected rises in energy bills. UK inflation is simply not supposed to hit levels this high. And as the Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey has said, these sorts of rises hit the poorest the hardest. 9% is an average across the population. The older Retail Prices Index measure is already at 11%. But Mr Bailey's institution has a battle on now to get this under control. The really painful issue is that this rate will sustain and is on course to get higher over the course of this year. And only this week he acknowledged that there was ""not a lot"" the Bank could do about four-fifths of the anticipated rise, as it is being imported from globally rising prices for energy and food . Read morehere. With households under increasing pressure, the government faces growing calls to offer more help. Commenting on the latest figures, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he ""cannot protect people completely"" from rising inflation as it was a global problem. Mr Sunak is expected to call on businesses at the CBI's annual dinner later to boost investment and training in order to grow the economy and help ease the cost of living crunch. He will pledge that he will cut taxes on firms in the Autumn to ""invest more, train more, and innovate more"". Meanwhile, at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all the measures"" needed to help people struggling with rising bills. Sir Keir Starmer pressed the PM on Labour's call for a one-off tax on oil and gas profits, arguing it would raise ""billions"" to help. The PM replied that the government was ""not in principle in favour of higher taxation"". The rising cost of living is already seeing peoplespending less money and cutting down on car journeys due to high fuel costs. It's impacting the economy, which shrank in March and risks falling into recession next year, according to the Bank of England. The Bank's response has been to raise interest rates to try and cool prices. The idea is that when borrowing is more expensive, people will have less money to spend which dampens demand. However, it the Bank has faced criticism from MPs for not doing enough to tackle the crisis. This week Governor Andrew Bailey defended its response,insisting inflation was being driven by global forces that limited what the Bank could do. But UK now has the highest rate of inflation (9%) of any G7 country, including Germany (7.4%) and France (4.8%). Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said higher prices in the UK risked becoming embedded due to wages ""spiralling upwards"" as firms fought for talent. There are currently more job vacancies than unemployed people in the UK for the first time since records began, partly because many people dropped out of the labour market during the pandemic. Ms Streeter said prices across the hospitality and leisure industries were now at a 30-year high. ""So far companies have succeeded in passing on higher costs to customers keeping margins resilient, but worries do linger about just how long consumers will continue to pay the price,"" she added.

Stormont crisis 'will demoralise health staff',"John Compton, a former chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said the health minister was powerless A former health chief has warned that workers will feel ""demoralised, leaderless and disrespected"" without a functioning government. John Compton, former chief executive of the Health and Social Care Board, said it was ""disappointing and shocking"" that the system was in crisis again. He said staff needed encouragement as we emerged from the pandemic. Mr Compton also said the present health minister remained powerless to take major decisions. Speaking to BBC News NI, Mr Compton said: ""It requires political leadership, political accountability, clarity over the management of money and the strategic reshaping of services."" The Department of Health said it was committed to delivering change and added that ""standing still and accepting the status quo is not an option"". There is currently no power-sharing government in Northern Ireland after the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) said it would not go into the executive until there are significant changes to the Northern Ireland Protocol. How events at Stormont will pause political life Stormont paralysis puts patients at risk say health leaders Stormont crisis 'bursts balloon' of health progress Caretaker ministers, who were in post before the collapse of Stormont in February, can keep running their respective departments but no new decisions, such as agreeing a budget, can be taken. If subsequently the Northern Ireland Assembly is put into long-term cold storage, the system would be led by the permanent health secretary, Peter May, who would also become the chief executive of the health and social care system. According to Mr Compton, while anyone can take care of the system, what was needed was ""someone in charge and who has power to facilitate change"". Mr Compton left the health board in 2014 and was responsible for producing one of several health reports around reform called Transforming Your Care. Without a functioning executive, Northern Ireland will not obtain a multi-year budget which prevents reformation of services, changes to how hospitals deliver those services and any decisions around the workforce. This impacts actions to tackle hospital waiting lists - and there are questions being raised around accountability. The Department of Health told BBC News NI that the issues facing health and social care ""are well known and require sustained investment and reform"". ""Political and budgetary certainty are highly important when it comes to rebuilding services,"" the department said. The protection of health and social care featured on all political manifestos in the most recent election In March this year, the Health and Social Care Board closed. The board held the health purse strings, trusts would have gone to it to ask for money - money to pay wages, operations and medical equipment. It was held to account during monthly meetings by its board, other public bodies and via published minutes which could be read by journalists. Now the Department of Health takes the lead on the day-to-day running of the health service and the minister is ultimately responsible for everything. Ann Watt, director of the independent think tank Pivotal, said accountability was a big issue. ""There had been an expectation that if there was no executive there would be an assembly and the minister (for health) would therefore be held to account in the chamber and in committees,"" she said. ""Unfortunately that is not in place so accountability will have to be directly through the public, the media, through professional bodies and clinicians."" The Department of Health said that ""the former functions of HSCB (Health and Social Care Board) are now departmental responsibility and subject to departmental governance and accountability arrangements"". ""Following the closure of the board, the department is accountable to the minister for all of the functions delivered by the former board staff under the direction of the department."" It added that the delivery of functions is ""subject to the appropriate level of scrutiny"". Last week Northern Ireland's Health leaders called on assembly members to ""get back to work"" In the recent assembly election, the protection of health and social care featured on all political manifestos. When the public went to the polls, it was the expectation of most voters that a government would follow - but that has not happened. Pivotal's Ann Watt said not having a brand new government in place was ""unfair on voters and unfair on the people who are going to suffer most ie those on waiting lists, children who won't get free school meals and the most vulnerable"". Last week, Northern Ireland's health leaders called on the recently elected assembly members to ""get back to work"". While meeting the political parties on Monday, the prime minister repeated the call. The Royal College of Surgeon's Mark Taylor said we are already seeing the ""impact of a process that needs radically changed"". ""Is it acceptable to sit eight hours in the back of an ambulance? Is it acceptable to wait five years on your hip replacement? Is it acceptable to wait on a trolley for 24 - 48 hours? Is it acceptable to have a two-tier system of health in Northern Ireland - is it acceptable to keep kicking the can down the road? ""The answer is no."" In a statement, the Department of Health added: ""The Departmental Management Board includes two non-executive members appointed through the public appointments system and scrutiny includes the delivery of the functions transferred to the department. ""The department's Audit and Risk Assurance Committee was established to advise the accounting officer, through the departmental board, on the quality of assurances they receive about strategic processes for risk management, governance, internal control and the integrity of financial statements."" It said the committee comprises of two non-executives from the board and two independent external members. The committee's oversight ""extends to those former functions of the board which are now under the direction of the senior civil servant"".

Troubles bill 'removes opportunity for justice',"Legislation introduced to deal with legacy issues related to the Northern Ireland Troubles is a cause for ""serious concern"", Ireland's foreign affairs minister has said. The UK government bill involves immunity from prosecution for those who co-operate with investigations. It also prevents future inquests and civil actions related to the Troubles. Simon Coveney said the Irish government cannot support the bill ""in its current form"". Earlier, the commissioner for victims and survivors said the legislation would remove the opportunity for justice for some victims. Ian Jeffers said this was ""a very bitter pill to swallow"". ""Everybody recognises it's 40 years, it's 50 years, the chances of a conviction are very slim,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""But if you've lost your mother or your son are you going to genuinely give that up? ""I think that's the big issue we've got to talk through with victims and survivors over the coming weeks."" The 100-page Northern Ireland Troubles (Legacy and Reconciliation) Bill sets out investigations run by a new information recovery body. The Independent Commission for Reconciliation and Information Recovery (ICRIR) will be headed by a judicial figure appointed by the government and would be operational for five years. Simon Coveney said the Irish government could not support the proposals in their current form The panel within ICRIR will decide if a perpetrator qualifies for immunity. Civil claims which already existed on or before the day of the bill's introduction will be allowed to continue. Inquests which have reached substantive hearing stage a year after the bill, or by the time the ICRIR becomes operational, can also go ahead. What were the Troubles? Troubles legacy plan looks toward South Africa Sandra Peake, chief executive of victims' group Wave Trauma Centre, said the families of victims wanted fairness and equity. ""Ultimately what they want to know is that their loved one's life mattered and that there has been a full process to account for that,"" she told Good Morning Ulster. Speaking about the issue of immunity for perpetrators she said: ""Why is murder in relation to the Troubles different to murder undertaken in the streets of London? ""We have families who continue to be jeered at, sneered at and winked at by those responsible for their loved ones murders."" In a statement issued on Wednesday, Mr Coveney said: ""It is disappointing that the UK Government have chosen to unilaterally introduce legislation, when our starting point was the need for an agreement to be reached between both governments and the parties, and with the needs of victims and survivors at the heart of the process"". The minister said he had concerns about the powers of the commission, the status of 'reviews' proposed in the bill and its compliance with European Convention on Human Rights. ""We will continue to engage with the UK Government, at all levels, to better understand the provisions of this bill and the policy intent, but at this initial stage, I have serious concerns and cannot support it in its current form,"" he continued. Kenny Donaldson from Innocent Vicitims United Kenny Donaldson from Innocent Victims United, which represents 12,500 families in Northern Ireland, said victims and survivors are being asked to ""be party to the effective closing off of the past"". ""That is a huge ask for people who have already suffered so grievously,"" he added. Helen Deery, whose 15-year-old brother Manus was with a group of friends when he was shot in the head by a soldier from an observation post on Londonderry's walls in May 1972, said his death was still ""heartbreaking"". A coronerruled in 2017 that he was ""totally innocent"" and did not pose a threat to anyone. Helen Deery, whose brother Manus was shot and killed by a soldier in 1972, said the new law was disgusting ""I feel the exact same way today as the day he died. I won't rest until we get justice,"" she told BBC Radio Foyle. ""There is absolutely nothing in it (the bill) for victims."" Ms Deery added: ""We have never been consulted on anything. I think it is disgusting."" Veterans' Commissioner Danny Kinahan said he believed the legislation was ""a step in the right direction"". ""It is going to be difficult, we are never going to please everybody we have a system that doesn't work,"" he told Good Morning Ulster. ""We had to find a way where families and veterans' families are as important as everyone else and they want to know what happened. ""They also want a chance for justice."" Veterans' Commissioner Danny Kinahan said soldiers would want to give evidence to a new information recovery body Mr Kinahan said he was confident that soldiers ""want to come forward"" and provide information to the ICRIR. ""They want to show they did nothing wrong, they want to follow the rule of law, most importantly they want society to realise what they want through, what they did. ""They went out there, they stopped terrorism, they stopped a civil war and, in many cases, they find themselves being demonised. ""They want to go in there, give evidence, show they did nothing wrong.""

Post office scandal inquiry comes to Belfast,"This video can not be played A shop owner wrongly accused in the Post Office scandal describes frantic search for cash. A woman who was wrongly accused of taking Â£63,000 in a UK-wide post office scandal has described her frantic bid to pay money she did not owe. Sinead Rainey has given evidence toThe Post Office Horizon IT Inquirywhich is holding hearings in Belfast. The scandal saw more than700 people wrongly accused of theft, fraud and false accounting. It has been described as the most ""widespread miscarriage of justice in British legal history"". Between 2000 and 2014, a flaw in a newly installed computer system made it look like money was missing from post offices. It led to suspensions, termination of contracts, wrongful prosecutions and convictions. What is the Post Office Horizon saga all about? Convicted Post Office workers have names cleared Post Office scandal victims wait for compensation 'I did not steal Â£16,000 from Post Office' Ms Rainey, from Moneyglass, County Antrim, owned a Spar shop which had a post office in it, but she was not the sub-postmistress. She told the inquiry about the day post office auditors visited the store demanding that she repay discrepancies worth Â£63,000 within an hour. ""I drove home and I lifted a bucket in my house."" She said she emptied her children's money box into it and ""any money that I had in the house - 2ps, 5ps, everything"". Several family members helped her gather about Â£42,000 in the bucket. More than 700 post office employees were wrongly accused of crimes between 2000 and 2014 ""The auditors made me stand there and watch them count it. They tutted and made me feel so lousy for bringing them all of these pennies but I brought them whatever I could."" Ms Rainey also told the inquiry that relationships with close relatives have broken down. ""I don't go anywhere. I don't do anything,"" she said. ""I don't even visit my own mother and father-in-law because I feel like I let them down because I wrecked their son's life because of what happened to me. ""I will never be the person I was before."" Deirdre Connolly told the inquiry that post office officials used ""bully boy tactics"" toaccuse her in the wrong of fraud. She was removed from her post office at Killeter, County Tyrone, in 2010. She said she never received formal training when she took over the post office and the available helpline, which she phoned several times, did not understand her accent. Ms Connolly described how she was told to plead guilty and forced to repay a discrepancy of over Â£15,000 which she did not owe. Her family had to re-mortgage their home and were declared bankrupt. Deirdre Connolly says what happened cost her her livelihood, health and reputation ""Financially, we were ruined,"" she commented. In a meeting with a fraud investigator, Ms Connolly said she was asked if she took the money for paramilitary organisations. ""All I could think of is is this going to get out? Are they going to say that I've been taking money? I felt for the safety of my family,"" she said. She described how the action against her caused financial hardship and a mental health breakdown. ""My mental health will never be the same again. Constant tablets,"" she said. Heather Earley had to leave her post office in Newtownabbey in 2017 after the faulty computer system prompted discrepancies and authorised illegitimate payments to a customer. She said she was told she had to repay the money, but the post office refused to pay her back when the customer was arrested and plead guilty to the alleged crime. On a different occasion, Ms Earley was told her post office would be closed down if she did not pay back Â£112 of Christmas stamps which were missing. She told the inquiry she had to pay nearly Â£50,000 to keep her head above water. Heather Earley said her community suffered from the ordeal Heather said she was in ""a very dark place"" while dealing with the stress of the discrepancies. ""I was taking loans from family members and I had three credit cards maxed just to get stock for the shop,"" she said. ""It was horrendous what me and my family went through. ""My community suffered. They lost their post office and local shop that a lot of elderly people relied on."" In a concluding statement, the former sub-postmistress called for others to come forward and tell their story. Sinn FÃ©in vice-president Michelle O'Neill met with some of those affected by the scandal before proceedings started on Wednesday. She said they had suffered ""mental anguish"" and were speaking out to reclaim their voice and their reputation. ""These women have been wronged on every level and it's not just about an economic impact or a loss of finances or their business, it's about the loss of their reputation, it's been about the trauma they have experienced every day since these accusations happened, for some cases going back many many years,"" she added. ""It's been a massive miscarriage of justice and I am grateful to stand here with these fine women to be able to say they are going to have the opportunity to put right what has been wrong and everything that has been said wrong about them. This is their day."" The inquiry, under the chairmanship of retired high court judge Sir Wyn Williams, has invited evidence from former and current sub-postmasters and sub-postmistresses, their assistants, managers and family members who have been affected by the scandal. Some 19 post office workers in Northern Ireland were convicted, but it is believed there were more victims of the scandal who have not come forward. It is thought some people have been reluctant to do so because of the stigma of being accused in the wrong. Sir Wyn has already heard from victims in other parts of the UK and this is the final week of the human impact hearings. Hearings will also be held in Belfast on Thursday.

Covid-19 and the Ukraine war have also hit global supply chains Inflation is expected to continue to rise, and Citizens Advice has urged anyone finding it difficult to pay bills to seek help Edited by Emma Owen We're finishing our coverage of the rise in inflation now - thanks for joining us. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Jen Meierhans, Charley Adams, Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon and Doug Faulkner. The page was edited by Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien.  We'll be finishing up our live coverage of the rise in inflation and PMQs shortly. Here's a brief recap of what's happened:  If you'd like to delve deeper into the issue of inflation, you can find coverage, analysis and explainers on ourpoliticsandbusinesspages. And we'll leave you as we started, with this graph showing inflation rates over the years.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak issued a few words on inflation earlier today, saying the government ""stood ready to take further action"". This evening, he's due to speak at the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry, and is expected to warn that it will not be easy for the government to address the rising cost of living. According to extracts of his speech released in advance by the Treasury, Sunak will tell businesses that government plans to deliver tax cuts in the autumn budget should encourage them to ""invest more, train more, and innovate more"". Sunak will also say the government cannot make ""global forces disappear overnight"" and ""the next few months will be tough"". Reality Check Earlier today at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson told MPs: âIn July, we will have the biggest
tax cut for 10 years, Â£330 cuts for 30 million people who are paying national
insurance contributions.â The Â£330 cut he is talking about is because the point at which people
start paying National Insurance is rising from earnings of Â£9,570 to Â£12,570 a
year. The Treasury says this â along
with a plan to cut income tax in 2024 â will be the biggest tax âgiveawayâ
since 1995. But â if you look beyond these
measures - the reductions are actually smaller than the increases in taxes the
chancellor announced in the previous year. And the governmentâs independent
forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility says the overall tax burden is
going to rise from 33% of GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) in 2019-20
to 36.3% of GDP in 2026-27. This would be the highest since
the late 1940s. You can read more about it here.  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Younger people looking for even the smallest crumb of
comfort in todayâs figures can look to the cost of buying a home - even if the overall trend continues to be of properties becoming more expensive and out of reach for many. The price of the average home still rose by Â£24,000 in the
year to March - bringing it to Â£278,000, according to the Office for National
Statistics (ONS). However, the pace of increase is slowing. In March, the
annual increase was 9.8% compared with 11.3% in February. Thatâs still extremely high but forecasts suggest thathouse price growth will slow in the next year or two. The difficulty for many first-time buyers is that their
savings are being eaten away by inflation, rather than growing and ready to use as
a deposit when getting a mortgage. The chief secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said Rachel Reeves' speech âfailed to rise to the magnitude of the momentâ. As expected, he did not give his backing for Labour's call for an emergency budget. Instead, he said the government had âresponded quickly and comprehensively to the greatest challenge of our generationâ with what he said was a package of financial support. He said the government was creating the conditions for growth by investing in skills and infrastructure. Returning now to the Commons, where MPs have been concluding their debate on the government's Queen's Speech, and Labour has called for an emergency budget to address the rising cost of living. In a speech, Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves criticised the Conservative governmentâs handling of the economy, accusing ministers of failing businesses and consumers. She cited a survey by the Food Foundation think tank, which suggested two million people were skipping meals because they cannot afford to eat every day. âThis is not normal,â Reeves said. âIt is the consequence of Conservative government choices.â A retired couple have told us the rise in petrol prices and energy bills means they've had to cut down on how often they see their children and grandchildren. Mike Gibbons 75 and his wife Ev, 72, from Southampton have six daughters between them, and while hers live not too far away, his are in Newcastle-under-Lyme and Milton Keynes. Mrs Gibbons said: ""They only have little houses, so we can't stay so we have hotel bills and petrol on top of it. It's a bit of a killer at the moment so we are budgeting and we are not going so often."" Mr Gibbons said their energy bills had gone up by Â£88 a month after their provider PurePlanet went bust and they moved to Shell. He said each 450-500 mile trip to see his family in Newcastle-under-Lyme now cost Â£25 more in petrol. Mrs Gibbons said: ""It's making it more difficult to see our family on a regular basis because you just can't afford it any more - the money's not there.We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to."" We've just heard the British Chamber of Commerce talk of the possibility of a recession in the UK later this year - somethinganalysts last week warned aboutas well. So, what does a recession actually mean? Clothes, food, cars... we make and sell loads of things in the UK. The more we sell, the more money the country makes. When that happens, the economy grows. People, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services we produce - our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes, this falls instead, which means our economy is shrinking. If this happens for a period of six months in a row, then this is called a recession. When the economy shrinks, some people may lose their jobs, struggle to find new ones or find it harder to get promotions or pay rises. However, the impact of a recession is usually not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Could there be a recession soon? It's possible. The economy grew by 0.8% over the first three months of the year, but in March it shrank by 0.1% as people cut back due to rising prices. Speaking last week, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures ""suggest the economy had less momentum than we thought"" and that the risk of recession ""has just risen"". More reaction now to news today that UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in the12 months to April, up from 7% in March.,external The British Chamber of Commerce has described the rise as ""eye-watering"" and has warned there is a real chance of a recession by the third quarter of the year. The BCC's head of economics, Surenâ¯Thiru, said inflation may ""moderate a little over the summer"" but was likely to increase even further in October to above 10% when the energy price cap rises. He said a June interest rate rise was inevitable. ""However, higher interest rates will do little to address the global factors driving this inflationary surge and risks undermining confidence and aggravating the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses,"" he said. The BCC is calling for the government to reverse the rise in National Insurance contributions and cut VAT on business energy bills to 5%.,external A senior Conservative MP has backed a windfall tax on oil and gas giants - a move Labour has repeatedly called for - saying ""desperate times call for desperate measures"". Robert Halfon accused oil companies of ""ripping off"" customers by not passing on the 12-month fuel duty cut that came into effect in March, making life ""very difficult for millions of people across the country"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, the chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee suggested money raised from a windfall tax and from scrapping green levies, could be put towards a further rebate on people's energy bills. ""I reckon there are arguments on both sides on this in terms of employment and investment, I get it,"" he says. ""But I think desperate times call for desperate measures and we must do this, and we must do it quickly."" Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all measures in future"" when asked about a windfall tax on oil and gas companies MPs in the Commons are now debating the Queen's Speech, which was announced last week and sets out the government's agenda. In case you missed it, here's a quick recap of Prime Minister's Questions earlier, which was dominated by the rising cost of living: Taxing times:Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked the PM if he was for or against his party's plan for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Boris Johnson said ""in principle"" the government doesn't want to raise taxes Wind of change:Sir Keir predicted an ""inevitable"" U-turn on the proposed tax, saying oil and gas companies were making extra profits worth Â£32m a day. Johnson said he would ""look at all measures in future"" Boom or gloom:The Labour leader said Johnson was pretending the economy was booming, which showed the PM had his âhead in the sandâ. But Johnson said his government had got more people into work and that was the answer to stimulate the economy Call for support:In his final question, Sir Keir said working people felt abandoned by the government. In reply, the PM reminded him that investment in public services wouldnât be possible without a strong economy Poor punished:The SNP's Ian Blackford said under the Tories the ""poorest are punished the most"". Johnson disputed that and said raising the living wage and helping people on benefits was creating a strong economic foundation Farmed out:Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey used his question to draw attention to farmers, whose state subsidies are being cut as production costs rise. The PM said he recognised the challenges farmers were facing and was championing the food export market Sir Keir Starmer accused Johnson of having his âhead in the sandâ The marked rise in inflation has been disconcerting to watch in recent months, as global economic shocks send living costs skyrocketing. As we've been reporting, Labour is calling for a one-offwindfall taxon oil and gas firms. They say a windfall tax would raise Â£1.2bn, but the government argues that such a tax could discourage crucial investments that would eventually bring down energy costs. But there are ways of counteracting inflation and helping households deal with the fallout, for example: Bank intervention By raising interest rates, the Bank of England can make borrowing more expensive - encouraging people to save instead of spend. So far, this hasn't reversed inflation, but central banks argue that without such measures, inflation would be rising faster. Direct support Governments can also give direct support to households by giving cash handouts, and placing caps on energy prices. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said âwe cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we canâ. Read more:When might the inflation rate come down? With prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, debt charities are warning there is an urgent need for extra support to help people struggling with the rising cost of living. StepChange Debt Charity says the surging cost of living is now the third most common reason people are giving for their debts. The charity's director of external affairs, Richard Lane, says there needs to be targeted support for those on low incomes, who rely on social security, or have vulnerabilities that mean they have specific needs and cannot cut their spending in areas such as food and energy. Michael Clarke, of Turn2us, says the increase in cost of living was going to ""plunge thousands more people into financial insecurity"", adding that intervention was ""urgently needed"" to catch people before they fall into crisis in the months to come. Jane Tully, director of external affairs and partnerships at the Money Advice Trust, says today's figures should ""raise the alarm"" on the need for support to help households that are struggling. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The raw headline
figures among the major economies now show the UK has the highest inflation in the G7. Now, it is important to note that this is just a single month and there are
important methodological differences in how inflation is calculated, especially
with the US. However, the comparison tells a broad story - for example, versus
France, where inflation is about half the level in UK. This is a direct result
of the French government forcing mainly state-owned energy companies to limit
electricity bill rises to single digits, rather close to the presidential
election. The shareholders of EDF paid the price.  It is well worth watching if the UK stays at the wrong end of this league table. The IMF recently predicted UK high inflation would linger for longer - over the course of next year being the highest in the G7 - and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. Many economists predicted that as a result of the post-Brexit end to free-flowing trade with the EU, and a shortage of European workers, that the UK would be more inflation-prone. So far the UK record has, more or less, moved in line with the rest of the world. The question is if this might be the start of a divergence. Student Kira Hayward has been telling us the practical things she's been doing to cope with rising prices, from batch- cooking to putting cash into a budget binder. The 19-year-old from Hull works part-time for a production company in Manchester but says rising food prices mean her money does not stretch as far.

It's not just Labour calling for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help with the cost of living. The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) - the UK's umbrella group for unions - also says it is urgently needed. A windfall tax is aone-off tax imposed by a government on a company or group of companies. ""With inflation so high, the crisis is cold, hard reality, and families are desperate for the government to help with an emergency budget"", said Frances O'Grady. ""The chancellor must step up with an emergency budget that helps families with a boost to Universal Credit and the minimum wage, and we urgently need a windfall tax on oil and gas to fund energy grants for struggling households."" This video can not be played PMQs: Starmer and Johnson on windfall tax on oil firms' excess profits During Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer questioned Boris Johnson's position on a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help fund extra support towards the cost of living. The Labour leader reiterated that he was in favour of the tax. In response, the prime minister did not give a direct answer on whether the government might implement the measure, and went on to accuse Labour of wanting to raise taxes. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The Labour leader, the SNP leader and the Lib Dem leader all got the opportunity to put questions to the Prime Minister this afternoon. They all raised, in one way or another, the cost of living. Itâs no secret that this is the key issue facing the government. And theyâve made clear that more help will be coming. And the prime minister stressed the help thatâs already out there, such as rises to the minimum wage. The potential interventions floating around government range from a windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, to making MOTs for cars less frequent. Boris Johnson faces pressure not just to act, but to do so in a way that makes a difference to those finding life most difficult. And thereâs only so long he can say more help is on the way, before he has to deliver. With that, Prime Minister's Questions has finished and MPs are leaving the chamber. A Home Office minister is answering questions now, but MPs will continue debating the Queen's Speech, which sets out the government legislative agenda, in a bit. Labour is planning to use the debate to put their call for an emergency budget to a vote. However the government has not backed the plan and it is unlikely to be supported by Conservative MPs either. We'll turn our focus back to the latest updates on inflation and the cost of living now, but you can continue to follow proceedings in Parliament onBBC iPlayer. And we'll bring you lines on that emergency budget call when it happens. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Netflix cuts 150 jobs after losing subscribers,"Netflix has made about 150 staff redundant, a month after the streaming service said it was losing subscribers for the first time in a decade. The redundancies, announced by the entertainment giant on Tuesday, will mainly affect its US office in California. They account for about 2% of its North American workforce. Netflix said the job losses were due to the slump in the company's revenue. The streaming service is battling an exodus of viewers this year. ""These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance, which makes them especially tough as none of us want to say goodbye to such great colleagues,"" the company said in a statement. It wasn't disclosed which parts of the business would see job losses, but the Los Angeles Times reported that recruiting, communications and also the content department were all affected. Some people also disclosed their job loss online. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In April, the streaming giant shocked the industry when it revealed it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of 2022, and warned another two million were expected to quit in the coming quarter. The news sparked an investor sell-off, with the firm's stock plunging 35% in one day. It is now trading at $190 (Â£152), a 46% drop on its previous premium. Netflix shares plunge 35% after subscriber fall Have we had enough of Netflix? While Netflix has 220 million subscribers globally and remains the clear market leader, it has faced fierce competition in recent years with the arrival of competitor platforms such as Disney Plus, HBO, and Amazon's Prime Video. In its earnings report last month, the company also said the war in Ukraine and the decision to raise its prices in the US had cost it subscribers. Pulling out of the Russian market alone had cost the service 700,000 members, it revealed. Along with job losses, the company is also cutting content and pulling back on its own creations.Earlier in May it cancelled development of Pearl,an animated series created by Meghan Markle, in its move to cut costs. Some analysts say that after a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic, Netflix has run out of easy ways to grow the business. The company says it's looking at a cheaper, ad-based model and also planning oncracking down on password sharingwhich has cost it 100 million households. Netflix is not alone in making job cuts. In recent weeks, a slew of US tech companies from start-ups to big names such as Uber and Twitter have said they are slowing or freezing hiring, or, like online car sales firm Carvana, announced redundancies, citing a downturn.

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion. Ukrainian volunteers prepare to deliver food inside a complex set up as a shelter in Zaporizhzhya We've been reporting onthe growing food crisis in Ukraineand accusations thatRussia is using food as a weapon of war, including by blocking ports in Ukraine's Black Sea. Now, the UN Development Programme (UNDP) has warned that 90% of people within Ukraine could be pushed into poverty if Russia continues its assault. ""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"". The General Staff of the Ukrainian Armed Forces has published its evening update on Facebook. It says:  The BBC is not able to independently verify this information. This video can not be played Ukrainian soldiers blow up a bridge connecting cities in the Luhansk region Earlier on Thursday, Ukraine's National Guard released a video it said shows the destruction of a bridge connecting Sievierodonetsk to Rubizhne in the Luhansk region. The special operation between Ukraine's security forces aims to slow down the advance of Russian troops in the Luhansk region. The BBC has not been able to independently verify the images. We'll turn now to the besieged Azovstal steelworks in the city of Mariupol, where some Ukrainian fighters are still believed to be holed up - although it's unclear how many. The Deputy Commander of the Azov unit, Sviatoslav Palamar hasposted a video message on Telegram,,externalin which he says: âGlory to Ukraine! It is day 85 of the war. The leadership and I are on the premises of the Azovstal plant. There is a certain operation happening, details of which I am not going to share. I thank the whole world and Ukraine for the support. I will be seeing you.â It is not clear what the operation he refers to is. We will bring you more information if it becomes available.

For his part, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky welcomed the US funding package. In a tweet, he called the Senate's approval of the $40m boost ""a significant  contribution to the restoration of peace and security in Ukraine, Europe and the world"" and looked ahead to US President Joe Biden signing off the funds. His chief of staff, Andriy Yermak, said the package would help ensure Russia's defeat by Ukraine, adding: ""We are moving towards victory confidently and

The US Senate has approved nearly $40bn in aid for Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia invaded. It includes military, economic and humanitarian assistance, and was voted through with 86 in favour and 11 against. The bill aims to release an urgently-needed injection of funds. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin had previously warned that authorised funds for sending weapons to Ukraine would run out today, and the bill had been delayed in the Senate. The package includes: It goes next to President Biden to be signed into law. McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar. It comes as the UN warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could sooncause a global food crisis that may last for years. In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Inflation hits 9% as cost of living crisis deepens,"Boris Johnson tells Prime Minister's Questions he will ""look at all the measures"" needed to help people struggling with rising bills Sir Keir Starmer presses him on Labour's call for a one-off tax on oil and gas profits, arguing it would raise ""billions"" to help with energy bills But the PM replies ""this government is not in principle in favour of higher taxation"" Meanwhile, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford calls for an emergency budget The Commons debate comes as the UK's rate of inflation reaches 9% as prices rise at the highest rate for 40 years Soaring energy bills are the main driver, after the UK's energy price cap increased in April. Covid-19 and the Ukraine war have also hit global supply chains Inflation is expected to continue to rise, and Citizens Advice has urged anyone finding it difficult to pay bills to seek help Edited by Emma Owen We're finishing our coverage of the rise in inflation now - thanks for joining us. Today's writers were Natasha Preskey, Jen Meierhans, Charley Adams, Joshua Nevett, Paul Seddon and Doug Faulkner. The page was edited by Emma Owen, with help from Alex Therrien.  We'll be finishing up our live coverage of the rise in inflation and PMQs shortly. Here's a brief recap of what's happened:  If you'd like to delve deeper into the issue of inflation, you can find coverage, analysis and explainers on ourpoliticsandbusinesspages. And we'll leave you as we started, with this graph showing inflation rates over the years.  Chancellor Rishi Sunak issued a few words on inflation earlier today, saying the government ""stood ready to take further action"". This evening, he's due to speak at the annual dinner of the Confederation of British Industry, and is expected to warn that it will not be easy for the government to address the rising cost of living. According to extracts of his speech released in advance by the Treasury, Sunak will tell businesses that government plans to deliver tax cuts in the autumn budget should encourage them to ""invest more, train more, and innovate more"". Sunak will also say the government cannot make ""global forces disappear overnight"" and ""the next few months will be tough"". Reality Check Earlier today at Prime Minister's Questions, Boris Johnson told MPs: âIn July, we will have the biggest
tax cut for 10 years, Â£330 cuts for 30 million people who are paying national
insurance contributions.â The Â£330 cut he is talking about is because the point at which people
start paying National Insurance is rising from earnings of Â£9,570 to Â£12,570 a
year. The Treasury says this â along
with a plan to cut income tax in 2024 â will be the biggest tax âgiveawayâ
since 1995. But â if you look beyond these
measures - the reductions are actually smaller than the increases in taxes the
chancellor announced in the previous year. And the governmentâs independent
forecaster the Office for Budget Responsibility says the overall tax burden is
going to rise from 33% of GDP (a measure of the size of the economy) in 2019-20
to 36.3% of GDP in 2026-27. This would be the highest since
the late 1940s. You can read more about it here.  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent Younger people looking for even the smallest crumb of
comfort in todayâs figures can look to the cost of buying a home - even if the overall trend continues to be of properties becoming more expensive and out of reach for many. The price of the average home still rose by Â£24,000 in the
year to March - bringing it to Â£278,000, according to the Office for National
Statistics (ONS). However, the pace of increase is slowing. In March, the
annual increase was 9.8% compared with 11.3% in February. Thatâs still extremely high but forecasts suggest thathouse price growth will slow in the next year or two. The difficulty for many first-time buyers is that their
savings are being eaten away by inflation, rather than growing and ready to use as
a deposit when getting a mortgage. The chief secretary to the Treasury Simon Clarke said Rachel Reeves' speech âfailed to rise to the magnitude of the momentâ. As expected, he did not give his backing for Labour's call for an emergency budget. Instead, he said the government had âresponded quickly and comprehensively to the greatest challenge of our generationâ with what he said was a package of financial support. He said the government was creating the conditions for growth by investing in skills and infrastructure. Returning now to the Commons, where MPs have been concluding their debate on the government's Queen's Speech, and Labour has called for an emergency budget to address the rising cost of living. In a speech, Labour's Shadow Chancellor Rachel Reeves criticised the Conservative governmentâs handling of the economy, accusing ministers of failing businesses and consumers. She cited a survey by the Food Foundation think tank, which suggested two million people were skipping meals because they cannot afford to eat every day. âThis is not normal,â Reeves said. âIt is the consequence of Conservative government choices.â A retired couple have told us the rise in petrol prices and energy bills means they've had to cut down on how often they see their children and grandchildren. Mike Gibbons 75 and his wife Ev, 72, from Southampton have six daughters between them, and while hers live not too far away, his are in Newcastle-under-Lyme and Milton Keynes. Mrs Gibbons said: ""They only have little houses, so we can't stay so we have hotel bills and petrol on top of it. It's a bit of a killer at the moment so we are budgeting and we are not going so often."" Mr Gibbons said their energy bills had gone up by Â£88 a month after their provider PurePlanet went bust and they moved to Shell. He said each 450-500 mile trip to see his family in Newcastle-under-Lyme now cost Â£25 more in petrol. Mrs Gibbons said: ""It's making it more difficult to see our family on a regular basis because you just can't afford it any more - the money's not there.We just can't see our children as much as we'd like to."" We've just heard the British Chamber of Commerce talk of the possibility of a recession in the UK later this year - somethinganalysts last week warned aboutas well. So, what does a recession actually mean? Clothes, food, cars... we make and sell loads of things in the UK. The more we sell, the more money the country makes. When that happens, the economy grows. People, on average, become slightly richer as the value of the goods and services we produce - our Gross Domestic Product (GDP) - increases. But sometimes, this falls instead, which means our economy is shrinking. If this happens for a period of six months in a row, then this is called a recession. When the economy shrinks, some people may lose their jobs, struggle to find new ones or find it harder to get promotions or pay rises. However, the impact of a recession is usually not felt equally across society, and inequality can increase. Could there be a recession soon? It's possible. The economy grew by 0.8% over the first three months of the year, but in March it shrank by 0.1% as people cut back due to rising prices. Speaking last week, Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures ""suggest the economy had less momentum than we thought"" and that the risk of recession ""has just risen"". More reaction now to news today that UK inflation - the rate at which prices rise - jumped to 9% in the12 months to April, up from 7% in March.,external The British Chamber of Commerce has described the rise as ""eye-watering"" and has warned there is a real chance of a recession by the third quarter of the year. The BCC's head of economics, Surenâ¯Thiru, said inflation may ""moderate a little over the summer"" but was likely to increase even further in October to above 10% when the energy price cap rises. He said a June interest rate rise was inevitable. ""However, higher interest rates will do little to address the global factors driving this inflationary surge and risks undermining confidence and aggravating the financial squeeze on consumers and businesses,"" he said. The BCC is calling for the government to reverse the rise in National Insurance contributions and cut VAT on business energy bills to 5%.,external A senior Conservative MP has backed a windfall tax on oil and gas giants - a move Labour has repeatedly called for - saying ""desperate times call for desperate measures"". Robert Halfon accused oil companies of ""ripping off"" customers by not passing on the 12-month fuel duty cut that came into effect in March, making life ""very difficult for millions of people across the country"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, the chairman of the Commons Education Select Committee suggested money raised from a windfall tax and from scrapping green levies, could be put towards a further rebate on people's energy bills. ""I reckon there are arguments on both sides on this in terms of employment and investment, I get it,"" he says. ""But I think desperate times call for desperate measures and we must do this, and we must do it quickly."" Boris Johnson said he would ""look at all measures in future"" when asked about a windfall tax on oil and gas companies MPs in the Commons are now debating the Queen's Speech, which was announced last week and sets out the government's agenda. In case you missed it, here's a quick recap of Prime Minister's Questions earlier, which was dominated by the rising cost of living: Taxing times:Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer asked the PM if he was for or against his party's plan for a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies. Boris Johnson said ""in principle"" the government doesn't want to raise taxes Wind of change:Sir Keir predicted an ""inevitable"" U-turn on the proposed tax, saying oil and gas companies were making extra profits worth Â£32m a day. Johnson said he would ""look at all measures in future"" Boom or gloom:The Labour leader said Johnson was pretending the economy was booming, which showed the PM had his âhead in the sandâ. But Johnson said his government had got more people into work and that was the answer to stimulate the economy Call for support:In his final question, Sir Keir said working people felt abandoned by the government. In reply, the PM reminded him that investment in public services wouldnât be possible without a strong economy Poor punished:The SNP's Ian Blackford said under the Tories the ""poorest are punished the most"". Johnson disputed that and said raising the living wage and helping people on benefits was creating a strong economic foundation Farmed out:Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey used his question to draw attention to farmers, whose state subsidies are being cut as production costs rise. The PM said he recognised the challenges farmers were facing and was championing the food export market Sir Keir Starmer accused Johnson of having his âhead in the sandâ The marked rise in inflation has been disconcerting to watch in recent months, as global economic shocks send living costs skyrocketing. As we've been reporting, Labour is calling for a one-offwindfall taxon oil and gas firms. They say a windfall tax would raise Â£1.2bn, but the government argues that such a tax could discourage crucial investments that would eventually bring down energy costs. But there are ways of counteracting inflation and helping households deal with the fallout, for example: Bank intervention By raising interest rates, the Bank of England can make borrowing more expensive - encouraging people to save instead of spend. So far, this hasn't reversed inflation, but central banks argue that without such measures, inflation would be rising faster. Direct support Governments can also give direct support to households by giving cash handouts, and placing caps on energy prices. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, has said âwe cannot protect people completely from these global challenges but are providing significant support where we canâ. Read more:When might the inflation rate come down? With prices rising at their fastest rate for 40 years, debt charities are warning there is an urgent need for extra support to help people struggling with the rising cost of living. StepChange Debt Charity says the surging cost of living is now the third most common reason people are giving for their debts. The charity's director of external affairs, Richard Lane, says there needs to be targeted support for those on low incomes, who rely on social security, or have vulnerabilities that mean they have specific needs and cannot cut their spending in areas such as food and energy. Michael Clarke, of Turn2us, says the increase in cost of living was going to ""plunge thousands more people into financial insecurity"", adding that intervention was ""urgently needed"" to catch people before they fall into crisis in the months to come. Jane Tully, director of external affairs and partnerships at the Money Advice Trust, says today's figures should ""raise the alarm"" on the need for support to help households that are struggling. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor The raw headline
figures among the major economies now show the UK has the highest inflation in the G7. Now, it is important to note that this is just a single month and there are
important methodological differences in how inflation is calculated, especially
with the US. However, the comparison tells a broad story - for example, versus
France, where inflation is about half the level in UK. This is a direct result
of the French government forcing mainly state-owned energy companies to limit
electricity bill rises to single digits, rather close to the presidential
election. The shareholders of EDF paid the price.  It is well worth watching if the UK stays at the wrong end of this league table. The IMF recently predicted UK high inflation would linger for longer - over the course of next year being the highest in the G7 - and higher than all EU members, and only exceeded in the G20 by crisis-ridden Argentina, Turkey and Russia. Many economists predicted that as a result of the post-Brexit end to free-flowing trade with the EU, and a shortage of European workers, that the UK would be more inflation-prone. So far the UK record has, more or less, moved in line with the rest of the world. The question is if this might be the start of a divergence. Student Kira Hayward has been telling us the practical things she's been doing to cope with rising prices, from batch- cooking to putting cash into a budget binder. The 19-year-old from Hull works part-time for a production company in Manchester but says rising food prices mean her money does not stretch as far. She said her shopping now costs Â£10 more per week. ""I used to shop every week, but I do it every 10 days or two weeks now, and at the cheaper places. And I try and get a big batch of chicken and freeze it all and make sure I split them up and make a batch meal like spaghetti bolognese. ""It is frustrating that even though I'm putting money aside I'm having to cap what I spend on everything."" Kira has started putting cash into plastic wallets labelled with what it is to be spent on. You can read more of people's spending solutionshere. It's not just Labour calling for a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help with the cost of living. The general secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) - the UK's umbrella group for unions - also says it is urgently needed. A windfall tax is aone-off tax imposed by a government on a company or group of companies. ""With inflation so high, the crisis is cold, hard reality, and families are desperate for the government to help with an emergency budget"", said Frances O'Grady. ""The chancellor must step up with an emergency budget that helps families with a boost to Universal Credit and the minimum wage, and we urgently need a windfall tax on oil and gas to fund energy grants for struggling households."" This video can not be played PMQs: Starmer and Johnson on windfall tax on oil firms' excess profits During Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer questioned Boris Johnson's position on a windfall tax on oil and gas companies to help fund extra support towards the cost of living. The Labour leader reiterated that he was in favour of the tax. In response, the prime minister did not give a direct answer on whether the government might implement the measure, and went on to accuse Labour of wanting to raise taxes. David Wallace LockhartBBC political correspondent The Labour leader, the SNP leader and the Lib Dem leader all got the opportunity to put questions to the Prime Minister this afternoon. They all raised, in one way or another, the cost of living. Itâs no secret that this is the key issue facing the government. And theyâve made clear that more help will be coming. And the prime minister stressed the help thatâs already out there, such as rises to the minimum wage. The potential interventions floating around government range from a windfall tax on record oil and gas profits, to making MOTs for cars less frequent. Boris Johnson faces pressure not just to act, but to do so in a way that makes a difference to those finding life most difficult. And thereâs only so long he can say more help is on the way, before he has to deliver. With that, Prime Minister's Questions has finished and MPs are leaving the chamber. A Home Office minister is answering questions now, but MPs will continue debating the Queen's Speech, which sets out the government legislative agenda, in a bit. Labour is planning to use the debate to put their call for an emergency budget to a vote. However the government has not backed the plan and it is unlikely to be supported by Conservative MPs either. We'll turn our focus back to the latest updates on inflation and the cost of living now, but you can continue to follow proceedings in Parliament onBBC iPlayer. And we'll bring you lines on that emergency budget call when it happens. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Nomia IqbalBBC News In a country where US lawmakers don't usually agree on much, helping Ukraine has become a rare area of bipartisan agreement. Most Democrats and Republicans have come together to help the embattled country and this latest package, worth nearly $40bn, was backed by 86 out of 100 senators in both parties. This round of aid is a mixture of military, economic and humanitarian assistance. It includes more weapons, a fund to help Ukraine's government function and cash to stop the disruption to the global food chain as a result of the war. It's the biggest aid package so far and brings the total American investment in the warto roughly $54 billion in just over two months. This bipartisan moment may not last though. The Republicans who did oppose the package said they are concerned about continuously sending huge amounts of money abroad for an ongoing conflict, especially whilst Americans are struggling with economic challenges at home. President Biden is expected quickly to sign it into law - he and Ukrainian leaders pushed hard for its approval over fears aid would run out by the end of the week. More now on the $40bn aid package that the US Senate has approved to send to Ukraine - the largest aid package since Russia began its war. US President Joe Biden applauded members for sending ""a clear bipartisan message to the world"" that the people of the United States ""stand together with the brave people of Ukraine as they defend their democracy and freedom"". Biden said the resources he requested will allow the US to send more weapons and ammunition to Ukraine, replenish its own stockpile, and support US troops stationed on Nato territory. ""Together with the contributions of our allies and partners, we will keep security, economic, food, and humanitarian assistance flowing to Ukraine, across the region, and around the world, and further strengthen Ukraine - both on the battlefield and at the negotiating table."" Biden also signed off on $100 million of military aid to Ukraine, including additional artillery munitions and
counter artillery battery radars, the latest in a series of
transfers to help Kyiv repel Russia's invasion.

""We're talking about nine out of 10 Ukrainians falling into poverty if this war continues until the end of the year,"" UNDP deputy representative in Ukraine, Manal Fouani, says. She says this is a ""shocking number"", given the poverty rate in the country was just 2.5% just before the war started. Fouani said that 18 years of development gains could be lost by the end of the year  - the ""investments of the European Union and of all of the donors and the development partners in this country over the past 20 years"".

McDonald's has found a local buyer for its Russian business, following its decision to end operating in the country over the war. Alexander Govor - who currently operates 25 McDonald's restaurants in Siberia - is set to take on the firm's  62,000 staff and operate its 850 businesses under a new brand. McDonald's did not disclose the sale price, but warns investors it expects to lose more than $1bn (Â£800m)  from the exit. Under the terms of the deal, the fast food giant's workers in Russia will be kept on their existing pay for at least two years, while Govor will pay the salaries of corporate staff until the deal is completed. McDonald's says it will retain its trademark in the country, but the restaurants will be stripped of their menu, logo and other branding. Read more about the dealhere. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is using food as a weapon to break the spirit of the Ukrainian people, adding the blame for the food crisis clearly lies with Moscow. ""The Russian Federation claims falsely that the international community's sanctions are to blame for worsening the global food crisis. Sanctions aren't blocking Black Sea ports, trapping ships filled with food, and destroying Ukrainian roads and railways - Russia is,"" Blinken told a UN Security Council meeting. It comes as the Russian foreign ministry says it will only consider allowing access to Ukraine's Black Sea ports if the lifting of international sanctions against Russia is also considered. Blinken says the UN Security Council has a ""unique responsibility to address the current crisis"" and called on UN countries to put pressure on Russia to stop weaponizing food. ""Stop blockading the ports in the Black Sea and the sea of Azov, allow for the free flow of ships and trains and trucks carrying food out of Ukraine; stop preventing food and other life-saving supplies from reaching civilians in besieged Ukrainian towns and cities; stop threatening to withhold food and fertiliser exports from countries that criticise your war of aggression,"" Blinken said. The head of the UN World Food Programme, David Beasley, earlier appealed to President Putin to end Moscow's blockade of the ports to allow the export of wheat and other vital food products. Russian deputy foreign minister, Andrei Rudenko, says US and EU sanctions have helped to cause the current food crisis, Russia's Interfax news agency reports. It is hard to believe Ukraine needs help with a growing food crisis, given the country's role in feeding the world before the war, the United Nations says. Manal Fouani, a representative to Ukraine from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), tells the BBC that 90% of Ukrainians will fall into poverty by the end of the year if the conflict continues. Ukraine has a population of nearly 45 million, with 15 million people currently refugees or internally displaced within the country. Fouani says: ""It sounds difficult to believe that we need to feed Ukrainians, while Ukrainians feed the world."" She adds it is ""heartbreaking"" that grain silos in Ukraine are full because it is too difficult to export, so if farmers cultivate and harvest more crops there is no space to store them. Read more about UN warnings of a possible global food crisishere. The two leaders held talks in Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, in April UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky today to discuss opening ""critical"" sea and land supply routes for grain exports, after Russia's invasion caused supplies to be cut off, reducing the global supply and causing the price of alternatives to soar.

In a tweet, Johnson said he blamed Russian President Vladimir Putin's ""reckless blockade of Black Sea ports""for causing global economic damage.,external Zelensky said the pair also discussed ""the operation to rescue military from Azovstal"" and ""ways to export agricultural products"" and import fuel to Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraineâs foreign minister, Dmytro Kuleba, also said hespoke with his British counterpart, Liz Truss,external, about how to âhold Russia accountable for its aggression and unblock Ukraineâs food exportsâ. ""Russia bears full responsibility not only for killing, torturing, and raping Ukrainians, but also for starving people across the world, including in Africa,"" Kuleba said in a tweet. A Ukrainian soldier displays an anti-drone rifle in Kyiv. Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

Vitaly ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Vadim Shishimarin, aged 21, has admitted killing 62-year-old civilian Oleksandr Shelipov One court case has been the focus of much of our coverage today - and there's been a near-total blackout in state-controlled Russian media on the war crimes trial of Russian soldier Vadim Shishimarin in Kyiv. BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT.

Returning now to the situation on the ground in Ukraine, 12 people have been killed in Ukrainian-controlled Severodonetsk after Russian shelling, the head of the eastern Luhansk Regional Military Administration has said on Telegram. Serhiy Hayday says more than 40 people who were injured in the attacks are receiving medical treatment - and there has been significant destruction leading to power cuts. Among the victims are two women found dead in a flat hit by a missile, he says in his post.

Russia claims to have destroyed a drone using a laser Russia claims to have used laser weapons on the battlefield in Ukraine, although the US says it has seen no evidence of this and Ukraine has derided it as propaganda. Yury Borisov, the deputy prime minister in charge of military development, told Russian TV that a laser prototype called Zadira was being deployed in Ukraine and had burned up a Ukrainian drone within five seconds at a distance of 5km (three miles). However, an official with the US Department of Defense said he had not seen ""anything to corroborate reports of lasers being used"" in Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has mocked the Russian claim, comparing it to the so-called ""wonder weapons"" that Nazi Germany claimed to be developing during World War Two.

BBC Monitoring has not observed any mentions of him on key TV channels, while there has been prominent reporting of the trial by independent Russian media, which is now operating from abroad. In a rare online report about Shishimarin, Kremlin-run broadcaster RT (also known as Russia Today)quoted his father,externalas doubting that he will get a fair hearing in Ukraine. ""What's that trial for? To prove him guilty,"" Yevgeny Shishimarin told RT. Asked about Shishimarin at a news briefing on 18 May, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskovsaid he did not have enough information,externalabout the soldier captured by Ukraine.

Fuel poverty scheme failed in many ways - inquiry,"The cost of heating our homes is putting huge pressure on household budgets A scheme to cut the energy bills of people in fuel poverty in Wales has failed to reach many of those now needing help, politicians have said. A Senedd inquiry report said theWarm Homes Programme,externallacked the ""scale, size and purpose"" to meet people's needs. Labour's Jenny Rathbone, who led the inquiry, called the programme ""in many ways a failure"", as ministers warned45% of Wales' households,externalcould be in fuel poverty by the winter. Welsh ministers welcomed the report. The Welsh government defines fuel poverty as when people have to spend more than 10% of their income to heat their home properly. Energy bills push price rises to 40-year high How high could my energy bills go? Energy bills shake-up plans to avoid price shocks Household budgets are facing huge pressure with rising inflation and hikes in energy prices a major factor. UK inflation, the rate at which prices are rising, jumped to 9% in the 12 months to April, up from 7% in March -the highest rate for 40 years- and is expected to continue to rise this year. Last month, typical energy bills in Britain rose from Â£1,277 to Â£1,971, afterregulator Ofgem raised the price capand are forecast to jump a further 32% when the cap goes up again in October. Michelle Hopkins says she knows ""it's going to get worse"" Michelle Hopkins, from Swansea, is a full time carer for her husband Stephen, who is bipolar, and she shared her experiences as part of the evidence the committee considered. She is on a pre-payment meter and said the family's energy bills have doubled. ""We're spending about Â£15 on the electric every week and, depending on the weather, Â£20 to Â£25 on the gas,"" she said. ""At the moment we are surviving. ""I do big clothes washes overnight, because from what I understand it's lower tariffs. And depending whether it's sunny, I take them to the laundrette. But that's gone up as well."" Michelle said her family tried to stay cheerful and not worry about even bigger energy bills in the autumn. ""I can't worry about it. I can't let myself slip into that darkness really because I've got to try to make ends meet and I know it's going to get worse."" Carol Beaumont, 75, said she isn't enjoying life like she used to due to rising costs Carol Beaumont, 75, from Newport, has seen her monthly energy and water bills rise by Â£71. She says the rising cost of food, energy and fuel means she's no longer enjoying life like she used to. She says her social life is ""non-existent"", and has had to completely change the way she lives due to rising costs. ""In this day and age I think it's disgraceful that politicians are letting us live like this because it's not getting any better it's getting worse,"" she said. ""I don't put my heating on, that uses the gas. I try not to cook too much on the stove, I can just put it in the microwave, so I am changing the way I'm doing things."" ""In the shower I'm in, run the water round me twice, and I'm out, because that takes a lot of electric,"" Carol added. ""You live your life differently even just to three months ago. You're conscious of what you're spending and I've never had to live like that ""I used to enjoy going to the shops, having a look to see if there was anything there, a new blouse of a new pair of shoes. I haven't looked since these increases have come in. I can't afford it so I don't look."" The Warm Homes Programme was created in 2011 to help people owning their home or living in private rented accommodation who are in fuel poverty or at risk of being so by installing free energy efficiency measures. It was made up of two schemes: Nest, which households across Wales could apply for and continues until March Arbed, for targeted geographical areas, which ended in November The Senedd's Equality and Social Justice Committee report, published on Wednesday, said the schemes were designed to offer systems such as boilers and solar panels as well as insulation and energy efficient lighting. But the committee said installing fossil fuel systems was overwhelmingly prioritised over measures such as insulation. CharityCare and Repair Cymru,externaltold the committee: ""Simply replacing faulty boilers does not mean that a household will no longer struggle with fuel poverty if heat is still escaping from their properties and their energy bills remain high because of it."" The report called for a much greener approach to address climate change as ministers consider the next programme. Jenny Rathbone says the next programme must be better at reaching those in greatest need The report describes the schemes' eligibility criteria as ""deficient, too restrictive and a poor indicator of being fuel poor, meaning that the programme did not always target the right people"". ""This is likely to have left a number of fuel poor households ineligible for support."" The exclusion of properties with anEnergy Performance Certificate,externalrating of D is also criticised as they are thought to make up 50% of all fuel-poor households. The report questioned the fairness of banning businesses of any size which happen to be operating from a domestic property from being eligible. However, the reports said the Warm Homes Programme ""undoubtedly made a lasting and positive difference to the lives of participants in the scheme"" with about 67,000 homes now warmer and more energy efficient. Jenny Rathbone, the Labour chairwoman of the committee, said the programme had ""admirable aims"" but the report showed it had been ""in many ways a failure"". ""The evidence shows the support this programme provided did not reach many people who now desperately need this help."" She said the next programme should be bigger, be better at targeting those in greatest need and ""aim to be greener"". Janet Finch-Saunders, who speaks for the Welsh Conservatives on climate change, said the inquiry's verdict was ""disappointing but not surprising"", and called for ""more direct action"" from ministers. ""Labour's policies have continued to be out of touch with the needs of the people of Wales and its poor record on addressing fuel poverty speaks for itself,"" she added. The Welsh government said: ""Since October, we have invested more than Â£380m in support for lower income households to help them with this unprecedented energy and cost-of-living crisis. ""We will consider the committee's recommendations as we refine our policy proposals to tackle fuel poverty and decarbonise homes following the consultation on the next iteration of the Warm Homes Programme.""

Netflix cuts 150 jobs after losing subscribersThe US streaming giant is forced to lay off staff to minimise cost of viewers quitting the service.Business,"Netflix has made about 150 staff redundant, a month after the streaming service said it was losing subscribers for the first time in a decade. The redundancies, announced by the entertainment giant on Tuesday, will mainly affect its US office in California. They account for about 2% of its North American workforce. Netflix said the job losses were due to the slump in the company's revenue. The streaming service is battling an exodus of viewers this year. ""These changes are primarily driven by business needs rather than individual performance, which makes them especially tough as none of us want to say goodbye to such great colleagues,"" the company said in a statement. It wasn't disclosed which parts of the business would see job losses, but the Los Angeles Times reported that recruiting, communications and also the content department were all affected. Some people also disclosed their job loss online. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In April, the streaming giant shocked the industry when it revealed it had lost 200,000 subscribers in the first three months of 2022, and warned another two million were expected to quit in the coming quarter. The news sparked an investor sell-off, with the firm's stock plunging 35% in one day. It is now trading at $190 (Â£152), a 46% drop on its previous premium. Netflix shares plunge 35% after subscriber fall Have we had enough of Netflix? While Netflix has 220 million subscribers globally and remains the clear market leader, it has faced fierce competition in recent years with the arrival of competitor platforms such as Disney Plus, HBO, and Amazon's Prime Video. In its earnings report last month, the company also said the war in Ukraine and the decision to raise its prices in the US had cost it subscribers. Pulling out of the Russian market alone had cost the service 700,000 members, it revealed. Along with job losses, the company is also cutting content and pulling back on its own creations.Earlier in May it cancelled development of Pearl,an animated series created by Meghan Markle, in its move to cut costs. Some analysts say that after a surge in sign-ups during the pandemic, Netflix has run out of easy ways to grow the business. The company says it's looking at a cheaper, ad-based model and also planning oncracking down on password sharingwhich has cost it 100 million households. Netflix is not alone in making job cuts. In recent weeks, a slew of US tech companies from start-ups to big names such as Uber and Twitter have said they are slowing or freezing hiring, or, like online car sales firm Carvana, announced redundancies, citing a downturn.

"'Worrying' messages to war refugee seeking safetyStudent's host says many young Ukrainian women are offered rooms ""with basically sex as payment"".Wales","This video can not be played Ukraine war: 'My previous life was stolen,' says refugee When Alina started checking Beth's Instagram, there was far more at stake than seeing what she was wearing, or which restaurants she'd visited. For the student fleeing Odesa in Ukraine it presented vital information on whether she could trust a stranger. After registering with websites linking Ukrainians with UK hosts, the 21-year-old noticed ""a lot of people"" looking to ""take advantage of refugees"". More than 87,000 people from Ukraine have applied to the sponsorship scheme. It requires the support of a host in the UK. Wales refugee family thwarted by paperwork Granddaughter, daughter and dog rescued Along with plenty of presumably genuine messages from well-meaning families, Alina, a linguistics student, also began to receive ""worrying"" messages sent directly to her email and WhatsApp. ""I was faced with a lot of people who wanted to take advantage of me,"" explained Alina, who woke to the sound of bombing near her university halls on the first day of the Russian invasion. ""I got a couple of messages that made me feel not very comfortable and I got a couple of messages saying 'we can hire you as a babysitter or to walk the dogs'. It made me really suspicious. ""I'm a refugee, I need a safe place to stay - I'm not looking for money or for a job."" Hundreds of miles away in Cardiff, prospective host Beth was having similar concerns. The 33-year-old hoped the spare room in her flat in the Welsh capital could offer safety to someone who needed it, but worried that refugees and hosts were expected to help match themselves under the UK government scheme. Some online investigating reassured Alina her host was sincere ""I didn't feel comfortable choosing someone to live with me through Facebook,"" she explained. ""It felt like a meat market. There were loads of other families advertising themselves. It was like open season for traffickers, I wanted to keep myself and whoever I was hosting safe. ""I heard there were a lot of people, girls, who were being offered room with basically sex as payment. ""It meant that when I was offering a room it felt like it was on me to prove I would provide a safe space."" When Beth, a biomedical scientist and Brownie leader, matched with Alina, she immediately sent her a link to her Instagram. She said it was one of the easiest ways she could think of to help Alina trust her. Alina relaxes at home with Beth's cat Barry Beth's first message also included her Disclosure and Barring Service (DBS) check from Brownies - and explicit confirmation that she was offering the room ""for free"". In other words, nothing would be expected of Alina. ""It was a huge letter through WhatsApp,"" remembers Alina. ""The thing that I liked was that she described all her safety checks. Her letter made me feel really comfortable. She was a real person. I thought, 'I feel safe with this girl'."" Millions of people have fled Ukraine since the start of the war Home Office data suggests more than 46,000 Ukrainian refugees have already travelled to the UK under family and sponsorship schemes. There have been more than 45,000 applications for visas under the Ukraine Family Scheme and almost 90,000 applications for visas under the sponsorship scheme which Alina travelled on. TheUkraine Sponsorship Scheme,externalallows Ukrainians and their family members to come to the UK if they can find a named host who will be providing accommodation for them. Data from the Office for National Statistics has suggested only 2% of the UK's Ukrainian refugees are living in Wales, despite an offer from the Welsh government to act as a host itself - and supply up to 1,000 people with accommodation. Figures suggest there are more than 1,100 Ukrainian refugees staying in Wales, but just 184 of them have come under Welsh government sponsorship. A Welsh government spokesman said UK-wide delays processing visas had meant a ""significant lag"" in the recorded data. Alina with her mum and Beth, after they arrived in the UK After spending some time Googling each other, messages between Alina and Beth ""started flying"". ""I was very insistent on her mum being there for the first video call,"" said Beth. ""I knew that my mum would be absolutely terrified if things were the other way around - so I wanted to provide that reassurance. ""I was showing views out my window, this is Cardiff, this is where I live, this is somewhere safe."" Alina's mum also travelled to the UK, but her host family are in Yorkshire. When their flight arrived at Heathrow Airport earlier this month, it was Beth who went to pick them up, complete with a selection of biscuits and crisps in case they were hungry. ""I was so nervous, but when we met Beth she was so nice, she was worrying about us and all my anxiety just went,"" said Alina, who still thinks more should be done to help refugees know potential hosts are ""safe"". ""The main thing is to choose your host carefully and to listen to your heart and your brain,"" she said. ""I need to build a new life, my previous life was stolen. I still have hopes I will be able to come back to Ukraine. ""But life is still going on and I have a lot of plans, I want to finish university and then I want to find work - and meet new people and just live."" Beth meanwhile - who used episodes of BBC comedy Gavin and Stacey to help Alina settle into Welsh life during her first night - has promised that she can stay rent-free for a year. ""If she wants to stay on after a year, I'm fully supportive but we'd have to have the rent conversation, I can't see me charging her too much though,"" she smiled. ""If she wants to move out before or after a year, I'm fully behind that too. She'll have my support no matter what."" A UK government spokesman said: ""The Homes for Ukraine scheme has stringent safeguarding measures in place, and the Home Office conducts security and background checks on all sponsors before visas are issued. Councils also conduct checks and must make at least one in-person visit to a sponsor's property. ""We have published a list of recognised providers and new guidance for voluntary and community sector organisations interested in developing a matching service to help more people from Ukraine find safe and sustainable matches with sponsors in the UK.""

"Truss sets out new law on Northern Ireland trade dealThe foreign secretary says the proposed legislation would resolve the ""grave situation"".UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Liz Truss says the UK government wants a negotiated settlement with the EU Liz Truss has said a new law would be introduced to change the post-Brexit trade deal for Northern Ireland. The foreign secretary insisted the bill would be legal under international law. Boris Johnson's government agreed the trade deal - which governs how goods enter Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK - with the European Union in 2019 after the Brexit vote. But a row over its impact on trade has created a block on forming a devolved government in Northern Ireland. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) has refused to join the power-sharing administration until reforms are made to the deal, which it says treats Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. In Parliament, Ms Truss said the proposed law would not scrap the deal but make limited changes, such as freeing the movement of UK-made goods from ""unnecessary bureaucracy"" and regulatory barriers. But in response to Ms Truss's statement, the EU said it would ""need to respond with all measures at its disposal"" if the UK went ahead with the legislation. Ireland's foreign affairs minister, Simon Coveney, said the unilateral action from the UK was ""damaging to trust"". What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Brexit and Northern Ireland: What does each side want? Fact-checking claims about Brexit and Northern Ireland And Labour said the government should abide by the deal it signed, and work with the EU ""to find practical solutions to these problems"" rather than altering the deal unilaterally. The deal - known as the protocol - is a special arrangement that keeps Northern Ireland aligned with the EU single market for goods, avoiding a hard border with the Republic of Ireland. The arrangement ensured free trade could continue across the Irish land border, which is a sensitive issue because of the history of conflict in Northern Ireland. But the protocol brought in some new checks on goods moving between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and has been criticised by unionist politicians since its introduction in 2021. The DUP's leader, Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, welcomed the UK government's proposed legislation and said his party would take ""cautious"" steps to re-engage with power sharing in Northern Ireland as it progresses. This video can not be played Stephen Doughty asks if the government did not understand its Brexit agreement or if it ""intended to break it all along"". Ms Truss told MPs in response to ""the grave situation in Northern Ireland"", there was a ""necessity to act to ensure institutions can be restored as soon as possible"". She said the UK's preference remained a negotiated solution with the EU in consultation with its negotiator Maros Sefcovic, who has been invited to London for more talks. If a resolution cannot be reached, the UK would take steps to ""cement provisions"" that are working in the protocol, while ""fixing those elements that aren't"". ""The government is clear that proceeding with our legislation is consistent with our obligations under international law,"" she said. She said the bill would: Propose ""green"" and ""red"" lanes for goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland Ensure goods moving and staying in the UK are""freed of unnecessary bureaucracy""if they are not destined for the EU Remove regulatory barriersto goods made to UK standards being sold in Northern Ireland Allow businesses to choose between meeting UK or EU standards ina new dual regulatory regime Give the UK governmentpower to decide on tax and spend policiesacross the whole of the UK Addressissues related to governance, ""bringing the protocol in line with international norms"" Elections to Northern Ireland's Assembly on 5 May resulted in a majority for politicians who accept the protocol, including the new largest party, Sinn FÃ©in. The party said the UK government was letting the DUP ""hold society to ransom"" after Mr Johnson met all political parties in Northern Ireland on Monday. Legislative solution on NI protocol needed - PM How PM's views on Northern Ireland deal changed In a statement on Tuesday, Mr Sefcovic said the European Commission ""stands ready to continue discussions with the UK government to identify joint solutions within the framework of the protocol"". ""Should the UK decide to move ahead with a bill disapplying constitutive elements of the Protocol as announced today by the UK government, the EU will need to respond with all measures at its disposal,"" Mr Sefcovic added. ""Our overarching objective is to find joint solutions within the framework of the Protocol."" The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem Prime Minister Boris Johnson held a cabinet meeting to discuss the situation in Northern Ireland on Tuesday morning What the foreign secretary is proposing would be a big change. It would mean Northern Ireland operating under a dual system for trade in goods rather than following EU rules. That's certainly more than a few tweaks. The government argues that an ""ambitious"" plan is now needed to safeguard peace and democracy. But it's not as if it inherited this problem; it negotiated the deal. It's pretty clear that many MPs are deeply unhappy with the idea of the UK now making one-sided changes and going back on an international agreement. The government insists it's acting within the law; it has promised to set out its legal position, although it's very unlikely we'll ever see the detailed legal advice behind it. Despite all of this, nothing will actually change immediately. Legislation would take time to pass through Parliament and hasn't even been published yet. Significantly, neither the EU nor the UK has walked away from negotiations and both say that's really how they want to settle this. Following Ms Truss's statement, some MPs - including Conservative Simon Hoare, who is chair of the Northern Ireland select committee - suggested the legislation would violate the protocol and breach international law. But Ms Truss assured MPs the legislation would not and said ""we will set out the legal position in due course"". Meanwhile, the prime minister defended the government's plans to change the protocol if they can not reach an agreement with the EU. He said changes were a ""necessity"" to ""fix the problems with the Northern Ireland political situation"" but insisted they amounted to ""getting rid of some relatively minor barriers to trade"". Asked if the UK could afford a trade war with the EU, he said: ""I don't think that is likely."" Earlier, Marks and Spencer chairman and former Tory MP Archie Norman said the protocol is ""very, very onerous"" and costs the business about Â£30m. ""At the moment, wagons arriving in the Republic of Ireland have to carry 700 pages of documentation,"" he told the BBC. ""It takes about eight hours to prepare the documentation. Some of the descriptors, particularly of animal products, have to be in Latin."" Any legislation to alter the protocol would have to be approved by Parliament in a process that could take months. There are fears that, if the UK did use such legislation, the move would trigger a trade war with the EU. A trade war, which involves putting up barriers to the exchange of goods, could increase costs for consumers at a time of pressure on household budgets. The EU has acknowledged the protocol has caused difficulties for Northern Ireland businesses. In October, it put forward proposals which, it said, would cut paperwork and checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. However, the UK rejected these plans last week saying they would make things worse.

Platforms' Buffalo attack action called inadequate,"Social media sites are facing criticism for the spread of graphic and far-right material from Saturday's attack in Buffalo, New York. Campaign group Hope Not Hate called the response ""wholly inadequate"". The gunman livestreamed the fatal shooting of 10 people at a Buffalo supermarket on Twitch. Twitch quickly took down the livestream on Saturday - but Meta and Twitter's moderation remains under scrutiny. The platforms say footage from theattackand links to the shooter's manifesto are being actively removed. The footage, captured on the gunman's helmet, was duplicated on other streaming sites after Twitch removed it. While 22 viewers watched the stream live on Twitch, the Washington Postreports,external, a copy uploaded to an alternative streaming site was viewed more than three million times before its removal. And Facebook did not remove a link to the copy for more than 10 hours, by which time it had been shared more than 46,000 times on the platform. Buffalo shooting: Gunman sought to 'continue his rampage' Meta being sued by ex-Facebook content moderator Meta says it is removing and blocking copies of the livestream, the shooter's manifesto and external links to them. The Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism'sContent Incident Protocol,externalincludes sharing digital identifiers of the Buffalo shooter's footage and copies of it in a database, to enable faster removals. But Meta says some people have been trying to bypass its policies to post material from the attack online. Hope Not Hate senior researcher Patrik Hermansson said: ""The speed at which the mass shooter's video and manifesto has spread on mainstream social-media platforms is worrying - and moderation of it has proven to be wholly inadequate. ""For it to spread to as many people as possible, in order to cause fear and inspire others to commit similar attacks, is one of the primary goals of the perpetrator - and he has succeeded in that."" In the wake of the attacks on two mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in 2019, which were also livestreamed, technology companies promised more action to limit the spread of terrorist content. But Mr Hermansson said what happened in Buffalo suggests more still needs to be done. ""Despite having had several years to put in place appropriate measures to hinder far-right terror propaganda to be spread virally, it has had little effect,"" he added. Center for Countering Digital Hateresearch,externalfound platforms had failed to take action on 90% posts promoting the Great Replacement conspiracy theory cited by the Buffalo shooter. The attack proved ""words can kill"", chief executive Imran Ahmed said, and platforms needed to remove ""not just content relating to the shooting but the violent ideology that inspired it"". A Twitter official said moderators were proactively removing media related to the Buffalo shooting, as per itsperpetrators-of-violent-attacks policy,external. And the company ""may remove"" Tweets sharing the shooter's manifesto and other perpetrator-produced content. ""We believe the hateful and discriminatory views promoted in content produced by perpetrators are harmful for society and that their dissemination should be limited in order to prevent perpetrators from publicising their message,"" the official said. ""In line with our glorification-of-violence policy, glorifying, celebrating, praising or condoning violent crimes, violent events where people were targeted because of their membership in a protected group or the perpetrators of such acts is prohibited."" The Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) said it had seen ""significant efforts"" from large social platforms to remove English-language copies of the manifesto and attack footage. But versions of the video in languages besides English had received many views prior to removal, ""suggesting that content-moderation efforts are still not creating equal results across geographies"". ISD researchers spotted links to the shooter's manifesto on file-sharing platforms and streaming sites used to spread graphic video footage. ""It is extremely difficult to prevent all instances of the manifesto and video from being uploaded across the web,"" an ISD official said. ""The primary issue here is that there are well known sites such as 4chan where users share the latest links to uploads, so even when one is taken down, there will always be other uploads to take its place.""
