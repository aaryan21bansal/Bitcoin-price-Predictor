Musk subpoenas Dorsey ahead of Twitter court battle,"Elon Musk has launched legal action to summon Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey to appear in court as part of his legal battle with the tech company. Mr Musk is seeking to end his $44bn deal for Twitter after alleging the firm failed to provide enough information on fake account numbers. But the social media site is suing Mr Musk to try to force him to buy it. The case will be heard in Delaware, US, in October unless both parties decide to settle outside of court beforehand. Twitter hopes that a judge will order Mr Musk - who is the world's richest man - to complete the takeover at the agreed price of $54.20 per share. But as part of the trial preparations, lawyers for Mr Musk have called on his friend, the former boss of Twitter Mr Dorsey, in the hope that he will help support the Tesla boss's argument that the social media company hasn't been honest about the volume of fake accounts on its platform. A subpoena legal writ or document summons a person to attend court or orders the submission of evidence, as records or documents, before a court. Elon Musk pulls out of $44bn deal to buy Twitter Twitter sues Elon Musk over $44bn takeover deal Doubts cast over Musk Twitter bot claims In July, the billionaire said he planned to walk away from his deal to buy Twitter, which prompted the company to sue him. Mr Musk accused the company of withholding information about fake accounts, but Twitter argued that these were excuses to cover buyer's remorse. The site has issued its own subpoenas to people who had planned to invest in the deal with Mr Musk. Jack Dorsey is the co-founder of Twitter Mr Dorsey stepped down as chief executive of Twitter in November last year andtweeted in support of Mr Muskwhen he announced his bid to buy the company in April, saying: ""Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness."" Last month, a US judge ruled that Twitter's lawsuit against Mr Musk should go to trial in October. Earlier in August, Mr Musk sold another 7.92 million shares in Tesla, worth around $6.88bn (Â£5.7bn), stating that he needed the money in case he is forced to buy Twitter. Mr Musk has countersued Twitter, claiming a third of visible Twitter accounts, assessed by his team, were fake. Using that figure the team estimated that a minimum of 10% of daily active users are bots.

"British Airways to cut 10,000 Heathrow flightsThe cancellations are aimed at minimising disruption to flights over the winter.BusinessComments","British Airways will cut roughly 10,000 short-haul flights to and from Heathrow Airport between late October and March. The move is aimed at minimising disruption over the winter and some long-haul flights will also be affected, the airline said. BA said it will also cut a dozen round-trips per day - totalling 629 flights - until the end of October. Heathrow, which is BA's main hub, has capped passenger numbers flying from the airport due to staff shortages. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during the height of Covid restrictions, have found it difficult to recruit enough staff as demand for holidays has returned. Heathrow has struggled to cope with rising passenger numbers and issues with its baggage handling systems caused long delays in returning luggage. BA said it was ""protecting key holiday destinations over half-term"". Most schools in England are off during the last week of October. Most cancellations will be on routes which have other daily services to the same destinations, it said in a statement. Passengers affected by the changes will be offered an alternative flight with BA or another airline or a refund, it added. BA insisted the impact for customers was ""minimal"", with the majority of flights unchanged. ""Customers booked for winter will be able to travel as planned and are being given several months' notice of any changes,"" a statement said. The airline said it was expecting to operate an average of 290 round-trips per day from London Heathrow over the winter. Its total capacity for the winter schedule will be reduced by 8%. John Strickland, an aviation consultant, said the amount of flights cut appeared to be a ""very negligible amount in the context of what they would plan to operate"". ""At this point they are likely to inconvenience very few people and I wouldn't expect any noticeable impact on price,"" he added. British Airways is the largest operator at Heathrow, and earlier this month suspended sales of tickets on short-haul flights from the airport for two weeks. This is to avoid exceeding its share of the airport's 100,000 per day passenger limit. This cap had been due to end on 11 September but was recentlyextended until 29 October. Announcing the extension, Heathrow said that the cap had worked, resulting in fewer last minute cancellations and delays, and better baggage delivery. BA had already cut more than 30,000 flights over the wider summer period, and had been planning a slow ramp-up towards the winter. But the passenger cap means it cannot run as many as hoped.

Water firms face growing criticism on beach sewage,"This video can not be played Watch: Untreated sewage water released into the Sussex sea Water companies are facing mounting criticism from environmental campaigners and politicians over sewage being pumped on to British beaches. Pollution warnings remain in place across more than 20 beaches and swimming spots in England and Wales afterheavy rain overwhelmed sewers. Downing Street condemned the industry for not reducing sewage discharge and putting shareholders before customers. But Labour and a leading campaigner said ministers had not done enough. At the height of the recent problems last week there were warnings in place at more than 40 locations. Environmental campaigner Feargal Sharkey said issues with sewage showed the water industry was in an ""extraordinary state of chaos"" and said decades of regulatory failure, underinvestment and profiteering had led to the current situation. A government spokesperson said ministers expected water companies ""to take urgent action on this issue or face fines"". The Environment Agency (EA), which covers England, says the capacity of the sewerage system can be exceeded at times during heavy rainfall, especially when the dry ground is unable to absorb water quickly. This could lead to inundation of sewage works and potential flooding of homes, roads and open spaces and for this reason, the system is designed to overflow occasionally and discharge excess wastewater directly to the sea and rivers. Untreated sewage is normally screened and passed through storage tanks before being dumped. English beach sewage dumps not monitored properly, data shows Sewage hits dozens of beaches in England and Wales after heavy rain Environment Agency seeks jail for polluting water bosses The government said firms had already faced legal action from regulators, pointing out the Environment Agency's prosecutions against water and sewage companies since 2015 had resulted in fines of more than Â£137m. Last year Southern Water wasfined a record Â£90mfor ""deliberately"" dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea, which the company said was the result of ""negligence"". But Mr Sharkey told BBC Breakfast: ""I'm afraid what you're looking at is simply the result of 30 years of underinvestment by the water industry, 30 years of profiteering, 30 years of regulatory failure, and 30 years of a vacuum of political oversight and government failing to take proper control for this industry."" The Downing Street spokesperson said since the industry was privatised in 1989, the equivalent of Â£5bn had been invested to upgrade water infrastructure. Neil Cutts, an activist from Surfers Against Sewage, said water firms ""tend not to listen"" to the group's calls for investment in water infrastructure. Speaking to Times Radio on Sunday, Mr Cutts said: ""They tend to hide because they are protected slightly by the government as well - and a series of governments, not just the one that's currently in power at the moment."" Middlesbrough's mayor haswarned people to stay away from beaches in Teessidebecause of ""totally unacceptable"" sewage discharges. He said there was never a good time to make such a call but pointed out he had been left needing to do so in the holiday season when he would normally want people to head to his region's coast. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government had its head in the sand and accused ministers of not being tough enough on water companies, while cutting funding for the Environment Agency. He said: ""I think there is huge anger about the sewage situation, because we're seeing yet again sewage pumped into our rivers and into our seas. What it shows is that the government hasn't been tough enough on the water companies and the enforcement against the water companies."" Meanwhile, dataanalysed by the Liberal Democratsfound water firms were not monitoring sewage discharges along the coastline. The party said the data revealed many monitoring devices used by firms across the UK did not work at least 90% of the time or had not been installed at all. Water firms have insisted they are committed to taking action. In a statement, a Water UK spokesperson said water firms ""agree there is an urgent need"" for action and were investing more than Â£3bn to improve overflows as part of a wider national environmental programme between 2020 and 2025. They said processes needed to be streamlined to investment could be quickly targeted where it was needed and said new investment should be met with action from the government and regulators on delivering a comprehensive national plan.

Bin strike residents told to keep rubbish inside,"Mary Nisbet does not want to keep rubbish in her flat Edinburgh residents are being asked to keep their rubbish inside as waste piles high during the city's bin strike. The city's waste workers launcheda 12-day strike as unions negotiate for an improved pay offer. On day five, scenes of overflowing bins were spreading from the city centre to residential areas. City conservation charity The Cockburn Association asked residents to avoid adding household waste to the pile up. Director Terry Levinthal told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland: ""Until such time as the strike action is resolved, I think everybody has a part to play in this. People who live in the city have to manage their waste appropriately. ""Don't put it out  - there is no sense in putting it on the street. ""There is waste that you can store - inert waste like cardboard, that kind of stuff. You can find a corner in your house or flat to keep it. It's that kind of management we need to get through this."" Cosla agrees to 5% pay offer for council workers Edinburgh Festival litter pickers clean up bin strike waste The industrial action falls in the final weeks of the Edinburgh festivals. It emerged on Sunday thatstreet performers and festival staff had taken to litter pickingto do their bit in keeping the city welcoming for visitors. Rubbish piled in city centre bins towers over resident Anne Starsmeare Mr Levinthal said that piles of rubbish were growing higher and called on businesses to help. ""We have to communicate with the tourist and events sector that there is a strike,"" he said. ""And if those businesses that have commercial collection facilities can actually maybe step up, because it is in their interests to present the city in the best way possible."" Meanwhile, city centre residents were having to live with the conditions. Anne Starsmeare was shocked that rubbish in Forrest Road was now towering over her. She said: ""This is such bad timing for the city and tourism. People are walking through the rubbish now and it's sticking to the pavements. ""It's awful to see a beautiful city looking like this."" Colin Jenkins said flies were already buzzing around residential bins in Jordan Lane Unions have rejected a pay offer equivalent to a 3.5% increase and the Edinburgh strike is the first of a series across Scotland. On Friday, local authoritiesincreased their pay offer from 3.5% to 5%. Residents outside the city centre expressed concern as communal bins started to overflow on Monday. Colin Jenkins, 72, from Morningside, said: ""I saw flies buzzing around the rubbish in Jordan Lane. ""The bins are stuffed and spilling out and people have left their rubbish next to the bins all over the pavement - there's even a toilet. ""It's getting quite bad now and people don't know where to put their rubbish."" A recycling point on Edinburgh's Grassmarket is strewn with cardboard waste The Edinburgh strike will be followed by a second wave of action by waste workers across Scotland. It is a coordinated effort by Unite, Unison and the GMB unions to get an improved council pay deal. Unite - 24 to 31 AugustAberdeen, Angus, Clackmannanshire, Dundee, East Ayrshire, East Lothian, East Renfrewshire, Edinburgh, Falkirk, Glasgow, Highland, Inverclyde, South Ayrshire, South Lanarkshire and West Lothian.

Mary Nisbet, 85, also from Morningside, said: ""I think it's a disgrace that we are being told to keep our rubbish. ""I live in a small flat. It's going to get very smelly and it's unhygienic. ""It could also attract vermin into our houses as well as flies and bluebottles."" Edinburgh City Council has issuedguidance for residents,external. Do not add to full bins - check nearby bins instead Store your waste at home, or in your back green or garden if possible Do not leave bags next to bins unless this is unavoidable, as it can become a hazard Keep food waste in a sealed container, as cool as possible If street bins are full, take dog mess home and double bag to reduce smells It said that there would be no collections during the period of action and waste and recycling centres would remain closed. Morningside rubbish bins were already overfull on Monday The Scottish Conservatives have called on the Scottish government to intervene to prevent Scotland suffering ""international embarrassment"" over the state of the capital's streets. On Monday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said: ""Nobody wants to see strikes and nobody wants to see that kind of disruption. ""Councils are the employers of the workers and the Scottish government has made extra funding available to local authorities to facilitate a better pay deal. ""I am glad Cosla has put a 5% pay offer on the table and I hope that will lead to a resolution of these issues."" Unions said thatstrikes would continueuntil an acceptable pay offer was agreed. City of Edinburgh Council Leader Cammy Day said the news was disappointing. He said: ""I'm continuing to push hard for a resolution as quickly as possible. We also need to carry on pressing the Scottish government to give us more flexibility on how we use our resources and as well as providing fairer funding for our services. ""I'd like to thank everyone for their patience as the strike continues and please continue to follow our advice on how to deal with your waste safely and responsibly to help us manage the impact of the strike action.""

"UK inflation could hit 18% next year, experts warn","Rising energy prices could push UK inflation as high as 18% next year, the highest rate in nearly 50 years, economic analysts have predicted. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 10.1% in July, five times the Bank of England's (BoE) target. Investment bank Citi said inflation was ""entering the stratosphere"" and could rise to 18%, while the Resolution Foundation said it could reach 18.3%. The BoE predicted inflation will rise to more than 13% in the coming months. Citi's forecast - which would be the UK's highest rate of inflation since 1976 - comes ahead of Friday's energy price cap announcement on the maximum amount suppliers can charge households for gas and electricity from October. The investment bank's forecast is at the higher end of the scale compared to those made by other economists, such as EY-Parthenon which has forecast inflation to be at 15.4%. However, economists at the Resolution Foundation think tank told the BBC that based on the current price cap predictions and the latest data on the rate prices are rising at, inflation could go as high as 18.3%. Citi's chief UK economist, Benjamin Nabarro, said affordability concerns were ""growing more deafening by the day"". ""The question now is what policy may do to offset the impact on both inflation and the real economy,"" he said. How high will my energy bill go and can I reduce it? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Consultancy Cornwall Insight now expects a typical household energy bill to Â£3,554 a year from October. This is slightly below its previous forecast. However, it now expects energy regulator Ofgem to announce a price cap in January of Â£4,650, which is higher than its previous estimate of Â£4,266. Its calculations reflected a 15% increase in wholesale prices in the last week, Cornwall said. But the ""highly volatile nature of the market"" means these figures are expected to go up and down over the next couple of months, it added. From October, all UK households will see their energy bill reduced by Â£400 through monthly instalments over six months, with a reduction of Â£66 in October and November, and of Â£67 a month from December to March 2023. Eight million low-income households have already begun to get support for the rising cost of living, with the first instalment of payments totalling Â£650 hitting bank accounts in July. But Citi said, without further government support, the price cap could hit Â£3,717 in October and Â£4,567 in January, reaching Â£5,816 in April. Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, buying a pint would cost Â£25. ""People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around Â£5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,"" he said. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there were 10 food groups that have seen their prices rise more than 18.6% in the past year, including bread, milk, pasta and butter. ""Inflation at 18.6% would push millions of people into dire straits,"" she said. ""And because these horrible price hikes are being driven by the essentials people need to stay alive - like food and heat - it's going to hit those on lower incomes hardest, who've got nothing left to give."" The Bank of England has been raising interest rates since December and earlier this month implemented its largest increase - 0.5% - in 27 years to take borrowing costs to 1.75%. But Citi said it expects the Bank to increase interest rates even higher, to as much as 7%, to control inflation. On Monday European gas prices rose sharply due to supply fears, after Russian energy firm Gazprom announced it would shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline - the main gas export route to Germany - to complete three days of unplanned maintenance. British gas for immediate delivery was also up 37% to 503p per therm. Oil and gas analysts at Investec said, in a briefing note, that it anticipated UK gas prices to remain elevated if Russia continues to restrict supplies to Europe. ""This is remarkable in summer, when gas demand for heating is at its lowest,"" its analysts said. ""The outlook for UK/European gas prices are to remain high - even in 2025 it is three-times the 10-year average."" Predicting the peak of inflation levels has been a mug's game in the last nine months. The Bank of England originally predicted last year it would peak at 5%, then 10, then 13. HSBC recently revised its forecasts to 14% and on Monday global investment bank Citi set a new high watermark of 18%. Almost all of this inflation of inflation estimates has been caused by rocketing gas prices, which find their way into almost everything we buy. What is clear is that the forces that have propelled prices higher look like they are going to get worse before they get better. Read more of Simon Jack'sanalysis here. The government has previously said there would be no new policies before a new prime minister is in place. The new Conservative Party leader will be announced on 5 September and will face immediate pressure to tackle the nation's energy bills. The current favourite, Liz Truss, has promised tax cuts - and recently hinted at direct financial help for hard-pressed households. Her rival, Rishi Sunak, has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero. The energy price cap is the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy.

Claim confusing ticket machines drive tourists offBusinesses and visitors say parking machines are making it almost impossible to pay and park.Wales,"This video can not be played ""We've tried for about seven or eight minutes and we're just going now because we can't use it"" ""Very complicated"" parking machines need replacing to stop deterring tourists, a councillor has said. Ceredigion councillor Elizabeth Evans said the machines ""must be changed"" to stop future difficulties for visitors. Ms Evans said the problems have existed since they were first installed in 2020, and that ""nothing"" has changed. Ceredigion council said changes to its machines were ""not being actively considered or pursued at this stage"". Motorists have complained about being unable to easily pay for daily, rather than weekly, parking or being unable to easily change the language on the machines.

""Visitors are driving off out of Aberaeron and that's a massive impact for local businesses. Small businesses are complaining, not just in Aberaeron, but in Lampeter and in Aberteifi as well.

""But you can't use the machine, we've tried to [pay] daily but it's only [showing to pay] weekly. We've just tried for seven to eight minutes and we're going now because we just can't use it."" Verena Edgeworth said having to ask for help made her feel ""awkward and annoyed"" Verena Edgeworth from Bristol, who is in Ceredigion on holiday, needed help in order to pay for her parking. ""I couldn't even work out how to select the language properly and then it kept coming up as weekly and I wanted just two hours,"" she said.

""People come to town, they can't use these machines, because they are not easy at all,"" he said.

UK agencies accused of tip-off that led to torture,"UK intelligence agencies are accused of tipping off Indian authorities about a British national before his abduction and alleged torture by Punjab police. Jagtar Singh Johal, from Dumbarton, was in India in 2017 when his family say he was forced into an unmarked car. He says he was then tortured over days, including with electrocution. He has remained in detention since then. Successive British prime ministers have raised his case but India's government denies he was tortured or mistreated. Mr Johal was an active blogger and campaigner for Sikh human rights, which are said to have brought him to the attention of the Indian authorities. In May, he was formally charged with conspiracy to commit murder and being a member of a terrorist gang. He will be presented with a full list of the charges against him next month and faces a possible death penalty. The Indian authorities say the charges are related to Sikh nationalism, though he denies any wrongdoing. Now the human rights group Reprieve has shown the BBC documentation that it says is compelling evidence that his arrest followed a tip-off from British intelligence. The UK government says it will not comment on an ongoing legal case. Scot held in India faces murder conspiracy charge Reprieve says it has matched several details relating to his case to a specific claim of mistreatment documented in a report by the watchdog that oversees the intelligence agencies. ""In the course of an investigation"", says the Investigatory Powers Commissioner's Office (IPCO) report, ""MI5 passed intelligence to a liaison partner via the Secret Intelligence Service (MI6). ""The subject of the intelligence was arrested by the liaison partner in their country. The individual told the British Consular Official that he had been tortured."" Mr Johal is not named in the report, but Reprieve's investigators are adamant the facts match his case due to the dates concerned, the lobbying by British prime ministers and supporting evidence detailed in the Indian press. In 2017, the Hindustan Times reported that Mr Johal had ""come under the scanner"" after ""a source in the UK"" provided the Punjab police with ""vague information"" about a key man, ""Johal"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he raised Mr Johal's case with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, during a trip to India in April this year But his brother Gurpreet told the BBC he was not aware of any activity that could be considered illegal. Mr Johal is currently being held in a Delhi prison. He has alleged that, following his arrest, he was held incommunicado, was brutally interrogated for hours on end, and was initially denied access to lawyers or British consular officials. He says he was made to sign blank sheets of paper that were later used against him as a false confession. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he raised Mr Johal's case with his Indian counterpart, Narendra Modi, during a trip to India in April this year. His predecessor, Theresa May, also raised the case with the Indian government during her tenure. Jagtar Singh Johal (right) arrives at court in India in November 2017 On 12 August, Mr Johal lodged a claim in the High Court against the Foreign Office, the Home Office and the attorney general, alleging that UK intelligence agencies unlawfully shared information with the Indian authorities when there was a risk he could be tortured. Reprieve says this case suggests the government has failed to fix longstanding shortcomings in its policy on torture and the death penalty, and has learned little from past failings such as the MI6 tip-off that led to the rendition and torture of Libyan dissident Abdulhakim Belhaj. Commenting on the allegations, MP Steve Baker said: ""This appalling case, where UK intelligence sharing has been linked to brutal torture, illustrates vividly why the National Security Bill needs to be improved."" Responding on behalf of all three accused government departments, the Foreign Office said: ""It would be inappropriate to comment on an ongoing legal case.""

"Truss dodging scrutiny of tax plans, claims Sunak","Liz Truss is avoiding scrutiny of her ""dangerous"" plans to tackle the cost of living crisis, her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak has claimed. Ms Truss has promised an ""emergency budget"" if she becomes prime minister in two weeks' time. She will reverse National Insurance rises and stop business tax hikes - and has hinted at further cash support for families struggling with energy bills. But she will not ask for a forecast of how this will impact the economy. Mr Sunak - who is trailing Ms Truss in polls of Tory members who are selecting the next PM - has seized on this as evidence that her sums do not add up. The former chancellor hasinsisted he still has a ""shot"" at Downing Street, even though many Tory members will have already cast their ballots. Help is coming with cost of living, says minister Recall Parliament over cost of living, Labour says Warning Tory leadership tax cut pledges unrealistic He says Ms Truss' plans will put the UK's public finances in ""serious jeopardy"" and fuel inflation, leading to even higher prices in the shops. In an interview with Vanessa Feltz on BBC Radio 2, he said: ""Liz's plans are promising the earth to everybody. I don't think you can have your cake and eat it. ""I don't think life's that simple, and I think her plan risks making the situation worse when you're borrowing that much money for tax cuts at a time when inflation's already going up."" Last month,the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which scrutinises government tax and spending plans, warned that UK debt is already on an ""unsustainable path"" because of inflation and other factors. Ms Truss has argued that tax cuts will help to grow the UK's economy and boost prosperity. Her team say there is no need for the OBR to produce new forecasts, because she is not planning a full budget, though will introduce tax cuts. ""The cost of living crisis means immediate action is required,"" a spokeswoman for Ms Truss' campaign said. ""A Truss government would seek to act as soon as possible to help people across the UK, by cutting taxes and introducing a temporary moratorium on energy levies."" The OBR usually requires 10 weeks to carry out an analysis of government economic plans, such as a budget. But a spokesperson for the OBR said: ""We would be prepared to publish a forecast for the new chancellor, should they request it."" The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Mel Stride, has written to the chancellor and the OBR to ask whether preparations were being made for a potential emergency budget when a new prime minister takes office. Mr Stride - a supporter of Mr Sunak - said bringing in ""significant tax cuts without a forecast would be ill advised"", likening it to ""flying blind"". Ms Truss' campaign defended her economic plan as ""sensible"" and said a ""new approach"" to the economy was needed. Her team say they will not reveal what she will do to help families with bills until the leadership contest is over, on 5 September. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, a Truss ally who is being tipped as her chancellor, said: ""Of course, she will look at what more can be done to help families, but it is entirely reasonable not to detail the exact shape of that support until she has all the information to hand."" The Sunak campaign says Ms Truss' plans are a ""mystery"" because she cannot deliver help with bills and Â£50bn worth of unfunded tax cuts in one go. ""It's no wonder they want to avoid independent scrutiny of the OBR in their emergency budget - they know you can't do both and it's time they came clean about that now,"" a spokesperson added. Mr Sunak has said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he becomes prime minister. He has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero and to cut 3p off income tax by 2029. Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake, a supporter of Mr Sunak, urged Ms Truss to stop offering ""the magic money tree"" and instead focus on what support she could offer to low-income households. ""These people are going to be on the streets,"" Mr Hollinrake told Sky News. ""Things are going to be that bad for some households."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer joined in with criticism of Ms Truss' decision not to ask the OBR to scrutinise her plans. He said:  ""We need an emergency budget. We should have had that months ago, to deal with the cost of living crisis. But the OBR is there to make sure that money is spent wisely and properly. So of course you need the OBR in place for that."" He added: ""Labour is leading on this, we have said freeze those bills this winter, make sure people don't pay any more for their energy."" The Institute for Fiscal Studieshas called pledgesby both Tory leadership candidates ""unrealistic"" unless they are matched by spending cuts. The cost of living crisis is being driven by several factors, including soaring energy bills and inflation outstripping wage increases. Last week, the UK's inflation rate hit 10.1%, with rising food and drink prices making the largest contribution to the change.

"Killed woman was not intended target, police sayAshley Dale was ""an innocent member of the public"" who was ""thoughtlessly shot"", police say.","Ms Dale's relatives said her killing was ""a senseless crime that has torn a family apart"" A woman who died after being shot at her own home was not the intended target of the attack, police have said. Ashley Dale wasfound wounded in her back gardenin Old Swan, Liverpool, in the early hours of Sunday and died a short time later in hospital. Her door had been forced and several shots fired, Merseyside Police said. Det Ch Supt Mark Kameen said the 28-year-old was ""an innocent member of the public"" who had been ""callously and thoughtlessly shot"". A force spokesman said the council worker was found with gunshot wounds in the garden of her house in Leinster Road at about 00:40 BST and died in hospital a short time later. In a statement, her family said Ms Dale had been ""a hard working young woman, who had her entire life ahead of her"" and had ""just been promoted at her job with Knowsley Council"". They said she had a degree and ""so many plans for her bright future that had only just begun"", adding that her ""laugh, smile and energy was infectious in any room"". ""We can't come to terms with how this would happen to a defenceless woman in her own home,"" they said. ""None of this makes sense and our lives will never be the same again.

Monkeypox vaccine rationed by giving mini doses,"Monkeypox virus particle Three NHS sites are set to begin a pilot offering eligible patients smaller doses of monkeypox vaccine, amid global shortages of the jab. Experts say the reduced shots are just as effective and will mean more people are protected. The fractional dosing approach has been authorised in the US and the EU, as well as the UK. More than 3,000 people have been diagnosed with monkeypox in the UK since the epidemic began in May. Most cases of the virus have been among gay and bisexual men. However, anyone who comes into close contact with someone who has monkeypox could potentially contract the virus. Vaccination can help prevent new cases. UK officials say more than 33,000 regular dose shots have been given to some of those at the greatest risk of contracting the virus. But many more, who could benefit from being vaccinated, have not yet been immunised - and stocks of the vaccine are running low. Monkeypox: Can we still stop the outbreak? 'I'm a different person after having monkeypox' What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? Fractional dosing could maximise the number of doses that can be administered currently, without compromising protection, says the UK Health Security Agency (UKHSA). Clinics in Chelsea and Westminster NHS Trust, Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust and Locala Health and Wellbeing in Greater Manchester are to begin offering people the lower dose option. Although the dose is a fifth of the volume of the regular one - 0.1ml rather than 0.5ml -studies suggest,externalit still gives good protection. Dr Mary Ramsay, Head of Immunisation at UKHSA, said: ""Adopting this tried-and-tested technique will help to maximise the reach of our remaining stock, including the 100,000 doses due to arrive in the country next month - potentially enabling us to offer protection for many more thousands of people. ""We will continue to remain agile in our response to the monkeypox outbreak and will adapt our approach as new science and advice becomes available."" Dr Claire Dewsnap, President of the British Association for Sexual Health & HIV, said: ""We absolutely support the UKHSA-led fractional dosing pilots assessing feasibility in UK sexual health clinics. If acceptable, this would offer us the opportunity to roll out vaccine to those eligible much faster, and would address the issues of short supply of vaccine across the world.""

Who is allowed to strike?,"Tougher rules for some workers planning strike action have been announced. The government said it would ensure key services like the NHS are protected, but unions plan legal action. Sometrade union members would be required to continue workingduring a strike, under the proposed law. This would be to ensure a ""minimum level of service"". It would apply to England, Scotland and Wales. The sectors covered are: The NHS Transport Education Fire and rescue Border security Nuclear decommissioning To meet minimum staffing levels - which are still to be announced - employers would be able to issue a ""work notice"" stating the workforce they need. Employees named on the work notice would lose their right to protection from unfair dismissal if they then went on strike. The proposals will not affect strikes happening now, as Parliament needs to approve the changes. While MPs have backed the plans -by 315 votes to 236 votes- they also need to clear the House of Lords. This will be tougher for the government as it has less support in the Lords. Unions have threatened legal action if the new law is passed, while Labour says it would repeal it if it wins the next election. Unions criticise strikes bill as unworkable The strikes taking place in February and March A few professions are already not allowed to strike. Police officers arebanned from taking strike action,external. Nurses have an agreement to only walk out if the wellbeing of patients is unaffected. What will nurses' strike mean for patients? A strike can only happen if a majority of union members agree via an organised vote -known as a ballot.,external There are strict rules,externalaround holding a vote. For example, it must be a postal ballot - where members vote on paper and return it in a prepaid envelope. If workers agree to strike, details must be given to the employer at least 14 days before it begins (unless the union and employer agree to seven days). If the rules aren't followed, a court could prevent a strike. Non-union members can also strike,,externalsays Crystal Boyde, an employment lawyer at Thrive Law. ""As long as the industrial action is lawful, non-union members are allowed to go on strike and remain protected from dismissal,"" she says. UK employees are protected from being sacked during the first 12 weeks of official industrial action. If they are sacked during this period, they can claim unfair dismissal. However, workerscan be dismissed after 12 weeks,externalif the employer has tried to settle the dispute. For example, if an employment adviser likeAcas has been brought in to help find a solution.,external The government has introduced a new law allowing businesses to use agency workers to fill in for striking workers. However, trade unions havemounted a legal challenge,external. Trade unions are organisations which help workers negotiate with employers. They often help employees ask for more pay, or better working conditions. Unions also represent members who have problems at work. If negotiations don't work, a trade union's members might support action such as a strike. Almost one in four UK workers (23%) were union members in 2021 - a total of 6.4 million people,according to government statistics.,external After peaking at 13.2 million in 1979, union membership has fallen significantly - although the rate of decline has slowed. In 2021, 50% of public sector workers - including people like teachers and health workers - were in a union, compared with 13% of private sector employees. Employees over 50 are most likely to be members. Members normally pay a subscription and can leave at any point. Workers on strike can expect to lose wages for the time they do not work. No-one can be forced to take part in a strike - so a worker can choose to work. Picket lines are common sights during strikes The Labour Party was created from the trade union movement in 1900. There are currently12 trade unions,externalaffiliated to the party, including two of the largest - Unison and Unite. Labour relies on unions for funding. During the last general election campaignLabour received a total of Â£5.4m,external- of which Â£5m came from trade union donations. Members of trade unions linked to Labour can apply to be allowed to vote in party leadership elections.

"UK inflation could hit 18% next year, bank warns","Rising energy prices could push UK inflation as high as 18% next year, the highest rate in nearly 50 years, economic analysts have predicted. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 10.1% in July, five times the Bank of England's (BoE) target. Investment bank Citi said inflation was ""entering the stratosphere"" and could rise to 18%, while the Resolution Foundation said it could reach 18.3%. The BoE predicted inflation will rise to more than 13% in the coming months. Citi's forecast - which would be the UK's highest rate of inflation since 1976 - comes ahead of Friday's energy price cap announcement on the maximum amount suppliers can charge households for gas and electricity from October. The investment bank's forecast is at the higher end of the scale compared to those made by other economists, such as EY-Parthenon which has forecast inflation to be at 15.4%. However, economists at the Resolution Foundation think tank told the BBC that based on the current price cap predictions and the latest data on the rate prices are rising at, inflation could go as high as 18.3%. Citi's chief UK economist, Benjamin Nabarro, said affordability concerns were ""growing more deafening by the day"". ""The question now is what policy may do to offset the impact on both inflation and the real economy,"" he said. How high will my energy bill go and can I reduce it? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Consultancy Cornwall Insight now expects a typical household energy bill to Â£3,554 a year from October. This is slightly below its previous forecast. However, it now expects energy regulator Ofgem to announce a price cap in January of Â£4,650, which is higher than its previous estimate of Â£4,266. Its calculations reflected a 15% increase in wholesale prices in the last week, Cornwall said. But the ""highly volatile nature of the market"" means these figures are expected to go up and down over the next couple of months, it added. From October, all UK households will see their energy bill reduced by Â£400 through monthly instalments over six months, with a reduction of Â£66 in October and November, and of Â£67 a month from December to March 2023. Eight million low-income households have already begun to get support for the rising cost of living, with the first instalment of payments totalling Â£650 hitting bank accounts in July. But Citi said, without further government support, the price cap could hit Â£3,717 in October and Â£4,567 in January, reaching Â£5,816 in April. Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, buying a pint would cost Â£25. ""People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around Â£5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,"" he said. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there were 10 food groups that have seen their prices rise more than 18.6% in the past year, including bread, milk, pasta and butter. ""Inflation at 18.6% would push millions of people into dire straits,"" she said. ""And because these horrible price hikes are being driven by the essentials people need to stay alive - like food and heat - it's going to hit those on lower incomes hardest, who've got nothing left to give."" The Bank of England has been raising interest rates since December and earlier this month implemented its largest increase - 0.5% - in 27 years to take borrowing costs to 1.75%. But Citi said it expects the Bank to increase interest rates even higher, to as much as 7%, to control inflation. On Monday European gas prices rose sharply due to supply fears, after Russian energy firm Gazprom announced it would shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline - the main gas export route to Germany - to complete three days of unplanned maintenance. British gas for immediate delivery was also up 37% to 503p per therm. Oil and gas analysts at Investec said, in a briefing note, that it anticipated UK gas prices to remain elevated if Russia continues to restrict supplies to Europe. ""This is remarkable in summer, when gas demand for heating is at its lowest,"" its analysts said. ""The outlook for UK/European gas prices are to remain high - even in 2025 it is three-times the 10-year average."" Predicting the peak of inflation levels has been a mug's game in the last nine months. The Bank of England originally predicted last year it would peak at 5%, then 10, then 13. HSBC recently revised its forecasts to 14% and on Monday global investment bank Citi set a new high watermark of 18%. Almost all of this inflation of inflation estimates has been caused by rocketing gas prices, which find their way into almost everything we buy. What is clear is that the forces that have propelled prices higher look like they are going to get worse before they get better. Read more of Simon Jack'sanalysis here. The government has previously said there would be no new policies before a new prime minister is in place. The new Conservative Party leader will be announced on 5 September and will face immediate pressure to tackle the nation's energy bills. The current favourite, Liz Truss, has promised tax cuts - and recently hinted at direct financial help for hard-pressed households. Her rival, Rishi Sunak, has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero. The energy price cap is the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy. The figure is based on how much gas and electricity a typical customer uses, so each household's bill will vary.

Actors to get nudity warning in anti-bullying move,"Actors will get prior written warning about the scope and extent of nudity and any simulated sex requested Equity has committed to ensuring actors are given nudity warnings as part of a move ""against bullying, harassment and inappropriate behaviour in TV"". The performing arts and entertainment trade union shared its fresh ""statement of commitment"". It brings together 21 major organisations, in the UK and abroad, including the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. The commitment, also backed by Sky, HBO and Warner Bros, comes with the warning that ""no one is untouchable"". In a statement, the union said it was part of a ""move towards a culture in which everyone working in the TV industry feels able to call out unacceptable behaviour, and that nobody is above being challenged: no one is untouchable"". It added ""everyone has a responsibility for creating an inclusive and respectful culture - and that by working together we can deliver real and lasting change in the industry"". This video can not be played Weinstein legacy: Life after #MeToo Equity president Lynda Rooke applauded the move, saying: ""On behalf of every performer who has experienced bullying and harassment during their on screen working lives, I welcome this commitment by industry representatives to create a safe working environment where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. ""But to establish an inclusive and respectful culture requires actions not just words, and I encourage all those working in this sector to recognise their individual responsibility to report inappropriate behaviour and unite against any pressure to remain silent on these issues."" Dame Emma defends 'important' intimacy directors 'People fear for their jobs if they report bullies' Me Too founder says movement not over Prior written warning about the scope and extent of nudity and any simulated sex requested will be provided going forward, the collective has agreed, followed by a discussion and agreement with the artist. And for scenes of an intimate nature, an intimacy co-ordinator will be engaged, if acceptable to the actors involved. Earlier this month, actresses including Dame Emma Thompson defended the use of intimacy co-ordinators - increasingly used on film and TV sets and in theatres in the years - after actor Sean Bean had said they ""spoil the spontaneity"" of sex scenes. The union also discussed and agreed to ensuring safe casting and audition spaces, and for producers to have clear respect at work policies, which include a process for addressing concerns and making complaints about bullying and harassment. The statement also included the prominent display of contact information relating to safeguarding and support - from proactive trained senior staff - for each production. Anti-bullying and harassment training will now be mandatory for every cast and crew too. Ralph Lee, director of content at BBC Studios Productions said it was ""important that as an industry we work together to ensure there is a safe and respectful working environment within the production community"". Signing up to the statement of commitment, he stressed, would ""strengthen our ability to continue to improve making this happen"". David Osborn, chief people officer at ITV, said it was ""crucial that all contributors to our industry work together to combat bullying and inappropriate behaviour"". The commitment comes in the period following the emergence of the#MeToo movement, which saw widespread allegations of abuse in the entertainment industry.

"British Airways to cut 5,000 Heathrow flights","British Airways will cut roughly 10,000 short-haul flights to and from Heathrow Airport between late October and March. The move is aimed at minimising disruption over the winter and some long-haul flights will also be affected, the airline said. BA said it will also cut a dozen round-trips per day - totalling 629 flights - until the end of October. Heathrow, which is BA's main hub, has capped passenger numbers flying from the airport due to staff shortages. Airports and airlines, which cut jobs during the height of Covid restrictions, have found it difficult to recruit enough staff as demand for holidays has returned. Heathrow has struggled to cope with rising passenger numbers and issues with its baggage handling systems caused long delays in returning luggage. BA said it was ""protecting key holiday destinations over half-term"". Most schools in England are off during the last week of October. Most cancellations will be on routes which have other daily services to the same destinations, it said in a statement. Passengers affected by the changes will be offered an alternative flight with BA or another airline or a refund, it added. BA insisted the impact for customers was ""minimal"", with the majority of flights unchanged. ""Customers booked for winter will be able to travel as planned and are being given several months' notice of any changes,"" a statement said. The airline said it was expecting to operate an average of 290 round-trips per day from London Heathrow over the winter. Its total capacity for the winter schedule will be reduced by 8%. John Strickland, an aviation consultant, said the amount of flights cut appeared to be a ""very negligible amount in the context of what they would plan to operate"". ""At this point they are likely to inconvenience very few people and I wouldn't expect any noticeable impact on price,"" he added. British Airways is the largest operator at Heathrow, and earlier this month suspended sales of tickets on short-haul flights from the airport for two weeks. This is to avoid exceeding its share of the airport's 100,000 per day passenger limit. This cap had been due to end on 11 September but was recentlyextended until 29 October. Announcing the extension, Heathrow said that the cap had worked, resulting in fewer last minute cancellations and delays, and better baggage delivery. BA had already cut more than 30,000 flights over the wider summer period, and had been planning a slow ramp-up towards the winter. But the passenger cap means it cannot run as many as hoped.

Cineworld confirms it is considering bankruptcy,"Thor: Love And Thunder is one of the biggest movie releases this year Cineworld has confirmed it is considering filing for bankruptcy in the US, as the cinema chain continues to struggle with $5bn worth of debt. But the company, which also owns the Picturehouse chain in the UK, insisted its cinemas ""remain open for business"" and that there would be ""no significant impact"" on jobs. Cineworld employs more than 28,000 people globally. Like other cinema chains, Cineworld was hit hard by the pandemic. Many theatres were forced to close for extended periods during the lockdowns, or had to operate at a reduced capacity due to social distancing rules. Cineworld shares plunge on bankruptcy fears Netflix loses almost a million subscribers Cinema chains had hoped blockbusters such as the latest Bond film, Top Gun: Maverick and Thor: Love And Thunder would draw audiences back in after lockdown restrictions eased. Top Gun: Maverick, starring Tom Cruise, has taken $1.8bn at the global box office, making it one of the top 10 highest grossing films of all time. But last week, Cineworld warned there had still not been enough major releases to attract cinema audiences and said this was hitting admissions. In 2019 before the pandemic, global box office takings hit a record $42.5bn according to Comscore, buoyed by films such as Avengers: Endgame and Frozen 2. So far in 2022, films such as Jurassic World Dominion and Minions: The Rise of Gru have performed strongly. But box office takings this year are down by around a third, or 32%, compared with 2019. Minions: The Rise of Gru is one of the best performing films of 2022 Cinema chains have also been facing tough competition from streaming services, which soared in popularity during the lockdowns. In 2020, a row broke out when Cineworld and rival AMC, which owns the Odeon Cinemas chain, criticised Universal Pictures for releasing Trolls: World Tour online at a time when theatres were forced to close because of coronavirus. Cineworld subsequentlysigned a deal with Warner Brosto show films in theatres before they are streamed. More recently, Netflix reported a sharp fall in subscribers, as the rising cost of living leads to people cutting back. On Friday, shares in Cineworld plunged 60% afterThe Wall Street Journal reported,externalthat the firm was preparing to file for bankruptcy ""within weeks"". Cineworld said on Monday it was looking at various options for how to restructure the business, including a Chapter 11 filing in the US. This allows a company to continue to operate while it negotiates with its creditors. The company would not comment on whether it was also considering entering liquidation in the UK, or what the potential impact could be on its 4,600 employees there. It also would not be drawn on what will happen to people who pay for Cineworld or Picturehouse membership, or who have vouchers, in the event of it filing for bankruptcy. In a statement, the firm said: ""Cineworld would expect to maintain its operations in the ordinary course until and following any filing and ultimately to continue its business over the longer term with no significant impact upon its employees."" Cineworld has 128 cinemas in the UK and Ireland. Globally, it has 9,189 screens across more than 750 sites. It operates in 10 countries, including the US, Poland and Israel. Cineworld currently has a market value of around $69m but is carrying close to $5bn of debt. The firm has expanded through acquisitions around the world. However, two years ago it ditched a plan to take over Cineplex, leading to a protracted legal battle as the Canadian firm sought substantial damages from Cineworld. Shares in Cineworld recovered slightly on Monday morning. But at just over 4p, the share price is still a long way off from where it was at the start of 2020 when it reached 220p before the pandemic struck.

"Energy customers can't carry cost of war, says boss","Average energy bills in the UK are predicted to reach Â£3,582 a year in October UK households cannot carry the cost of the Ukraine war which is set to push energy bills even higher, the boss of Octopus Energy has said. Greg Jackson was speaking as UK households brace for average energy bills to reach a predicted Â£3,554 a year in October and Â£4,650 in January. He called for the government to double its financial support or freeze the amount suppliers can charge for energy. No 10 previously said there would be no new policybefore a new PM is in place. The new Conservative Party leader will be announced on 5 September and will face immediate pressure to tackle the nation's energy bills. The current favourite, Liz Truss, has promised tax cuts and recently hinted atdirect financial help for hard-pressed households. Her rival, Rishi Sunak, has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero. The upcoming jump in energy prices has prompted investment bank Citi to raise his forecast of UK inflation to 18% in early 2023. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at10.1% and the Bank of England's target is 2%. What is the energy price cap? How will I get the Â£400 energy grant? On Friday, the energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - will be announced. Energy prices have risen sharply because demand for gas increased when Covid restrictions eased while the war in Ukraine has disrupted supplies from Russia. Mr Jackson, founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy Group, said: ""You can't expect the energy customers, or indeed the retailers to carry the cost of a war."" Asked what the solution could be, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government ""could double the existing support package"". In October, all UK households will get aÂ£400 discount on their fuel billsand some eight million low-income households will get an additional Â£650. Plans to enable households to getdiscounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak timesare set to be announced by the National Grid in the next two weeks. Mr Jackson also suggested a""tariff deficit fund"",externalwhich would involve the government freezing the energy price cap roughly where it is. The government would borrow money from banks to pay the difference between the wholesale cost and the price to the consumer while energy prices were high. This money would be paid back when energy prices came down, he said. Dale Vince, chief executive of renewable energy generator and supplier Ecotricity, told the BBC: ""The government does need to intervene we shouldn't expect customers to pay the cost of this failure and the Ukraine war."" He said the problem pre-dated the invasion of Ukraine and there was a ""systemic failure in the energy market"". But he said the deficit scheme Mr Jackson had outlined would force taxpayers to foot the bill over the next decade. ""The government simply needs to step in and pick up this cost like it did in the pandemic,"" he said. ""We need Â£40bn to get through this winter. That's 10% of what was spent during the pandemic and that's the only thing that will really sort this problem out."" This summer has seen forecasts, suggestions and a lot of political debate. What it has not seen is certainty. On Friday, households will finally be told exactly by how much domestic energy bills will rise in October. Remember, individual bills will vary, depending on how much gas and electricity you use. But the percentage increase in the domestic energy price cap for England, Wales and Scotland will be official and expressed in clear terms. Energy will be more expensive, but at least people will have some basis to plan for the financial hit. That said, the uncertainty won't be over. What extra support, if any, that is provided by government won't be clear until a new prime minister is in place. Energy prices for the second half of the winter are also unclear. Energy bosses say fundamental change in the sector doesn't come quickly, but help for householders facing soaring bills as the nights draw in cannot come quickly enough. Meanwhile Bill Bullen, founder and chief executive of energy supplier Utilita,said that energy prices must be frozen at their current level. ""That's not going to be enough even still for those customers who are on low incomes and vulnerable, maybe have some medical dependencies so some extra help is going to be required,"" he said. He added: ""The reality is when you get up to Â£3,500 a huge number of homes won't be able to afford this."" Mr Vince said there needed to be an overhaul of how electricity prices were decided. ""The price of gas sets the price of electricity in our country and we should break that link - other European countries are looking to do exactly that,"" he said. ""We let global commodity markets set the price that we pay for gas from our own North Sea and we are paying up to 10 times more for that right now."" He added: ""Half of the gas that Britain uses come from our North Sea if we price cap that we take away half the problem.""

PM backs nuclear power plant fundingThe Sizewell C plant is expected to cost Â£20bn and could provide the UK with 7% of its electricity.,"The planned Sizewell C plant is expected to cost about Â£20bn Prime Minister Boris Johnson has backed plans to part-fund the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast, Whitehall sources said. The government is expected to confirm it will invest in the estimated Â£20bn project within weeks. Itgave the go-ahead for the new plant in Julywith negotiations on raising funds for the development continuing. Other sources have said a final decision will be made in 2023 and will be for the new prime minister to make. The project, mainly funded by the French energy company EDF, is expected to generate about 7% of the UK's electricity needs and operate for 60 years. It would be built next to the existing Sizewell B, which is still generating electricity, and Sizewell A, which has been decommissioned. EDF has said the new two-reactor plant could generate 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, enough for about six million homes. Sizewell C would be built just south of RSPB Minsmere A government confirmation of its investment decision would allow private capital to be raised to help fund the development. But sources have said a final decision will be made by the new prime minister. Sizewell C, on the right, would be built next to Sizewell B, centre, which is still generating, and Sizewell A, far left, which operated until 2006 and is being decommissioned Aletter leaked to the Sunday Times,externalshows the chief secretary to the Treasury - Simon Clarke - has raised concerns that a decision now, could tie the hands of the next prime minister. According to the paper, Mr Clarke says the costs of Sizewell C are ""sufficient to materially affect spending and fiscal choices for an incoming government, especially in the context of wider pressures on the public finances"". The BBC has approached Mr Clarke for comment but a government source suggested he was fulfilling his duty as chief secretary. A government spokeswoman said: ""Nuclear power has a key role to play as we work to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global gas prices. ""Negotiations are still ongoing on Sizewell C and as these are active and commercially sensitive discussions we cannot comment further."" New nuclear power plant gets go-ahead How much nuclear power does the UK use? What is Sizewell C? Local anti-nuclear campaigners have objected to the plant on several grounds, including that it would have a negative effect on wildlife and campaign group Stop Sizewell C has said it will continue to oppose the project. Anti-nuclear campaigners protesting on the beach in the shadow of the decommissioned Sizewell A, which generated electricity between 1966 and 2006 A spokeswoman said: ""Our next prime minister should call Sizewell C in. ""There are so many better ways to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers' money than on a project that won't light a single lightbulb for at least a decade.""

"UK inflation could hit 18% next year, bank warnsCiti bank also warns that without government support typical energy bills could hit Â£3,717 in October.Business","Rising energy prices could push UK inflation as high as 18% next year, the highest rate in nearly 50 years, economic analysts have predicted. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise -hit 10.1% in July, five times the Bank of England's (BoE) target. Investment bank Citi said inflation was ""entering the stratosphere"" and could rise to 18%, while the Resolution Foundation said it could reach 18.3%. The BoE predicted inflation will rise to more than 13% in the coming months. Citi's forecast - which would be the UK's highest rate of inflation since 1976 - comes ahead of Friday's energy price cap announcement on the maximum amount suppliers can charge households for gas and electricity from October. The investment bank's forecast is at the higher end of the scale compared to those made by other economists, such as EY-Parthenon which has forecast inflation to be at 15.4%. However, economists at the Resolution Foundation think tank told the BBC that based on the current price cap predictions and the latest data on the rate prices are rising at, inflation could go as high as 18.3%. Citi's chief UK economist, Benjamin Nabarro, said affordability concerns were ""growing more deafening by the day"". ""The question now is what policy may do to offset the impact on both inflation and the real economy,"" he said. How high will my energy bill go and can I reduce it? How will I get the cost-of-living payments? Consultancy Cornwall Insight now expects a typical household energy bill to Â£3,554 a year from October. This is slightly below its previous forecast. However, it now expects energy regulator Ofgem to announce a price cap in January of Â£4,650, which is higher than its previous estimate of Â£4,266. Its calculations reflected a 15% increase in wholesale prices in the last week, Cornwall said. But the ""highly volatile nature of the market"" means these figures are expected to go up and down over the next couple of months, it added. From October, all UK households will see their energy bill reduced by Â£400 through monthly instalments over six months, with a reduction of Â£66 in October and November, and of Â£67 a month from December to March 2023. Eight million low-income households have already begun to get support for the rising cost of living, with the first instalment of payments totalling Â£650 hitting bank accounts in July. But Citi said, without further government support, the price cap could hit Â£3,717 in October and Â£4,567 in January, reaching Â£5,816 in April. Octopus Energy chief executive Greg Jackson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the price of beer had risen as much as gas prices, buying a pint would cost Â£25. ""People don't know what a therm is, but, underneath it, the price per therm has gone from 60p to around Â£5 at the moment and that's what's passing through to customers if we don't do something,"" he said. Sarah Coles, a senior personal finance analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said there were 10 food groups that have seen their prices rise more than 18.6% in the past year, including bread, milk, pasta and butter. ""Inflation at 18.6% would push millions of people into dire straits,"" she said. ""And because these horrible price hikes are being driven by the essentials people need to stay alive - like food and heat - it's going to hit those on lower incomes hardest, who've got nothing left to give."" The Bank of England has been raising interest rates since December and earlier this month implemented its largest increase - 0.5% - in 27 years to take borrowing costs to 1.75%. But Citi said it expects the Bank to increase interest rates even higher, to as much as 7%, to control inflation. On Monday European gas prices rose sharply due to supply fears, after Russian energy firm Gazprom announced it would shut down the Nord Stream 1 pipeline - the main gas export route to Germany - to complete three days of unplanned maintenance. British gas for immediate delivery was also up 37% to 503p per therm. Oil and gas analysts at Investec said, in a briefing note, that it anticipated UK gas prices to remain elevated if Russia continues to restrict supplies to Europe. ""This is remarkable in summer, when gas demand for heating is at its lowest,"" its analysts said. ""The outlook for UK/European gas prices are to remain high - even in 2025 it is three-times the 10-year average."" Predicting the peak of inflation levels has been a mug's game in the last nine months. The Bank of England originally predicted last year it would peak at 5%, then 10, then 13. HSBC recently revised its forecasts to 14% and on Monday global investment bank Citi set a new high watermark of 18%. Almost all of this inflation of inflation estimates has been caused by rocketing gas prices, which find their way into almost everything we buy. What is clear is that the forces that have propelled prices higher look like they are going to get worse before they get better. Read more of Simon Jack'sanalysis here.

"Energy customers can't carry cost of war, says bossThe government must stop bills being pushed up by the Ukraine war, the boss of Octopus Energy says.","Average energy bills in the UK are predicted to reach Â£3,582 a year in October UK households cannot carry the cost of the Ukraine war which is set to push energy bills even higher, the boss of Octopus Energy has said. Greg Jackson was speaking as UK households brace for average energy bills to reach a predicted Â£3,554 a year in October and Â£4,650 in January. He called for the government to double its financial support or freeze the amount suppliers can charge for energy. No 10 previously said there would be no new policybefore a new PM is in place. The new Conservative Party leader will be announced on 5 September and will face immediate pressure to tackle the nation's energy bills. The current favourite, Liz Truss, has promised tax cuts and recently hinted atdirect financial help for hard-pressed households. Her rival, Rishi Sunak, has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero. The upcoming jump in energy prices has prompted investment bank Citi to raise his forecast of UK inflation to 18% in early 2023. Inflation - the rate at which prices rise - is currently at10.1% and the Bank of England's target is 2%. What is the energy price cap? How will I get the Â£400 energy grant? On Friday, the energy price cap - the maximum amount suppliers can charge customers in England, Scotland and Wales for each unit of energy - will be announced. Energy prices have risen sharply because demand for gas increased when Covid restrictions eased while the war in Ukraine has disrupted supplies from Russia. Mr Jackson, founder and chief executive of Octopus Energy Group, said: ""You can't expect the energy customers, or indeed the retailers to carry the cost of a war."" Asked what the solution could be, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government ""could double the existing support package"". In October, all UK households will get aÂ£400 discount on their fuel billsand some eight million low-income households will get an additional Â£650. Plans to enable households to getdiscounts on electricity bills if they cut use at peak timesare set to be announced by the National Grid in the next two weeks. Mr Jackson also suggested a""tariff deficit fund"",externalwhich would involve the government freezing the energy price cap roughly where it is. The government would borrow money from banks to pay the difference between the wholesale cost and the price to the consumer while energy prices were high. This money would be paid back when energy prices came down, he said. Dale Vince, chief executive of renewable energy generator and supplier Ecotricity, told the BBC: ""The government does need to intervene we shouldn't expect customers to pay the cost of this failure and the Ukraine war."" He said the problem pre-dated the invasion of Ukraine and there was a ""systemic failure in the energy market"". But he said the deficit scheme Mr Jackson had outlined would force taxpayers to foot the bill over the next decade. ""The government simply needs to step in and pick up this cost like it did in the pandemic,"" he said. ""We need Â£40bn to get through this winter. That's 10% of what was spent during the pandemic and that's the only thing that will really sort this problem out."" This summer has seen forecasts, suggestions and a lot of political debate. What it has not seen is certainty. On Friday, households will finally be told exactly by how much domestic energy bills will rise in October. Remember, individual bills will vary, depending on how much gas and electricity you use. But the percentage increase in the domestic energy price cap for England, Wales and Scotland will be official and expressed in clear terms. Energy will be more expensive, but at least people will have some basis to plan for the financial hit. That said, the uncertainty won't be over. What extra support, if any, that is provided by government won't be clear until a new prime minister is in place. Energy prices for the second half of the winter are also unclear. Energy bosses say fundamental change in the sector doesn't come quickly, but help for householders facing soaring bills as the nights draw in cannot come quickly enough. Meanwhile Bill Bullen, founder and chief executive of energy supplier Utilita,said that energy prices must be frozen at their current level. ""That's not going to be enough even still for those customers who are on low incomes and vulnerable, maybe have some medical dependencies so some extra help is going to be required,"" he said. He added: ""The reality is when you get up to Â£3,500 a huge number of homes won't be able to afford this."" Mr Vince said there needed to be an overhaul of how electricity prices were decided. ""The price of gas sets the price of electricity in our country and we should break that link - other European countries are looking to do exactly that,"" he said. ""We let global commodity markets set the price that we pay for gas from our own North Sea and we are paying up to 10 times more for that right now."" He added: ""Half of the gas that Britain uses come from our North Sea if we price cap that we take away half the problem.""

Inside the secret world of trading nudes,"Women are facing threats and blackmail from a mob of anonymous strangers after their personal details, intimate photos and videos were shared on the social media platform Reddit. The BBC has unmasked the man behind one of the groups, thanks to a second-hand cigarette lighter. ""Â£5 for her nudes, DM me."" ""I've got some of her vids looking to trade."" ""What are we gonna do to her?"" I felt sick as I scrolled through the images and comments online. There were thousands of photographs. A seemingly endless stream of naked or partially dressed women. Underneath, men were posting vicious commentary about the women, including rape threats. Much of what I saw was too explicit to share here. A tip-off from a friend had brought me to these images. One of her pictures had been lifted from Instagram and posted on Reddit. It was not a nude but was still accompanied by sexual and degrading language. She was concerned for herself and other women. What I found was a marketplace. Hundreds of anonymous profiles were dedicated to sharing, trading and selling explicit images - and it all appeared to be without the permission of the women pictured. It seemed like a new evolution of so-called revenge porn, where private sexual material is published online without consent, often by embittered ex-partners. Not only were these intimate images being shared for an audience of thousands, but men - lurking behind the mask of anonymity - were teaming up to expose the real-life identities of these women, a practice known as doxing. Addresses, phone numbers and social media handles were being swapped online - the women then being targeted with lurid sexual comments, threats and blackmail. It felt like I had stumbled into a very dark corner of the internet, but this was all happening on a major social media platform. Reddit brands itself as ""the front page of the internet"". It has built an audience of about 50 million daily users - roughly four million in the UK - by letting people set up and run forums, known as ""subreddits"", dedicated to all kinds of interests. Most subreddits are harmless, but Reddit has a history of hosting controversial sexual content. In 2014, a huge cache of private images of celebrities was shared on the site, and four years later Reddit shut down a group which was using ""deepfake"" technology - a kind of artificial intelligence - to superimpose celebrities into porn videos. Responding to these controversies, the US-based company introduced stricter rules and strengthened its ban on posting or threatening to post intimate or sexually explicit media of people without their consent. I wanted to understand how women's intimate photographs were still being shared on Reddit and what it was like for those affected. Then I wanted to find out who was behind it. I could see that Reddit's ban wasn't working. We found dozens of subreddits dedicated to sharing intimate images of women from all over the UK. The first one I looked at was focused on South Asian women and had more than 20,000 users, most of whom seemed to be men from the same community, with comments in English, Hindi, Urdu and Punjabi. Some of the women I recognised because they had large social media followings. A few I even knew personally. There were more than 15,000 images. We looked at a thousand of them and found sexually explicit pictures of 150 different women. All were being dehumanised as sexual objects in the comments. I was sure none of the women would have consented to appearing on this forum. Anonymous users shared women's images while making degrading comments and threats Some, like the one my friend discovered of herself, were images lifted from the women's social media and weren't explicit. But they were accompanied by degrading comments and sometimes requests to hack victims' phones and computers for nudes. One woman we contacted says she now gets intrusive, sexual messages on social media ""every day"" after the group posted an image of her in a crop top from Instagram, alongside comments about raping her. The men on the subreddit were also sharing and selling naked photos of the women. These images looked like selfies which had been sent between partners and were not meant for public consumption. There were also videos - even more graphic - where it appeared as though the women had been secretly filmed during sex. One thread of messages featured images of a naked woman giving oral sex. ""Anyone got any vids of this [expletive]?"" an anonymous user asked, using a derogatory name for her. ""I have her whole folder for Â£5, snap me,"" another said. ""What's her socials,"" asked a third. Ayesha - not her real name - discovered videos of her were being shared on the subreddit last year. She believes she had been secretly filmed by an ex-partner. She didn't just have to deal with the violation of her trust, she also faced a wave of harassment and threats on social media when her personal details were posted on the forum. ""If you don't have sex with me, I'll send it to your parents. I will come and find youâ¦ If you don't agree to having sex with me, I will rape you."" Her harassers tried to blackmail her for more images as well. ""Being a Pakistani girl, it's not right in our community for us to even get sexual before marriage or anything like that - that's not acceptable,"" she says. Ayesha stopped socialising or even leaving the house, and eventually tried to take her own life. After her suicide attempt, she had to tell her parents what had happened. Her mother and father both fell into depression, she says. ""I felt so ashamed of everything that was going on and that I'd put them in this situation,"" she says. Ayesha contacted Reddit several times. On one occasion, a video was deleted almost immediately but it took four months to remove another. And it didn't end there. The deleted content had already been shared on other social media sites and eventually appeared back on the original subreddit a month later. The subreddit that shamed and harassed Ayesha was set up and moderated by a user called Zippomad - a name that would eventually provide the clue to tracking him down. Forum users worked together to share women's personal details to find them in real life As moderator, Zippomad was supposed to make sure his subreddit discussion group followed Reddit's rules. But he did the opposite. Since first tracking his subreddit, I've seen him create new versions of it three times - after each previous version was shut down by Reddit due to complaints. Each new incarnation used a variation of the same name, which includes a racial slur too offensive to repeat. Each one was filled with the same material - and each had thousands of active users. The trade in nudes has become widespread enough for experts in online abuse to give it a name: collector culture. Clare McGlynn, a law professor at the University of Durham who's an expert on this kind of online abuse, says: ""This is not a phenomenon of perverts or weirdos or other oddballs who are doing this. There are too many of them, and it's tens of thousands of men."" Trading images takes place in small, private chat groups in messaging apps as well as websites where tens of thousands of men gather, Prof McGlynn says. She says many of the men involved gain status in these communities by building up large collections of non-consensual images. This obsessive hoarding can make it hard to stamp out, as Ayesha found out when deleted videos were simply reposted from other collections. The Secret World of Trading Nudes Monika Plaha investigates the disturbing online trade in sexually explicit images and video of women, often taken and posted on social media without their consent. Watch on BBC iPlayer(UK Only) Seven women who've tried to get their images removed from Reddit told me they didn't feel the company was doing enough to help. Four said the material was never removed by Reddit and some had to wait eight months before content was deleted. Reddit has told us it removed just over 88,000 non-consensual sexual images last year and says it takes the issue ""extremely seriously"". It says it uses automated tools and has a team of staff to find and remove intimate images published without permission. It adds that it regularly takes action, including closing down forums. ""We know we have more work to do to prevent, detect, and action this content even more quickly and accurately, and we are investing now in our teams, tools, and processes to achieve this goal,"" a company spokesperson said. Like tech companies, UK law is struggling to protect women from having their private images shared online. Georgie says a loophole in the law meant her ex-partner could not be prosecuted after he shared explicit images of her When Georgie was contacted by a stranger and told explicit images of her were being shared on the internet, she went to the police. She knew that only one person should have had access to them. ""I can't even compute how many people might have already seen them? And there is no way of stopping more people seeing them. In this moment, right now, people might be looking at them,"" she says. Her ex-partner texted her to admit sharing the images, but she says he told her ""he didn't mean to hurt or embarrass me"". That part of his confession turned out to be a legal loophole. Existing legislation against revenge porn across the UK requires proof that the person sharing photos without permission is doing it to cause distress to the victim. The Law Commission, an independent advisory body to the government, has recommended removing the requirement to prove intent to cause harm. But the Online Safety Bill currently progressing through Parliament does not include that change. I wanted to track down Zippomad, the Reddit user who created the forum targeting South Asian women - including Ayesha. As I looked through his history of comments on the site, there was no real name, email address or pictures to be found. Only his username provided a clue as to who he was - he collected Zippo lighters and had one for sale. So I got in touch using a fake account and offered to buy it. He agreed to set up a meeting and our undercover reporter finally came face-to-face with the man who had created the forum where the privacy of so many women had been violated. His name is Himesh Shingadia. He's university-educated and works as a manager at a large company. It wasn't who I expected to find at all. Himesh Shingadia says he set up the Reddit forum to ""appreciate South Asian women"" After Panorama contacted him, Mr Shingadia deleted his subreddit. In a statement, he says the group had been intended to ""appreciate South Asian women"". Due to the high number of users, he says he found it impossible to moderate the forum. He says he never shared anyone's private details or traded images himself and says he helped to remove some sexually explicit material when asked to by women. ""Zippomad is deeply embarrassed and ashamed of his actions, this does not reflect his real personality,"" the statement says. Reddit has also removed the other, similar groups that we highlighted to the company. It means almost a thousand women have, at last, had their images taken down - but that's little comfort after the pain of unwanted exposure. Tech companies and legislators will need to make changes to prevent more women from being exploited by this trade. As Georgie says about the ex-partner who shared her images: ""I don't want to punish him. I want him to never do it again.""

"Choose tax cuts or bills help, Sunak warns Truss","Liz Truss is avoiding scrutiny of her ""dangerous"" plans to tackle the cost of living crisis, her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak has claimed. Ms Truss has promised an ""emergency budget"" if she becomes prime minister in two weeks' time. She will reverse National Insurance rises and stop business tax hikes - and has hinted at further cash support for families struggling with energy bills. But she will not ask for a forecast of how this will impact the economy. Mr Sunak - who is trailing Ms Truss in polls of Tory members who are selecting the next PM - has seized on this as evidence that her sums do not add up. The former chancellor hasinsisted he still has a ""shot"" at Downing Street, even though many Tory members will have already cast their ballots. Help is coming with cost of living, says minister Recall Parliament over cost of living, Labour says Warning Tory leadership tax cut pledges unrealistic He says Ms Truss' plans will put the UK's public finances in ""serious jeopardy"" and fuel inflation, leading to even higher prices in the shops. In an interview with Vanessa Feltz on BBC Radio 2, he said: ""Liz's plans are promising the earth to everybody. I don't think you can have your cake and eat it. ""I don't think life's that simple, and I think her plan risks making the situation worse when you're borrowing that much money for tax cuts at a time when inflation's already going up."" Last month,the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which scrutinises government tax and spending plans, warned that UK debt is already on an ""unsustainable path"" because of inflation and other factors. Ms Truss has argued that tax cuts will help to grow the UK's economy and boost prosperity. Her team say there is no need for the OBR to produce new forecasts, because she is not planning a full budget, though will introduce tax cuts. ""The cost of living crisis means immediate action is required,"" a spokeswoman for Ms Truss' campaign said. ""A Truss government would seek to act as soon as possible to help people across the UK, by cutting taxes and introducing a temporary moratorium on energy levies."" The OBR usually requires 10 weeks to carry out an analysis of government economic plans, such as a budget. But a spokesperson for the OBR said: ""We would be prepared to publish a forecast for the new chancellor, should they request it."" The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Mel Stride, has written to the chancellor and the OBR to ask whether preparations were being made for a potential emergency budget when a new prime minister takes office. Mr Stride - a supporter of Mr Sunak - said bringing in ""significant tax cuts without a forecast would be ill advised"", likening it to ""flying blind"". Ms Truss' campaign defended her economic plan as ""sensible"" and said a ""new approach"" to the economy was needed. Her team say they will not reveal what she will do to help families with bills until the leadership contest is over, on 5 September. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, a Truss ally who is being tipped as her chancellor, said: ""Of course, she will look at what more can be done to help families, but it is entirely reasonable not to detail the exact shape of that support until she has all the information to hand."" The Sunak campaign says Ms Truss' plans are a ""mystery"" because she cannot deliver help with bills and Â£50bn worth of unfunded tax cuts in one go. ""It's no wonder they want to avoid independent scrutiny of the OBR in their emergency budget - they know you can't do both and it's time they came clean about that now,"" a spokesperson added. Mr Sunak has said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he becomes prime minister. He has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero and to cut 3p off income tax by 2029. Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake, a supporter of Mr Sunak, urged Ms Truss to stop offering ""the magic money tree"" and instead focus on what support she could offer to low-income households. ""These people are going to be on the streets,"" Mr Hollinrake told Sky News. ""Things are going to be that bad for some households."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer joined in with criticism of Ms Truss' decision not to ask the OBR to scrutinise her plans. He said:  ""We need an emergency budget. We should have had that months ago, to deal with the cost of living crisis. But the OBR is there to make sure that money is spent wisely and properly. So of course you need the OBR in place for that."" He added: ""Labour is leading on this, we have said freeze those bills this winter, make sure people don't pay any more for their energy."" The Institute for Fiscal Studieshas called pledgesby both Tory leadership candidates ""unrealistic"" unless they are matched by spending cuts. The cost of living crisis is being driven by several factors, including soaring energy bills and inflation outstripping wage increases. Last week, the UK's inflation rate hit 10.1%, with rising food and drink prices making the largest contribution to the change.

Actors to get nudity warning in anti-bullying moveA commitment to stopping inappropriate behaviour in TV is set out by entertainment union Equity.,"Actors will get prior written warning about the scope and extent of nudity and any simulated sex requested Equity has committed to ensuring actors are given nudity warnings as part of a move ""against bullying, harassment and inappropriate behaviour in TV"". The performing arts and entertainment trade union shared its fresh ""statement of commitment"". It brings together 21 major organisations, in the UK and abroad, including the BBC, ITV and Channel 4. The commitment, also backed by Sky, HBO and Warner Bros, comes with the warning that ""no one is untouchable"". In a statement, the union said it was part of a ""move towards a culture in which everyone working in the TV industry feels able to call out unacceptable behaviour, and that nobody is above being challenged: no one is untouchable"". It added ""everyone has a responsibility for creating an inclusive and respectful culture - and that by working together we can deliver real and lasting change in the industry"". This video can not be played Weinstein legacy: Life after #MeToo Equity president Lynda Rooke applauded the move, saying: ""On behalf of every performer who has experienced bullying and harassment during their on screen working lives, I welcome this commitment by industry representatives to create a safe working environment where everyone is treated with dignity and respect. ""But to establish an inclusive and respectful culture requires actions not just words, and I encourage all those working in this sector to recognise their individual responsibility to report inappropriate behaviour and unite against any pressure to remain silent on these issues."" Dame Emma defends 'important' intimacy directors 'People fear for their jobs if they report bullies' Me Too founder says movement not over Prior written warning about the scope and extent of nudity and any simulated sex requested will be provided going forward, the collective has agreed, followed by a discussion and agreement with the artist. And for scenes of an intimate nature, an intimacy co-ordinator will be engaged, if acceptable to the actors involved. Earlier this month, actresses including Dame Emma Thompson defended the use of intimacy co-ordinators - increasingly used on film and TV sets and in theatres in the years - after actor Sean Bean had said they ""spoil the spontaneity"" of sex scenes. The union also discussed and agreed to ensuring safe casting and audition spaces, and for producers to have clear respect at work policies, which include a process for addressing concerns and making complaints about bullying and harassment. The statement also included the prominent display of contact information relating to safeguarding and support - from proactive trained senior staff - for each production. Anti-bullying and harassment training will now be mandatory for every cast and crew too. Ralph Lee, director of content at BBC Studios Productions said it was ""important that as an industry we work together to ensure there is a safe and respectful working environment within the production community"". Signing up to the statement of commitment, he stressed, would ""strengthen our ability to continue to improve making this happen"". David Osborn, chief people officer at ITV, said it was ""crucial that all contributors to our industry work together to combat bullying and inappropriate behaviour"". The commitment comes in the period following the emergence of the#MeToo movement, which saw widespread allegations of abuse in the entertainment industry.

"English beach sewage not monitored properly - dataSome water firms fail to install devices that measure storm overflows, according to the Lib Dems.Science & EnvironmentComments","This video can not be played Watch: Untreated sewage water released into the Sussex sea Water companies have been accused of failing to monitor sewage discharges at popular British seaside resorts. Data analysed by the Liberal Democrats found that many monitoring devices had either not been installed or do not work ""90% of the time"". The Lib Dems said the data showed a quarter of sewage discharges went unmonitored last year as a result of a lack of monitors or faults. Water firms have insisted they are committed to tackling the issue. In Seaford, East Sussex, where the beach is popular with swimmers and families, a monitor was only working a third of the time, according to a review ofdata from the Environment Agency,external. Southern Water wasforced to apologiselast week after beaches in East Sussex were closed due to untreated wastewater being released into the sea at the shoreline. Pollution warnings were put in place across more than 40 beaches and swimming spots in England and Wales after heavy rain overwhelmed sewer systems. Particular concern was raised over a handful of beaches that have bathing water status - including Littlehampton in West Sussex and Lee-on-Solent in Hampshire - where the Lib Dems said some Event Duration Monitoring (EDM) devices were not installed at all. Across Devon and Cornwall, one in eight of South West Water's sewage monitors installed at designated bathing locations were also either faulty or not installed, they said. Bathing water status is given to locations where ministers expect ""a large number of people to bathe"" based on past trends. Raw sewage was pumped into rivers and coasts around 375,000 times in 2021,down 25,000 from the previous year, according to the Environment Agency. The agency said it increased the number of combined sewer overflows (CSOs) monitored across the network from 800 in 2016 to more than 12,000 in 2020. All 15,000 will have them by the end of 2023, it added. The government previously said it wanted to reduce discharges into bathing waters by 70% by 2035, and eliminate 160,000 incidents of sewage overflows by 2040. Water minister Steve Double said earlier this week: ""We are the first government to take action to tackle sewage overflows. ""Work on tackling sewage overflows continues at pace."" Dr Imogen Napper, a postdoctoral researcher in marine pollution at the University of Plymouth, said for such goals to be met more ""investment and accountability is required from water companies to ensure this environmental disaster is not repeated"". ""The protection of our environment, and the community that enjoy it, is paramount,"" she told BBC News, adding it was ""environmental vandalism"" for raw sewage to ""enter our environment due to [companies] cutting corners and a lack of appropriate infrastructure"". When all monitors were considered - not just those in spots with bathing status - the Lib Dem analysis found that the water company with the worst record was Anglian Water, which had less than half (49%) its sewage discharges measured due to a faulty monitor or the fact one was never installed. This was followed by South West Water (30%) and Severn Trent Water (29%). Stanley Johnson, the prime minister's father, blamed his son's administration for the sewage problem, saying it should have been pressed harder. Linking the problem to Brexit, he said Britain's beaches got a ""clean up"" after joining the European Union in 1973. Without the ""EU push"", he added, the UK faces a ""very dangerous and difficult situation"". Both Anglian Water and Southern Water told BBC News work had already been done to improve the issue. ""All but three of the places designated for bathing in our region are rated as good or excellent for bathing water quality, and all have EDM monitors installed on them,"" an Anglian Water spokeswoman said. She added the company planned to have devices installed ""across all CSOs by the end of 2023"". Sewage hits dozens of UK beaches after heavy rain Tory MPs defend votes after uproar over sewage plan Yorkshire Water fined Â£1.6m for sewage pollution At Southern, a spokesman said the company has monitors on ""87.8% of our storm overflows, giving us the ability to report pollutions more accurately"". He added: ""This covers 959 of our 974 overflows - one of the highest levels in the industry. ""We have committed to Â£145m of investment to drive down pollutions by 2025."" Lib Dem MP Tim Farron, the party's environment spokesperson, described a ""national scandal"" in which water companies could be guilty of ""gross negligence by failing to install sewage monitors"". Meanwhile, a spokesman for water regulator Ofwat said it was currently investigating ""all wastewater companies"" in England and Wales due to ""concerns"" over how they ""manage their treatment works"".

Tory MPslast year defended themselvesafter 256 voted with the government to reject an attempt by the House of Lords to bolster the Environment Bill.

PM backs nuclear power plant funding,"The planned Sizewell C plant is expected to cost about Â£20bn Prime Minister Boris Johnson has backed plans to part-fund the Sizewell C nuclear power plant on the Suffolk coast, Whitehall sources said. The government is expected to confirm it will invest in the estimated Â£20bn project within weeks. Itgave the go-ahead for the new plant in Julywith negotiations on raising funds for the development continuing. Other sources have said a final decision will be made in 2023 and will be for the new prime minister to make. The project, mainly funded by the French energy company EDF, is expected to generate about 7% of the UK's electricity needs and operate for 60 years. It would be built next to the existing Sizewell B, which is still generating electricity, and Sizewell A, which has been decommissioned. EDF has said the new two-reactor plant could generate 3.2 gigawatts (GW) of electricity, enough for about six million homes. Sizewell C would be built just south of RSPB Minsmere A government confirmation of its investment decision would allow private capital to be raised to help fund the development. But sources have said a final decision will be made by the new prime minister. Sizewell C, on the right, would be built next to Sizewell B, centre, which is still generating, and Sizewell A, far left, which operated until 2006 and is being decommissioned Aletter leaked to the Sunday Times,externalshows the chief secretary to the Treasury - Simon Clarke - has raised concerns that a decision now, could tie the hands of the next prime minister. According to the paper, Mr Clarke says the costs of Sizewell C are ""sufficient to materially affect spending and fiscal choices for an incoming government, especially in the context of wider pressures on the public finances"". The BBC has approached Mr Clarke for comment but a government source suggested he was fulfilling his duty as chief secretary. A government spokeswoman said: ""Nuclear power has a key role to play as we work to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels and exposure to volatile global gas prices. ""Negotiations are still ongoing on Sizewell C and as these are active and commercially sensitive discussions we cannot comment further."" New nuclear power plant gets go-ahead How much nuclear power does the UK use? What is Sizewell C? Local anti-nuclear campaigners have objected to the plant on several grounds, including that it would have a negative effect on wildlife and campaign group Stop Sizewell C has said it will continue to oppose the project. Anti-nuclear campaigners protesting on the beach in the shadow of the decommissioned Sizewell A, which generated electricity between 1966 and 2006 A spokeswoman said: ""Our next prime minister should call Sizewell C in. ""There are so many better ways to spend billions of pounds of taxpayers' money than on a project that won't light a single lightbulb for at least a decade.""

"Mum puts hopes in experimental Long Covid trialKate Stott will travel from Aberdeen to Germany to get experimental treatment for blood microclots.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","Kate Stott finds it difficult to keep up with her two youngest children Beau and Jude An Aberdeen mother-of-three whose life has been put on hold by Long Covid will travel to Germany this week for experimental treatment. Kate Stott says her world has been transformed since she contracted the virus more than two years ago. She told BBC Scotland her continuing symptoms were debilitating. But Mrs Stott has now agreed to therapy targeting tiny blood clots which some doctors believe could be a core cause of the condition. Long Covid: Will I ever get better? What are the symptoms of Long Covid? The latest ONS figures estimate 164,000 people are living with Long Covid in Scotland and 57,000 of those have been dealing with the illness for more than 12 months. The Scottish government has allocated Â£3m this year to improve care for Long Covid patients. But for some sufferers, the lack of treatment options has seen them look further afield for help. Mrs Stott suffers constant fatigue as well as numerous other symptoms Mrs Stott, 36, woke up in March 2020 with a sore throat. Two-and-a-half years later her life is unrecognisable. She told BBC Scotland: ""First I was so incredibly tired. I was sleeping a lot of the time. ""Then, as the weeks progressed, stranger symptoms would arrive, like shortness of breath, lots of problems with my mobility, rashes everywhere. ""That was the beginning of questioning what was wrong."" The former Scottish businesswoman of the year had Long Covid. The go-getting entrepreneur had to close her business and was soon spending most of her time on the couch. She also had to rely on crutches to get around.

""I just want to try to relieve some of these symptoms. I am not expecting a magic pill."" Microclots are emerging as a potential key to unlocking Long Covid treatment. Some symptoms of Long Covid could be down to tiny clots blocking up the smallest blood vessels called capillaries. Our major arteries and veins are like motorways around our bodies, but capillaries do the actual job of getting oxygen and nutrients to the individual cells of our bodies. Crucially, capillaries also clear away the waste products of our metabolism. Blocked capillaries could lead to cells becoming rapidly distressed. Dr David Strain, from the NHS Long Covid Taskforce, said: ""That could account for why some people start the day feeling great because the body's had time to replenish itself, but very, very quickly, they become exhausted."" Research has also shown the brain can shrink by between 0.2% and 2% even after mild infection so unrepaired damage is a potential cause of symptoms like brain fog. Kevin Deans, a consultant chemical pathologist at NHS Grampian, is studying how dissolving the tiny clots will allow oxygen back into the organs, effectively ""rebooting the body"". He told BBC Scotland: ""They are these very hard to break down little clots - if we can use medicines to dissolve them, the question then is if this allows things to reset. ""Does that allow the formation to settle down, and hopefully allow improved oxygen supply and blood supply to the body's organ systems? ""Understanding the mechanism is key, and then, can we exploit that mechanism to actually have treatments that benefit people, improve their symptoms and become all or part of a treatment regime that can help people with Long Covid?"" Experimental treatments are being offered at private clinics in Cyprus, Germany, and Switzerland where medics use apheresis, a ""blood washing"" treatment, and anticoagulants - blood thinning drugs. However,there is, as yet, no published and peer reviewed evidence,externalshowing that apheresis and anticoagulation therapy reduce microclots. The ONS publishes updates on the numbers of people who self-report Long Covid symptoms such as fatigue, muscle weakness, breathing difficulties or brain fog. It is likely to be an overestimate as many of these symptoms could also be an indication of something else. Nevertheless there are thousands of people in Scotland living with debilitating symptoms, desperate for help and who feel like they have nowhere to go. Long Covid is a very new disorder and there is not a great deal of data about what treatments work.  There is also no internationally agreed treatment pathway for the condition. In 2021, the Scottish government allocated Â£10m to be spent on Long Covid support with the first Â£3m  going to health boards in May this year. Some believe it is taking too long to set up clear routes to treatment leaving GPs and patients in limbo. They say more could be done to improve diagnosis and to train clinicians as well as investing in research. But many medics also issue a word of caution about spending thousands of pounds on private treatments without clear evidence that they work. Treatments for the condition are limited in Scotland. The Scottish government said it was up to individual health boards to develop and deliver the best models of care which, in time, could include specific Long Covid clinics. A spokesman said: ""Initiatives being supported by the Scottish government's Long Covid Support Fund include key elements of care that are also offered by Long Covid assessment clinics elsewhere in the UK.""

Mum puts hopes in experimental Long Covid trial,"Kate Stott finds it difficult to keep up with her two youngest children Beau and Jude An Aberdeen mother-of-three whose life has been put on hold by Long Covid will travel to Germany this week for experimental treatment. Kate Stott says her world has been transformed since she contracted the virus more than two years ago. She told BBC Scotland her continuing symptoms were debilitating. But Mrs Stott has now agreed to therapy targeting tiny blood clots which some doctors believe could be a core cause of the condition. Long Covid: Will I ever get better? What are the symptoms of Long Covid? The latest ONS figures estimate 164,000 people are living with Long Covid in Scotland and 57,000 of those have been dealing with the illness for more than 12 months. The Scottish government has allocated Â£3m this year to improve care for Long Covid patients. But for some sufferers, the lack of treatment options has seen them look further afield for help. Mrs Stott suffers constant fatigue as well as numerous other symptoms Mrs Stott, 36, woke up in March 2020 with a sore throat. Two-and-a-half years later her life is unrecognisable. She told BBC Scotland: ""First I was so incredibly tired. I was sleeping a lot of the time. ""Then, as the weeks progressed, stranger symptoms would arrive, like shortness of breath, lots of problems with my mobility, rashes everywhere. ""That was the beginning of questioning what was wrong."" The former Scottish businesswoman of the year had Long Covid. The go-getting entrepreneur had to close her business and was soon spending most of her time on the couch. She also had to rely on crutches to get around. Mrs Stott said: ""That feeling you get before you get an operation, and you are put under anaesthetic and they say count down from ten - that is what living with Long Covid fatigue is like. ""You just feel like you are sedated. ""I feel like I have got concussion and that sounds bizarre to anybody else who hasn't experienced it.

Strike continues at UK's biggest container port,"Strike action at the port is expected to last until 29 August A second day of strike action is under way at the UK's busiest container port after workers walked out on Sunday in a pay dispute. The union Unite said about 1,900 of its members were taking action, expected to last eight days, at the Port of Felixstowe in Suffolk. A 7% pay offer from the port operator was described as ""significantly below"" the rate of inflation by Unite. The decision to strike was described by the port as ""disappointing"". A picket line formed for a second time on Monday, with the union saying it would be staffed until 22:00 BST each day of the strike. Which workers are allowed to go on strike? The Port of Felixstowe handles about 48% of container trade, and employs about 2,550 people, Unite said. Port spokesman Paul Davey said the pay offer of ""7% plus Â£500 was ""a very fair offer indeed."" On Monday, he told Sky News that ""a lot of [its] employees, Unite members, don't want to be on strike"" but crossing a picket line was ""a very intimidating atmosphere"". ""We've spoken to a lot of them,"" he said. ""There's a lot of people at home who are quite angry with Unite, that they haven't given them an opportunity to vote on a pay deal which we know many of them would accept. They've told us they would."" Unite national officer, Robert Morton, acknowledged it had not put the employer's offer to its members but said they had wanted an improved pay offer in line with at ""least the rate of inflation"". ""So when we get further up the negotiations, perhaps we will put an offer to them, but it certainly won't be at 7%,"" he said. He suggested a figure between ""7% and 12.3%"" would be ""acceptable"". Strike action is expected to last for eight days Docker Andrew Damant, on the picket line on Monday, said workers wanted a 10% rise. ""My rent was increased by Â£90 six months ago,"" he said. ""We're on pay-as-you-go gas and electric meters [and] whereas gas was Â£20 a month in the summer before, it's now Â£40 a month, the electricity is Â£100 a month and this is only going to go up and up and up."" There is also concern about the impact of the strike on shipping companies. Mark Woodward, from DFDS Seaways, said: ""Longer term, if the situation isn't resolved, it's going to have a reputational impact both on ourselves as DFDS and the Port of Felixstowe as a safe operating zone and customers will look necessarily elsewhere."" The port handles about 48% of the UK container trade Container logistics company, Maersk, has said eight days of no operation will have a ""significant impact"" and it has been left with ""no choice but to omit three services"". UK managing director, Gary Jeffreys, said the containers on those vessels will be ""dropped off"" in Europe and transferred back to Felixstowe or an alternative UK port based on customer preferences within the ""quickest time possible"". ""This is normal practice when we invoke a contingency situation which can be for various reasons from industrial action, labour availability or even weather,"" he said. Mr Jeffreys added that while most customers have told them they are ""well-stocked"", there will be ""fast-moving consumer goods that will be needed quickly"". ""Not everyone, especially small/medium size companies, will have the luxury of significant stocks, they will be hit harder. ""Ultimately everyone is impacted, we will always find ways to keep cargo moving but we need the port and the unions to reach an agreement which means we can return to normal service."" Strike action at the port is expected to last until Monday, 29 August. Find BBC News: East of England onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,external.

"Cineworld confirms it is considering bankruptcyThe cinema chain, which also owns Picturehouse, says it has struggled with poor ticket sales.","Thor: Love And Thunder is one of the biggest movie releases this year Cineworld has confirmed it is considering filing for bankruptcy in the US, as the cinema chain continues to struggle with $5bn worth of debt. But the company, which also owns the Picturehouse chain in the UK, insisted its cinemas ""remain open for business"" and that there would be ""no significant impact"" on jobs. Cineworld employs more than 28,000 people globally. Like other cinema chains, Cineworld was hit hard by the pandemic. Many theatres were forced to close for extended periods during the lockdowns, or had to operate at a reduced capacity due to social distancing rules. Cineworld shares plunge on bankruptcy fears Netflix loses almost a million subscribers Cinema chains had hoped blockbusters such as the latest Bond film, Top Gun: Maverick and Thor: Love And Thunder would draw audiences back in after lockdown restrictions eased. Top Gun: Maverick, starring Tom Cruise, has taken $1.8bn at the global box office, making it one of the top 10 highest grossing films of all time. But last week, Cineworld warned there had still not been enough major releases to attract cinema audiences and said this was hitting admissions. In 2019 before the pandemic, global box office takings hit a record $42.5bn according to Comscore, buoyed by films such as Avengers: Endgame and Frozen 2. So far in 2022, films such as Jurassic World Dominion and Minions: The Rise of Gru have performed strongly. But box office takings this year are down by around a third, or 32%, compared with 2019. Minions: The Rise of Gru is one of the best performing films of 2022 Cinema chains have also been facing tough competition from streaming services, which soared in popularity during the lockdowns. In 2020, a row broke out when Cineworld and rival AMC, which owns the Odeon Cinemas chain, criticised Universal Pictures for releasing Trolls: World Tour online at a time when theatres were forced to close because of coronavirus. Cineworld subsequentlysigned a deal with Warner Brosto show films in theatres before they are streamed. More recently, Netflix reported a sharp fall in subscribers, as the rising cost of living leads to people cutting back. On Friday, shares in Cineworld plunged 60% afterThe Wall Street Journal reported,externalthat the firm was preparing to file for bankruptcy ""within weeks"". Cineworld said on Monday it was looking at various options for how to restructure the business, including a Chapter 11 filing in the US. This allows a company to continue to operate while it negotiates with its creditors. The company would not comment on whether it was also considering entering liquidation in the UK, or what the potential impact could be on its 4,600 employees there. It also would not be drawn on what will happen to people who pay for Cineworld or Picturehouse membership, or who have vouchers, in the event of it filing for bankruptcy. In a statement, the firm said: ""Cineworld would expect to maintain its operations in the ordinary course until and following any filing and ultimately to continue its business over the longer term with no significant impact upon its employees."" Cineworld has 128 cinemas in the UK and Ireland. Globally, it has 9,189 screens across more than 750 sites. It operates in 10 countries, including the US, Poland and Israel. Cineworld currently has a market value of around $69m but is carrying close to $5bn of debt. The firm has expanded through acquisitions around the world. However, two years ago it ditched a plan to take over Cineplex, leading to a protracted legal battle as the Canadian firm sought substantial damages from Cineworld. Shares in Cineworld recovered slightly on Monday morning. But at just over 4p, the share price is still a long way off from where it was at the start of 2020 when it reached 220p before the pandemic struck.

Which workers are allowed to  strike?,"Tougher rules for some workers planning strike action have been announced. The government said it would ensure key services like the NHS are protected, but unions plan legal action. Sometrade union members would be required to continue workingduring a strike, under the proposed law. This would be to ensure a ""minimum level of service"". It would apply to England, Scotland and Wales. The sectors covered are: The NHS Transport Education Fire and rescue Border security Nuclear decommissioning To meet minimum staffing levels - which are still to be announced - employers would be able to issue a ""work notice"" stating the workforce they need. Employees named on the work notice would lose their right to protection from unfair dismissal if they then went on strike. The proposals will not affect strikes happening now, as Parliament needs to approve the changes. While MPs have backed the plans -by 315 votes to 236 votes- they also need to clear the House of Lords. This will be tougher for the government as it has less support in the Lords. Unions have threatened legal action if the new law is passed, while Labour says it would repeal it if it wins the next election. Unions criticise strikes bill as unworkable The strikes taking place in February and March A few professions are already not allowed to strike. Police officers arebanned from taking strike action,external. Nurses have an agreement to only walk out if the wellbeing of patients is unaffected. What will nurses' strike mean for patients? A strike can only happen if a majority of union members agree via an organised vote -known as a ballot.,external There are strict rules,externalaround holding a vote. For example, it must be a postal ballot - where members vote on paper and return it in a prepaid envelope. If workers agree to strike, details must be given to the employer at least 14 days before it begins (unless the union and employer agree to seven days). If the rules aren't followed, a court could prevent a strike. Non-union members can also strike,,externalsays Crystal Boyde, an employment lawyer at Thrive Law. ""As long as the industrial action is lawful, non-union members are allowed to go on strike and remain protected from dismissal,"" she says. UK employees are protected from being sacked during the first 12 weeks of official industrial action. If they are sacked during this period, they can claim unfair dismissal. However, workerscan be dismissed after 12 weeks,externalif the employer has tried to settle the dispute. For example, if an employment adviser likeAcas has been brought in to help find a solution.,external The government has introduced a new law allowing businesses to use agency workers to fill in for striking workers. However, trade unions havemounted a legal challenge,external. Trade unions are organisations which help workers negotiate with employers. They often help employees ask for more pay, or better working conditions. Unions also represent members who have problems at work. If negotiations don't work, a trade union's members might support action such as a strike. Almost one in four UK workers (23%) were union members in 2021 - a total of 6.4 million people,according to government statistics.,external After peaking at 13.2 million in 1979, union membership has fallen significantly - although the rate of decline has slowed. In 2021, 50% of public sector workers - including people like teachers and health workers - were in a union, compared with 13% of private sector employees. Employees over 50 are most likely to be members. Members normally pay a subscription and can leave at any point. Workers on strike can expect to lose wages for the time they do not work. No-one can be forced to take part in a strike - so a worker can choose to work. Picket lines are common sights during strikes The Labour Party was created from the trade union movement in 1900. There are currently12 trade unions,externalaffiliated to the party, including two of the largest - Unison and Unite. Labour relies on unions for funding. During the last general election campaignLabour received a total of Â£5.4m,external- of which Â£5m came from trade union donations. Members of trade unions linked to Labour can apply to be allowed to vote in party leadership elections.

Result due in barristers' all-out strike vote,"Results are due in a barristers' vote on whether they should go on an all-out strike in England and Wales next month. Courts have seen several days of disruption over lawyer walkouts in recent weeks, but members of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) have been voting on whether to stage an indefinite, uninterrupted strike. It is part of an ongoing row with the government over pay and legal aid cuts. Proposed strike action would begin on 5 September. The ballot closed at midnight on Sunday, with results expected on Monday morning. The CBA is asking for a 25% rise in pay for legal aid work, when they represent defendants who could not otherwise afford lawyers. Criminal barristers are due to receive a 15% fee rise from the end of September, with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) saying the increase would see the average barrister earn about Â£7,000 more annually. But members of the CBA have rejected the government's pay offer, saying it would not kick in immediately or apply to existing cases. Some 6,235 court cases were disrupted during the first 19 days of industrial action between 27 June and 5 August - including 1,415 trials - according to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) data. Barristers walk out of courts over pay Barristers to strike every other week from August Victim's father backs barristers' strike action Criminal barrister and former Conservative MP Anna Soubry said more than 500 trials could not go ahead last year due to a shortage of criminal barristers. Sheposted on Twitter,externalthat since 2006 their fees have been cut by 28%, adding: ""We can't recruit or retain."" The former minister urged the government to settle the dispute. ""We want to get back to work and shift the backlog,"" she said. The CBA said the walkouts have had a ""devastating impact on the ability of our crown courts to function with any semblance of normality"". Every barrister who has taken part in the walkouts ""has made the decision to withdraw their labour with a heavy heart"", the CBA said. They added: ""It is a decision to which we have been driven after years and years of abject neglect of the criminal justice system and the cynical exploitation of our time, effort and goodwill by successive governments determined to deliver justice on the cheap."" The CBA said the ""continuing refusal of the justice secretary to negotiate a fair settlement with criminal barristers comes at a very heavy price"". This price can be measured by the financial waste of courtrooms sitting idle and the impact on complainants, defendants and witnesses, the CBA added. An MoJ spokesman said: ""The only outcome of escalating strike action is further distress for victims forced to wait longer for justice."" The MoJ added that backdating pay would require a ""fundamental change"" in how fees are paid. ""That reform would cost a disproportionate amount of taxpayers' money and would take longer to implement, meaning barristers would have to wait longer for payment,"" a spokesperson said.

Sunak attacks Truss plans in last push for votes,"Liz Truss is avoiding scrutiny of her ""dangerous"" plans to tackle the cost of living crisis, her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak has claimed. Ms Truss has promised an ""emergency budget"" if she becomes prime minister in two weeks' time. She will reverse National Insurance rises and stop business tax hikes - and has hinted at further cash support for families struggling with energy bills. But she will not ask for a forecast of how this will impact the economy. Mr Sunak - who is trailing Ms Truss in polls of Tory members who are selecting the next PM - has seized on this as evidence that her sums do not add up. The former chancellor hasinsisted he still has a ""shot"" at Downing Street, even though many Tory members will have already cast their ballots. Help is coming with cost of living, says minister Recall Parliament over cost of living, Labour says Warning Tory leadership tax cut pledges unrealistic He says Ms Truss' plans will put the UK's public finances in ""serious jeopardy"" and fuel inflation, leading to even higher prices in the shops. In an interview with Vanessa Feltz on BBC Radio 2, he said: ""Liz's plans are promising the earth to everybody. I don't think you can have your cake and eat it. ""I don't think life's that simple, and I think her plan risks making the situation worse when you're borrowing that much money for tax cuts at a time when inflation's already going up."" Last month,the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which scrutinises government tax and spending plans, warned that UK debt is already on an ""unsustainable path"" because of inflation and other factors. Ms Truss has argued that tax cuts will help to grow the UK's economy and boost prosperity. Her team say there is no need for the OBR to produce new forecasts, because she is not planning a full budget, though will introduce tax cuts. ""The cost of living crisis means immediate action is required,"" a spokeswoman for Ms Truss' campaign said. ""A Truss government would seek to act as soon as possible to help people across the UK, by cutting taxes and introducing a temporary moratorium on energy levies."" The OBR usually requires 10 weeks to carry out an analysis of government economic plans, such as a budget. But a spokesperson for the OBR said: ""We would be prepared to publish a forecast for the new chancellor, should they request it."" The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Mel Stride, has written to the chancellor and the OBR to ask whether preparations were being made for a potential emergency budget when a new prime minister takes office. Mr Stride - a supporter of Mr Sunak - said bringing in ""significant tax cuts without a forecast would be ill advised"", likening it to ""flying blind"". Ms Truss' campaign defended her economic plan as ""sensible"" and said a ""new approach"" to the economy was needed. Her team say they will not reveal what she will do to help families with bills until the leadership contest is over, on 5 September. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, a Truss ally who is being tipped as her chancellor, said: ""Of course, she will look at what more can be done to help families, but it is entirely reasonable not to detail the exact shape of that support until she has all the information to hand."" The Sunak campaign says Ms Truss' plans are a ""mystery"" because she cannot deliver help with bills and Â£50bn worth of unfunded tax cuts in one go. ""It's no wonder they want to avoid independent scrutiny of the OBR in their emergency budget - they know you can't do both and it's time they came clean about that now,"" a spokesperson added. Mr Sunak has said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he becomes prime minister. He has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero and to cut 3p off income tax by 2029. Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake, a supporter of Mr Sunak, urged Ms Truss to stop offering ""the magic money tree"" and instead focus on what support she could offer to low-income households. ""These people are going to be on the streets,"" Mr Hollinrake told Sky News. ""Things are going to be that bad for some households."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer joined in with criticism of Ms Truss' decision not to ask the OBR to scrutinise her plans. He said:  ""We need an emergency budget. We should have had that months ago, to deal with the cost of living crisis. But the OBR is there to make sure that money is spent wisely and properly. So of course you need the OBR in place for that."" He added: ""Labour is leading on this, we have said freeze those bills this winter, make sure people don't pay any more for their energy."" The Institute for Fiscal Studieshas called pledgesby both Tory leadership candidates ""unrealistic"" unless they are matched by spending cuts. The cost of living crisis is being driven by several factors, including soaring energy bills and inflation outstripping wage increases. Last week, the UK's inflation rate hit 10.1%, with rising food and drink prices making the largest contribution to the change.

Telegram: Why won't you take down my naked photos?,"A BBC investigation has found that women's intimate pictures are being shared to harass, shame and blackmail them on a massive scale, on the social media app Telegram. WARNING: THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS CONTENT OF A SEXUAL NATURE In the split second Sara found out a nude photo of her had been leaked and shared on Telegram, her life changed. Her Instagram and Facebook profiles had been added, and her phone number included. Suddenly she was being contacted by unknown men asking for more pictures. ""They made me feel like I was a prostitute because [they believed] I'd shared intimate pictures of myself. It meant I had no value as a woman,"" she says. Sara stopped going out after her images were shared on Telegram Sara, not her real name, had shared the photo with one person, but it had ended up in a Telegram group with 18,000 followers, many from her neighbourhood in Havana, Cuba. She now fears strangers in the street may have seen her naked. ""I didn't want to go out, I didn't want to have any contact with my friends. The truth is that I suffered a lot."" She's not alone. After months of investigating Telegram, we found large groups and channels sharing thousands of secretly filmed, stolen or leaked images of women in at least 20 countries. And there's little evidence the platform is tackling this problem. Thousands of miles from Cuba, Nigar is having to adjust to a new life. Nigar says she has been forced to leave her country She's from Azerbaijan, but says she has been forced to leave her homeland. In 2021, a video of her having sex with her husband was sent to her family, and then posted in a Telegram group. ""My mum started crying and told me: 'There's a video, it was sent to me',"" she says. ""I was devastated, absolutely devastated."" The video was shared in a group with 40,000 members. In the footage, Nigar's now ex-husband's face is blurred but hers is clearly visible. She believes her ex secretly filmed her to blackmail her brother, a prominent critic of Azerbaijan's president. She says her mother was told the video would be released on Telegram unless her brother stopped his activism. ""They look at you as if you are a disgrace. Who cares if you were married?"" says Nigar. Nigar says she confronted her ex-husband about the video and he denied making it. We tried to get a comment from him, but he didn't reply. Nigar is still struggling to move on with her life: ""I can't recover. I see therapists twice a week,"" she says. ""They say there is no progress so far. They ask if I can forget it, and I say no."" The pictures of Nigar and Sara were both reported to Telegram, but the platform did not respond. Their experience is far from unique. The BBC has been monitoring 18 Telegram channels and 24 groups in countries ranging from Russia to Brazil, and Kenya to Malaysia. The total number of subscribers is nearly two million. Watch our investigation on YouTube:Telegram: Why won't you take my nudes down?,external Personal details like home addresses and parents' phone numbers were posted alongside explicit pictures. We saw group administrators asking members to send intimate images of ex-partners, colleagues or fellow-students to an automated account, so they could be published without revealing the identity of the sender. Telegram now says it has more than half a billion active users worldwide - that's more than Twitter - with many attracted by its emphasis on privacy. WhatsApp users flock to rival message platforms 'They wanted to tie me and my child to a horse' Revenge porn: What to do if you're a victim Millions moved to Telegram in January 2021 from WhatsApp, which changed its privacy terms. Telegram has long been popular with pro-democracy protesters in countries with media censorship. Users can post without sharing their name or phone number, and create public or private groups with up to 200,000 members, or channels which can broadcast to an unlimited number of people. Telegram was used to organise mass anti-government protests in Belarus Despite Telegram's reputation for privacy, only the ""secret chat"" option provides end-to-end encryption, which ensures just the two people talking can see the message. It's the default setting on secure chat apps like Signal and WhatsApp. This video can not be played What's behind Telegram's growing popularity? The platform also attracts users seeking a less regulated space, including those who have been banned from other platforms. ""According to Telegram and its owner, they don't want to censor users,"" says Natalia Krapiva, tech legal counsel at digital rights group Access Now. But our research has shown this light-touch approach to moderation has led Telegram to become a haven for the leaking and sharing of intimate images. Telegram does not have a dedicated policy to tackle the non-consensual sharing of intimate images, but its terms of service make users agree ""not to post illegal pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels, bots, etc"". It also has an in-app reporting feature across both public and private groups, and channels where users can report pornography. To test how rigorously Telegram enforced its policies, we found and reported 100 images as pornography via the in-app reporting feature. One month later, 96 remained accessible. We could not locate four others, as they were in groups which we could no longer access. Disturbingly, while we were investigating these groups, an account from Russia also tried to sell us a folder containing child abuse videos for less than the price of a coffee. We reported it to Telegram and the Metropolitan Police, but two months later the post and the channel were still there. The account was only removed after we contacted the Telegram media team. Despite its lenient moderation, Telegram does take action against certain content. AfterApple briefly removed Telegram from its app storebecause of videos like the ones we were offered, Telegram took a more proactive stance on child abuse images. The platform alsoco-operated with EU crime agency Europol in 2019to eliminate a huge amount of Islamic State content that had proliferated on the platform. ""We know that Telegram can remove and [has] been removing terrorist-related content or some kind of very radical political content,"" says Dr Aliaksandr Herasimenka, researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute. Members of far-right groups moved to Telegram But the removal of intimate images appears not to be a priority. We spoke to five Telegram content moderators on condition of anonymity. They told us they receive reports from users via an automated system, which they said they sort into ""spam"" and ""not spam"". They said they don't proactively search for intimate images and, as far as they know, Telegram doesn't use artificial intelligence to do that either. This lack of action has led some women to take steps themselves. Joanna reported images that were shared without consent in Telegram Joanna found a naked image of herself from when she was 13 years old in a notorious Malaysian Telegram group. She created a fake Telegram profile to join the group, where she anonymously searched for nude pictures and reported them. She also shared her findings with her friends. Amid intense media pressure, the group was eventually closed down. But during the course of our investigation, we found at least two duplicate groups sharing the same kind of images. ""Sometimes you just feel so helpless, because we tried to do so much to remove these groups. But they're still coming up, so I don't know if there's an end to it, honestly,"" says Joanna. Telegram declined an interview with us, but in a statement it told us it does proactively monitor public spaces and process user reports about content which violates its terms of service. Telegram did not confirm if posting people's intimate images without consent is allowed on the platform, or whether they are removed. The rollout of ads on some public channels on Telegram - along with investment - has signalled thatfounder Pavel Durov is intending to monetise the platform,external. This is likely to increase pressure on Telegram and its libertarian founder to fall more in line with social media rivals such as WhatsApp, which has started to introduce polices against sharing intimate pictures. It remains to be seen how long the company will resist greater moderation as it moves into new markets and starts to generate revenue. For the women whose reputations have been destroyed and lives damaged by the sharing of their intimate images on Telegram, change cannot come soon enough.

"Do new school uniform rules save parents money?Schools now have to take unnecessary logos off uniforms, but so far not all parents are benefitting.Business","Shoana Qureshi-Khan reckons she has spent more than Â£300 this summer on school clothes for her two sons A new law to protect parents in England from unnecessary school uniform costs comes into effect from September 2022. State schools will be forced to remove unnecessary branded items from their uniform requirements, allowing parents to shop around or hand clothes down more easily. However, Shoana Qureshi-Khan is one mother who has not seen the price of school clothes come down. She has still had to fork out for a number of items of clothing bearing the school logo for her sons aged 11 and 13. ""The school blazer alone costs between Â£45 to Â£60,"" she said. ""It's just a phenomenal amount that you just don't prepare for."" The boys are in the same secondary school and can pass on some items, but Shoana still reckons she has spent more than Â£300 kitting them out this summer. ""It is just crazy if I'm honest. I suppose I can understand one logo so the kids feel part of the school family, but it's just so unnecessary,"" she said. ""I can get something else from the supermarket for a few pounds. It's just not fair on hard-working families and pushes the equality gap further."" Shoana's story will ring true for hundreds of other parents. An issue for some is that September's new rules come with a loophole. It means schools which need to secure a new uniform contract with a supplier have until December 2022 to put that in place. They then have until the start of the September 2023 school year to introduce those garments. The new legislation requires branding to be kept to a minimum, but does not ban it, so some children will continue to wear some items with school logos, for example blazers. This video can not be played Emma Prosser, founder of the Uniform Project Nottingham, says that this summer has seen a âmassive increase in usersâ For those parents who struggle to afford school uniforms some help is available, from people like Emma Prosser who runs the Uniform Project Nottingham. She started off facilitating uniform swaps between the parents of children attending two primary schools. But demand has grown so much that she now has a uniform bank available to the parents of pupils at 19 schools across Nottinghamshire, where those who need it can access free uniforms. We met her surrounded by piles of jumpers, pinafores and donated warm coats. ""You have three types of parents,"" she said. ""Those who like to buy new, and like brands. Those who really can't afford it and really need the help. And also a growing number of those with a decent income but just don't see any sense in buying new. Buying second-hand is so much greener."" Now, Emma partners with local food banks to offer items of uniform alongside food staples and she tells us she's never been busier. But the logos place a limit on how easily good clothes can be shared. ""You have got to cater to your parental community,"" Emma said. ""You're not doing that if you're insisting on having logos and expecting everyone to have a spare Â£300 for each child they have."" While we were at the Uniform Project, a mum of four came in. She was emotional and did not want to give her name, but was relieved to receive free jumpers, cardigans, trousers, shirts and skirts for her family. ""I've been panicking,"" she admitted. ""To kit out my son in secondary, it'll cost me Â£98 because he has to have logo-ed everything except shirts,"" she tells us. ""When you're spending as much on one uniform as you do on a big shop, it's difficult. It's really hit us hard this year."" The Children's Society said it expected the average cost of school uniform this year to be Â£315 per primary pupil and Â£337 per secondary pupil, unchanged from 2020. But the charity, which helped push through the new legislation, believes it should empower parents to push back when uniforms feel too much. Chief executive Mark Russell said: ""If parents think that the school uniform policy hasn't changed in their local school, they should contact the headteacher, they should contact the governing body."" ""Failing that, if they are still not satisfied, they should contact their local MP or the Department for Education itself. The department will then contact the school and require them to implement the law."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""School uniform must never be a burden for parents or a barrier to pupils accessing education."" The new law coming into effect next month should help families to keep down costs, they added. ""We know schools and families are facing increased cost pressures more broadly, which is why this government is providing over Â£37bn to help households with the greatest need and supporting families through the Household Support Fund."" Unlike many other products at the moment, school uniforms have not gone up much in price this year. The difference is that for an increasing number of families, the ability to make a big one-off payment at the start of the academic year has become much harder to achieve. The new guidelines are supposed to help with that but there are a lot of grey areas, with parents and schools likely to have differing opinions of what might be considered ""necessary"" or ""reasonable"". Parents who don't think their school is complying with the new guidance are being told to approach the school's governors in the first instance. That's not an easy step to take, but the hope when this legislation received cross-party support was that a gentle reminder from parents that schools must comply with the new guidelines will be enough to bring most uniform policies down in price.

Cineworld considers filing for bankruptcy in US,"Thor: Love And Thunder is one of the biggest movie releases this year Cineworld has confirmed it is considering filing for bankruptcy in the US, as the cinema chain continues to struggle with $5bn worth of debt. But the company, which also owns the Picturehouse chain in the UK, insisted its cinemas ""remain open for business"" and that there would be ""no significant impact"" on jobs. Cineworld employs more than 28,000 people globally. Like other cinema chains, Cineworld was hit hard by the pandemic. Many theatres were forced to close for extended periods during the lockdowns, or had to operate at a reduced capacity due to social distancing rules. Cineworld shares plunge on bankruptcy fears Netflix loses almost a million subscribers Cinema chains had hoped blockbusters such as the latest Bond film, Top Gun: Maverick and Thor: Love And Thunder would draw audiences back in after lockdown restrictions eased. Top Gun: Maverick, starring Tom Cruise, has taken $1.8bn at the global box office, making it one of the top 10 highest grossing films of all time. But last week, Cineworld warned there had still not been enough major releases to attract cinema audiences and said this was hitting admissions. In 2019 before the pandemic, global box office takings hit a record $42.5bn according to Comscore, buoyed by films such as Avengers: Endgame and Frozen 2. So far in 2022, films such as Jurassic World Dominion and Minions: The Rise of Gru have performed strongly. But box office takings this year are down by around a third, or 32%, compared with 2019. Minions: The Rise of Gru is one of the best performing films of 2022 Cinema chains have also been facing tough competition from streaming services, which soared in popularity during the lockdowns. In 2020, a row broke out when Cineworld and rival AMC, which owns the Odeon Cinemas chain, criticised Universal Pictures for releasing Trolls: World Tour online at a time when theatres were forced to close because of coronavirus. Cineworld subsequentlysigned a deal with Warner Brosto show films in theatres before they are streamed. More recently, Netflix reported a sharp fall in subscribers, as the rising cost of living leads to people cutting back. On Friday, shares in Cineworld plunged 60% afterThe Wall Street Journal reported,externalthat the firm was preparing to file for bankruptcy ""within weeks"". Cineworld said on Monday it was looking at various options for how to restructure the business, including a Chapter 11 filing in the US. This allows a company to continue to operate while it negotiates with its creditors. The company would not comment on whether it was also considering entering liquidation in the UK, or what the potential impact could be on its 4,600 employees there. It also would not be drawn on what will happen to people who pay for Cineworld or Picturehouse membership, or who have vouchers, in the event of it filing for bankruptcy.

Nani, 38, moved to his hometown club, Estrela da Amadora, in the summer - a move which represented, in his own words, his 'last dance' - a reference taken from the Michael Jordan docu-series on Netflix. But his focus quickly switched to caring for his father Domingos Antonio Cunha David, who passed away in November. ""I was already thinking about retiring but my ideas and feelings changed, because of the love and passion I have for this sport,"" Nani told BBC Sport's Nizaar Kinsella. ""This was an opportunity to play for my people in Portugal and it sounded like a great idea to give them the last dance. "" But a lot of things have happened in my life, including my father passing away a few months ago so it helped me make this decision early. I spent some difficult months visiting him in hospital and trying to make him stay with us but it was not possible. ""I felt after that moment that I was ready to make this big decision in my life because I have a lot of other opportunities as well. I have opened a new academy to help top youngsters develop their talents and inspire them to follow their dreams. That made it much easier to make this decision."" Not a Manchester United fan? Find and follow your club here Nani joined Manchester United from Portugese side Sporting in June 2007 and went on to play 230 times for the club, scoring 41 goals. His time at Old Trafford was successful, winning the Champions League in his first season, plus four Premier League titles and two League Cups in eight seasons. Nani's standout campaign with United was 2010-11 when he was named the club's players' player of the year, named in the PFA's Premier League team of the year, and registered a league-high 14 league assists. At international level, Nani scored 23 goals in 112 caps - and won Euro 2016. Alex TurkFan writer The rocky start to life at Manchester United for Ruben Amorim was predictable, given the mess he had to pick up represented shattered glass between a football match every few days. Amorim would have forgotten what defeat felt like at the height of his self-built empire at Sporting. He will remember now. However, the arrival of 2025 has offered a welcome second New Year's present after his family joined him in Manchester on 27 December. Amorim finally has time on the training pitch. A week beforeLiverpool. A week beforeArsenal. United harvested positive results from both. Not a Manchester United fan? Find and follow your club here The Portuguese tactician inherited a plethora of problems he had to fix at Old Trafford upon his arrival in November. United's new boss is already addressing one of the biggest. Erik ten Hag's domestic cup pedigree was undisputed. He won 19 of his 21 such matches in charge, lifting the Carabao Cup and FA Cup in two years (did he mention that?). But the Dutchman simply could not set up his team to consistently get results away from home - especially against United's biggest rivals. The Red Devils travelled to 'Big Six' opposition 10 times under Ten Hag's leadership. They did not return to M16 with a win once, losing seven and drawing three. Amorim has been in the job for two months with a squad including many who will not last in his rebuild and has conjured up victories at Manchester City and Arsenal, while also avoiding defeat at Liverpool. He did not need long to win over a fanbase starved of optimism. A warm demeanour mixed with brutal realism from the moment he landed sparked hope. A point at Anfield - that c(sh)ould have been three - and an FA Cup scalp at Emirates Stadium has turned hope into confidence that better days are ahead. Find more from Alex Turk atStretford Paddock,external Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim says his team needs time to ""build a different way of playing"". Since Amorim's arrival in November, the Red Devils have impressed most in away games against big sides - drawing at Anfield and winning 2-1 at Etihad Stadium in the Premier League before beatingArsenalon penalties in the FA Cup. On Thursday United host rock-bottomSouthampton, a game in which Amorim says his players ""have to deliver"". ""The most difficult thing to train in one team is the way you build with the ball and in the final third the way you create situations,"" the United boss said in his pre-match news conference. ""That is what a big team should do very well and for that we also need time to train. We have had for a long time a lack of goals. ""We don't spend a lot of times during games in the last third with the ball - we did it against Nottingham Forest but we need to improve in that part of the game. ""I understand in this moment it is OK to play like that againstLiverpooland Arsenal - against Arsenal we waited for the opportunity but in the future you cannot play like that and I know that but we need time to build a different way of playing. ""In the future we are going to focus a lot on that."" The visit of Saints could derail the momentum built by United with their last two positive results and Amorim believes it will be a batter match to learn about his squad. ""This next game will teach me more about my players than the last two,"" he added. ""There is no expectation in the last two games. Fans will expect more tomorrow."" Simon StoneChief football news reporter There has to be an element of apprehension for any coach ahead of a game. They can have gone through all scenarios in fine detail with their players but in the end, once the game starts, their effect is minimal. That is why Ruben Amorim admitted it is his ""job to be worried"" before Manchester United's Premier League encounter withSouthampton. He has seen his side win atManchester City, draw atLiverpooland beatArsenalin the FA Cup despite playing with 10 men for an hour. In modern parlance, it shows United can 'suffer' when the going gets tough and come out on top. What Amorim has not seen is his side controlling a game. It is something they have struggled with virtually since Sir Alex Ferguson retired. It has always felt they are more effective playing on the counter-attack. Amorim wants something different. Moreover, he knows United have to be something different if they are to compete for the biggest prizes. The former Sporting boss says he will learn more about his team over the remainder of this week than he did over the past couple of games. That is because it will tell him a lot about the amount of work he has to do before he can truly get United pointing in the right direction again. Manchester United boss Ruben Amorim has been speaking to the media before Thursday's Premier League game at home toSouthampton(20:00 GMT). Here are the key lines from his news conference: Amorim said his side ""have to deliver"" against the league's bottom team: ""This next game will teach me more about my players than the last two. There was no expectation in the past two games. AgainstArsenal, we waited for the opportunity. In the future we can't play like that and I know that. Fans will expect more tomorrow."" Amorim shut down questions on the future of Marcus Rashford: ""I just want to win tomorrow. My focus is to win tomorrow, I will choose the players that I think are best to win the game tomorrow. I am just focused on that."" On selection dilemmas: ""A lot of players I had to think [about] this week. Toby [Collyer] is training really well. He has a lot of pace and he likes to learn so is one more option."" On the pressure of being United boss: ""Of course, I feel the pressure of this club, but in this moment I don't feel that pressure because in the past years we didn't win the league. If you followed this club in the past, if you don't win the league one year, you must win it the next year."" Therefore, he wants to channel expectations: ""We need to bring that pressure to us. We need to win titles and games in this moment. When you have the pressure to win, that is the pressure we want."" Amorim said he is ""always concerned"" when there is inconsistency in performances and results: ""It's my job to be worried but we have to face Southampton in the same way we facedLiverpooland Arsenal. Not more, not less."" Follow all of Wednesday's Premier League news conferences and the rest of the day's football news Full commentary of Man Utd v Southampton on BBC Radio 5 Live from 20:00 GMT on Thursday Pat NevinFormer footballer and presenter Football has a great habit of changing very quickly - just ask Ruben Amorim and Mikel Arteta. Arsenal were flying high, looking likely to close in on Liverpool's current dominance while Manchester United had the aura of a club praying for the intervention of Saint Jude - the patron saint of lost causes or impossible hope. Manchester United may have only drawn againstLiverpoolandArsenal, before scraping through in Sunday's penalty shootout, but that upward trajectory suddenly looks much more possible. âIt is early days for United fans to proclaim a resurrection but there are grounds for hope. They currently look like a coherent group. They have rediscovered how to toil at an acceptable rate and the desire that has been sadly lacking for a very long time is creeping back. âAmorim has managed to make them believe they can be competitive. It may be that the new shape and his tactics are beginning to pay off or it may be that he has got inside their heads better than any other manager or indeed sports psychologist has. âMaybe he just made it clear that if you are willing to put in the hard yards, you will get rewards. It may sound harsh, but some players have been conspicuous by their absence in the past two impressive performances. Fabulous pros and world-class players in their time, neither Casemiro nor Christian Eriksen made it on to the field for a minute. Sadly, the now lacklustre Marcus Rashford has to be added to this group. They do not appear to have the 'legs' needed for the top echelons and the manager has made his decision. Eriksen can still play a bit part, maybe as one of the two players behind the striker now and again but they are clearly not the future for this coach. âHarsh, maybe even vicious, Amorim outwardly seems a kindly and caring sort, although on this occasion he has made the tough decisions that the heartless world of football has known were needed for quite some time. The changes are paying off. Sign up to read more from Pat Nevin in his Football Extra newsletter Altay Bayindir and Joshua Zirkzee ""epitomised"" what Manchester United are about in the club's FA Cup victory againstArsenal. On the latest episode of BBC Radio Manchester's The Devils' Advocate podcast, Gaz, Kim and Jay spoke about the key role they played as United progressed to the fourth round. BBC Radio Manchester's Gaz Drinkwater said: ""I will openly admit that I said it was a disgrace that [Bayindir] would start this game, purely because it was the FA Cup and an important game. ""Why would you start your back-up keeper? But, [he was] phenomenal."" Jay Motty added: ""He was. The one saving grace for Bayindir was that he made that clanger atSpursand then Andre Onana did something similar a week later. ""It wasn't like you had one goalkeeper who was terrible and another who was flying. Onana has been going through a sticky patch although obviously he's the first-choice goalkeeper. ""You look at players like Bayindir who had a stinker at Spurs and Joshua Zirkzee, who had a section of fans boo him which was just disgraceful. ""To see those players doing well and playing their part in what could be a massive win is great to see. ""It's what Manchester United are about - people writing us off and bouncing back and proving everyone wrong. Those two players epitomised that. ""You use the word redemption for a reason - it did feel like that."" Listen to the full episode on BBC Sounds We asked for your thoughts after Tuesday's Premier League game between Brentford and Manchester City, where the Bees came from two goals down to secure a 2-2 draw late on. Here are some of your comments: Brentford fans Theo: A complete performance against one of the best clubs in the world. Very consistent in both halves, defended really well, looked dangerous going forward and battled for every ball. So much effort and pressing from the boys, and we never gave up! Couldn't be prouder of my team. Mitch: I thought we were excellent, but if we'd been a little braver in the first half and played Kevin Schade from the start against a holding midfielder, we'd have won. I never felt we were overly threatened, and if we'd converted our chances... but what a fantastic game! Players were outstanding. Rhys: Incredible night. Amazing performance. It should have been 5-2! Wonderful to watch and great to see Rico Lewis back in the Premier League. Cliff: Super proud of our Brentford team. One of the best games at the Gtech this season and it felt like a win. I can't help but think that City should have completely closed the game down, though - and in previous seasons they would have I'm sure. Anyhow,Liverpoolon Saturday! City fans Pat: Difficult one to take. For most of the game we were solid and controlled the midfield. We scored two very good goals and created numerous chances when we should have put the game to bed. Then we allow two soft goals in the last 10 minutes and drop two more points. But, for me, the game hinged on the decision to bring on Ilkay Gundogan for Mateo Kovacic. It felt wrong, looked wrong and ultimately changed the game. Josh: Much better performance all round but same defensive frailties visible. Nathan Ake can't do it all - Josko Gvardiol and Manuel Akanji are still liabilities defensively. Colin: Frightening to see how low City are in confidence. The play on the edge of the opposition box shows that no-one will take a risk and either shoot or make a risky pass. All very safe and very boring - and won't lead to goals. A shadow of their former selves. Martin: I thought they were looking more creative up front. Phil Foden must be crestfallen at the jelly-like defending and inability of the team to close out wins.  Savinho good. Matheus Nunes and Akanji awful. Poor choices of substitutions. Mid-table team this year but little buds are appearing for development. Simon StoneChief football news reporter Reporters covering Manchester United have repeatedly been told the club is committed to the Premier League's financial rules. They have also been told United are ""tight"" when it comes to their PSR position. The detail of that - as with all clubs - is vague. But while they are dealing with the legacy of ridiculous contracts handed out to underperforming players, they will have a problem. Selling homegrown stars is a way to relieve the problem - which is why the future of Marcus Rashford is key in terms of what transfer business United might be able to do this month. But that policy risks alienating supporters, especially if another local lad, like Kobbie Mainoo, was offloaded. The positive, if there is such a thing, around the huge debt United will probably take on for whatever stadium project they choose, is that it will not count in PSR calculations even though, in reality, it will have a massive impact on their budget because it will need paying back. For now, expect overall costs to keep getting cut and more emphasis to be placed on better recruitment at first-team level. They have not been charged this time, but United are too close to spend their way out of their current mess. Read more on how Premier League clubs kept to spending rules Manchester United's rivals are waiting to pounce on January deals for midfielder Kobbie Mainoo and forwards Marcus Rashford and Alejandro Garnacho as they anticipate co-owner Sir Jim Ratcliffe wanting to avoid last-minute profit and sustainability rules sales on 30 June to stay within financial rules.

Read Wednesday's full gossip column Follow the gossip column on BBC Sport Manchester City boss Pep Guardiola, speaking to TNT Sports:""We're a bit disappointed but at 2-0 up we didn't manage to hold on to the lead and unfortunately we couldn't close the game. ""Today we didn't take the right decisions in the final third. I had the feeling that we didn't take the right decisions in the final third to close the game."" On the team being tired:""With the absence of the central defenders, Rodri, with many things, we are not [at our best] and we didn't take the right decisions. It's fine, it's not a good place to come. Unfortunately, we couldn't win."" On if he is happy with a point:""Yeah, it is what it is."" On why his side are struggling to hold on to leads:""I don't know, it can happen. Sometimes it happens. We have to manage a little bit better but today was not bad."" Michael EmonsBBC Sport journalist Leading 2-0 at the 82nd-minute mark, Manchester City will be heading north wondering how they left London without the three points. Phil Foden's double had City on course for their third successive league win and their fourth in all competitions, before Brentford produced a superb fightback. Yoane Wissa pulled one back, but City should have then restored their two-goal advantage only for Savinho, Erling Haaland and James McAtee to all miss chances before Bees skipper Christian Norgaard headed in an equaliser in the 92nd minute. City have won the title in each of the past four seasons and this was a missed chance to close the gap on leaders Liverpool, who drew 1-1 at Nottingham Forest and remain 12 points ahead of Pep Guardiola's side. One positive for City would have been Foden's two goals. He did superbly to control a side-footed volley from Kevin de Bruyne's excellent cross and then reacted quickest to prod him a second after Savinho's effort had been parried by Mark Flekken. That is now four goals in Foden's past five Premier League matches after he had not scored in the opening four months of City's league campaign. Foden won the Players' Player of the Year award last season and his form could be crucial if City are to push on and secure Champions League football for 2025-26.

Strike at key UK port to cost 'stack of money'Companies talk of how they expect the eight-day strike at the Port of Felixstowe to affect them.Suffolk,"The Port of Felixstowe is the UK's largest container port Workers in Felixstowe, Suffolk, are striking in a row about their pay, with eight days of industrial action at the UK's largest container port. What could it mean for those reliant on goods coming in to the port? About 2,550 people work at the Port of Felixstowe, which is the UK's biggest container port, handling 48% of container trade. About 1,900 Unite members walked out from 07:00 BST for eight days, after rejecting a 7% pay offer from Felixstowe Dock and Railway Company, which operates the port. The offer also includes a one-off Â£500 payment. Unite says the pay offer is ""significantly below"" the rate of inflation but the port insists it is a ""very respectable offer"". Which workers are allowed to go on strike? Paul Day, manager of Turners (Soham), says the strike will be very costly for his haulage company ""About 30% of our business is at Felixstowe, so it's going to have a huge impact,"" says Paul Day, managing director of haulage company Turners (Soham). The Cambridgeshire company moves about 500 containers out of the port every day. ""We might be able to keep operating for two or three days but I can't see we'll be able to after that,"" he says. ""It will cost us a stack of money, but all I can do is optimise what we can do and try to minimise the damage - but the damage is coming."" Derek Hailstone, owner of Mick's Cycles in Bury St Edmunds, is concerned about the potential impact of the strikes at Felixstowe Port Derek Hailstone, co-owner of Mick's Cycles, in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, says the majority of his stock comes in through Felixstowe. The company has been trading in the Suffolk town since 1970. 'I want to see how big this ship is and it's huge' Felixstowe port workers to strike after talks fail Port health team finds fish tongue parasite ""The strikes have the potential to affect us, as most of our stock comes into the UK through Felixstowe,"" he says. ""A lot will depend on how much stock is already being held in Felixstowe and whether that can come out of the port."" He says the key factor for his business would be whether the shipments headed for Felixstowe can be diverted to other ports around the UK. ""If they divert to other ports, then we'll be OK,"" he says. Haydyn Rowlandson, traffic operator for Felixstowe haulage company Openultra, says customers want to know what is happening Haydyn Rowlandson, traffic operator for Openultra haulage company, based in Felixstowe, says collecting deliveries from other ports would mean additional costs for customers. ""Vessels are being diverted to ports such as Southampton but, clearly, if we have to go there, it significantly changes the rate of the job,"" he says. ""One collection would cost hundreds of pounds more as there is extra wear and tear, the additional fuel and driver hours."" But the looming strike is already having an effect on business. ""We have had to stand vehicles down, we have had to stand drivers down and the workload has been minimal in comparison with the last few weeks,"" he says. ""Customers are ringing us up on a daily basis and asking if we know what is happening. ""They're taking a hit, we are taking a hit - and the country is taking a hit, too."" Delays could impact on the consumer, an expert warns James Hookham, director of Global Shippers Forum, says: ""We are just entering peak season for consumer goods movements in UK international trade and transport. ""From now on, ships will be arriving from the Far East in increasing numbers, with containers of goods destined for retail outlets and online distribution centres to be ready for the three peaks in retail sales - Halloween (half-term holidays), Black Friday (last weekend in November) and Christmas."" He says a prolonged strike ""has the potential to disrupt the UK's consumer supply chains at a critical period"". ""These containers are moving aboard some of the biggest ships in the world - think Ever Given - and are moving in such numbers and frequency that other routes or transport modes (overland by rail from China to Europe, or by air cargo) simply don't have the capacity to handle these numbers, at such short notice,"" he says. ""Consumer prices are already rising due to the dramatic increases in shipping rates experienced since mid-2020. ""Further disruption in the UK will add to these cost pressures, although temporary unavailability of some goods may be the first noticeable effect to consumers."" Unite's general secretary Sharon Graham says the port workforce deserves ""a fair day's pay"" Unite says eight days of strike action at the port will run until 29 August. Its general secretary Sharon Graham says: ""Felixstowe docks is enormously profitable. The latest figures show that in 2020 it made Â£61m in profits. Its parent company, CK Hutchison Holding Ltd, is so wealthy that, in the same year, it handed out Â£99m to its shareholders. ""So they can give Felixstowe workers a decent pay raise. So they should do so. It's clear both companies have prioritised delivering multi-million pound profits and dividends rather than paying their workers a decent wage."" She says the union is ""entirely focused on enhancing its members' jobs, pay and conditions and it will be giving the workers at Felixstowe its complete support until this dispute is resolved and a decent pay increase is secured"". The port handles about 48% of the UK container trade ""I think we've made a very respectable offer,"" says Paul Davey, spokesman for the port. ""The 7% plus Â£500 means this year it's an increase of between 8.1% and 9.6% depending upon the category of worker at the port, and I think at a time when the average pay increase in the country is 5% - we've got a shrinking economy, we're going into recession - as a country I think that's a very fair offer indeed. ""Unite head office have refused the pay deal on behalf of their employees locally. We know a lot of the employees locally would be quite happy to accept that."" The Bank of England has warned the UK willfall into recession in the final three months of this yearwhen inflation is set to hit more than 13%. He says some shipping companies have brought forward shipment dates while others have delayed them to avoid the strike period. He adds: ""It will have an impact - it won't be catastrophic. ""It's not great news for the logistics and the supply chain but they will work around it. There won't be shortages of goods or anything like that.""

Sunak criticises Truss over economy plans,"Liz Truss is avoiding scrutiny of her ""dangerous"" plans to tackle the cost of living crisis, her Tory leadership rival Rishi Sunak has claimed. Ms Truss has promised an ""emergency budget"" if she becomes prime minister in two weeks' time. She will reverse National Insurance rises and stop business tax hikes - and has hinted at further cash support for families struggling with energy bills. But she will not ask for a forecast of how this will impact the economy. Mr Sunak - who is trailing Ms Truss in polls of Tory members who are selecting the next PM - has seized on this as evidence that her sums do not add up. The former chancellor hasinsisted he still has a ""shot"" at Downing Street, even though many Tory members will have already cast their ballots. Help is coming with cost of living, says minister Recall Parliament over cost of living, Labour says Warning Tory leadership tax cut pledges unrealistic He says Ms Truss' plans will put the UK's public finances in ""serious jeopardy"" and fuel inflation, leading to even higher prices in the shops. In an interview with Vanessa Feltz on BBC Radio 2, he said: ""Liz's plans are promising the earth to everybody. I don't think you can have your cake and eat it. ""I don't think life's that simple, and I think her plan risks making the situation worse when you're borrowing that much money for tax cuts at a time when inflation's already going up."" Last month,the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which scrutinises government tax and spending plans, warned that UK debt is already on an ""unsustainable path"" because of inflation and other factors. Ms Truss has argued that tax cuts will help to grow the UK's economy and boost prosperity. Her team say there is no need for the OBR to produce new forecasts, because she is not planning a full budget, though will introduce tax cuts. ""The cost of living crisis means immediate action is required,"" a spokeswoman for Ms Truss' campaign said. ""A Truss government would seek to act as soon as possible to help people across the UK, by cutting taxes and introducing a temporary moratorium on energy levies."" The OBR usually requires 10 weeks to carry out an analysis of government economic plans, such as a budget. But a spokesperson for the OBR said: ""We would be prepared to publish a forecast for the new chancellor, should they request it."" The chairman of the Treasury Committee, Mel Stride, has written to the chancellor and the OBR to ask whether preparations were being made for a potential emergency budget when a new prime minister takes office. Mr Stride - a supporter of Mr Sunak - said bringing in ""significant tax cuts without a forecast would be ill advised"", likening it to ""flying blind"". Ms Truss' campaign defended her economic plan as ""sensible"" and said a ""new approach"" to the economy was needed. Her team say they will not reveal what she will do to help families with bills until the leadership contest is over, on 5 September. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, a Truss ally who is being tipped as her chancellor, said: ""Of course, she will look at what more can be done to help families, but it is entirely reasonable not to detail the exact shape of that support until she has all the information to hand."" The Sunak campaign says Ms Truss' plans are a ""mystery"" because she cannot deliver help with bills and Â£50bn worth of unfunded tax cuts in one go. ""It's no wonder they want to avoid independent scrutiny of the OBR in their emergency budget - they know you can't do both and it's time they came clean about that now,"" a spokesperson added. Mr Sunak has said he would prioritise bringing down inflation before cutting taxes if he becomes prime minister. He has said he would introduce more targeted support for households, and has promised to reduce VAT on domestic energy bills from 5% to zero and to cut 3p off income tax by 2029. Tory MP Kevin Hollinrake, a supporter of Mr Sunak, urged Ms Truss to stop offering ""the magic money tree"" and instead focus on what support she could offer to low-income households. ""These people are going to be on the streets,"" Mr Hollinrake told Sky News. ""Things are going to be that bad for some households."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer joined in with criticism of Ms Truss' decision not to ask the OBR to scrutinise her plans. He said:  ""We need an emergency budget. We should have had that months ago, to deal with the cost of living crisis. But the OBR is there to make sure that money is spent wisely and properly. So of course you need the OBR in place for that."" He added: ""Labour is leading on this, we have said freeze those bills this winter, make sure people don't pay any more for their energy."" The Institute for Fiscal Studieshas called pledgesby both Tory leadership candidates ""unrealistic"" unless they are matched by spending cuts. The cost of living crisis is being driven by several factors, including soaring energy bills and inflation outstripping wage increases. Last week, the UK's inflation rate hit 10.1%, with rising food and drink prices making the largest contribution to the change.

Result due in barristers' all-out strike voteCriminal Bar Association members are being asked if they want to ramp up their industrial action over pay.,"Results are due in a barristers' vote on whether they should go on an all-out strike in England and Wales next month. Courts have seen several days of disruption over lawyer walkouts in recent weeks, but members of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA) have been voting on whether to stage an indefinite, uninterrupted strike. It is part of an ongoing row with the government over pay and legal aid cuts. Proposed strike action would begin on 5 September. The ballot closed at midnight on Sunday, with results expected on Monday morning. The CBA is asking for a 25% rise in pay for legal aid work, when they represent defendants who could not otherwise afford lawyers. Criminal barristers are due to receive a 15% fee rise from the end of September, with the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) saying the increase would see the average barrister earn about Â£7,000 more annually. But members of the CBA have rejected the government's pay offer, saying it would not kick in immediately or apply to existing cases. Some 6,235 court cases were disrupted during the first 19 days of industrial action between 27 June and 5 August - including 1,415 trials - according to Ministry of Justice (MoJ) data. Barristers walk out of courts over pay Barristers to strike every other week from August Victim's father backs barristers' strike action Criminal barrister and former Conservative MP Anna Soubry said more than 500 trials could not go ahead last year due to a shortage of criminal barristers. Sheposted on Twitter,externalthat since 2006 their fees have been cut by 28%, adding: ""We can't recruit or retain."" The former minister urged the government to settle the dispute. ""We want to get back to work and shift the backlog,"" she said. The CBA said the walkouts have had a ""devastating impact on the ability of our crown courts to function with any semblance of normality"". Every barrister who has taken part in the walkouts ""has made the decision to withdraw their labour with a heavy heart"", the CBA said. They added: ""It is a decision to which we have been driven after years and years of abject neglect of the criminal justice system and the cynical exploitation of our time, effort and goodwill by successive governments determined to deliver justice on the cheap."" The CBA said the ""continuing refusal of the justice secretary to negotiate a fair settlement with criminal barristers comes at a very heavy price"". This price can be measured by the financial waste of courtrooms sitting idle and the impact on complainants, defendants and witnesses, the CBA added. An MoJ spokesman said: ""The only outcome of escalating strike action is further distress for victims forced to wait longer for justice."" The MoJ added that backdating pay would require a ""fundamental change"" in how fees are paid. ""That reform would cost a disproportionate amount of taxpayers' money and would take longer to implement, meaning barristers would have to wait longer for payment,"" a spokesperson said.

What are policy flashpoints for the next PM?,"In a month, Liz Truss or Rishi Sunak will be prime minister. The two contenders for the job of PM and Conservative leader are setting out their policies and visions for the job daily. But what about policies which often split opinion among Conservative party members - who, of course, are key to winning this contest. We've been looking at some potential flashpoints and contested policies from the last general election manifesto. The manifesto promised 300,000 new homes every year by the middle of the decade. But after some well publicised rows on planning, Boris Johnson had gone cold on the idea. Now, it's clear both candidates would abandon the target. Rishi Sunak's team say he doesn't believe in arbitrary or top-down numbers. He wants to deliver progress on delivering more homes but believe the government should work with councils to develop local plans supported by communities. Liz Truss has also criticised top-down planning targets set in Whitehall. She wants reforms to the planning system to make it simpler and faster to build homes, but only if communities want them. The opening of new grammar schools in England is banned - but current ones can be expanded. Both candidates have spoken about support for grammars, but that doesn't necessarily mean they'd change the law. Rishi Sunak told a hustings in July that he supported grammar schools. But his team have clarified that he doesn't mean opening new ones - instead he back ""expanding existing grammar schools in local areas which are wholly-selective."" Liz Truss hasn't said explicitly that she would change the law to allow new grammars. But she has hinted at it, saying she wants them to available to everyone. She said: ""I want people around the country to have the choice that we have to be able to send our daughters to a grammar school."" Grammar schools are controversial, and the last manifesto did not mention them. Some argue they lift standards, but others are worried selective education is discriminatory. Both candidates are committed tolegislation which would allow ministers in London to override the Northern Ireland protocol. The EU argues this would break international law - but the UK government has argued it wouldn't because of the need to protect the Good Friday Agreement. We asked both candidates if they would continue with steel subsidies, which are also contrary to international trade rules. Team Sunak has pledged to support the industry, Team Truss says key sectors must be competitive. This was a significant - but controversial -piece of legislation which was progressing through Parliament. But it ran out of time to pass under Boris Johnson and it'll now be up to the next prime minister to decide what happens. Rishi Sunak is committing to looking again at one of the most controversial parts - referring to legal but harmful content. As prime minister, he would revisit it and ""make sure that the approach it right"". He is said to want to avoid the bill venturing into suppressing freedom of speech. Liz Truss is understood to support the bill in principle - but also to want to balance freedom of speech with keeping people safe online. Her team has not said if there are specific elements she would change. For years, the government wanted to get net migration to under 100,000. That target was dropped for the 2019 manifesto and neither candidate has suggested they would bring it back. The 2019 manifesto talked about backing the increased use ofstop and searchin England. Rishi Sunak has said he supports making it easier for the police to stop and search convicted criminals. Liz Truss's team didn't respond to our request for details. The Conservatives said at the last general election that they would end automatic halfway release from prison for those convicted of a serious crimes. Ministers have had theirpowers beefed up since then, to stop the early release for offenders seen as a dangers to the public. Rishi Sunak wants to look at expanding stopping automatic early release to cover a wider range of offences. He also wants ministers to have a veto on the release of serious offenders. Liz Truss's team didn't respond. Neither candidate would give us a yes or no answer. Team Sunak said any application would be reviewed by ministers and it was for the airport to make the business case. Team Truss didn't respond. There was a row earlier this year when the governmentabandoned plans to ban the import of fur and foie gras- as it had promised in its manifesto. The policy was unpopular with some cabinet ministers. Rishi Sunak did say would work with MPs on animal welfare - including a Trophy Hunt Bill, which was also promised in the manifesto. Team Truss didn't respond. Rishi Sunak has no plans to make changes to the Hunting Act which was passed in 2004. When asked whether she would repeal the Hunting Act or not, Ms Truss said that ""opening that Pandora's box could possibly make the situation worse for people who enjoy country sports"".
