Delays in state pension payments 'causing anxiety',"Hundreds of new pensioners could face anxiety and stress owing to delays in payments of their state pension, campaigners have said. The Department for Work and Pensions admitted that the pandemic and staffing issues had caused backlogs in payments to those reaching the age of 66. It is understood that the number affected is in the low thousands, and officials have apologised to them. One charity said that the problem could have a big impact on poorer claimants. ""For people who rely on the state pension as a relatively high proportion of their income it could be a bit of a disaster,"" said David Sinclair, director at the International Longevity Centre UK. ""The potential for anxiety and stress is huge."" Pension scandal: 'I've lost 14 years of payments' Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year Pensions Minister Guy Opperman told MPs that hundreds of department staff were being redeployed to deal with the backlog in payments. A DWP spokesman said: ""We are sorry that some new state pension customers have faced delays receiving payment. ""All those affected have been identified and we have deployed extra resources to process these as a priority. Any claims made today should not be subject to delay."" Those without their money should be paid automatically, and Mr Opperman said that the system would be back to normal by the end of October. Mr Sinclair said the episode shed a light on wider issues, and called on the DWP to ensure that the pension system was more automated. Those reaching state pension age are required to make a claim before payments start. He said older people could be confused easily by the various requirements needed in the pension, tax and benefits systems. Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, said:  ""For many people living on the breadline it can be difficult to make ends meet, and so we urge the government to resolve this problem as soon as possible to ensure people who have reached their state pension age can access their money."" The DWP is already facing criticism and a heavy workload after it emerged that an estimated 200,000 female pensioners are collectively owed up to Â£2.7bn after the under-payment of state pensions owing to historic errors at the department. Pensioners were also told earlier this week that the ""triple lock"" formula for annual state pension increases would be suspended for a year. The move follows government concern that a big post-pandemic rise in average earnings would have meant pensions increasing by 8%. Now, the average earnings component will be disregarded in the 2022-23 financial year, with the rise based only on the higher of the consumer inflation rate or 2.5%.

"50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year","The government has confirmed plans to speed up the process of obtaining an HGV driver licence, amid a nationwide shortage of drivers. Up to 50,000 more HGV driving tests will be made available each year by shortening the application process and the tests themselves, it said. The UK faces a shortfall of around 90,000 drivers, which has hit the supply of food, petrol and other goods. However, industry groups said the new plans did not go far enough. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Government to shorten HGV driver testing process Lorry driver shortages have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. There have also beencomplaints about a backlog of driver tests. In a written statement to the House of Commons,external, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would now overhaul regulations to boost capacity, meaning: Car drivers will no longer need to take a separate test to tow a trailer or caravan, allowing roughly 30,000 more HGV tests to be conducted every year Tests will be made shorter by removing several elements and having them tested separately by a third party Drivers will be able to get a licence to drive an articulated vehicle without first getting one for a smaller vehicle, making around 20,000 more HGV driving tests available every year. Mr Shapps said the changes, which still need to be approved by parliament, will generate additional test capacity ""very rapidly"". He added: ""These changes will not change the standard of driving required to drive an HGV, with road safety continuing to be of paramount importance."" Industry groups are sceptical about the plans - elements of which were published earlier this week - warning that they could affect safety. They also reiterated calls for temporary work visas to woo back around 20,000 EU drivers who have left the industry - something the government has rejected. More than 6,300 lorry drivers spent Christmas 2020 queuing to enter the Port of Dover when France closed its border with the UK ""This is a sensible move but it's not enough to fix the problem,"" Paul Jackson, managing director of Peterborough-based cold and chilled food logistics firm Chiltern Distribution told the BBC on Thursday. ""We don't put newly-qualified drivers straight behind the wheel on their own. We buddy them up with experienced drivers for the first eight to 10 weeks and the insurance costs for new drivers are also much higher. ""We desperately need to put HGV drivers on the list of skilled workers we can bring in from abroad."" Richard Burnett of the Road Haulage Association said the industry was losing 600 drivers a week and it would take nearly two years to fill the net shortfall. A host of companies have been hit by the driver shortage, while some are offering higher wages and retention bonuses to woo recruits. SupermarketMorrisons has warned the crisis will push up prices, while restaurant chainNando's temporarily closed 50 sites, blaming supply chain issues. And BP temporarily closed a ""handful"" of its UK sites, due to not being able to get petrol and diesel to them. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

Clarkson: 'Swamped' village has seen more trade,"Mr Clarkson posed for selfies with fans as he arrived for the village meeting TV personality Jeremy Clarkson said he sympathises with people in his village after it was overwhelmed with visitors as a result of his latest TV series. The presenter called a meeting for residents of Chadlington, Oxfordshire, on Thursdayto quell ""gossip"" about his Diddly Squat farm shop. Villagers had complained of traffic delays caused by visiting fans. Mr Clarkson admitted the village had been ""swamped"" but said it had led to increased trade for local businesses. Speaking on the Jeremy Vine radio show, he said: ""I absolutely sympathise with people in the village. ""There is more traffic, yes, but there is more business - the village shop is doing better, the cafe in the village, the pub in the village - they are all doing better. ""They are swamped with people but they are swamped with people spending money."" Jeremy Clarkson said ""someone gave me the finger"" as he arrived at the meeting The farm, which he bought in 2008,is the subject of an Amazon Studios series, entitled Clarkson's Farm. Mr Clarkson said: ""I had no idea that the show was going to be as successful as it was. ""Then thousands and thousands of people descended - we weren't ready for it, the village wasn't ready for it."" Resident Maggie Jackman, who called into the Radio 2 show, said Mr Clarkson had been ""very affable, disarming and amusing"" at the meeting. ""In 10 minutes, he had won over many of the audience,"" she said, but added the village was ""split into three"". ""There's a very hard-line opposition who would like to see it shut, there's a middle ground, then there are the younger people who quite welcome him."" People leaving the meeting on Thursday said Mr Clarkson had announced plans to convert a lambing shed into a restaurant and would attempt to curb the number of visitors to his shop.

Landlord tax could pay for social care - Starmer,"Money to pay for social care could have been raised through taxing landlords, Sir Keir Starmer was expected to tell a conference. It comes after Boris Johnson announced plans to raise National Insurance tax on workers and employers in order to pay for the NHS backlog and social care Sir Keir was to describe the rise as ""unfair"" and ""poorly thought through"". But the Labour leader has come under pressure in recent days to detail his own plan to fund social care. Addressing the House of Commons earlier this week, Mr Johnson acknowledged his tax rise broke a manifesto commitment not to raise taxes, but defended the move as ""the right, reasonable and fair approach"" in light of the pandemic. He criticised calls for a rise in capital gains tax - the levy you pay on the profits when you sell an asset - arguing that it would not raise enough money to ""even begin to deal with this problem"". Social care changes at-a-glance Minister defends social care bill reform wait Will people still have to sell their homes? Speaking to the Local Government Association which represents councils in England and Wales, Sir Keir was expected to attack the Conservatives' plans, arguing that: ""Working people will pay more tax now, but might still have to sell their home to pay even more later."" ""This is an unfair plan that doesn't work. And who is left with the bill? It's working people. It's especially low earners and young people who have already borne the brunt of the economic impact of the pandemic,"" he was to say. Instead he was to argue that ""the money could have been raised by taxing the incomes of landlords, and those who buy and sell large quantities of financial assets, stocks shares"". Mr Johnson's plans, he was to say, leave ""a private landlord renting out multiple properties not paying a penny more in tax, and their hard-working tenants to pick up the burden"". He was to add it sees ""an Amazon worker's taxes raised, but Amazon itself able to squirrel profits away in tax havens and only pay a fraction of what high street shops do"". Earlier this week, Sir Keir told Sky News he would back ""wealth taxes"" to fund social care but did not set out further details. Giving shape to a future Labour policy, Sir Keir was also expected to say that his party would introduce a principle of ""home first"" care, shift the focus to prevention and early intervention, and introduce a ""new deal"" for care workers. Under Mr Johnson's proposals there will be a 1.25 percentage point rise in National Insurance from next April for workers and employers. It means that someone earning Â£30,000 will pay an extra Â£255 a year, while someone on a Â£50,000 salary will pay Â£505. Income from share dividends - earned by those who own shares in companies - will also see a 1.25% tax rate increase. In 2023, National Insurance will return to its previous level and the tax increase will become a separate health and social care levy on earnings. The majority of the Â£36bn fund raised by the rise will go towards tackling the backlog of NHS cases created by the pandemic. A smaller portion of the money - Â£5.4bn over the next three years - will also go towards changes to the social care system, with more promised after that. In his speech, Sir Keir was to warn that the government plans would not provide any money for councils in the short term and would force them to put up council tax in order to meet demand.

"Boy band accuse manager of mental, financial abuse","Why Don't We have had two US top 10 albums US boy band Why Don't We have accused one of their managers of ""mental, emotional and financial abuse"" by making them ""hostages in our own home"" and restricting their food. The five-piece's latest album went to number five in the UK in January. They claimed the manager, who they didn't name, ""controlled us 24/7"", verbally berated them and led members to develop eating disorders. David Loeffler, one of their managers, rejected the ""untrue, hurtful"" claims. Why Don't We said they were aged between 15 and 18, and ""young, impressionable and trusting"" when they formed and started living in the same house. ""Little did we know that we would eventually become prisoners in the 'Why Don't We compound' under the supervision of one of our managers at Signature Entertainment Partners,""they wrote on social media.,external ""He would not only live with us during the day, but controlled us 24/7, setting an alarm that would go off if any door or window was opened. Needless to say, we were not given the security code to the alarm, essentially making us hostages in our own home."" They added that their food was ""restricted to the point that some band members developed eating disorders"", and they were forced to sneak food into the house. ""We were verbally berated almost every day and alienated from our friends and families,"" they added. ""We had no support system except for each other and were made to believe that this was 'normal', that every artist had to pay their dues."" The group have had two US top 10 albums, and their statement comes after two former partners of Signature Entertainment sued each other. Mr Loeffler and music industry veteran Randy Phillips had launched the band's career, but split up and took legal action against each other last month over the group's management and control of Signature and another company. At the time, Mr Phillips' lawyer Howard King alleged that Mr Loeffler had subjected the group to ""years of mental and financial abuse"". According to Billboard in late August,,externalthe group were refusing to sign a recording agreement with Atlantic Records or perform as a group, until Mr Phillips was reinstated as their sole manager. In a statement at the time, the group's lawyer Alan Gutman said they ""support Randy Phillips the same way he has supported us from the start of our careers"". On Friday, Mr Loeffler's lawyer Michael Levin said Signature had profit share agreements with the members of Why Won't We, which had been ""very beneficial for the individual members of WDW"", earning them approximately $10m (Â£7.2m) in total. He added: ""Recent comments attributed to WDW members are untrue, hurtful, and apparently designed to be part of an ill-advised strategy to evade their obligations under these agreements. ""Signature would certainly welcome a reasonable and amicable resolution of this matter that preserves the mutually beneficial relationship that has helped WDW achieve their great success to date.""

"Terrorism failed, says PM as he remembers 9/11","A private service of remembrance has been held in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London The Queen has sent a message to US President Biden marking 20 years since the 11 September attacks, saying her thoughts and prayers are with the victims, survivors and their families. In her message, she also paid tribute to the resilience of the communities who joined together to rebuild. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the terrorists had failed to ""shake our belief in freedom and democracy"". After sunset, 67 candles were lit to remember the British victims. Commemorations have been taking place at a memorial garden in Grosvenor Square, London, where a private service of remembrance was held earlier, organised by a support group for victims' families. Other events have been held around the world to remember the 2,977 people killed. The world remembers lives lost on 9/11 What happened on 9/11? The attacks, which were planned by al-Qaeda from Afghanistan, saw four US passenger jets seized by suicide attackers - two of which were flown into the Twin Towers of the World Trade Center in New York. Another plane crashed into the Pentagon, just outside US capital Washington DC, and a fourth plane crashed in a field in Pennsylvania after passengers fought back. Candles have been put out in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London, to remember British victims People comforted each other after attending the Memorial Garden Flowers have been laid in Grosvenor Square In her message to President Biden, the Queen said: ""As we mark the 20th anniversary of the terrible attacks on September 11 2001, my thoughts and prayers, and those of my family and the entire nation, remain with the victims, survivors and families affected, as well as the first responders and rescue workers called to duty. ""My visit to the site of the World Trade Center in 2010 is held fast in my memory. ""It reminds me that as we honour those from many nations, faiths and backgrounds who lost their lives, we also pay tribute to the resilience and determination of the communities who joined together to rebuild."" And in a defiant message to mark the anniversary, the prime minister said while the terror threat remained, people refused ""to live in permanent fear"". ""That we are coming together today - in sorrow but also in faith and resolve - demonstrates the failure of terrorism."" The Queen laid a wreath at Ground Zero during her 2010 visit Events have also been taking place at Windsor Castle, where a special changing of the guard ceremony took place, during which the US national anthem was played. It was an echo of the playing of the Star Spangled Banner at Buckingham Palace 20 years ago on the day after the atrocity, as a gesture of solidarity. There was a minute's silence after the Band of the Welsh Guards performed the anthem, watched by hundreds who had gathered at the castle. British doctor saw shocking 9/11 attack from plane 'A split-second decision saved my life on 9/11' Acting US ambassador Philip T Reeker said the events were a reminder that the US had ""no closer ally and no closer friend in good times and in bad times"" than the UK. He said: ""This has shown the special relationship remains so crucial to all of us."" Mr Reeker was among those attending another event at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in London, organised by education charity Since 9/11 for survivors of the attacks. This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson says terrorism failed to drive US and UK apart During the commemoration, the message from the PM was played, in which he said recent events in Afghanistan had only strengthened people's belief in freedom and democracy. ""Twenty years ago, September 11 2001 became, in President Roosevelt's words after Pearl Harbor, a 'date which will live in infamy',"" Mr Johnson said. ""On a crystal clear morning, terrorists attacked the United States with the simple goal of killing or maiming as many human beings as possible, and by inflicting such bloodshed in the world's greatest democracy, they tried to destroy the faith of free peoples everywhere in the open societies which terrorists despise and which we cherish."" Flowers left by Boris Johnson at the garden in Grosvenor Square, bearing a message ""in defiance of those who would have us live in fear"" Mr Johnson said that ""precisely because of the openness and tolerance of the United States"", people of almost every nationality and religion were among those murdered that day. ""But while the terrorists imposed their burden of grief and suffering, and while the threat persists today, we can now say with the perspective of 20 years that they failed to shake our belief in freedom and democracy; they failed to drive our nations apart, or cause us to abandon our values, or to live in permanent fear."" The US national anthem was played during the Changing of the Guard at Windsor Castle on Saturday A minute's silence was also held at Windsor Castle earlier Tony Blair, who was prime minister at the time, also recorded a message for the event, saying the thinking of the 9/11 terrorists was ""filled with hatred, an ideology at violent odds with a world seeking to flourish across boundaries of faith and culture"". It is as ""flawed and irrational"" today as it was 20 years ago, he said. On 11 September, 2001, Andrew Cullen - originally from Motherwell in North Lanarkshire - arrived at work on the 89th floor of the South Tower. Soon afterwards, he heard an explosion in the North Tower. ""Myself and three colleagues made the decision to get out of the building, so we headed towards the stairwell and began descending from the 89th floor down to the Sky Lobby at the 44th floor,"" he said. ""It was at that point that the port authority instructed us to go back to our offices, so they sort of shuffled us into one of the freight elevators. ""At that point the button for 78 was lit but we decided we wanted to go down, so I was the one who pounded the lobby button just a few moments before the second plane hit the tower above us."" Read the full story here Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the anniversary was about remembering and honouring those who were killed and showing ""support to our American friends as they mark this difficult time in their history"". He said the tragedy was ""still so raw"", with the consequences of the attacks ""still being felt to this day"". ""But as we mark this anniversary, I'm convinced our resolve has never been stronger,"" he said. ""We will continue to fight terror and violence, by promoting our values of justice and peace."" The Labour leader laid flowers in the September 11 Memorial Garden in Grosvenor Square, London London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the lives of innocent people, including the 67 Britons, would be remembered, adding: ""Our values of freedom, tolerance and respect will always, always prevail. Hate will never win."" The Archbishop of Canterbury said 20 years on it was still hard to articulate the sense of ""shock and horror"" felt around the world after the attacks - including ""the devastating loss experienced by so many people, and the fear and uncertainty that terrible day brought"". Justin Welby added: ""9/11 was a sharp reminder to us of the fragility of the privilege many of us have of living free of the threat of violence, while many in our world continue to wake to war or the fear of war."" He urged his followers to follow the example of the first responders to the Twin Towers and be willing ""to make sacrifices for the wellbeing of others"".

Emma Raducanu - the making of a US Open finalist,"Emma Raducanu is the first British woman to win a Grand Slam final since 1977 Emma Raducanu was not even a teenager when she had to make a big decision about her future. It was a choice she made reluctantly. Having been encouraged to take up a variety of sports by her father Ian - including horse riding, swimming and basketball - she was particularly enamoured with motocross. ""I was racing go-karts for a year or two when I was younger - about eight - and then at 10 I transitioned into motocross,"" she told Amazon Prime earlier this week. ""I'm into motor sports but I couldn't carry on with it as my tennis career progressed. It turned out pretty well."" That has proved to be an understatement. Little more than five years later, the 18-year-old has reached a Grand Slam final. With a steely composure in executing her skills, and an effervescent personality endearing her to fans across the globe, Raducanu has emerged as a star. Having burst on to the professional scene by reaching the fourth round at Wimbledon in July, she has surpassed that by winning the US Open in only her fourth tour-level event. ""She has a great attitude, she is smart and is doing extremely well - I'm sure she will continue along the right path,"" said Britain's former world number one Andy Murray. 'Calm & composed' Raducanu rising to every challenge Raducanu's rise has been heavily influenced by her Chinese mother Renee and Romanian father Ian, who both work in the finance sector and moved to London from Canada when their Toronto-born daughter was two. First grabbing a tennis racquet at the age of five, Raducanu went on to join the Bromley Tennis Academy before her potential was spotted by the Lawn Tennis Association. The governing body took Raducanu under its wing from an early age, with the youngster taking part in camps and trips abroad before progressing through the age groups. This video can not be played Raducanu has 'got the whole package' While that support has clearly been crucial, her parents' influence also continues to be evident in the way Raducanu remains composed on court and grounded off it. ""I think that the calmness and the mental strength definitely comes from my upbringing,"" she said this week. ""I think my parents have both instilled in me from a very young age to definitely have a positive attitude on court. ""When I was younger, it was definitely an absolute no-go if I had any sort of bad attitude. So from a young age, I definitely learned that and it's followed me until now."" Raducanu's surprise run in New York has had a downside - her parents have been unable to see any of her matches in person. Nor were they able to see the final - against another teenager in Canada's Leylah Fernandez - because of the strict travel restrictions to the United States. ""It's not possible, because you need a waiver and it takes a couple weeks for approval. It's too late and they won't be able to get one,"" said Raducanu, whose love of motorsport has remained strong. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

While she had long been tipped for stardom by those within British tennis, Raducanu was untested at the highest level before being given a wildcard for Wimbledon. Ranked 336 in the world as she faced only her second tour-level event, Raducanu took everything in her stride on the way to the last 16. But, then came a worrying moment. Having beaten two top-50 players at the All England Club, she had to retire from the fourth-round match with breathing difficulties and dizziness when trailing 6-4 3-0 against Australia's Ajla Tomljanovic. Speaking after her first practice session in New York, Raducanu explained to BBC Sport how the experience had illustrated the physical improvements she had to make. ""I haven't done much work relative to these other girls who have been on tour for 10 years,"" she said almost three weeks ago. ""Then to be playing the intensity I was at for a couple of weeks in a row, it was something completely new to me."" That was achieved by playing more matches leading up to the US Open - reaching the quarter-finals of an ITF Tour event in Pennsylvania and the final of a WTA Challenger event in Chicago - and then coming through three rounds of qualifying at Flushing Meadows. Having four days without a match between qualifying and her first-round match benefited Raducanu, as has having a day off to recover between the main-draw matches. Another key element to her physical improvements has been the decision to bring physio Will Herbert into her team. Herbert is a former trainer with German men's world number four Alexander Zverev and former British number one Kyle Edmund - and according to Raducanu, he is her ""mechanic"". Allow Twitter content?

Identifying what she needs to change to be more successful is a key part of Raducanu's make-up. Following her breakout Wimbledon exploits, Raducanu returned to being coached by Andrew Richardson - a former British tour player who she also worked with before she was a teenager - having been guided by the experienced Nigel Sears at the All-England Club. Discussing the switch with BBC Sport before US Open qualifying, she spoke about the need for ""fresh eyes and a fresh voice"", saying Sears - who is best known for coaching former top-five ranked players Ana Ivanovic and Daniela Hantuchova - brought the most value at ""the top of the game"". It is a move which has paid dividends. Working with a variety of coaches has enabled Raducanu to ""take nuggets of information"" as she looks to build her own identity, says Anne Keothavong, captain of Britain's Billie Jean King Cup team. ""Emma is a sponge. She learns so quickly,"" said British doubles player Naomi Broady, who has been exchanging texts with Raducanu before her matches this week. ""She does all her match scouting as well, she loves it. She enjoys the educational side of tennis."" Keothavong, speaking on Amazon Prime, added: ""Emma has got her own mind and builds her own picture of how she wants to play and perform."" Naomi Cavaday, a former British tour player who also coached Raducanu when she was younger, backs up that view. ""She's a phenomenal worker, the best worker I've ever met and always has been,"" said Cavaday. ""Her demand of herself and her demand of her team has also been something incredible. You have to be on it when you're on court with Emma. ""Every single shot, she will be looking for analysis and asking questions - it has always been that way."" Those close to Raducanu are cautious about heaping too much expectation on the teenager's shoulders. Iain Bates, the head of British women's tennis, says it is important to ""live in the moment"" and leave predictions about her career trajectory until further down the line. There are no guarantees for young players with talent. The story of Britain's Laura Robson - who reached the US Open fourth round as an 18-year-old in 2012 before her career was derailed by injury - is an example of that. But if Raducanu does stay healthy, former Grand Slam champions Martina Navratilova and Virginia Wade predict she will win multiple Grand Slam titles. ""When you see that kind of talent, that won't be denied. The only thing that could deny is her body,"" said Czech-American Navratilova, who won 18 major singles titles. ""She is almost like a finished product when she is just getting started."" Virginia Wade, Britain's last female Grand Slam champion, has been watching Raducanu live in New York this week and described the teenager's game as ""ticking every box"" British legend Wade, the last British woman to win a Grand Slam singles title, agrees. ""No question - I'm sure she will win majors,"" Wade said. ""But she will be sharing them with a handful who will be dominating the game."" Murray, who won his first major aged 25 at the 2012 US Open, knows Raducanu's ability well - as he has practised with her at the National Tennis Centre in Roehampton, while her former coach Sears is his father-in-law. ""Her attitude is fantastic, she trains hard, she practises well and I've not heard anyone around say a bad word about her,"" said the Scot. In sport, fans and media are constantly on the lookout for the next talents who will break out - and British tennis has long been searching for a female star. Chatty, bubbly and unfailingly polite, Raducanu is comfortable in the spotlight, as her interviews have proved. So too have the scenes of her interacting with fans in New York after her victories, enjoyment etched across her face as she poses for every selfie asked. This week, she was presented to a new audience with a photoshoot and interview for fashion magazine Vogue. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Making quips about not missing her parents because it is every teenager's dream to be without them in New York, along with her natural giggles in post-match interviews, have also demonstrated how she possesses a sense of fun and is relaxed off court. ""One of the things I've been hugely impressed with is how calm she is and how she is taking it all in her stride,"" added the Lawn Tennis Association's Bates. ""On court, her level gets better and better as each match goes on. It is hugely exciting for British sport and British women's tennis."" While Johanna Konta has reached two Grand Slam semi-finals in recent years, the buzz around Raducanu has been notably elevated. ""I can't explain how important it is,"" Wade said. ""It is the absolute thrill of someone who you can hopefully depend on and enjoying watching. She has been an inspiration. ""Girls are very mature really at 18. She is smart she thinks very well, she talks very well. ""I think she is going to be able to handle it, but there is an awful lot she will have to handle.""

Apple dealt major blow in Epic Games trial,"Apple has been dealt a major blow in its ongoing trial against Fortnite-maker Epic Games. A court in Oakland, California, has ruled that Apple cannot stop app developers directing users to third-party payment options. Apple had argued that all apps should use Apple's own in-app payment options. In a high profile trial, Epic Games had challenged the up-to-30% cut Apple takes from purchases - and argued that the App Store was monopolistic. On Friday, Judge Yvonne Gonzalez-Rogers ruled that ""the court cannot ultimately conclude that Apple is a monopolist"". However she also issued a permanent injunction, stating that Apple could no longer prohibit developers linking to their own purchasing mechanisms. For example, a movie-streaming service will now be able to tell customers to subscribe via its own website, without using Apple's in-app purchasing mechanism. Epic has also taken legal action against Google over its Play Store. Apple's closed payments system is hugely lucrative for the tech giant, although the company says it does not know exactly how much it makes. The ruling effectively states that Apple cannot ban developers from communicating with customers. Often there are cheaper options for consumers away from the App Store, however Apple did not allow companies to tell consumers this. Epic had argued that this was unreasonable and that developers should be able to inform users that they could make purchases away from the App Store. However in a win for Apple, the judge also ruled Epic failed to demonstrate Apple was operating an illegal monopoly. Judge Yvonne Gonzales-Rogers said: ""Apple enjoys considerable market share of over 55% and extraordinary high profit margins."" But added: ""These factors alone do not show antitrust conduct. Success is not illegal."" A spokesperson for Apple said:  ""Today the Court has affirmed what we've known all along: the App Store is not in violation of antitrust law. ""Apple faces rigorous competition in every segment in which we do business, and we believe customers and developers choose us because our products and services are the best in the world."" Epic Games' chief Tim Sweeney said the ruling was ""not a win for developers or consumers"" and vowed to ""fight on"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Music streaming site Spotify said: ""We are pleased with [the decision that] Apple engaged in anti-competitive conduct and has permanently prohibited their anti-steering provisions."" The ruling also revealed that gaming apps account for 70% of App Store revenue. It's likely the decision will be appealed, perhaps by both sides. Apple's share price has fallen by 3% since the decision, wiping billions of dollars from its valuation. Apple has been quick to claim victory - calling it a ""resounding win"". It is true that the judge mainly sided with Apple on Epic's major contention, stating it is not a monopoly. However the characterisation that Apple has ""won"" here is misleading. Epic's case against Apple was speculative. Many believed they didn't stand a chance. That the court has moved to allow in app purchases to be redirected away from the App Store could be a major blow to Apple's business model. It was revealed that 70% of Apple's App Store revenue comes from gaming apps - an astonishing figure. I say ""could be"" because it's unclear how many people would choose to purchase away from the App Store, or to what extent that would dent Apple's profits. During the trial, Apple's CEO Tim Cook said he didn't know how much the company generates from the App Store. That makes trying to assess the damage this ruling could have on the company difficult. Epic is saying it is disappointed in the ruling, and certainly the judge could have given them more. But the decision has been welcomed by anti-trust campaigners, who believe Apple use their market dominance to bully developers. Epic v Apple: What have we learned?

"50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a yearThe government will make it quicker to get an HGV driver licence, amid an industry-wide shortage.BusinessComments","The government has confirmed plans to speed up the process of obtaining an HGV driver licence, amid a nationwide shortage of drivers. Up to 50,000 more HGV driving tests will be made available each year by shortening the application process and the tests themselves, it said. The UK faces a shortfall of around 90,000 drivers, which has hit the supply of food, petrol and other goods. However, industry groups said the new plans did not go far enough. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Government to shorten HGV driver testing process Lorry driver shortages have been blamed on EU workers leaving the UK following Brexit as well as during the pandemic and tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. There have also beencomplaints about a backlog of driver tests. In a written statement to the House of Commons,external, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the government would now overhaul regulations to boost capacity, meaning: Car drivers will no longer need to take a separate test to tow a trailer or caravan, allowing roughly 30,000 more HGV tests to be conducted every year Tests will be made shorter by removing several elements and having them tested separately by a third party Drivers will be able to get a licence to drive an articulated vehicle without first getting one for a smaller vehicle, making around 20,000 more HGV driving tests available every year. Mr Shapps said the changes, which still need to be approved by parliament, will generate additional test capacity ""very rapidly"". He added: ""These changes will not change the standard of driving required to drive an HGV, with road safety continuing to be of paramount importance."" Industry groups are sceptical about the plans - elements of which were published earlier this week - warning that they could affect safety. They also reiterated calls for temporary work visas to woo back around 20,000 EU drivers who have left the industry - something the government has rejected. More than 6,300 lorry drivers spent Christmas 2020 queuing to enter the Port of Dover when France closed its border with the UK ""This is a sensible move but it's not enough to fix the problem,"" Paul Jackson, managing director of Peterborough-based cold and chilled food logistics firm Chiltern Distribution told the BBC on Thursday. ""We don't put newly-qualified drivers straight behind the wheel on their own. We buddy them up with experienced drivers for the first eight to 10 weeks and the insurance costs for new drivers are also much higher. ""We desperately need to put HGV drivers on the list of skilled workers we can bring in from abroad."" Richard Burnett of the Road Haulage Association said the industry was losing 600 drivers a week and it would take nearly two years to fill the net shortfall. A host of companies have been hit by the driver shortage, while some are offering higher wages and retention bonuses to woo recruits. SupermarketMorrisons has warned the crisis will push up prices, while restaurant chainNando's temporarily closed 50 sites, blaming supply chain issues. And BP temporarily closed a ""handful"" of its UK sites, due to not being able to get petrol and diesel to them. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

Vaccine protection still strong - Oxford jab creator,"This video can not be played Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert: ""We need more doses so we're not talking about choices"" The vaccines are still providing strong protection, a year on from the initial two doses, says the scientist who developed the Oxford-AZ vaccine. The UK's vaccine advisory body is set to decide whether booster doses against Covid-19 are needed this autumn. Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert told the BBC that offering a third booster dose to millions of people was ""a complex decision"". And she called for more vaccines to be licensed to increase supplies. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has already said a third top-up dose should be offered to people with severely weakened immune systems, which accounts for up to half a million people in the UK. But it has not decided if booster doses are needed to extend protection in larger numbers of people at high risk from Covid-19, including those normally eligible for a flu jab. The UK reported a further 37,622 coronavirus cases on Friday,according to the latest government figures.,external There have also been another 147 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Will I get a booster jab this autumn? Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision No jab. No entry. When will I need a Covid passport? Prof Gilbert, who began designing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in early 2020 when Covid first emerged in China, said there were no signs of immunity waning in ongoing trials of the vaccine, which started in April 2020. Blood tests on volunteers who had been vaccinated more than a year ago, showed they had signs of good protection. ""It's the first dose of the vaccine that has the most impact, whoever you give that vaccine too,"" she said. ""We get good protection after a single dose and then it's improved by a second dose and we would expect to see it being maintained or possibly slightly improved then by third dose. ""As we would expect, with any other vaccine, we are seeing strong maintenance of the [immune] response."" Prof Gilbert also said the world needed more doses and more vaccine supplies, so there didn't need to be a choice between vaccinating one country over another. ""More doses are becoming available and we need to focus on getting those doses to countries that really need them,"" she said, adding that many African countries had only vaccinated 2% of their population. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Thursday he was awaiting ""final advice"" from the JCVI, but was ""confident"" a booster programme would start later this month. Interim advice issued by the JCVI in July suggested more than 30 million people should receive a booster dose, including all adults over 50. The UK medicines regulator (MHRA) hasapproved the use of Pfizer and AstraZeneca as Covid booster vaccines,paving the way for a rollout ahead of the winter. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, agreed there is a ""fire raging all around the world with huge pressure on health systems in many, many countries"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to help other countries, adding: ""There is such a big risk, morally from our perspective - there's a risk to trade, there's a risk to economies, but also these are our friends and colleagues who need to be protected, and we are losing them every day that goes by."" Sir Andrew also said the UK still had high levels of protection from the virus, despite the fall in levels of people's immune response after having had the vaccine. The JCVI needs to look at the issue of who is ending up in hospital after being infected as part of its considerations, he added. How many people have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Who is the woman who designed the Oxford vaccine? More than 48.3 million people in the UK - 88.8% of the population aged over 16 - have had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 43.7 million have had both doses. The UK has ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use - Pfizer, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, and the government has pledged to donate 100 million surplus jabs to poorer countries before the middle of 2022.

Husband of Welsh 9/11 victim to be played in film,"Charles and Katherine had been together since 1988 The husband of a Welsh person who died in the 9/11 attacks has recalled the last moment he saw his wife alive. Charles Wolf had been married to Katherine Wolf, from Swansea, for 13 years prior to the attacks. His fight for compensation for the victim's families is told in the new Netflix film Worth and Mr Wolf is portrayed by Emmy winner Stanley Tucci. ""She went to work, I kissed her goodbye at 8:06, and I never heard from her again,"" Mr Wolftold BBC Radio Wales. Katherine started work on the 97th floor of the north tower of the World Trade Center just two weeks before the attacks. What happened on 9/11? Five lessons learned (or not) since 9/11 Why do sick 9/11 heroes beg Congress for money? The last time Charles saw her was as she left for work - 40 minutes later, the first plane would hit the north tower. Katherine Wolf's name is etched onto the 9/11 memorial in New York, where Charles Wolf will mark the 20th anniversary of the event this Saturday ""At 8:46 the first plane had hit her office directly, flew right over our apartment at less than 1,000ft above the ground. ""Someone on the street yelled that a plane had gone into the World Trade Center and I said 'are you kidding, my wife works there'."" 9/11 victim's son on day world ""changed forever"" 9/11 families tell Biden not to attend memorials Three days after the attacks, Mr Wolf still had not received any confirmation about what had happened to Katherine, so he went to her company's headquarters, elsewhere in Manhattan. ""I walked in and I couldn't even say my name, I just froze, I tried to tell them who I was and I couldn't even get my name out."" Katherine Wolf worked on the 97th floor of the north tower, for insurance firm Marsh & McLennan He was then taken to meeting held by the company for families of those who worked in the north tower office. An executive of the company told the group that the highest floor anyone had managed to escape from was the 91st, six floors below Katherine's office. ""When I heard that I said 'well that's it, no way, she's gone' I came to that conclusion myself. ""It was a relief, what's worse is not knowing."" Mr Wolf spent the years following the attacks campaigning for fairer compensation for the families of victims After the attacks Mr Wolf led a campaign to ensure the families and dependants of victims of the attacks were fairly compensated. He was unhappy with the US-government run September 11th Victim Compensation Fund and the man who had been assigned to run it, attorney Ken Feinberg. ""I decided I was going to do something and the press would be my megaphone, and I was going to do it for the widows, and that's what I did,"" Mr Wolf said. He set up the website fixthefund.org to pressure those in charge to allocate funds more fairly, and to more people, and it worked. After adequate changes were made Mr Wolf renamed his website The Fund is Fixed! He applied for it himself in 2003. Oscar-nominated actor Stanley Tucci portrays Charles Wolf in a new film, which also stars Michael Keaton and Amy Ryan His story in Worth, which stars Oscar nominees Michael Keaton and Stanley Tucci as Ken Feinberg and Mr Wolf respectively. ""The movie is actually very very good, I'm very pleased with it, as is Ken Feinberg,"" Mr Wolf said, but admitted he was not aware of who Tucci was before he was cast in the film. The par met at Sundance Film Festival in Utah and Mr Wolf said: ""He knew who I was, I stood up to introduce myself, I said 'I'm Charles Wolf' he said 'I recognise you', we had a lovely personal talk afterwards, just alone, face-to-face. ""He said 'you know I lost my wife', I looked at him and asked if that was why he chose to do the film, he said it was a big part of it. ""We looked at each other, as only two men who had lost the love of their life can, we just about burst into tears the both of us, and we just grabbed and hugged each other, and just hugged and hugged and hugged."" Mr Wolf said it has been too emotional for him to make a return to Wales Mr Wolf said he has not been to Wales since 2002, adding: ""I miss it, it's so beautiful and I really want to get back. ""Once 2003 happened and the [9/11] British memorial at Grosvenor Square opened up I knew I had to make the break, it was just too emotional to go back there."" He said he would always miss and love Katherine, but made a vow he would not let the terrorists take the rest of his life away. ""You have to be able to move along, moving on does not mean you've forgotten the person, moving on does not mean you don't love the person anymore. ""That person will look down upon you and say 'I want you to live the rest of your life happily', she was in my life for 13 years, and I am very very grateful for that, very grateful."" 9/11 families tell Biden not to attend memorials What happened on 9/11?

Minister not sorry for swearing at Mr Stop Brexit,"This video can not be played Steve Bray uploaded the exchange between the two men to Twitter A minister has been filmed swearing at a veteran pro-EU campaigner who approached him outside the Houses of Parliament. Steve Bray, known as Mr Stop Brexit, uploaded the clip of his exchange with Foreign Office minister Nigel Adams. The footage shows Mr Adams give the four-letter response at least twice as Mr Bray attempts to question him. A spokesperson for the MP said his remarks ""no doubt reflect those of many democratic representatives"". The video, shared on social media by Mr Bray, shows the pair talking in the street on Wednesday evening following the Commonsvote on a tax increaseto help fund health and social care. Steve Bray became known for his shouts of ""Stop Brexit"" and waving placards in the background of live TV broadcasts near Parliament After questioning Mr Adams about the tax increase, the MP responds: ""I'm really not interested in talking to an odd bloke with a top hat on chasing me down the street"". He then tells Mr Bray, from Port Talbot in Wales, to ""talk to your own MP"" and swears at him. The 52-year-old campaigner became a regular sight outside Parliament following the EU referendum, with Mr Bray repeatedly interrupting live TV broadcasts with his cries of ""stop Brexit"". Speaking to BBC Radio York, he said: ""You should be able to ask an MP a question without being told where to go. ""This is at Parliament, it's not as if I'm on his doorstep at his house, this is the seat of power - if you write to these MPs, half of them don't reply. ""I don't harass MPs, I ask them questions and I like to think I'm speaking for other people who can't be there to ask those questions."" Mr Adams is the minister for Asia at the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office In a statement, a spokesperson for Selby and Ainsty MP Mr Adams said: ""Mr Bray has spent the last few years harassing, following and hurling abuse at elected Parliamentarians as well as interrupting journalists, preventing some from doing their job of reporting the news and conducting interviews. ""Mr Adams' remarks no doubt reflect those of many democratic representatives trying to deliver on the will of the people and others seeking to go about their business who have been harassed or had their work disrupted by this individual and his handful of followers.""

Met commissioner given two-year contract extension,"Dame Cressida Dick is set to lead the Metropolitan Police until 2024 Dame Cressida Dick will serve an extra two years as Metropolitan Police commissioner, it has been confirmed. She became the first woman to lead the London's force when she was appointed in 2017 and will remain until 2024. On Wednesday, a number of high-profile signatorieswrote an open letteraccusing her of ""presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover-up"". Dame Cressida, 60, said she was ""honoured and humbled"" to have her contract extended. Among those who signed the letter calling for her to go were Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephenwas murdered in a racist attack,external, and Lady Brittan, whose home was raided when her husband Lord Brittanwas falsely accused of child abuse. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Her extension will provide continuity and stability as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic and recruit 20,000 additional police officers. ""Londoners know there is more to do to keep our capital safe, including by driving down violent crime, and I look forward to continuing to work with the commissioner and mayor of London to protect the public."" However, former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor -whose home was raided during the flawed investigation into false claims of a VIP paedophile ring- said he was ""bitterly disappointed"". Mr Proctor, who was one of the seven people who signed the letter calling for Dame Cressida to be replaced, said: ""I believe the government will rue the day of this terribly bad and wrong decision. It is obscene."" Protesters demonstrate outside Scotland Yard over the treatment of people by police at the Sarah Everard vigil Since her appointment in 2017, Dame Cressida has been involved in several controversies. The Met commissioner resisted pressure on her to resign in March when the force came under scrutiny over thehandling of a vigil held in memory of Sarah Everard,the marketing executive murdered by then-Met Police constable Wayne Couzens. Three months ago she was personally criticised in a report examining police failings in the 1987 murder of the private investigator Daniel Morgan. Dame Cressida was accused of obstructing access to documents and herforce was denounced as ""institutionally corrupt""- something she denied. The Met has faced repeated accusations of racial bias in its use of stop-and-search powers and was hit with criticism over the security of Wembley stadium during the final of the Euro 2020 championships. Speaking about the decision to extend her five-year contract, Dame Cressida said: ""I am immensely honoured and humbled to have been asked to extend my time as commissioner for a further two years. ""In the last four and a half years Met teams have dealt with some extraordinary challenges, including most recently in the pandemic, and delivered some fantastic results - critically, in reducing violent crimes. ""I'd like to thank the mayor, the home secretary and the prime minister for the confidence they have shown in me. I am acutely aware that there are many excellent leaders in policing."" Dame Cressida has the backing of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the prime minister and the home secretary In a statement released before the contract extension was announced, the Metropolitan Police Federation said Dame Cressida had the ""full support of the rank and file"". The federation, which represents more than 30,000 officers in London, said: ""It is easy to comment and criticise from the side-lines. ""We know her to be an ethical, courageous and highly competent police leader who genuinely cares about London, its citizens and her officers."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""This will provide the experienced and strong leadership we need as our city emerges from the pandemic. ""The Met commissioner has the most difficult policing job in the country, overseeing the safety of more than 10 million people living, working and visiting our global city."" Victims call for Met Police commissioner to go Met Police chief: 'I'm a bit different' PM 'has complete confidence' in Met Police boss Police violated rights at demos, say MPs 'Three and a half years of non-honesty from Dick' Video, 00:01:12'Three and a half years of non-honesty from Dick' Met Police 'Prolific' Harold Hill shoplifter BANNED from entering busy roads for two years Acton man among four convicted  in fatal street stabbing US jobs data sparks Wall Street sell-off while pound slump continues Coroner demands answers as tests on dead bodies delayed for two years Gritting in Havering: Which of the borough's main roads are prioritised?

before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main coronavirus headlines from the
UK and around the world: David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Bangladesh, on the UN's list of Least Developed Countries, is battling river erosion due to climate change The world's poorest countries say they are worried about getting to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Twenty are on the UK's Covid red list - meaning hotel quarantine for arrivals. They say the fortnight-long talks may involve delegates being away for seven weeks as they will also have to isolate on return. And they warn that flights from Pacific islands have virtually stopped and that some transit hubs are refusing non-residents. The warning comes from the group made up of the world's 46 poorest countries which are on the United Nations' list ofLeast Developed Countries (LDC),external. The 20 countries that are also on theUK's foreign travel red list,externalinclude Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Nepal. Read more More than 400 University of Hertfordshire students have signed a petition demanding face-to-face tutoring, after some found they were only being offered online sessions again this year. They claim the institution is putting the cost benefits of virtual lessons ahead of students' preferences. The university says the timetables have not been finalised, and ""all students will receive in-person, on-campus teaching sessions this year"". According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, one student, whose timetable indicated only online lessons, said: ""With us being allowed back in clubs and venues like Leeds Festival, how can they [decide] online lessons are still ok?"" Read more This video can not be played Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: The only people who get punished are players and clubs Premier League bosses have criticised a Fifa ruling that could see their Brazilian players banned this weekend over Covid-19 protocols. Under Fifa rules, players not released for the recent South American World Cup qualifiers can be banned for five days. The Premier League, the relevant national associations and Fifa are continuing to try to resolve the issue. However, BBC Sport has been told clubs are seriously considering ignoring Fifa and fielding the players in question. All of the South American qualifiers took place in countries on the government's red travel list. Anyone entering - or returning - to the UK from those countries has to quarantine for 10 days. As a result, several players did not report for international duty, resulting in the affected South American national associations asking Fifa to implement bans. Read more A ""super"" courtroom has opened in England to tackle backlogs caused by the coronavirus pandemic and make it easier to deal with organised crime gangs. Walls were knocked down at Manchester Crown Court to make it three times the size of a usual courtroom, so it can hold trials with up to 12 defendants. Trials of this size - which usually involve gang-related crime such as county lines, drug trafficking, murders and money laundering - have built up during the pandemic due to social distancing, according to the Ministry of Justice. Courts Minister Lord Wolfson QC says the Â£2.5m revamp ""will get gang-related suspects in front of judges quicker"" and ""speed up justice for victims"". Read more Another 25,774 people in the UK have had a first dose
of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 89.0% of the population aged 16 and over has now had at least one jab. And a further 96,702 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 80.6% of the population aged 16 and over has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 37,622 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,
according to thelatest government
figures,external. There have also been another 147 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. This video can not be played Newcastle United goalkeeper Karl Darlow talks about his experience with Covid-19 Newcastle United's Karl Darlow has urged footballers to get the Covid vaccine after he recovered from a serious bout of the virus. The goalkeeper, 30, spent three days on a hospital drip and was ""severely worried"" after catching coronavirus before he was due to have his first jab in July. Having only just returned to full fitness after ""awful fatigue"" and losing five kilos, Darlow told the BBC his ordeal had convinced ""a couple"" of his teammates to get immunised. But speaking onThe Sports Desk podcast,Darlow added that four or five other Newcastle players remain unvaccinated ""for hopefully genuine reasons"". There is growing concern about the numbers of players refusing get the jab, with almost a third in the English Football League still not vaccinated. Read more As students return to campus for the new term, they'll find many Covid restrictions have been lifted. There should be more face-to-face teaching but things won't be entirely back to normal. The Russell Group of leading universities says some online learning will continue - partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes. Students are also also likely to be asked to wear a face covering in crowded areas such as libraries, and will be encouraged to take regular Covid tests, even if they don't have any symptoms. Staff will be asked to test twice a week. You can read more about how the pandemic might affect universities here. The UK competition regulator is calling for a more ""interventionist"" approach from the government to tackle the ""lottery"" of buying a PCR test for travel. The
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says there is a risk of a ""race to the bottom"" and travellers could end up losing out. It says complaints from customers includes over-priced tests and poor service, with test kits and results arriving late or not at all. When things do go wrong customers are unable to contact some providers, let alone get a refund, the CMA says. The regulator is making a number of recommendations to the government, including creating ""a one-stop list of quality, approved test providers"" by significantly improving the basic standards to qualify to be listed on the gov.uk website. It is also calling for a ""comprehensive monitoring and enforcement programme"" to ensure providers on the list meet basic standards, as well as monitoring of prices, in case price reductions are not seen as a result of other measures. Tests cost about Â£75 per person on average in the UK, but there are reports of some being offered for as little as Â£20, and others for more than Â£500. Read more More people are considering giving up their dogs for adoption since coronavirus restrictions were lifted, according to the Dogs Trust. The dog welfare charity says it has seen a 35% increase in calls related to giving up the pets in the last few weeks. It says that people are reconsidering owning a dog as their circumstances change post-lockdown. The sales of pets in the UK had soared since the start of the pandemic, when more people spent time at home. The price of puppies more than doubled during lockdown, with dogs costing almost Â£1,900 on average. Owen Sharp, chief executive of the Dogs Trust, said: ""Following the boom in pet ownership during the pandemic which saw millions of us delighting in the companionship of a dog, today's figures have sadly come as no surprise to us."" Read more Only fully vaccinated people will be allowed into nightclubs, major sporting events and many concerts and festivals in Scotland from October. If you've had two doses you can alreadydownload or get a paper copy of a certificate,externalwith a QR code to prove your vaccination status. It is expected that this code will soon be available on a new NHS Scotland Status app. In a new development in Wales, First Minister Mark Drakeford saysministers will decide next week if vaccine passports should be usedto gain entry to some events. Wales already has anNHS Covid Pass,externalto show your vaccination status In England, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says people will need to prove their Covid status to get into nightclubs and some other venues from the end of September. The plans were first announced in July and have been opposed by some Tory MPs and the Liberal Democrats. Nightclubs have described them as ""chaotic and surreal"". In England, as long as you are registered with a GP, you can prove your Covid status using theNHS Covid Pass,external, via the NHS App. Northern Ireland has not yet proposed Covid passport rules for venues and events, but residents canapply for a Covid status certificate online,external. Read more about the plans for vaccine passports across the UK here. Up to 50,000 people are descending on Glasgow Green for the first day of the TRNSMT festival. The three-day event will see performances from artists including Liam Gallagher, Snow Patrol, Amy Macdonald and The Chemical Brothers. Vaccine passports are not being introduced in Scotland until1 Octoberbut ticket holders will be refused entry without proof of a negative lateral flow test. The organisers says precautions are in place to prevent Covid spreading. In addition to needing a negative lateral flow test to enter - which must have been taken no more than 48 hours before arrival - those fans attending on multiple daysmust take a second test 48 hours after the first one. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor July's figures, showing thebounce-back in the UK's economy stalling, make clear the recovery cannot be taken for granted. The cause, primarily, was the upsurge in cases across the UK, tempering the impact of the full reopening of the economy. But the impact of the supply chain crisis is also in these figures. While August should have been better, these figures are consistent with the now slow decline in furlough numbers. Monthly data is always volatile, but the pattern seems to be that the UK saw a very rapid initial bounce-back from the mere act of economic reopening. Recovery is going to be trickier as pandemic support is phased out and the impact of labour shortages and trade problems start to be seen in the figures. Talk of a ""boom"" was rather premature. Derby-based firm Colleague Box has seen its fortunes intimately linked to the health of the economy during the pandemic. The company allows both companies and individuals to send out gift boxes to friends, colleagues and relatives to show them they are still appreciated while many continue working remotely. ""The idea is that we stay connected even though we're apart,"" managing director Natalie Bamford tells the BBC. ""It's a way of putting smiles on people's faces."" However, theUK's economic slowdownhas not gone unnoticed at the firm. ""We did notice for the first time a slump in sales over August,"" Natalie says. ""We're assuming it was due to the summer holidays, but it makes you concerned as a small business owner."" Read more Here's a bit more detail on the news we brought you earlier that the Covid infection rate in Scotland has again risen to its highest level since estimates began. About 117,300 people - one in 45 - are thought to have had the virus last week, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey. It is the highest rate of any of the UK nations - and the most ever recorded. For the same week (ending 3 September), England's rate is estimated to be one in 70, Wales one in 65 and Northern Ireland one in 60, says the ONS. The figure for Scotland was a large increase on the previous week when it was one in 75. Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey, says: ""Scotland now has the highest rates across the UK countries where infections have continued to increase sharply, reaching a new highest recorded level."" Read morehere. Ministers will decide next week if vaccine passports should be used to gain entry to some events in Wales, the first minister says. Mark Drakeford says there are a number of practical and ethical issues but with infection rates rising it would be irresponsible not to consider the measure. He says Covid hospital admissions in Wales could more than double to 100 a day, based on modelling work carried out by Swansea University. People will needproof of full vaccinationfor some eventsin Scotland from 1 Octoberandin Englandfrom the end of this month. Read more Houseparty, the video-calling app that quickly became popular at the start of the pandemic as national lockdowns around the world saw people confined to their homes, is to close down next month. First launched in 2016, the app was acquired by Fortnite-maker Epic Games in 2019 as part of a multi-million dollar deal. In November 2020 it was integrated with Fortnite to let players see one another during multiplayer gaming sessions. But the developers say their work on other Epic Games products mean they cannot give Houseparty ""the attention that it deserves"". In a statement, the team says,externalit will instead develop ""new ways to have meaningful and authentic social interactions"" in other Epic Games software. While the app will continue to work until October, it has already been removed from the Google Play store and Apple's App Store. Read morehere. There could beas many as 100 new Covid hospital admissions a day in Walesas the Delta wave peaks at the end of this month, First Minister Mark Drakeford warns. Describing the situation as ""serious"", he says the figure is based on modelling work carried out by Swansea University. At the moment there are about 40 daily Covid-19 hospital admissions a day, Drakeford says, adding that patients will include many who need to be in hospital for a long time and need intensive care. Public Health Wales has reported 2,467 more coronavirus cases today and five more Covid-related deaths. The nation's public health agency says 522.7 per 100,000 population have tested positive for the virus in the past seven days - the highest case rate since the second wave in December. Â© 2025 BBC.

UK and around the world: David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Bangladesh, on the UN's list of Least Developed Countries, is battling river erosion due to climate change The world's poorest countries say they are worried about getting to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Twenty are on the UK's Covid red list - meaning hotel quarantine for arrivals. They say the fortnight-long talks may involve delegates being away for seven weeks as they will also have to isolate on return. And they warn that flights from Pacific islands have virtually stopped and that some transit hubs are refusing non-residents. The warning comes from the group made up of the world's 46 poorest countries which are on the United Nations' list ofLeast Developed Countries (LDC),external. The 20 countries that are also on theUK's foreign travel red list,externalinclude Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Nepal. Read more More than 400 University of Hertfordshire students have signed a petition demanding face-to-face tutoring, after some found they were only being offered online sessions again this year. They claim the institution is putting the cost benefits of virtual lessons ahead of students' preferences. The university says the timetables have not been finalised, and ""all students will receive in-person, on-campus teaching sessions this year"". According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, one student, whose timetable indicated only online lessons, said: ""With us being allowed back in clubs and venues like Leeds Festival, how can they [decide] online lessons are still ok?"" Read more This video can not be played Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp: The only people who get punished are players and clubs Premier League bosses have criticised a Fifa ruling that could see their Brazilian players banned this weekend over Covid-19 protocols. Under Fifa rules, players not released for the recent South American World Cup qualifiers can be banned for five days. The Premier League, the relevant national associations and Fifa are continuing to try to resolve the issue. However, BBC Sport has been told clubs are seriously considering ignoring Fifa and fielding the players in question. All of the South American qualifiers took place in countries on the government's red travel list. Anyone entering - or returning - to the UK from those countries has to quarantine for 10 days. As a result, several players did not report for international duty, resulting in the affected South American national associations asking Fifa to implement bans. Read more A ""super"" courtroom has opened in England to tackle backlogs caused by the coronavirus pandemic and make it easier to deal with organised crime gangs. Walls were knocked down at Manchester Crown Court to make it three times the size of a usual courtroom, so it can hold trials with up to 12 defendants. Trials of this size - which usually involve gang-related crime such as county lines, drug trafficking, murders and money laundering - have built up during the pandemic due to social distancing, according to the Ministry of Justice. Courts Minister Lord Wolfson QC says the Â£2.5m revamp ""will get gang-related suspects in front of judges quicker"" and ""speed up justice for victims"".

of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 89.0% of the population aged 16 and over has now had at least one jab. And a further 96,702 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 80.6% of the population aged 16 and over has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 37,622 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,
according to thelatest government
figures,external. There have also been another 147 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. This video can not be played Newcastle United goalkeeper Karl Darlow talks about his experience with Covid-19 Newcastle United's Karl Darlow has urged footballers to get the Covid vaccine after he recovered from a serious bout of the virus. The goalkeeper, 30, spent three days on a hospital drip and was ""severely worried"" after catching coronavirus before he was due to have his first jab in July. Having only just returned to full fitness after ""awful fatigue"" and losing five kilos, Darlow told the BBC his ordeal had convinced ""a couple"" of his teammates to get immunised. But speaking onThe Sports Desk podcast,Darlow added that four or five other Newcastle players remain unvaccinated ""for hopefully genuine reasons"". There is growing concern about the numbers of players refusing get the jab, with almost a third in the English Football League still not vaccinated. Read more As students return to campus for the new term, they'll find many Covid restrictions have been lifted. There should be more face-to-face teaching but things won't be entirely back to normal. The Russell Group of leading universities says some online learning will continue - partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes. Students are also also likely to be asked to wear a face covering in crowded areas such as libraries, and will be encouraged to take regular Covid tests, even if they don't have any symptoms. Staff will be asked to test twice a week. You can read more about how the pandemic might affect universities here. The UK competition regulator is calling for a more ""interventionist"" approach from the government to tackle the ""lottery"" of buying a PCR test for travel. The
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says there is a risk of a ""race to the bottom"" and travellers could end up losing out. It says complaints from customers includes over-priced tests and poor service, with test kits and results arriving late or not at all. When things do go wrong customers are unable to contact some providers, let alone get a refund, the CMA says. The regulator is making a number of recommendations to the government, including creating ""a one-stop list of quality, approved test providers"" by significantly improving the basic standards to qualify to be listed on the gov.uk website. It is also calling for a ""comprehensive monitoring and enforcement programme"" to ensure providers on the list meet basic standards, as well as monitoring of prices, in case price reductions are not seen as a result of other measures. Tests cost about Â£75 per person on average in the UK, but there are reports of some being offered for as little as Â£20, and others for more than Â£500. Read more More people are considering giving up their dogs for adoption since coronavirus restrictions were lifted, according to the Dogs Trust. The dog welfare charity says it has seen a 35% increase in calls related to giving up the pets in the last few weeks. It says that people are reconsidering owning a dog as their circumstances change post-lockdown. The sales of pets in the UK had soared since the start of the pandemic, when more people spent time at home. The price of puppies more than doubled during lockdown, with dogs costing almost Â£1,900 on average. Owen Sharp, chief executive of the Dogs Trust, said: ""Following the boom in pet ownership during the pandemic which saw millions of us delighting in the companionship of a dog, today's figures have sadly come as no surprise to us.""

"Clarkson: 'Swamped' village has seen more tradeJeremy Clarkson said businesses in Chadlington were ""doing better"" due to an influx of visitors.Oxford","Mr Clarkson posed for selfies with fans as he arrived for the village meeting TV personality Jeremy Clarkson said he sympathises with people in his village after it was overwhelmed with visitors as a result of his latest TV series. The presenter called a meeting for residents of Chadlington, Oxfordshire, on Thursdayto quell ""gossip"" about his Diddly Squat farm shop. Villagers had complained of traffic delays caused by visiting fans. Mr Clarkson admitted the village had been ""swamped"" but said it had led to increased trade for local businesses. Speaking on the Jeremy Vine radio show, he said: ""I absolutely sympathise with people in the village. ""There is more traffic, yes, but there is more business - the village shop is doing better, the cafe in the village, the pub in the village - they are all doing better. ""They are swamped with people but they are swamped with people spending money."" Jeremy Clarkson said ""someone gave me the finger"" as he arrived at the meeting The farm, which he bought in 2008,is the subject of an Amazon Studios series, entitled Clarkson's Farm. Mr Clarkson said: ""I had no idea that the show was going to be as successful as it was. ""Then thousands and thousands of people descended - we weren't ready for it, the village wasn't ready for it."" Resident Maggie Jackman, who called into the Radio 2 show, said Mr Clarkson had been ""very affable, disarming and amusing"" at the meeting. ""In 10 minutes, he had won over many of the audience,"" she said, but added the village was ""split into three"". ""There's a very hard-line opposition who would like to see it shut, there's a middle ground, then there are the younger people who quite welcome him."" People leaving the meeting on Thursday said Mr Clarkson had announced plans to convert a lambing shed into a restaurant and would attempt to curb the number of visitors to his shop.

UK and around the world: David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Bangladesh, on the UN's list of Least Developed Countries, is battling river erosion due to climate change The world's poorest countries say they are worried about getting to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Twenty are on the UK's Covid red list - meaning hotel quarantine for arrivals. They say the fortnight-long talks may involve delegates being away for seven weeks as they will also have to isolate on return. And they warn that flights from Pacific islands have virtually stopped and that some transit hubs are refusing non-residents. The warning comes from the group made up of the world's 46 poorest countries which are on the United Nations' list ofLeast Developed Countries (LDC),external. The 20 countries that are also on theUK's foreign travel red list,externalinclude Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Nepal.

They claim the institution is putting the cost benefits of virtual lessons ahead of students' preferences. The university says the timetables have not been finalised, and ""all students will receive in-person, on-campus teaching sessions this year"". According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, one student, whose timetable indicated only online lessons, said: ""With us being allowed back in clubs and venues like Leeds Festival, how can they [decide] online lessons are still ok?""

Under Fifa rules, players not released for the recent South American World Cup qualifiers can be banned for five days. The Premier League, the relevant national associations and Fifa are continuing to try to resolve the issue. However, BBC Sport has been told clubs are seriously considering ignoring Fifa and fielding the players in question. All of the South American qualifiers took place in countries on the government's red travel list. Anyone entering - or returning - to the UK from those countries has to quarantine for 10 days. As a result, several players did not report for international duty, resulting in the affected South American national associations asking Fifa to implement bans. Read more A ""super"" courtroom has opened in England to tackle backlogs caused by the coronavirus pandemic and make it easier to deal with organised crime gangs. Walls were knocked down at Manchester Crown Court to make it three times the size of a usual courtroom, so it can hold trials with up to 12 defendants. Trials of this size - which usually involve gang-related crime such as county lines, drug trafficking, murders and money laundering - have built up during the pandemic due to social distancing, according to the Ministry of Justice. Courts Minister Lord Wolfson QC says the Â£2.5m revamp ""will get gang-related suspects in front of judges quicker"" and ""speed up justice for victims"".

The goalkeeper, 30, spent three days on a hospital drip and was ""severely worried"" after catching coronavirus before he was due to have his first jab in July. Having only just returned to full fitness after ""awful fatigue"" and losing five kilos, Darlow told the BBC his ordeal had convinced ""a couple"" of his teammates to get immunised. But speaking onThe Sports Desk podcast,Darlow added that four or five other Newcastle players remain unvaccinated ""for hopefully genuine reasons"". There is growing concern about the numbers of players refusing get the jab, with almost a third in the English Football League still not vaccinated. Read more As students return to campus for the new term, they'll find many Covid restrictions have been lifted. There should be more face-to-face teaching but things won't be entirely back to normal. The Russell Group of leading universities says some online learning will continue - partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes. Students are also also likely to be asked to wear a face covering in crowded areas such as libraries, and will be encouraged to take regular Covid tests, even if they don't have any symptoms. Staff will be asked to test twice a week. You can read more about how the pandemic might affect universities here. The UK competition regulator is calling for a more ""interventionist"" approach from the government to tackle the ""lottery"" of buying a PCR test for travel. The
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says there is a risk of a ""race to the bottom"" and travellers could end up losing out. It says complaints from customers includes over-priced tests and poor service, with test kits and results arriving late or not at all. When things do go wrong customers are unable to contact some providers, let alone get a refund, the CMA says. The regulator is making a number of recommendations to the government, including creating ""a one-stop list of quality, approved test providers"" by significantly improving the basic standards to qualify to be listed on the gov.uk website. It is also calling for a ""comprehensive monitoring and enforcement programme"" to ensure providers on the list meet basic standards, as well as monitoring of prices, in case price reductions are not seen as a result of other measures. Tests cost about Â£75 per person on average in the UK, but there are reports of some being offered for as little as Â£20, and others for more than Â£500. Read more More people are considering giving up their dogs for adoption since coronavirus restrictions were lifted, according to the Dogs Trust. The dog welfare charity says it has seen a 35% increase in calls related to giving up the pets in the last few weeks. It says that people are reconsidering owning a dog as their circumstances change post-lockdown. The sales of pets in the UK had soared since the start of the pandemic, when more people spent time at home. The price of puppies more than doubled during lockdown, with dogs costing almost Â£1,900 on average. Owen Sharp, chief executive of the Dogs Trust, said: ""Following the boom in pet ownership during the pandemic which saw millions of us delighting in the companionship of a dog, today's figures have sadly come as no surprise to us.""

Vaccine passports are not being introduced in Scotland until1 Octoberbut ticket holders will be refused entry without proof of a negative lateral flow test. The organisers says precautions are in place to prevent Covid spreading. In addition to needing a negative lateral flow test to enter - which must have been taken no more than 48 hours before arrival - those fans attending on multiple daysmust take a second test 48 hours after the first one. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor July's figures, showing thebounce-back in the UK's economy stalling, make clear the recovery cannot be taken for granted. The cause, primarily, was the upsurge in cases across the UK, tempering the impact of the full reopening of the economy. But the impact of the supply chain crisis is also in these figures. While August should have been better, these figures are consistent with the now slow decline in furlough numbers. Monthly data is always volatile, but the pattern seems to be that the UK saw a very rapid initial bounce-back from the mere act of economic reopening. Recovery is going to be trickier as pandemic support is phased out and the impact of labour shortages and trade problems start to be seen in the figures. Talk of a ""boom"" was rather premature. Derby-based firm Colleague Box has seen its fortunes intimately linked to the health of the economy during the pandemic. The company allows both companies and individuals to send out gift boxes to friends, colleagues and relatives to show them they are still appreciated while many continue working remotely. ""The idea is that we stay connected even though we're apart,"" managing director Natalie Bamford tells the BBC. ""It's a way of putting smiles on people's faces."" However, theUK's economic slowdownhas not gone unnoticed at the firm. ""We did notice for the first time a slump in sales over August,"" Natalie says. ""We're assuming it was due to the summer holidays, but it makes you concerned as a small business owner."" Read more Here's a bit more detail on the news we brought you earlier that the Covid infection rate in Scotland has again risen to its highest level since estimates began. About 117,300 people - one in 45 - are thought to have had the virus last week, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey. It is the highest rate of any of the UK nations - and the most ever recorded. For the same week (ending 3 September), England's rate is estimated to be one in 70, Wales one in 65 and Northern Ireland one in 60, says the ONS. The figure for Scotland was a large increase on the previous week when it was one in 75. Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey, says: ""Scotland now has the highest rates across the UK countries where infections have continued to increase sharply, reaching a new highest recorded level."" Read morehere. Ministers will decide next week if vaccine passports should be used to gain entry to some events in Wales, the first minister says. Mark Drakeford says there are a number of practical and ethical issues but with infection rates rising it would be irresponsible not to consider the measure.

"Austria man kept dead mother in cellar, police say","Police said the suspect had confessed A man kept the mummified corpse of his mother in a basement for over a year while continuing to receive her pension payments, Austrian police say. The 89-year-old woman, who reportedly had dementia, is thought to have died of natural causes in June last year. Her son, 66, is said to have put her body in his cellar and used ice packs and bandages to mask the smell. Police believe he may have illegally received about â¬50,000 (Â£42,000) in payments. The suspected fraud only came to light after a new postman delivering the woman's benefits in the western Tyrol region was refused a request to see her, police said in a statement. That sparked an investigation, and led to the subsequent grisly discovery. Police told Austria's public broadcaster ORF that the suspect had also covered his mother with cat litter. ""Ultimately, the corpse was mummified,"" officer Helmuth Gufler said, adding that the man had confessed. Mr Gufler said the man had no other income, and had told them that the payments would have stopped immediately if he had reported the death, leaving him unable to afford to pay for his mother's funeral or to keep the house they had shared. The suspect also said he had told his brother that their mother was receiving care at a hospital, and that it was not worth visiting as her condition meant it was unlikely she would recognise him, ORF reported.

"Lingerie lizard's 4,000-mile trip hidden in bra","Ms Russell's bra was the perfect place for the lingerie-loving lizard to enjoy the trip from Barbados to Rotherham A lingerie-loving lizard was found lounging in a bra after travelling all the way from Barbados to sunny Yorkshire on a transatlantic flight. The tiny gecko, now called Barbie, was spotted by Lisa Russell as she unpacked her suitcase after arriving back at her home near Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Ms Russell said: ""When it moved, I started screaming. It is not what you expect to find in your bra after a 4,000-mile journey."" Barbie is now safe in the RSPCA's care. The returning holidaymaker, who lives in Thrybergh, arrived home on Tuesday and started to unpack her suitcase after holidaying in the Caribbean. Ms Russell, 47, saw what she thought was a speck on her bra and shook the underwear and it was then she spotted the female lizard moving. More stories from Yorkshire Lisa Russell said she screamed when the ""speck"" moved as she was unpacking her suitcase ""The tiny lizard was lucky as the bra was on top of my suitcase on my clean pile. As it was so hot out there, I didn't bother wearing one,"" the beautician said. Ms Russell revealed that the gecko remained unharmed in its lacy lair despite her sitting on the full suitcase in order to zip it up before her return journey to Yorkshire. Barbie the lizard, named after the famous doll and the lizard's island home, had survived 24 hours in the garment uninjured. The tiny female gecko survived the flight but would not last outside in the UK, said the RSPCA An RSPCA inspector was dispatched to deal with the tiny survivor, which appeared unscathed after its underwear odyssey. Sandra Dransfield, of the RSPCA, said releasing the lizard in the UK would be illegal as it was a non-native species and it ""would not survive in our climate"". The gecko was taken in by a specialist reptile keeper where she is said to be doing well. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Sturgeon: Indyref2 timetable realistic despite Covid,"Scotland's first minister has said that holding an independence referendum in the next two years is realistic despite Covid making ""everything harder"". Nicola Sturgeon announced this week that her government was resuming work on its plans to hold indyref2 by the end of 2023. She told the BBC it was important not to underplay the challenges caused by the pandemic. But she said remaining in the UK would not ""magic away"" those difficulties. The first minister said that regardless of whether or not Scotland becomes independent, the next few years would be difficult for Scotland - as it will for the UK and countries across the world. Sturgeon: Work to restart on case for independence Gove 'can't see' Scottish referendum before 2024 Covid surge in Scotland 'may be slowing down' Asked about the financial case for independence, and whether setting up a new country after the pandemic would be harder, she replied: ""I think everything is harder after the pandemic. ""There are always challenges, big challenges, and I think it's important we do not underplay them. ""Everything has become harder, but the point I'm making is if we decide not to become independent and stay in the UK that doesn't magic away these difficulties and challenges."" The SNP leader was speaking as her party's four-day virtual conference - which was postponed earlier in the year - got under way, with her speech due on Monday. She said the Scottish government would have a ""small team"" of civil servants working on its preparations for a possible referendum. The UK government has said it intends to block indyref2, but Ms Sturgeon said it was realistic to plan for one by the end of 2023. While she said Covid ""continued to be the priority"", the SNP leader argued it was right that the country's future would be ""decided by people in Scotland"" once the crisis is over. Ms Sturgeon said that decision should be ""an informed one"". She said that regardless of whether or not Scotland becomes independent, the next few years would be difficult for Scotland - as it will for the UK and countries across the world - as it recovers from the pandemic. She said there were ""big decisions"" to be taken as Scotland emerges from the pandemic about what kind of country, society and economy it wants to be. This weekend's SNP conference will see the party recommit to another referendum - Nicola Sturgeon wants it by the end of 2023. But it's impossible to say with certainty that will happen. The UK government isn't budging - and the pro-independence side are still working on their updated case for a post-Brexit, post-Covid vision. Nicola Sturgeon told me that the Scottish government team working on independence would be small - and consist of civil servants already focused on intergovernmental issues. She doesn't want it to look like taxpayer-funded staff are being taken away from Covid - but some in the SNP want the government to move much faster. Then there's the case for independence itself. Ms Sturgeon admits that the financial arguments for independence have been harder by the pandemic. Scotland's deficit doubled in the latest figures. She still believes Scotland should control its recovery - but it's a sign of the challenge ahead for her side of the independence debate. That challenge becomes all the more acute if there's just two years to provide the answers. Ms Sturgeon added: ""Every country is facing those, so for Scotland it's about who drives those decisions and what values guide those decisions. ""Is it Boris Johnson and his government or is it the government we elect here in Scotland? That is the fundamental issue."" The UK government has repeatedly dismissed calls for a fresh vote on independence, saying that such referendums should be once in a generation and that the current priority was to recover from Covid. In her interview, Ms Sturgeon also said that Scotland's NHS was under more pressure now than ever before due the recent surge in the number of Covid cases. And she said the controversial new vaccine passport rules, which are due to come into force on 1 October and will only allow fully vaccinated people to go into nightclubs and many other major events, were not a ""magic wand"". Ms Sturgeon said the passports would instead be a measure that might ""help tip the balance that will allow events to go ahead, nightclubs to stay open, when otherwise we may as we go into the winter face difficult choices about closing them"". The Scottish Conservatives have described the vaccine passport scheme as ""a shambles waiting to happen"". And the party's constitution spokesman, Donald Cameron, said the economic case for independence ""has never been weaker"". ""The pandemic has shown the strength of being part of our UK during a time of crisis,"" he said. ""The SNP/Green government's full focus should be on our recovery from Covid. No vital resources should be diverted by this nationalist coalition of chaos away from tackling the true priorities of the people of Scotland.""

"Vaccine protection still strong - Oxford jab creatorProf Dame Sarah Gilbert said offering a booster dose this autumn was ""a complex decision"".UKComments","This video can not be played Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert: ""We need more doses so we're not talking about choices"" The vaccines are still providing strong protection, a year on from the initial two doses, says the scientist who developed the Oxford-AZ vaccine. The UK's vaccine advisory body is set to decide whether booster doses against Covid-19 are needed this autumn. Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert told the BBC that offering a third booster dose to millions of people was ""a complex decision"". And she called for more vaccines to be licensed to increase supplies. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has already said a third top-up dose should be offered to people with severely weakened immune systems, which accounts for up to half a million people in the UK. But it has not decided if booster doses are needed to extend protection in larger numbers of people at high risk from Covid-19, including those normally eligible for a flu jab. The UK reported a further 37,622 coronavirus cases on Friday,according to the latest government figures.,external There have also been another 147 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Will I get a booster jab this autumn? Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision No jab. No entry. When will I need a Covid passport? Prof Gilbert, who began designing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in early 2020 when Covid first emerged in China, said there were no signs of immunity waning in ongoing trials of the vaccine, which started in April 2020. Blood tests on volunteers who had been vaccinated more than a year ago, showed they had signs of good protection. ""It's the first dose of the vaccine that has the most impact, whoever you give that vaccine too,"" she said. ""We get good protection after a single dose and then it's improved by a second dose and we would expect to see it being maintained or possibly slightly improved then by third dose. ""As we would expect, with any other vaccine, we are seeing strong maintenance of the [immune] response."" Prof Gilbert also said the world needed more doses and more vaccine supplies, so there didn't need to be a choice between vaccinating one country over another. ""More doses are becoming available and we need to focus on getting those doses to countries that really need them,"" she said, adding that many African countries had only vaccinated 2% of their population. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Thursday he was awaiting ""final advice"" from the JCVI, but was ""confident"" a booster programme would start later this month. Interim advice issued by the JCVI in July suggested more than 30 million people should receive a booster dose, including all adults over 50. The UK medicines regulator (MHRA) hasapproved the use of Pfizer and AstraZeneca as Covid booster vaccines,paving the way for a rollout ahead of the winter. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, agreed there is a ""fire raging all around the world with huge pressure on health systems in many, many countries"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to help other countries, adding: ""There is such a big risk, morally from our perspective - there's a risk to trade, there's a risk to economies, but also these are our friends and colleagues who need to be protected, and we are losing them every day that goes by."" Sir Andrew also said the UK still had high levels of protection from the virus, despite the fall in levels of people's immune response after having had the vaccine. The JCVI needs to look at the issue of who is ending up in hospital after being infected as part of its considerations, he added. How many people have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Who is the woman who designed the Oxford vaccine? More than 48.3 million people in the UK - 88.8% of the population aged over 16 - have had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 43.7 million have had both doses. The UK has ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use - Pfizer, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, and the government has pledged to donate 100 million surplus jabs to poorer countries before the middle of 2022.

Met commissioner given two-year contract extensionDame Cressida Dick has come under fire from victims of police injustice who called for her to go.LondonEx-detective jailed for witness signature forgeryThe former officer signed a witness's name on a statement during an inquiry into a woman's murder.Hampshire & Isle of Wight,"Dame Cressida Dick is set to lead the Metropolitan Police until 2024 Dame Cressida Dick will serve an extra two years as Metropolitan Police commissioner, it has been confirmed. She became the first woman to lead the London's force when she was appointed in 2017 and will remain until 2024. On Wednesday, a number of high-profile signatorieswrote an open letteraccusing her of ""presiding over a culture of incompetence and cover-up"". Dame Cressida, 60, said she was ""honoured and humbled"" to have her contract extended. Among those who signed the letter calling for her to go were Baroness Lawrence, whose son Stephenwas murdered in a racist attack,external, and Lady Brittan, whose home was raided when her husband Lord Brittanwas falsely accused of child abuse. Home Secretary Priti Patel said: ""Her extension will provide continuity and stability as we emerge from the coronavirus pandemic and recruit 20,000 additional police officers. ""Londoners know there is more to do to keep our capital safe, including by driving down violent crime, and I look forward to continuing to work with the commissioner and mayor of London to protect the public."" However, former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor -whose home was raided during the flawed investigation into false claims of a VIP paedophile ring- said he was ""bitterly disappointed"". Mr Proctor, who was one of the seven people who signed the letter calling for Dame Cressida to be replaced, said: ""I believe the government will rue the day of this terribly bad and wrong decision. It is obscene."" Protesters demonstrate outside Scotland Yard over the treatment of people by police at the Sarah Everard vigil Since her appointment in 2017, Dame Cressida has been involved in several controversies. The Met commissioner resisted pressure on her to resign in March when the force came under scrutiny over thehandling of a vigil held in memory of Sarah Everard,the marketing executive murdered by then-Met Police constable Wayne Couzens. Three months ago she was personally criticised in a report examining police failings in the 1987 murder of the private investigator Daniel Morgan. Dame Cressida was accused of obstructing access to documents and herforce was denounced as ""institutionally corrupt""- something she denied. The Met has faced repeated accusations of racial bias in its use of stop-and-search powers and was hit with criticism over the security of Wembley stadium during the final of the Euro 2020 championships. Speaking about the decision to extend her five-year contract, Dame Cressida said: ""I am immensely honoured and humbled to have been asked to extend my time as commissioner for a further two years. ""In the last four and a half years Met teams have dealt with some extraordinary challenges, including most recently in the pandemic, and delivered some fantastic results - critically, in reducing violent crimes. ""I'd like to thank the mayor, the home secretary and the prime minister for the confidence they have shown in me. I am acutely aware that there are many excellent leaders in policing."" Dame Cressida has the backing of London Mayor Sadiq Khan, the prime minister and the home secretary In a statement released before the contract extension was announced, the Metropolitan Police Federation said Dame Cressida had the ""full support of the rank and file"". The federation, which represents more than 30,000 officers in London, said: ""It is easy to comment and criticise from the side-lines. ""We know her to be an ethical, courageous and highly competent police leader who genuinely cares about London, its citizens and her officers."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""This will provide the experienced and strong leadership we need as our city emerges from the pandemic. ""The Met commissioner has the most difficult policing job in the country, overseeing the safety of more than 10 million people living, working and visiting our global city.""

Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

'Pingdemic' dents UK economic growth in July,"The UK economy grew by just 0.1% in July as the last Covid restrictions were lifted in England. It was the economy's sixth consecutive month of growth, but the increase was much lower than in the previous month, which saw 1% growth. Arts, entertainment and recreation activities helped the rise, but the ""pingdemic"" kept many workers at home. The UK economy is still 2.1% below its pre-pandemic peak, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said there had been a boost from outdoor events such as sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals following the easing of restrictions on social distancing on 19 July in England. However, the main contributor to growth was a 1.2% rise in production output, boosted by the reopening of an oil field production site, which was previously temporarily closed for planned maintenance. Jonathan Athow, deputy statistician of the ONS, said: ""Oil and gas provided the strongest boost, having partially bounced back after summer maintenance. Car production also continued to recover from recent component shortages."" Many firms suffered from a lack of staff during July as workers were forced to self-isolate at home after being alerted by the NHS Test and Trace app, giving rise to what was dubbed the ""pingdemic"". What's happening with the people still on furlough? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Services output was largely unchanged in July, but the construction sector contracted for a fourth consecutive month, with output down by 1.6%. Construction has been affected by a shortage of building materials as prices have soared and supply has failed to match demand. Overall, GDP grew by 3.6% in the three months to July, the ONS said. The latest figures will weigh on the minds of Bank of England policymakers, who must ponder the implications for UK monetary policy. On Wednesday, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the UK's economic bounce-back from the pandemic was showing signs of ""levelling off"", but he maintained the view that rising inflation would not turn out to be persistent. Natalie Bamford at Colleague Box's head office, known as the Smile Factory Derby-based firm Colleague Box has seen its fortunes intimately linked to the health of the economy during the pandemic. The company allows both companies and individuals to send out gift boxes to friends, colleagues and relatives. With remote working having become standard practice at many firms, its service has allowed them to show their staff they are still appreciated. ""The idea is that we stay connected even though we're apart,"" managing director Natalie Bamford told the BBC. ""It's a way of putting smiles on people's faces."" However, the economic slowdown has not gone unnoticed at the firm. ""We did notice for the first time a slump in sales over August,"" Natalie says. ""We're assuming it was due to the summer holidays, but it makes you concerned as a small business owner."" During the pandemic, Colleague Box has seen some companies send out gift boxes to their entire staff, ""particularly those working from home or on furlough"". And now that more people are returning to work, some firms are putting gift boxes on their desks to welcome them back. ""Returning to the office can be stressful and cause anxiety,"" says Natalie. ""It's going back to the work life that's become alien over the past year."" Colleague Box is now hoping that sales will pick up again in time for Christmas. ""I think we're still very much a nation that wants to celebrate things,"" says Natalie. ""We're clinging to these hallmark holidays, so I think Christmas is going to be big and that will be huge for the economy."" Prof Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told the BBC's Today programme that the increase for July was ""lower than most people expected"". But he added: ""The economy is slowly getting back to its pre-pandemic level. There were always going to be potholes along the way."" July's figures, showing the bounce-back in the economy stalling, make clear the recovery cannot be taken for granted. The cause, primarily, was the upsurge in cases across the UK, tempering the impact of the full reopening of the economy. But the impact of the supply chain crisis is also in these figures. While August should have been better, these figures are consistent with the now slow decline in furlough numbers. Monthly data is always volatile, but the pattern seems to be that the UK saw a very rapid initial bounce-back from the mere act of economic reopening. Recovery is going to be trickier as pandemic support is phased out and the impact of labour shortages and trade problems start to be seen in the figures. Talk of a ""boom"" was rather premature. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the economic recovery had been ""stopped in its tracks"" by a surge in Covid cases in July. He added that there were signs that the economy had regained momentum in August. ""Nonetheless, surveys continue to show that a large minority of households remain fearful of contracting Covid-19, even though they have been double-vaccinated. ""This suggests that the recovery in consumer-facing sectors might run out of steam again in the autumn if, as we expect, Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions remain on their current upward trend,"" he said. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said it appeared that ""England's thrilling run"" in the Euro 2020 tournament had boosted growth in June, leading to ""a bit of fall-back"" in July. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed the recovery was ""well under way"". But Labour's Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said ""Conservative complacency"" was ""holding our country back"". How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"Lingerie lizard's 4,000-mile trip hidden in braA Rotherham woman finds she has brought more home from the Caribbean than just a tan.Sheffield & South Yorkshire","Ms Russell's bra was the perfect place for the lingerie-loving lizard to enjoy the trip from Barbados to Rotherham A lingerie-loving lizard was found lounging in a bra after travelling all the way from Barbados to sunny Yorkshire on a transatlantic flight. The tiny gecko, now called Barbie, was spotted by Lisa Russell as she unpacked her suitcase after arriving back at her home near Rotherham, South Yorkshire. Ms Russell said: ""When it moved, I started screaming. It is not what you expect to find in your bra after a 4,000-mile journey."" Barbie is now safe in the RSPCA's care. The returning holidaymaker, who lives in Thrybergh, arrived home on Tuesday and started to unpack her suitcase after holidaying in the Caribbean. Ms Russell, 47, saw what she thought was a speck on her bra and shook the underwear and it was then she spotted the female lizard moving. More stories from Yorkshire Lisa Russell said she screamed when the ""speck"" moved as she was unpacking her suitcase ""The tiny lizard was lucky as the bra was on top of my suitcase on my clean pile. As it was so hot out there, I didn't bother wearing one,"" the beautician said. Ms Russell revealed that the gecko remained unharmed in its lacy lair despite her sitting on the full suitcase in order to zip it up before her return journey to Yorkshire. Barbie the lizard, named after the famous doll and the lizard's island home, had survived 24 hours in the garment uninjured. The tiny female gecko survived the flight but would not last outside in the UK, said the RSPCA An RSPCA inspector was dispatched to deal with the tiny survivor, which appeared unscathed after its underwear odyssey. Sandra Dransfield, of the RSPCA, said releasing the lizard in the UK would be illegal as it was a non-native species and it ""would not survive in our climate"". The gecko was taken in by a specialist reptile keeper where she is said to be doing well. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Vaccine protection still strong - Oxford jab creatorProf Dame Sarah Gilbert said offering a booster dose this autumn was ""a complex decision"".","This video can not be played Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert: ""We need more doses so we're not talking about choices"" The vaccines are still providing strong protection, a year on from the initial two doses, says the scientist who developed the Oxford-AZ vaccine. The UK's vaccine advisory body is set to decide whether booster doses against Covid-19 are needed this autumn. Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert told the BBC that offering a third booster dose to millions of people was ""a complex decision"". And she called for more vaccines to be licensed to increase supplies. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has already said a third top-up dose should be offered to people with severely weakened immune systems, which accounts for up to half a million people in the UK. But it has not decided if booster doses are needed to extend protection in larger numbers of people at high risk from Covid-19, including those normally eligible for a flu jab. The UK reported a further 37,622 coronavirus cases on Friday,according to the latest government figures.,external There have also been another 147 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Will I get a booster jab this autumn? Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision No jab. No entry. When will I need a Covid passport? Prof Gilbert, who began designing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in early 2020 when Covid first emerged in China, said there were no signs of immunity waning in ongoing trials of the vaccine, which started in April 2020. Blood tests on volunteers who had been vaccinated more than a year ago, showed they had signs of good protection. ""It's the first dose of the vaccine that has the most impact, whoever you give that vaccine too,"" she said. ""We get good protection after a single dose and then it's improved by a second dose and we would expect to see it being maintained or possibly slightly improved then by third dose. ""As we would expect, with any other vaccine, we are seeing strong maintenance of the [immune] response."" Prof Gilbert also said the world needed more doses and more vaccine supplies, so there didn't need to be a choice between vaccinating one country over another. ""More doses are becoming available and we need to focus on getting those doses to countries that really need them,"" she said, adding that many African countries had only vaccinated 2% of their population. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Thursday he was awaiting ""final advice"" from the JCVI, but was ""confident"" a booster programme would start later this month. Interim advice issued by the JCVI in July suggested more than 30 million people should receive a booster dose, including all adults over 50. The UK medicines regulator (MHRA) hasapproved the use of Pfizer and AstraZeneca as Covid booster vaccines,paving the way for a rollout ahead of the winter. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, agreed there is a ""fire raging all around the world with huge pressure on health systems in many, many countries"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to help other countries, adding: ""There is such a big risk, morally from our perspective - there's a risk to trade, there's a risk to economies, but also these are our friends and colleagues who need to be protected, and we are losing them every day that goes by."" Sir Andrew also said the UK still had high levels of protection from the virus, despite the fall in levels of people's immune response after having had the vaccine. The JCVI needs to look at the issue of who is ending up in hospital after being infected as part of its considerations, he added. How many people have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Who is the woman who designed the Oxford vaccine? More than 48.3 million people in the UK - 88.8% of the population aged over 16 - have had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 43.7 million have had both doses. The UK has ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use - Pfizer, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, and the government has pledged to donate 100 million surplus jabs to poorer countries before the middle of 2022.

Taliban increasingly violent against protesters â UN,"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"".

The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

Twenty are on the UK's Covid red list - meaning hotel quarantine for arrivals. They say the fortnight-long talks may involve delegates being away for seven weeks as they will also have to isolate on return. And they warn that flights from Pacific islands have virtually stopped and that some transit hubs are refusing non-residents.

Under Fifa rules, players not released for the recent South American World Cup qualifiers can be banned for five days. The Premier League, the relevant national associations and Fifa are continuing to try to resolve the issue. However, BBC Sport has been told clubs are seriously considering ignoring Fifa and fielding the players in question. All of the South American qualifiers took place in countries on the government's red travel list. Anyone entering - or returning - to the UK from those countries has to quarantine for 10 days. As a result, several players did not report for international duty, resulting in the affected South American national associations asking Fifa to implement bans.

Walls were knocked down at Manchester Crown Court to make it three times the size of a usual courtroom, so it can hold trials with up to 12 defendants. Trials of this size - which usually involve gang-related crime such as county lines, drug trafficking, murders and money laundering - have built up during the pandemic due to social distancing, according to the Ministry of Justice.

The goalkeeper, 30, spent three days on a hospital drip and was ""severely worried"" after catching coronavirus before he was due to have his first jab in July. Having only just returned to full fitness after ""awful fatigue"" and losing five kilos, Darlow told the BBC his ordeal had convinced ""a couple"" of his teammates to get immunised. But speaking onThe Sports Desk podcast,Darlow added that four or five other Newcastle players remain unvaccinated ""for hopefully genuine reasons"". There is growing concern about the numbers of players refusing get the jab, with almost a third in the English Football League still not vaccinated.

The Russell Group of leading universities says some online learning will continue - partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes. Students are also also likely to be asked to wear a face covering in crowded areas such as libraries, and will be encouraged to take regular Covid tests, even if they don't have any symptoms. Staff will be asked to test twice a week. You can read more about how the pandemic might affect universities here. The UK competition regulator is calling for a more ""interventionist"" approach from the government to tackle the ""lottery"" of buying a PCR test for travel. The
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says there is a risk of a ""race to the bottom"" and travellers could end up losing out. It says complaints from customers includes over-priced tests and poor service, with test kits and results arriving late or not at all. When things do go wrong customers are unable to contact some providers, let alone get a refund, the CMA says. The regulator is making a number of recommendations to the government, including creating ""a one-stop list of quality, approved test providers"" by significantly improving the basic standards to qualify to be listed on the gov.uk website. It is also calling for a ""comprehensive monitoring and enforcement programme"" to ensure providers on the list meet basic standards, as well as monitoring of prices, in case price reductions are not seen as a result of other measures. Tests cost about Â£75 per person on average in the UK, but there are reports of some being offered for as little as Â£20, and others for more than Â£500.

The dog welfare charity says it has seen a 35% increase in calls related to giving up the pets in the last few weeks. It says that people are reconsidering owning a dog as their circumstances change post-lockdown. The sales of pets in the UK had soared since the start of the pandemic, when more people spent time at home. The price of puppies more than doubled during lockdown, with dogs costing almost Â£1,900 on average. Owen Sharp, chief executive of the Dogs Trust, said: ""Following the boom in pet ownership during the pandemic which saw millions of us delighting in the companionship of a dog, today's figures have sadly come as no surprise to us.""

Vaccine passports are not being introduced in Scotland until1 Octoberbut ticket holders will be refused entry without proof of a negative lateral flow test. The organisers says precautions are in place to prevent Covid spreading. In addition to needing a negative lateral flow test to enter - which must have been taken no more than 48 hours before arrival - those fans attending on multiple daysmust take a second test 48 hours after the first one. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor July's figures, showing thebounce-back in the UK's economy stalling, make clear the recovery cannot be taken for granted. The cause, primarily, was the upsurge in cases across the UK, tempering the impact of the full reopening of the economy. But the impact of the supply chain crisis is also in these figures. While August should have been better, these figures are consistent with the now slow decline in furlough numbers. Monthly data is always volatile, but the pattern seems to be that the UK saw a very rapid initial bounce-back from the mere act of economic reopening. Recovery is going to be trickier as pandemic support is phased out and the impact of labour shortages and trade problems start to be seen in the figures. Talk of a ""boom"" was rather premature. Derby-based firm Colleague Box has seen its fortunes intimately linked to the health of the economy during the pandemic. The company allows both companies and individuals to send out gift boxes to friends, colleagues and relatives to show them they are still appreciated while many continue working remotely.

Read more Here's a bit more detail on the news we brought you earlier that the Covid infection rate in Scotland has again risen to its highest level since estimates began. About 117,300 people - one in 45 - are thought to have had the virus last week, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey. It is the highest rate of any of the UK nations - and the most ever recorded. For the same week (ending 3 September), England's rate is estimated to be one in 70, Wales one in 65 and Northern Ireland one in 60, says the ONS. The figure for Scotland was a large increase on the previous week when it was one in 75. Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey, says: ""Scotland now has the highest rates across the UK countries where infections have continued to increase sharply, reaching a new highest recorded level.""

Mark Drakeford says there are a number of practical and ethical issues but with infection rates rising it would be irresponsible not to consider the measure. He says Covid hospital admissions in Wales could more than double to 100 a day, based on modelling work carried out by Swansea University.

First launched in 2016, the app was acquired by Fortnite-maker Epic Games in 2019 as part of a multi-million dollar deal. In November 2020 it was integrated with Fortnite to let players see one another during multiplayer gaming sessions. But the developers say their work on other Epic Games products mean they cannot give Houseparty ""the attention that it deserves"". In a statement, the team says,externalit will instead develop ""new ways to have meaningful and authentic social interactions"" in other Epic Games software.

There could beas many as 100 new Covid hospital admissions a day in Walesas the Delta wave peaks at the end of this month, First Minister Mark Drakeford warns. Describing the situation as ""serious"", he says the figure is based on modelling work carried out by Swansea University. At the moment there are about 40 daily Covid-19 hospital admissions a day, Drakeford says, adding that patients will include many who need to be in hospital for a long time and need intensive care. Public Health Wales has reported 2,467 more coronavirus cases today and five more Covid-related deaths. The nation's public health agency says 522.7 per 100,000 population have tested positive for the virus in the past seven days - the highest case rate since the second wave in December. Â© 2025 BBC.

UK and around the world: David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Bangladesh, on the UN's list of Least Developed Countries, is battling river erosion due to climate change The world's poorest countries say they are worried about getting to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Twenty are on the UK's Covid red list - meaning hotel quarantine for arrivals. They say the fortnight-long talks may involve delegates being away for seven weeks as they will also have to isolate on return. And they warn that flights from Pacific islands have virtually stopped and that some transit hubs are refusing non-residents. The warning comes from the group made up of the world's 46 poorest countries which are on the United Nations' list ofLeast Developed Countries (LDC),external. The 20 countries that are also on theUK's foreign travel red list,externalinclude Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Nepal. Read more More than 400 University of Hertfordshire students have signed a petition demanding face-to-face tutoring, after some found they were only being offered online sessions again this year. They claim the institution is putting the cost benefits of virtual lessons ahead of students' preferences. The university says the timetables have not been finalised, and ""all students will receive in-person, on-campus teaching sessions this year"". According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, one student, whose timetable indicated only online lessons, said: ""With us being allowed back in clubs and venues like Leeds Festival, how can they [decide] online lessons are still ok?""

Under Fifa rules, players not released for the recent South American World Cup qualifiers can be banned for five days. The Premier League, the relevant national associations and Fifa are continuing to try to resolve the issue. However, BBC Sport has been told clubs are seriously considering ignoring Fifa and fielding the players in question. All of the South American qualifiers took place in countries on the government's red travel list. Anyone entering - or returning - to the UK from those countries has to quarantine for 10 days. As a result, several players did not report for international duty, resulting in the affected South American national associations asking Fifa to implement bans. Read more A ""super"" courtroom has opened in England to tackle backlogs caused by the coronavirus pandemic and make it easier to deal with organised crime gangs. Walls were knocked down at Manchester Crown Court to make it three times the size of a usual courtroom, so it can hold trials with up to 12 defendants. Trials of this size - which usually involve gang-related crime such as county lines, drug trafficking, murders and money laundering - have built up during the pandemic due to social distancing, according to the Ministry of Justice. Courts Minister Lord Wolfson QC says the Â£2.5m revamp ""will get gang-related suspects in front of judges quicker"" and ""speed up justice for victims"".

of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 89.0% of the population aged 16 and over has now had at least one jab. And a further 96,702 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 80.6% of the population aged 16 and over has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 37,622 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,

This video can not be played Newcastle United goalkeeper Karl Darlow talks about his experience with Covid-19 Newcastle United's Karl Darlow has urged footballers to get the Covid vaccine after he recovered from a serious bout of the virus. The goalkeeper, 30, spent three days on a hospital drip and was ""severely worried"" after catching coronavirus before he was due to have his first jab in July. Having only just returned to full fitness after ""awful fatigue"" and losing five kilos, Darlow told the BBC his ordeal had convinced ""a couple"" of his teammates to get immunised. But speaking onThe Sports Desk podcast,Darlow added that four or five other Newcastle players remain unvaccinated ""for hopefully genuine reasons"". There is growing concern about the numbers of players refusing get the jab, with almost a third in the English Football League still not vaccinated. Read more As students return to campus for the new term, they'll find many Covid restrictions have been lifted. There should be more face-to-face teaching but things won't be entirely back to normal. The Russell Group of leading universities says some online learning will continue - partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes. Students are also also likely to be asked to wear a face covering in crowded areas such as libraries, and will be encouraged to take regular Covid tests, even if they don't have any symptoms. Staff will be asked to test twice a week. You can read more about how the pandemic might affect universities here. The UK competition regulator is calling for a more ""interventionist"" approach from the government to tackle the ""lottery"" of buying a PCR test for travel. The
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says there is a risk of a ""race to the bottom"" and travellers could end up losing out. It says complaints from customers includes over-priced tests and poor service, with test kits and results arriving late or not at all. When things do go wrong customers are unable to contact some providers, let alone get a refund, the CMA says. The regulator is making a number of recommendations to the government, including creating ""a one-stop list of quality, approved test providers"" by significantly improving the basic standards to qualify to be listed on the gov.uk website. It is also calling for a ""comprehensive monitoring and enforcement programme"" to ensure providers on the list meet basic standards, as well as monitoring of prices, in case price reductions are not seen as a result of other measures. Tests cost about Â£75 per person on average in the UK, but there are reports of some being offered for as little as Â£20, and others for more than Â£500. Read more More people are considering giving up their dogs for adoption since coronavirus restrictions were lifted, according to the Dogs Trust. The dog welfare charity says it has seen a 35% increase in calls related to giving up the pets in the last few weeks. It says that people are reconsidering owning a dog as their circumstances change post-lockdown. The sales of pets in the UK had soared since the start of the pandemic, when more people spent time at home. The price of puppies more than doubled during lockdown, with dogs costing almost Â£1,900 on average. Owen Sharp, chief executive of the Dogs Trust, said: ""Following the boom in pet ownership during the pandemic which saw millions of us delighting in the companionship of a dog, today's figures have sadly come as no surprise to us.""

Wales already has anNHS Covid Pass,externalto show your vaccination status In England, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says people will need to prove their Covid status to get into nightclubs and some other venues from the end of September. The plans were first announced in July and have been opposed by some Tory MPs and the Liberal Democrats. Nightclubs have described them as ""chaotic and surreal"". In England, as long as you are registered with a GP, you can prove your Covid status using theNHS Covid Pass,external, via the NHS App. Northern Ireland has not yet proposed Covid passport rules for venues and events, but residents canapply for a Covid status certificate online,external. Read more about the plans for vaccine passports across the UK here. Up to 50,000 people are descending on Glasgow Green for the first day of the TRNSMT festival. The three-day event will see performances from artists including Liam Gallagher, Snow Patrol, Amy Macdonald and The Chemical Brothers. Vaccine passports are not being introduced in Scotland until1 Octoberbut ticket holders will be refused entry without proof of a negative lateral flow test. The organisers says precautions are in place to prevent Covid spreading. In addition to needing a negative lateral flow test to enter - which must have been taken no more than 48 hours before arrival - those fans attending on multiple daysmust take a second test 48 hours after the first one. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor July's figures, showing thebounce-back in the UK's economy stalling, make clear the recovery cannot be taken for granted. The cause, primarily, was the upsurge in cases across the UK, tempering the impact of the full reopening of the economy. But the impact of the supply chain crisis is also in these figures. While August should have been better, these figures are consistent with the now slow decline in furlough numbers. Monthly data is always volatile, but the pattern seems to be that the UK saw a very rapid initial bounce-back from the mere act of economic reopening. Recovery is going to be trickier as pandemic support is phased out and the impact of labour shortages and trade problems start to be seen in the figures. Talk of a ""boom"" was rather premature. Derby-based firm Colleague Box has seen its fortunes intimately linked to the health of the economy during the pandemic. The company allows both companies and individuals to send out gift boxes to friends, colleagues and relatives to show them they are still appreciated while many continue working remotely.

Rail industry urges workers not to spurn the train,"Unless workers start taking the train again, there could be long-term adverse effects on city centres and High Streets, the rail industry has warned. Train commuting is still just 33% of its pre-Covid rate, while car journeys have reached pre-pandemic levels, said the Rail Delivery Group (RDG). If workers continued to go by road rather than rail, there would be more pollution, it added. Cities could be hit by a double whammy of traffic jams and business closures. A 20% shift from rail to road would lead to 300 million extra hours of traffic congestion, the RDG said. ""With more workers set to return to offices this month, encouraging people to take the train for their commute will be vital to avoid empty shop fronts and polluting traffic jams in cities across the country,"" it added. The RDG said rail journeys to and from work were expected to increase during September, but could take years to return to numbers seen in 2019. It added that train commuters were vital to city centres and High Streets. Research carried out by WPI Economics for the RDG indicated that these commuters spent a total of Â£30bn a year on food and drink, shopping, entertainment and culture, boosting local businesses. Andy Bagnall, director general of the Rail Delivery Group, said that for many commuters, the future would undoubtedly involve a mix of home and office working. However, he added the extent to which people returned to the workplace, and whether or not they took the train to get there, would be crucial. ""When people take the train, it's more than a journey - it will impact the future of thousands of small businesses, local air quality and the government's net zero ambitions,"" he said. The RDG said that although commuting and business journeys by rail were still well below pre-pandemic levels, leisure journeys were recovering more quickly, suggesting that many people felt confident travelling by train. To encourage more people to take the train, the rail industry is running a national marketing campaign with the slogan, ""Let's get back on track"". Rail companies have also introduced new Flexi Season tickets that provide a discount for commuters travelling into the office two or three days a week.

"Doctors are exhausted, says BMA chief","Dr Lewis Morrison said doctors were washed out physically and mentally Scotland's doctors are ""exhausted"" and many are cutting working hours or leaving the health service altogether, according to a senior doctors' leader. BMA Scotland chairman Dr Lewis Morrison told BBC Scotland that doctors were ""washed out physically and mentally"" after 18 months of the Covid pandemic. He said action was needed to stop doctors leaving the profession and to boost recruitment of new medics. The Scottish government said it was working to manage the pressures. Speaking ahead of the BMA's annual representative meeting, Dr Morrison said the ""workforce crisis"" had its roots in the number of senior doctor vacancies before the pandemic. Hospitals under more pressure than ever, say medics Doctors and dentists awarded 3% pay rise Can in-person GP appointments ever fully return? But he said that the NHS ""being run at 110% capacity"" during Covid had deepened the crisis. The pressures across the NHS had been ""immense"" in the past few weeks, he said. Dr Morrison said doctors traditionally had low levels of sickness but it was starting to rise. ""I think the cumulative effect of the pandemic is now starting to show,"" he said. ""The main other thing is to look after people, to give people the space to have rest and recuperation as best they can, to not pressurise people to do more and more. ""The message needs to go to the public to still be patient with the NHS because it cannot meet the needs of everybody right now."" The BMA says the pandemic has deepened a ""workforce crisis"" that existed before the current pressures Dr Morrison said that in the medium term, over the next few months, efforts must be made to stop staff leaving the NHS. ""There are lots of factors at play that could lead people to make a decision to either retire, or potentially leave for other parts of the world to work, or indeed to reduce the amount of work they do to protect themselves from physical and mental burnout,"" he said. ""So anything we can do to support the existing medical workforce until we get a clear plan for recruiting and increasing the number of doctors that is going to be how we get through this."" Dr Morrison said the problem was not an issue of ""morale"". ""This is sheer out-and-out exhaustion we are looking at and that's more worrying,"" he said. The Scottish government said the health secretary met BMA representatives earlier this week to hear about the challenges facing doctors. A spokesperson said: ""We are also working proactively with health boards to manage pressures and take rapid action to support increased capacity, including expedited recruitment, flexible deployment of existing staffing and supporting mutual aid across the system. ""Our NHS Recovery Plan commits more than Â£1bn of targeted investment in Scotland's health service and sets out key actions for the next five years, putting staff at the very heart of our recovery with an increased budget of Â£8m to provide ongoing support for their mental health and wellbeing. ""This includes targeted support to the primary care and social care workforce of Â£2m. We have record staffing levels and the best paid staff in UK, recently giving doctors a 3% pay rise.""

'We are busier than any of the busiest winters',"Dr Lynn McCallum said health services were busier than during the busiest winter The medical director of NHS Borders has urged the public to ""be kind"" to staff facing ""unprecedented challenges"". Dr Lynn McCallum said they were currently busier than in the ""busiest winter"". She added that there had also been an increase in abuse of staff recently - both face-to-face and on social media. She said she recognised some delays for treatment were ""far from ideal"" but she urged people to show understanding. Dr McCallum said the challenges being faced by health workers were greater than they had seen at any point in their careers. Dr McCallum said the emergency department was facing significant pressure ""Unfortunately, the last 18 months have had such a significant impact on staff that we are seeing significant problems both with vacancies and staff absence due to illness,"" she said. ""As a result it is proving very, very challenging to provide services across the organisation."" Doctors are 'exhausted' says BMA chief She said it translated to very low morale among workers. ""I think the staff have absolutely put their heart and soul into working and providing high quality healthcare over the last 18 months,"" said Dr McCallum. ""But the pressures continue relentlessly both in relation to Covid but also in relation to non-Covid illness."" She said she recognised a lot of people were still waiting for operations -non-urgent surgery is currently suspended- and said that was a source of frustration for staff as well. The hospital is currently said to be operating at full capacity However, Dr McCallum said that was no excuse for abusing workers. ""Sadly, we have seen a significant increase in poor behaviour from the public,"" she said. ""We have seen quite a lot of abuse to staff face-to-face - and even more on social media. ""I suppose what I would request of the public is please be kind. ""Please remember where all of these individuals have been for the last 18 months and how hard they have been working."" She said health workers were looking towards winter ""with some dread"". ""As things stand currently we are busier than we have seen at any of the busiest winters in any of our working careers,"" she said. Dr McCallum said the Borders General was operating at full capacity which was creating problems for the emergency department which could not be closed. ""What we are finding is that patients are unfortunately having to stay for prolonged periods of time in the emergency department which we know is far from ideal for either them or our staff,"" she added.

"'We are busier than any of the busiest winters'The medical director of NHS Borders asks the public to ""be kind"" to under pressure staff.South Scotland","Dr Lynn McCallum said health services were busier than during the busiest winter The medical director of NHS Borders has urged the public to ""be kind"" to staff facing ""unprecedented challenges"". Dr Lynn McCallum said they were currently busier than in the ""busiest winter"". She added that there had also been an increase in abuse of staff recently - both face-to-face and on social media. She said she recognised some delays for treatment were ""far from ideal"" but she urged people to show understanding. Dr McCallum said the challenges being faced by health workers were greater than they had seen at any point in their careers. Dr McCallum said the emergency department was facing significant pressure ""Unfortunately, the last 18 months have had such a significant impact on staff that we are seeing significant problems both with vacancies and staff absence due to illness,"" she said. ""As a result it is proving very, very challenging to provide services across the organisation."" Doctors are 'exhausted' says BMA chief She said it translated to very low morale among workers. ""I think the staff have absolutely put their heart and soul into working and providing high quality healthcare over the last 18 months,"" said Dr McCallum. ""But the pressures continue relentlessly both in relation to Covid but also in relation to non-Covid illness."" She said she recognised a lot of people were still waiting for operations -non-urgent surgery is currently suspended- and said that was a source of frustration for staff as well. The hospital is currently said to be operating at full capacity However, Dr McCallum said that was no excuse for abusing workers. ""Sadly, we have seen a significant increase in poor behaviour from the public,"" she said. ""We have seen quite a lot of abuse to staff face-to-face - and even more on social media. ""I suppose what I would request of the public is please be kind. ""Please remember where all of these individuals have been for the last 18 months and how hard they have been working."" She said health workers were looking towards winter ""with some dread"". ""As things stand currently we are busier than we have seen at any of the busiest winters in any of our working careers,"" she said. Dr McCallum said the Borders General was operating at full capacity which was creating problems for the emergency department which could not be closed. ""What we are finding is that patients are unfortunately having to stay for prolonged periods of time in the emergency department which we know is far from ideal for either them or our staff,"" she added.

"Schools safe for children and staff, says CMOSir Michael McBride says there is a ""certainty of long-term harm to many children"" from not attending school.Northern IrelandComments","Northern Ireland primary pupils are only behind students in the east Asian countries Singapore, South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan Schools are safe places for children and staff, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer has said. Professor Sir Michael McBride made the comments in a detailed letter about schools to pupils, parents and staff. He added, though, that it was ""inevitable"" there would be Covid cases in schools. But he said there was a ""certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people"" from not attending school. ""The public health grounds for keeping and supporting children at school are extremely strong,"" he wrote. His letter comes as the Public Health Authority (PHA)takes over responsibility for contact tracing in schools on Friday. In his letter Sir Michael said that the Covid pandemic had damaged children's wellbeing, mental health and education. ""Children from more disadvantaged backgrounds have been particularly negatively impacted,"" he said. ""As we progress through the pandemic response, we must continue to strike a balance between safeguarding children's education and wellbeing and measures to contain Covid."" Pupils in contact with Covid case can stay in class Pandemic 'had severe impact' on young people Children's very low Covid risk confirmed by study Schools overwhelmed by 'tsunami' of Covid absences Sir Michael said that now was the right time to take a more targeted approach to contact tracing in schools and said he was writing to explain why that was the case. ""Multiple sources of evidence show that a lack of schooling increases inequalities, reduces the life chances of children and can exacerbate physical and mental health issues,"" he said. ""School improves health, learning, socialisation and opportunities throughout childhood, adolescence and into adulthood."" He wrote that it was ""no longer necessary"" to close schools as had happened earlier in the pandemic. Sir Michael McBride said there is a ""certainty of long-term harm to many children"" from not attending school He also cited large-scale studies from England and Scotland which showed ""the vast majority of those identified as school close contacts and sent home to isolate during the last academic year did not go on to develop Covid"". The chief medical officer said that the overall risk of children becoming severely ill from Covid was extremely low. He also said all school staff had the chance to be fully vaccinated, and that many other safety measures remained in place in schools. ""It is my professional opinion, which is shared by my chief medical officer colleagues across the UK, that very few, if any, children or teenagers will come to long-term harm from Covid due solely to attending school,"" he said. ""This has to be set against a certainty of long-term harm to many children and young people from not attending school."" Sir Michael said the contact tracing taken on by the PHA would bring Northern Ireland into line with England, Scotland and Wales and identify children with the ""closest contact"" to a positive case. He also said it would free principals and teachers to get back to ""doing what they do best - teaching and inspiring our children and young people.""

LiveLiveSecond evacuation flight set to leave Afghanistan3 minutes ago,"Taliban violence against protesters is increasing, the UN human rights organisation says The agency called on the Islamist group to stop using force, and allow peaceful demonstrations A second international flight carrying passengers leaving Afghanistan has now departed from Kabul airport The first flight to carry foreigners since the US pullout left on Thursday US officials described the Taliban co-operation as businesslike and professional Saturday will be the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US - which triggered a two-decade conflict in Afghanistan Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We're now pausing our live coverage of the latest developments in and around Afghanistan - thanks for staying with us. Just to recap, here are the main headlines in the past 24 hours:  You can still follow all the latest developments on major news stories on theBBC News website. BBC OS A US flag is seen posted in the rubble of the World Trade Center in New York, two days after the attack there The BBC is covering the 20th anniversary of the 11 September 2001 attacks in the US, which led to the 20-year conflict in Afghanistan. This is the story of Chris Cruz, who explains in an interview to BBC's OS programme why he decided to join the US army. ""My mother was heading to work on a normal 11 September day. As soon as she exited the subway, she was told to start running as the buildings were coming down. She literally saw them coming down and described people jumping out of the windows,"" says Chris. ""When she finally made it home, I - as an 11-year-old boy at the time - had to tell her that she had burn marks and blood spots on the back of her legs. She was in a state of shock. ""As I grew up, I realised... I had the ability to be part of an organisation that could defend and prevent these atrocities for all Americans. ""9/11 played a role, but not in a way of revenge. I didn't want to join out of bloodlust. I served two tours in Afghanistan. Both of those times I volunteered to go. ""I don't think our mission would have succeeded without our Afghan partners. I agree we couldn't be there forever, but we made a promise to keep our partners safe and that we wouldn't turn our backs on them, and that's exactly what we've done."" Chris adds: ""I do think the way we pulled out, the way we left it, was completely wrong. There needed to be a better exit strategy."" New York Republican representative Lee Zeldin says it is âinfuriatingâ
that the Taliban are âback in controlâ of Afghanistan two decades after the
September 11 attacks. In an interview with Fox News, Zeldin, 41 - who joined the US
Army in 2003 and later deployed to Iraq - said he âcouldnât get on active
duty fast enoughâ following the attacks. âI vividly remember the sounds, the visuals, the motions,
the yellow ribbons on all the trees on the streets, the flags going up from home to home â a sense of patriotism and unity I had never
experienced at any other point in my life,â he said. Zeldin said he believed the US withdrawal
from Afghanistan would create a âpath towards leaving our nation more
domestically vulnerable to threatsâ. âCreating a nation as a safe haven of terrorism, and likely
allowing the rise of groups like al-Qaeda and IS, that has ramifications
beyond Afghanistanâs borders,â he said.  Nine out of 10 households in Afghanistan are not getting enough to eat, the World Food Programme has warned. Regional director Anthea Webb said that after the Taliban took power on 15 August, ""the portion of families resorting to extreme coping mechanisms, like skipping meals or preferring to give food to children instead of adults or limiting portion sizes had almost doubled"". The findings were based on phone calls to 1,600 random households between 17 June and 5 September. An international conference on aid to Afghanistan is due to take place on Monday and Webb called on donors to respond to an appeal for $200m. Food prices had risen sharply even before the Taliban takeover due a drought. Afghanistan is in an acute economic situation after Western powers suspended foreign aid, and the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) also halted payments. Pakistan has been delivering aid A former US Ambassador to Afghanistan has told BBC News the ""stunning"" retreat of US forces ""pulled the plumbing"" out of Afghan security forces. Karl Eikenberry described the situation as ""a house of cards militarily and politically"", and said the way the Afghan army had been developed by the United States had left it dependent on US intelligence, technology and firepower, which contributed to the rapid collapse in control. This video can not be played Karl Eikenberry described the collapse of Afghanistan's government as a ""house of cards"" Women playing cricket in Herat in 2015 Afghanistan Cricket Board chief Hamid Shinwari has pleaded with Australia not to cancel an upcoming match in Hobart over the Taliban's attitude to women in sport. Taliban officials have suggested they could ban women playing sport. Cricket Australia  said it would have to cancel a men's test against Afghanistan in Hobart on 27 November if women were banned. Mr Shinwari issued a statement saying that ""cricket diplomacy"" was preferable to a ""knee-jerk"" reaction. And he suggested that Taliban comments on the participation of women in cricket were not substantially different from the ""cultural and religious environment"" under the previous Ghani and Karzai governments. Mr Shinwari called on ""Cricket Australia and the whole cricketing world to keep the door open for us"". A Taliban official earlier toldAustralia's SBS,externalnews that sport was ""not necessary"" and ""in cricket, they might face a situation where their face and body will not be covered"". This video can not be played Former member of Afghan parliament: 'The Taliban would've killed me if they found me' Former member of the Afghan parliament, Naheed Farid, left Afghanistan because she feared the Taliban could kill her, and she worried about the safety of her children. Ms Farid said she still felt part of Afghanistan and wanted to ""stand for the freedom of women"". She spoke to the BBC's Chief International Correspondent Lyse Doucet. A second international civilian charter flight has just taken off from Kabul airport, headed for Doha. It is currently unclear how many people are on the flight, or their nationalities. It comes after more than 100 people, including US and UK nationals, were flown out of Afghanistan on Thursday. Qatari officials, who have been assisting the Taliban to reopen the airport, say it is up and running again. The Taliban say regular commercial flights will resume soon. As we've reported, the Taliban has declared victory in the Panjshir Valley, the final pocket of territory which remained outside their rule. However anti-Taliban resistance fighters have denied that, and said they were still present in ""all strategic positions"" in the province. Caught in the middle of the fighting are the citizens of Panjshir - some of whom are reported to have fled into the surrounding mountains to escape the violence, according to Afghanistan's Tolo News agency who quote Panjshir residents in Kabul. One family who lost a son during the fighting has warned of a humanitarian crisis in the region, but the Taliban has denied that, and described the conditions in Panjshir as ""normal"". Read more on why the Panjshir Valley is so significant This video can not be played Afghanistan: Taliban fighters raise flag in Panjshir Traditional clothes sellers in Kabul have said the new Taliban government is proving to be a boost for their income. ""Our business has changed now,"" seller Abdul Hameed told Reuters news agency. ""People are not going for jeans and T-shirts, they want traditional clothes and waistcoats. People do not have money to buy much, but still, they are coming to us more than before."" However shops selling jeans, suits and eye-catching dresses have said their profits are drying up. Sayed Numan Sadat told Reuters people are not daring to venture into his shop, which specialises in glitzy women's dresses. ""For now, the Islamic Emirate has permitted us to run our business. If things get better, we will continue. If not, we will shut our business and we will start a new type of work to feed ourselves."" While sales have boomed at traditional clothing stores, they have dropped significantly at other businesses, like this women's clothing shop Aid workers are warning that almost the entire population of Afghanistan could slide into poverty within the next few months,reports the Wall Street Journal.,external It says that even before the Taliban takeover, half of the countryâs roughly 40 million people already needed humanitarian assistance, according to the UN. Now, aid organisations are looking for ways to help the Afghan people without strengthening the Taliban's new administration. Afghanistan has been cut off from the international financial system and foreign aid since August, with more than $9bn (Â£6.5bn) in the Afghanistan central bankâs assets frozen in the West. Meanwhile,the World Health Organization warned this week that more than 2,000 health facilities in Afghanistan were now at risk of closing,externalbecause funding was halted, meaning millions of vulnerable Afghans could lose access to essential healthcare. The team became a symbol for the progress of Afghan women (File image) Members of the famed all-girls Afghan robotics team who faced an agonising wait before managing to escape Kabul have spoken to the BBC about their ordeal - and why they fear for the future for Afghan women. For 17-year-old Ayda and 18-year-old Somaya, the chaotic scenes of Kabul's fall to the Taliban will forever be etched into their memory. ""We tried to get a visa out, but couldn't. We were trying to go to the airport for three days. But we couldn't. There were thousands of people trying,"" Ayda says of her harrowing escape from Afghanistan. ""We were in the streets and so many children were crying. They couldn't find their families."" On the third day, however, they managed to get on a flight organised by Qatar's government, flying to Doha alongside seven other team members, all without their families. But even as they begin their new lives in Doha, the pair both say their minds drift back to those still in Afghanistan. Read more here. As we have been reporting, the director general of MI5 has warned that the fall of Afghanistan to the Taliban is likely to have ""emboldened"" UK terrorists. Ken McCallum told the BBCthat while the terror threat would not change overnight, there could be a ""morale boost"" for extremists. Fears over the link between the Taliban takeover and terrorism have also been expressed by UN chief Antonio Guterres. In an interview with AFP news agency, he was asked about the risks of an Afghanistan-like scenario happening in West Africa's Sahel region, where Islamist groups are waging insurgencies. Guterres said there was a ""real danger"" that some ""terrorist groups may feel enthusiastic about what happened and have ambitions beyond what they thought a few months ago"". He said he was worried about fanatical groups where death ""is desirable"", and that it was ""essential to reinforce security mechanisms in the Sahel"". Click here to read more about what the Taliban takeover means for Africa's jihadists Guterres also warned of extremists feeling emboldened Welcome to our live coverage of the latest developments in Afghanistan. The BBC will also be reflecting on the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks in the US, and how they defined the 20-year conflict. Our correspondents will be reporting from New York, Kabul, Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere. Here are some of the biggest updates we've been covering on Friday:  As we reported earlier, the first civilian charter flight from Afghanistan since the US pullout from the country arrived in Doha on Thursday night. Qatar Airways flew more than 100 foreign nationals from Kabul to Doha. They included 13 Britons and up to 30 Americans. The US said the Taliban had shown flexibility, and been ""business-like and professional"" in facilitating the departure of American citizens. More than 100 people were on the flight headed to Doha and included families with children This is the first commercial international flight to leave Kabul since the airlift was suspended at the end of August Some international flights have been in and out before, but largely carrying aid and technicians who were part of the team helping to get Kabul's airport operational again Russia will not take part ""in any way"" in the Taliban government's inauguration ceremony in Afghanistan, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov has said. ""We do not know how this situation will develop. That is why we say that it is important for us to understand what the first and subsequent steps of the current leadership of Afghanistan will be,"" he said. Earlier in the week, the speaker of Russia's upper house of parliament said Russia would be represented at the
inauguration by ambassador-level officials, the RIA news agency had reported. On Thursday, President Vladimir Putin said Russia was in talks with the Taliban to facilitate the evacuation
from Afghanistan of nationals of other countries. ""Many are asking us to help bring out of Afghanistan
nationals of third countries, as well as some Afghans. We are not doing this
covertly; we too are in talks with Taliban leaders in relation to certain
categories of people and we are doing this,"" he told a news conference in Moscow. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News For the past two decades, terrorism has dominated MI5's work. But with significant shifts over time. It took the attacks of 7 July 2005 for it to fully understand the threat came from within as well as abroad. By the 10th anniversary of 9/11, the sense was that the threat from al-Qaeda might be receding and MI5 could turn to other issues of concern, such as state espionage. But then the Islamic State group emerged out of Iraq and Syria and a new wave started - less sophisticated and organised but still deadly. Once again, in the last couple of years, there was a hope that this jihadist threat might be slowing as MI5 took on extreme-right wing activity and focused more on Russia and China. But recent events have raised concerns that the jihadist threat could evolve once again, with Afghanistan inspiring people to act, or by the Western withdrawal creating a new safe haven for groups to operate in and plan more sophisticated attacks, as they did in the years around 9/11. MI5 boss warns of Afghanistan 'morale boost' for extremists The UN rights office says the Taliban have been ""increasingly violent"" against protesters, using live ammunition, batons and whips. Spokesperson Ravina Shamdasani told a briefing in Geneva that the agency had received credible reports that at least four people had been killed at protests in recent days. Protesters have also been beaten and detained. In addition to violence against protesters, the UN said the Taliban had been increasingly using force against those reporting on the demonstrations. Earlier this week, the Taliban issued an order prohibiting ""unauthorised assemblies"". ""Rather than banning peaceful protests, the Taliban should cease the use of force and ensure the freedom of peaceful assembly and expression, including as a means for people to voice their concerns and exercise their right to participate in public affairs,"" the UN rights office said. Click here to read more about how journalists have been beaten, detained and flogged by the Taliban when attempting to cover protests Some of the Afghans evacuated to Australia who have now left hotel quarantine say they are grateful for their escape, but worry about those left behind. ""We have seen a few children who have come with heavy
trauma,"" aid worker Assadullah Khurrami told Reuters. ""The evacuees are very grateful... but
at the same time there is a lot of desperation, a lot of sadness
in these families, in these individuals, because they still have
loved ones and family members left in Afghanistan."" One such refugee is Amena - a member of the Hazara ethnic group which has been persecuted by extremists - who managed to escape on one of the last evacuation flights, but was forced to leave her family behind at Kabul airport. âThey caught my brothers, my parents and stopped them from moving beyond the gate. I was on one side of the gate, they were on the other. The Taliban had guns, they were hitting people,â she told SBS News. While Amena had a visa to Australia, the rest of her family didn't. They're now in hiding in Kabul, unable to return home to rural Afghanistan because it has been taken by the Taliban. Australia managed to evacuate a total of 4,100 people from Kabul after it fell to the Taliban. Pakistan's role in the recent events has been much disputed. It has led to anti-Pakistan protests in the Afghan capital. On the other hand, some Western powers seeking to influence the new Taliban government, are hoping that Pakistan could play a role as a mediator. Pakistan's foreign minister on Friday said he wanted peace and prosperity in Afghanistan, while calling for a humanitarian crisis there to be averted. In a statement reported by local media, Shah Mehmood Qureshi said Pakistan was committed to helping Afghanistan, despite having limited resources. He said Pakistan had sent medicine and food to Kabul on Thursday, and urged other countries to take action too. And he added: ""We should encourage the Taliban not to allow their land to be used against any other country."" Anti-Pakistan protestshave been held in Kabul this week, with many Afghans believing the country supports the Taliban. Claims have emerged that in recent days Pakistani drones have been used to help the Taliban, by targeting anti-Taliban positions. The claims have been dismissed by Pakistan, as well as by the Taliban. A spokesman for the Pakistani armed forces, Gen Babar Iftikhar, told the BBC they were ""complete lies"".

UK economic growth slows sharply in JulyThe UK economy grew just 0.1% in July as the last Covid restrictions were lifted in England.Business,"The UK economy grew by just 0.1% in July as the last Covid restrictions were lifted in England. It was the economy's sixth consecutive month of growth, but the increase was much lower than in the previous month, which saw 1% growth. Arts, entertainment and recreation activities helped the rise, but the ""pingdemic"" kept many workers at home. The UK economy is still 2.1% below its pre-pandemic peak, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said there had been a boost from outdoor events such as sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals following the easing of restrictions on social distancing on 19 July in England. However, the main contributor to growth was a 1.2% rise in production output, boosted by the reopening of an oil field production site, which was previously temporarily closed for planned maintenance. Jonathan Athow, deputy statistician of the ONS, said: ""Oil and gas provided the strongest boost, having partially bounced back after summer maintenance. Car production also continued to recover from recent component shortages."" Many firms suffered from a lack of staff during July as workers were forced to self-isolate at home after being alerted by the NHS Test and Trace app, giving rise to what was dubbed the ""pingdemic"". What's happening with the people still on furlough? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Services output was largely unchanged in July, but the construction sector contracted for a fourth consecutive month, with output down by 1.6%. Construction has been affected by a shortage of building materials as prices have soared and supply has failed to match demand. Overall, GDP grew by 3.6% in the three months to July, the ONS said. The latest figures will weigh on the minds of Bank of England policymakers, who must ponder the implications for UK monetary policy. On Wednesday, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the UK's economic bounce-back from the pandemic was showing signs of ""levelling off"", but he maintained the view that rising inflation would not turn out to be persistent. Natalie Bamford at Colleague Box's head office, known as the Smile Factory Derby-based firm Colleague Box has seen its fortunes intimately linked to the health of the economy during the pandemic. The company allows both companies and individuals to send out gift boxes to friends, colleagues and relatives. With remote working having become standard practice at many firms, its service has allowed them to show their staff they are still appreciated. ""The idea is that we stay connected even though we're apart,"" managing director Natalie Bamford told the BBC. ""It's a way of putting smiles on people's faces."" However, the economic slowdown has not gone unnoticed at the firm. ""We did notice for the first time a slump in sales over August,"" Natalie says. ""We're assuming it was due to the summer holidays, but it makes you concerned as a small business owner."" During the pandemic, Colleague Box has seen some companies send out gift boxes to their entire staff, ""particularly those working from home or on furlough"". And now that more people are returning to work, some firms are putting gift boxes on their desks to welcome them back. ""Returning to the office can be stressful and cause anxiety,"" says Natalie. ""It's going back to the work life that's become alien over the past year."" Colleague Box is now hoping that sales will pick up again in time for Christmas. ""I think we're still very much a nation that wants to celebrate things,"" says Natalie. ""We're clinging to these hallmark holidays, so I think Christmas is going to be big and that will be huge for the economy."" Prof Jagjit Chadha, director of the National Institute of Economic and Social Research, told the BBC's Today programme that the increase for July was ""lower than most people expected"". But he added: ""The economy is slowly getting back to its pre-pandemic level. There were always going to be potholes along the way."" July's figures, showing the bounce-back in the economy stalling, make clear the recovery cannot be taken for granted. The cause, primarily, was the upsurge in cases across the UK, tempering the impact of the full reopening of the economy. But the impact of the supply chain crisis is also in these figures. While August should have been better, these figures are consistent with the now slow decline in furlough numbers. Monthly data is always volatile, but the pattern seems to be that the UK saw a very rapid initial bounce-back from the mere act of economic reopening. Recovery is going to be trickier as pandemic support is phased out and the impact of labour shortages and trade problems start to be seen in the figures. Talk of a ""boom"" was rather premature. Samuel Tombs of Pantheon Macroeconomics said the economic recovery had been ""stopped in its tracks"" by a surge in Covid cases in July. He added that there were signs that the economy had regained momentum in August. ""Nonetheless, surveys continue to show that a large minority of households remain fearful of contracting Covid-19, even though they have been double-vaccinated. ""This suggests that the recovery in consumer-facing sectors might run out of steam again in the autumn if, as we expect, Covid-19 cases and hospital admissions remain on their current upward trend,"" he said. Kitty Ussher, chief economist at the Institute of Directors, said it appeared that ""England's thrilling run"" in the Euro 2020 tournament had boosted growth in June, leading to ""a bit of fall-back"" in July. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures showed the recovery was ""well under way"".

UK economic growth slows sharply in July,"The UK economy grew by just 0.1% in July as the last Covid restrictions were lifted in England. It was the economy's sixth consecutive month of growth, but the increase was much lower than in the previous month, which saw 1% growth. Arts, entertainment and recreation activities helped the rise, but the ""pingdemic"" kept many workers at home. The UK economy is still 2.1% below its pre-pandemic peak, said the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said there had been a boost from outdoor events such as sports clubs, amusement parks and festivals following the easing of restrictions on social distancing on 19 July in England. However, the main contributor to growth was a 1.2% rise in production output, boosted by the reopening of an oil field production site, which was previously temporarily closed for planned maintenance. Jonathan Athow, deputy statistician of the ONS, said: ""Oil and gas provided the strongest boost, having partially bounced back after summer maintenance. Car production also continued to recover from recent component shortages."" Many firms suffered from a lack of staff during July as workers were forced to self-isolate at home after being alerted by the NHS Test and Trace app, giving rise to what was dubbed the ""pingdemic"". What's happening with the people still on furlough? What is GDP and how does it affect me? Services output was largely unchanged in July, but the construction sector contracted for a fourth consecutive month, with output down by 1.6%. Construction has been affected by a shortage of building materials as prices have soared and supply has failed to match demand. Overall, GDP grew by 3.6% in the three months to July, the ONS said. The latest figures will weigh on the minds of Bank of England policymakers, who must ponder the implications for UK monetary policy. On Wednesday, Bank governor Andrew Bailey said the UK's economic bounce-back from the pandemic was showing signs of ""levelling off"", but he maintained the view that rising inflation would not turn out to be persistent.

Biden and Xi hold first call in seven months,"This is only the second call between the leaders since President Biden took office Chinese President Xi Jinping has spoken with his US counterpart Joe Biden for the first time in seven months. A White House Statement said both leaders had ""discussed the responsibility of both nations to ensure competition does not veer into conflict"". This is only the second call between them since President Biden took office. US- China relations have been tense, with clashes over issues like trade, espionage and the pandemic. ""The two leaders had a broad, strategic discussion in which they discussed areas where our interests converge, and areas where our interests, values, and perspectives diverge,""the White House Statement added.,external ""This discussion, as President Biden made clear, was part of the United States' ongoing effort to responsibly manage the competition between the United States and the PRC."" Chinese state broadcaster CCTV said the phone call was ""candid [and] in-depth"", adding that it had covered ""extensive strategic communication and... issues of mutual concern"". ""Whether China and the US can properly handle their relations... is critical for the future and destiny of the world,"" said Mr Xi, according to the CCTV report. Mr Biden's predecessor Donald Trump had interacted more frequently with Mr Xi when he first took office. Within the first six months of his administration, Mr Trump spoke to Mr Xi twice over the phone, and also invited the Chinese President to Mar-a-Lago, Mr Trump's private club, where the two held talks in person. Angry exchanges at US and China talks in Alaska How Afghanistan rattled Asia and emboldened China A senior White House official on Friday said the call came at the request of President Biden, who had become ""exasperated"" by the unwillingness of lower level Chinese officials to hold substantive talks with his administration. Earlier this year, high-level talks between the Biden administration and China were fraught with tension - with officials on both sides exchanging sharp rebukes. Chinese officials had accused the US of inciting countries ""to attack China"", while the US said China had ""arrived intent on grandstanding"". There are quite a few major issues the two economic giants clash on - with human rights and democracy a major sticking point. The US accuses China of genocide against the Uighur population in the province of Xinjiang. It also says Beijing is trampling on democratic rights in Hong Kong with a recently introduced security law that critics say is being used to crack down on dissent. Meanwhile, China has repeatedly told the US to stop interfering in what Beijing considers its internal affairs and accuses Washington of ""smearing"" the ruling Communist Party. There's also the issue of trade. Both countries have been locked in a trade battle that began in 2018 under then President Donald Trump. The US had imposed tariffs on more than $360bn (Â£268bn) of Chinese goods, and China has retaliated with tariffs on more than $110bn of US products. Mr Biden has not pulled back on the tough trade messaging to Beijing of his predecessor - something that has angered China. Then there's the South China Sea. In recent years it has become a flashpoint between China and other nations in the region which claim sovereignty over two largely uninhabited island chains, the Paracels and the Spratlys. China claims most of the sea, but neighbouring countries which have competing claims and the US disagree. Despite the opposition, Beijing has continued to expand its military presence in the area while maintaining that its intentions are peaceful. This video can not be played Why is everyone fighting over the South China Sea? We could also be seeing tensions over Afghanistan. China has repeatedly criticised the US for its withdrawal from Afghanistan. Earlier this week, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin once again slammed the US, saying their troops had ""wreaked havoc"". He also accused the US of inflicting ""serious damage on the Afghan people"".

Boosters not needed for all - Oxford jab creator,"This video can not be played Professor Dame Sarah Gilbert: ""We need more doses so we're not talking about choices"" The vaccines are still providing strong protection, a year on from the initial two doses, says the scientist who developed the Oxford-AZ vaccine. The UK's vaccine advisory body is set to decide whether booster doses against Covid-19 are needed this autumn. Prof Dame Sarah Gilbert told the BBC that offering a third booster dose to millions of people was ""a complex decision"". And she called for more vaccines to be licensed to increase supplies. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) has already said a third top-up dose should be offered to people with severely weakened immune systems, which accounts for up to half a million people in the UK. But it has not decided if booster doses are needed to extend protection in larger numbers of people at high risk from Covid-19, including those normally eligible for a flu jab. The UK reported a further 37,622 coronavirus cases on Friday,according to the latest government figures.,external There have also been another 147 deaths of people who tested positive for the virus within the previous 28 days. Will I get a booster jab this autumn? Why vaccinating all teens is a difficult decision No jab. No entry. When will I need a Covid passport? Prof Gilbert, who began designing the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine in early 2020 when Covid first emerged in China, said there were no signs of immunity waning in ongoing trials of the vaccine, which started in April 2020. Blood tests on volunteers who had been vaccinated more than a year ago, showed they had signs of good protection. ""It's the first dose of the vaccine that has the most impact, whoever you give that vaccine too,"" she said. ""We get good protection after a single dose and then it's improved by a second dose and we would expect to see it being maintained or possibly slightly improved then by third dose. ""As we would expect, with any other vaccine, we are seeing strong maintenance of the [immune] response."" Prof Gilbert also said the world needed more doses and more vaccine supplies, so there didn't need to be a choice between vaccinating one country over another. ""More doses are becoming available and we need to focus on getting those doses to countries that really need them,"" she said, adding that many African countries had only vaccinated 2% of their population. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said on Thursday he was awaiting ""final advice"" from the JCVI, but was ""confident"" a booster programme would start later this month. Interim advice issued by the JCVI in July suggested more than 30 million people should receive a booster dose, including all adults over 50. The UK medicines regulator (MHRA) hasapproved the use of Pfizer and AstraZeneca as Covid booster vaccines,paving the way for a rollout ahead of the winter. Prof Sir Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford Vaccine Group, agreed there is a ""fire raging all around the world with huge pressure on health systems in many, many countries"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the UK had a ""moral obligation"" to help other countries, adding: ""There is such a big risk, morally from our perspective - there's a risk to trade, there's a risk to economies, but also these are our friends and colleagues who need to be protected, and we are losing them every day that goes by."" Sir Andrew also said the UK still had high levels of protection from the virus, despite the fall in levels of people's immune response after having had the vaccine. The JCVI needs to look at the issue of who is ending up in hospital after being infected as part of its considerations, he added. How many people have been vaccinated so far? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? Who is the woman who designed the Oxford vaccine? More than 48.3 million people in the UK - 88.8% of the population aged over 16 - have had a first dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, while 43.7 million have had both doses. The UK has ordered more than 540 million doses of seven of the most promising vaccines, including the four so far approved for use - Pfizer, Oxford-AstraZeneca, Moderna and Janssen. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world, and the government has pledged to donate 100 million surplus jabs to poorer countries before the middle of 2022.

Dial down political rhetoric on protocol - EU chiefEuropean Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic calls for calm as he visits Northern Ireland.Northern IrelandComments,"Maros Sefcovic is in Northern Ireland to meet political, business and civic leaders European Commission vice president Maros Sefcovic has urged politicians to ""dial down the rhetoric"" on the Northern Ireland Protocol. He was responding to Sir Jeffrey Donaldson's warning that his partymay quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its protocol demands are not met. Mr Sefcovic is in Northern Ireland to meet political, business and civic leaders. The UK wants the protocol,which puts a trade border in the Irish Sea, changed. Unionists believe it undermines their place in the United Kingdom and want it to be scrapped. Mr Sefcovic said he had already spoken to Sir Jeffrey ""a couple of weeks ago"". ""I will see him this afternoon as I will see also the other political leaders,"" he said on Thursday. ""We will have the opportunity to discuss this face to face and my message will be 'let's work on the concrete problems'. ""Let's focus on the issues which are the most important for the people of Northern Ireland, let's be constructive, let's dial down the political rhetoric, let's bring calm and focus on what is our task to accomplish."" Mr Sefcovic, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, described Sir Jeffrey as a ""very experienced politician"" who wants the best for Northern Ireland. ""I can assure him that is my intention as well,"" Mr Sefcovic added. Mr Sefcovic (centre) met First Minister Paul Givan (left) and Declan Kearney, junior minister at the Executive Office during a visit to Stormont Mr Sefcovic said the purpose of his trip to Northern Ireland was to find out ""face-to-face"" what the problems were with the implementation of the protocol.

""I came here to listen, to learn what are the concrete problems that the people of Northern Ireland are facing with the implementation of the protocol. ""But I am also here to talk about opportunities the protocol is bringing, especially to the economy and of course the people of Northern Ireland, and I am starting with the business representatives."" On Monday,the UK delayed new checks on goods from Great Britain entering Northern Irelandas required by the protocol. Lord Frost, the Brexit minister, said the move was necessary to ""provide space for further potential discussions"" with the EU. Mr Sefcovic said the EU had taken note of the decision. ""We are talking over the last few weeks constructively on solving the issues linked with the protocol and I hope that also the way that we handled Monday's announcement coming from London just proves that we are ready to do our utmost to look for every possible solution within the protocol to resolve the problems."" However the EU has repeatedly said the sort of fundamental renegotiation Lord Frost wants is not on offer. Further delays confirmed for Irish Sea border checks What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol? Technical discussions between the UK and EU on an agri-food agreement have reached a stalemate. The EU has offered the UK a Swiss-style deal which would involve the UK following EU rules. The UK has rejected that and instead asked for a deal in which the EU would recognise UK standards as equivalent to its own. An EU official has suggested that the issue could be unlocked with a bespoke arrangement which recognises Northern Ireland's unique circumstances. It is not yet clear what such an arrangement might involve and the EU is wary that the UK would demand the same deal for GB-EU agri-food trade. What next for the Northern Ireland Protocol?

UK and around the world: David ShukmanScience editor, BBC News Bangladesh, on the UN's list of Least Developed Countries, is battling river erosion due to climate change The world's poorest countries say they are worried about getting to the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow in November. Twenty are on the UK's Covid red list - meaning hotel quarantine for arrivals. They say the fortnight-long talks may involve delegates being away for seven weeks as they will also have to isolate on return. And they warn that flights from Pacific islands have virtually stopped and that some transit hubs are refusing non-residents. The warning comes from the group made up of the world's 46 poorest countries which are on the United Nations' list ofLeast Developed Countries (LDC),external. The 20 countries that are also on theUK's foreign travel red list,externalinclude Afghanistan, Ethiopia and Nepal. Read more More than 400 University of Hertfordshire students have signed a petition demanding face-to-face tutoring, after some found they were only being offered online sessions again this year. They claim the institution is putting the cost benefits of virtual lessons ahead of students' preferences. The university says the timetables have not been finalised, and ""all students will receive in-person, on-campus teaching sessions this year"". According to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service, one student, whose timetable indicated only online lessons, said: ""With us being allowed back in clubs and venues like Leeds Festival, how can they [decide] online lessons are still ok?""

Under Fifa rules, players not released for the recent South American World Cup qualifiers can be banned for five days. The Premier League, the relevant national associations and Fifa are continuing to try to resolve the issue. However, BBC Sport has been told clubs are seriously considering ignoring Fifa and fielding the players in question. All of the South American qualifiers took place in countries on the government's red travel list. Anyone entering - or returning - to the UK from those countries has to quarantine for 10 days. As a result, several players did not report for international duty, resulting in the affected South American national associations asking Fifa to implement bans. Read more A ""super"" courtroom has opened in England to tackle backlogs caused by the coronavirus pandemic and make it easier to deal with organised crime gangs. Walls were knocked down at Manchester Crown Court to make it three times the size of a usual courtroom, so it can hold trials with up to 12 defendants. Trials of this size - which usually involve gang-related crime such as county lines, drug trafficking, murders and money laundering - have built up during the pandemic due to social distancing, according to the Ministry of Justice. Courts Minister Lord Wolfson QC says the Â£2.5m revamp ""will get gang-related suspects in front of judges quicker"" and ""speed up justice for victims"".

of a coronavirus vaccine, the government figures show. In total, 89.0% of the population aged 16 and over has now had at least one jab. And a further 96,702 have had a second
vaccine dose now. As of today, 80.6% of the population aged 16 and over has now had both jabs. There
have been a further 37,622 cases of coronavirus reported in the UK,

This video can not be played Newcastle United goalkeeper Karl Darlow talks about his experience with Covid-19 Newcastle United's Karl Darlow has urged footballers to get the Covid vaccine after he recovered from a serious bout of the virus. The goalkeeper, 30, spent three days on a hospital drip and was ""severely worried"" after catching coronavirus before he was due to have his first jab in July. Having only just returned to full fitness after ""awful fatigue"" and losing five kilos, Darlow told the BBC his ordeal had convinced ""a couple"" of his teammates to get immunised. But speaking onThe Sports Desk podcast,Darlow added that four or five other Newcastle players remain unvaccinated ""for hopefully genuine reasons"". There is growing concern about the numbers of players refusing get the jab, with almost a third in the English Football League still not vaccinated. Read more As students return to campus for the new term, they'll find many Covid restrictions have been lifted. There should be more face-to-face teaching but things won't be entirely back to normal. The Russell Group of leading universities says some online learning will continue - partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes. Students are also also likely to be asked to wear a face covering in crowded areas such as libraries, and will be encouraged to take regular Covid tests, even if they don't have any symptoms. Staff will be asked to test twice a week. You can read more about how the pandemic might affect universities here. The UK competition regulator is calling for a more ""interventionist"" approach from the government to tackle the ""lottery"" of buying a PCR test for travel. The
Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) says there is a risk of a ""race to the bottom"" and travellers could end up losing out. It says complaints from customers includes over-priced tests and poor service, with test kits and results arriving late or not at all. When things do go wrong customers are unable to contact some providers, let alone get a refund, the CMA says. The regulator is making a number of recommendations to the government, including creating ""a one-stop list of quality, approved test providers"" by significantly improving the basic standards to qualify to be listed on the gov.uk website. It is also calling for a ""comprehensive monitoring and enforcement programme"" to ensure providers on the list meet basic standards, as well as monitoring of prices, in case price reductions are not seen as a result of other measures. Tests cost about Â£75 per person on average in the UK, but there are reports of some being offered for as little as Â£20, and others for more than Â£500. Read more More people are considering giving up their dogs for adoption since coronavirus restrictions were lifted, according to the Dogs Trust. The dog welfare charity says it has seen a 35% increase in calls related to giving up the pets in the last few weeks. It says that people are reconsidering owning a dog as their circumstances change post-lockdown. The sales of pets in the UK had soared since the start of the pandemic, when more people spent time at home. The price of puppies more than doubled during lockdown, with dogs costing almost Â£1,900 on average. Owen Sharp, chief executive of the Dogs Trust, said: ""Following the boom in pet ownership during the pandemic which saw millions of us delighting in the companionship of a dog, today's figures have sadly come as no surprise to us.""

Wales already has anNHS Covid Pass,externalto show your vaccination status In England, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi says people will need to prove their Covid status to get into nightclubs and some other venues from the end of September. The plans were first announced in July and have been opposed by some Tory MPs and the Liberal Democrats. Nightclubs have described them as ""chaotic and surreal"". In England, as long as you are registered with a GP, you can prove your Covid status using theNHS Covid Pass,external, via the NHS App. Northern Ireland has not yet proposed Covid passport rules for venues and events, but residents canapply for a Covid status certificate online,external.

The three-day event will see performances from artists including Liam Gallagher, Snow Patrol, Amy Macdonald and The Chemical Brothers. Vaccine passports are not being introduced in Scotland until1 Octoberbut ticket holders will be refused entry without proof of a negative lateral flow test. The organisers says precautions are in place to prevent Covid spreading. In addition to needing a negative lateral flow test to enter - which must have been taken no more than 48 hours before arrival - those fans attending on multiple daysmust take a second test 48 hours after the first one. Faisal IslamBBC Economics Editor July's figures, showing thebounce-back in the UK's economy stalling, make clear the recovery cannot be taken for granted. The cause, primarily, was the upsurge in cases across the UK, tempering the impact of the full reopening of the economy. But the impact of the supply chain crisis is also in these figures. While August should have been better, these figures are consistent with the now slow decline in furlough numbers. Monthly data is always volatile, but the pattern seems to be that the UK saw a very rapid initial bounce-back from the mere act of economic reopening. Recovery is going to be trickier as pandemic support is phased out and the impact of labour shortages and trade problems start to be seen in the figures. Talk of a ""boom"" was rather premature. Derby-based firm Colleague Box has seen its fortunes intimately linked to the health of the economy during the pandemic. The company allows both companies and individuals to send out gift boxes to friends, colleagues and relatives to show them they are still appreciated while many continue working remotely. ""The idea is that we stay connected even though we're apart,"" managing director Natalie Bamford tells the BBC. ""It's a way of putting smiles on people's faces."" However, theUK's economic slowdownhas not gone unnoticed at the firm. ""We did notice for the first time a slump in sales over August,"" Natalie says. ""We're assuming it was due to the summer holidays, but it makes you concerned as a small business owner."" Read more Here's a bit more detail on the news we brought you earlier that the Covid infection rate in Scotland has again risen to its highest level since estimates began. About 117,300 people - one in 45 - are thought to have had the virus last week, according to the latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) infection survey. It is the highest rate of any of the UK nations - and the most ever recorded. For the same week (ending 3 September), England's rate is estimated to be one in 70, Wales one in 65 and Northern Ireland one in 60, says the ONS. The figure for Scotland was a large increase on the previous week when it was one in 75. Sarah Crofts, head of analytical outputs for the Covid-19 infection survey, says: ""Scotland now has the highest rates across the UK countries where infections have continued to increase sharply, reaching a new highest recorded level."" Read morehere. Ministers will decide next week if vaccine passports should be used to gain entry to some events in Wales, the first minister says. Mark Drakeford says there are a number of practical and ethical issues but with infection rates rising it would be irresponsible not to consider the measure. He says Covid hospital admissions in Wales could more than double to 100 a day, based on modelling work carried out by Swansea University. People will needproof of full vaccinationfor some eventsin Scotland from 1 Octoberandin Englandfrom the end of this month.

First launched in 2016, the app was acquired by Fortnite-maker Epic Games in 2019 as part of a multi-million dollar deal. In November 2020 it was integrated with Fortnite to let players see one another during multiplayer gaming sessions. But the developers say their work on other Epic Games products mean they cannot give Houseparty ""the attention that it deserves"". In a statement, the team says,externalit will instead develop ""new ways to have meaningful and authentic social interactions"" in other Epic Games software. While the app will continue to work until October, it has already been removed from the Google Play store and Apple's App Store. Read morehere. There could beas many as 100 new Covid hospital admissions a day in Walesas the Delta wave peaks at the end of this month, First Minister Mark Drakeford warns. Describing the situation as ""serious"", he says the figure is based on modelling work carried out by Swansea University. At the moment there are about 40 daily Covid-19 hospital admissions a day, Drakeford says, adding that patients will include many who need to be in hospital for a long time and need intensive care. Public Health Wales has reported 2,467 more coronavirus cases today and five more Covid-related deaths. The nation's public health agency says 522.7 per 100,000 population have tested positive for the virus in the past seven days - the highest case rate since the second wave in December. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Amazon offers to pay college fees for 750,000 staff","Amazon has offered to cover the cost of college tuition of all 750,000 of its frontline workers in the US. It comes as the online shopping giant struggles to attract and retain staff amid an industry wide labour shortage. The firm said it would invest $1.2bn in the scheme, with workers able to access the annual funding for as long as they remain at Amazon. It is the latest big firm to offer to fund workers' education after similar moves by Walmart and Target. In a blog post,external, Amazon said its college tuition offer would apply at ""hundreds of education partners across the country"" without stating which ones. The shopping giant said it would also cover other types of education including high school diplomas and English language courses, as well as extending on-the-job career training to 300,000. ""Amazon is now the largest job creator in the US, and we know that investing in free skills training for our teams can have a huge impact for hundreds of thousands of families across the country,"" said Dave Clark, head of worldwide consumer at Amazon. McDonaldâs in US hiring 14-year-olds amid shortage US job vacancies hit a record 10.1 million US firms are offering a range of benefits and incentives to lure employees back to the workforce as restrictions ease. According to the US Labor Department, job openings hit a fresh record high of 10.9 million in July, surpassing the number of unemployed people by more than two million. Experts say a mixture of people leaving the workforce during the pandemic, lingering concerns about Covid and a lack of childcare have prolonged the shortage. Last month Walmart said it would pay the costs of tuition and books for its hourly staffers, with about 1.5 million people eligible. And Target said it would offer free undergraduate degrees to more than 340,000 employees at its US stores. Firms have also raised starting wages or offered bonuses to win workers, with some even urging 14 and 15 year-olds to apply to tackle the shortage.

Doctors are 'exhausted' says BMA chief,"Dr Lewis Morrison said doctors were washed out physically and mentally Scotland's doctors are ""exhausted"" and many are cutting working hours or leaving the health service altogether, according to a senior doctors' leader. BMA Scotland chairman Dr Lewis Morrison told BBC Scotland that doctors were ""washed out physically and mentally"" after 18 months of the Covid pandemic. He said action was needed to stop doctors leaving the profession and to boost recruitment of new medics. The Scottish government said it was working to manage the pressures. Speaking ahead of the BMA's annual representative meeting, Dr Morrison said the ""workforce crisis"" had its roots in the number of senior doctor vacancies before the pandemic. Hospitals under more pressure than ever, say medics Doctors and dentists awarded 3% pay rise Can in-person GP appointments ever fully return? But he said that the NHS ""being run at 110% capacity"" during Covid had deepened the crisis. The pressures across the NHS had been ""immense"" in the past few weeks, he said. Dr Morrison said doctors traditionally had low levels of sickness but it was starting to rise. ""I think the cumulative effect of the pandemic is now starting to show,"" he said. ""The main other thing is to look after people, to give people the space to have rest and recuperation as best they can, to not pressurise people to do more and more. ""The message needs to go to the public to still be patient with the NHS because it cannot meet the needs of everybody right now."" The BMA says the pandemic has deepened a ""workforce crisis"" that existed before the current pressures Dr Morrison said that in the medium term, over the next few months, efforts must be made to stop staff leaving the NHS. ""There are lots of factors at play that could lead people to make a decision to either retire, or potentially leave for other parts of the world to work, or indeed to reduce the amount of work they do to protect themselves from physical and mental burnout,"" he said. ""So anything we can do to support the existing medical workforce until we get a clear plan for recruiting and increasing the number of doctors that is going to be how we get through this."" Dr Morrison said the problem was not an issue of ""morale"". ""This is sheer out-and-out exhaustion we are looking at and that's more worrying,"" he said. The Scottish government said the health secretary met BMA representatives earlier this week to hear about the challenges facing doctors. A spokesperson said: ""We are also working proactively with health boards to manage pressures and take rapid action to support increased capacity, including expedited recruitment, flexible deployment of existing staffing and supporting mutual aid across the system. ""Our NHS Recovery Plan commits more than Â£1bn of targeted investment in Scotland's health service and sets out key actions for the next five years, putting staff at the very heart of our recovery with an increased budget of Â£8m to provide ongoing support for their mental health and wellbeing. ""This includes targeted support to the primary care and social care workforce of Â£2m. We have record staffing levels and the best paid staff in UK, recently giving doctors a 3% pay rise."" Supporting the physical and psychological wellbeing of NHS staff was a ""fundamental priority"", the spokesperson added.

First refugees arrive in Wales after Taliban coup,"This video can not be played Wales' Afghan community have been collecting clothes, shoes, toys and nappies for children The first Afghan refugees, who were airlifted from Kabul following the Taliban seizure of power last month, have arrived in Wales. The Welsh government said 50 families are being resettled across the country. Most of those who have arrived directly supported Welsh-based armed forces in the country over the past 20 years. TheUrdd youth organisation,externalis helping to provide accommodation, with 230 Afghans being resettled in Wales in total. Afghan journalists tell of beatings by Taliban First foreigners fly out of Kabul since US pull-out Inspirational Afghan robotics team begin new chapter This is after the UK government pledged to rehome 20,000 Afghans over the next five years after the Taliban seized back control of the country. Wali Mohammad says many refugees have the skills to contribute to society if given a chance Wali Mohammad knows all too well the journey recent refugees have faced after he fled from Afghanistan in 2015. ""It's one of the hardest journeys one can go through,"" he said. ""You leave everything behind and you have to start everything from scratch. But Afghans are hard working. I'm sure these people that have arrived here will soon start living and contribute to Wales' economy. ""They already have skills, it's just opportunity that needs to be provided for them."" Mr Mohammad worked in a high-level government role before seeking asylum, but volunteered for Public Health Wales when he arrived in the UK. He urged organisations to offer simple jobs so arrivals have the opportunity to ""start somewhere"". Mr Ahmed Shirzai also escaped the Taliban when they were in power about 20 years ago Nazir Ahmad Shirzai and his family fled the Taliban in 2001, leaving his life as a vet to seek asylum in the UK. Mr Shirzai, who now owns his own furniture business in Cardiff, knows exactly what the new arrivals will be going through and said he wanted refugees to know ""we can help and support them"". ""If they have problems, we can contact the MP or the passport office,"" he said. ""Or if there are social things they need, for example halal shops, a GP, school, language help - we can discuss with members and other channels to sort it out."" Wales' Social Justice Minister Jane Hutt said: ""Today we welcome the families and individuals that have served our country in Afghanistan. ""We have made clear our pledge of Wales being a nation of sanctuary and we're committed to do all that is possible to ensure Afghan interpreters, refugees and their families are welcomed."" She added: ""All local authorities in Wales are participating in these schemes and have offered their support and assistance to the Afghan citizens who are being resettled in the UK.""

Colonel Sion Walker from the 160th (Welsh) Brigade said: ""There are direct historical links with Wales-based and Wales-facing units and members of many of those families coming to Wales. ""They will have worked alongside each other during very difficult times in Afghanistan; our involvement is recognition of the support given and comradeships developed during those times and we are proud to have played a part in making Wales a nation of sanctuary."" A spokesperson for the UK government said it was ""working urgently to ensure thousands of Afghans who were evacuated to the UK receive the support they need to rebuild their lives, find work, pursue education and integrate into their local communities"". ""Every day we work closely with local authorities and charities in Wales and the rest of the UK to ensure suitable accommodation and support is in place for those seeking asylum or resettlement.""

Private Covid travel tests allowed in some cases,"Dafydd Sion, from Cardiff, has flights booked to Mallorca next week Travellers can use private Covid tests if they cannot access approved ones in time, Welsh ministers have said. It follows concerns from a traveller who made repeated attempts to buy the required test online and spent hours on the phone with booking agent CTM. Dafydd Sion is set to fly to Spain next week but is worried he will not get the NHS approved test in time. The Welsh government said he would be spared a Â£1,000 fine for using the wrong PCR test in such circumstances. A spokesperson said travellers would not be penalised for using alternative test providers due to an ""inability to book a test because of system issues, combined with the urgency of imminent travel"". CTM said it does not comment on individual cases but was ""successfully processing thousands of bookings"" every day. What are the holiday rules for travel? How do I get my free Covid tests? Watchdog will look at Covid test cost immediately Wales is the only UK nation still requiring those who have been abroad to use NHS PCR tests on day two of their return - and day eight if unvaccinated - at a cost of Â£68 each, although the Welsh government has said it is reviewing that policy. BBC Wales has also been contacted by another traveller who says his day eight PCR test result, ordered through CTM, was never returned. Mr Sion, from Cardiff, has flights booked to travel to Mallorca next week and said he has tried five times to purchase his legally-required PCR tests through CTM, but failed. ""I have been trying to purchase this for the last three days but each time I get confirmation it's shortly followed by a cancellation,"" he said. ""I've spoken to the customer service team for over three hours in the last three days and got nowhere."" Approved NHS PCR Covid tests cost Â£68 each On one 20 minute call with CTM's customer service he said he was asked to ""email their customer services team with my personal details, passport details and bank details so they could put the order through for me, which I refused to do due to data protection"". He added: ""I think it's awful that the Welsh government only accept the tests from a company that are unable to assist you. ""I am due to fly to Spain next week, however, I also understand that I could be fined Â£1,000 for not having my correct day two test details."" Tom Bloomfield said he still hasn't had his day eight test result back, after a trip in July Another traveller, Tom Bloomfield, said his day eight PCR test results, on returning from Portugal, were never returned. The retired NHS consultant from Carmarthen said he arrived back from Portugal in July and had booked the PCR tests through the link on the Welsh government's website. He said: ""Our day two results were not returned until day eight. Our day eight results have still not appeared. ""CTM do not reply at all, even allowing for 10 working days as on their website. ""I had a refund from my credit-card provider after complaining to them."" The booking agent said it does not comment on individual cases but was ""successfully processing thousands of bookings for Managed Hotel Quarantine and Covid-19 test kits every day"". The spokesperson added: ""A small percentage of bookings are declined for a variety of reasons, including but not limited to incorrect details being submitted at the time of booking, or insufficient funds, leading to payment declines. ""Covid tests kits purchased through CTM's online system need to be registered with NHS Track and Trace. ""CTM does not process, store or share Covid-19 test results. Travellers should contact 119 for assistance with accessing their results."" A Welsh government spokesperson said: ""The contract is managed by the UK government Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) on behalf of all four nations. We have raised the concerns with DHSC."" Asked whether Mr Sion would face the stated fine of Â£1,000 for being unable to use the correct PCR test on his return, a Welsh government spokesperson said: ""There is a provision in our regulations which provides that any person who has a reasonable excuse for contravening the requirement to book an NHS test does not commit an offence. ""In this case, an inability to book a test because of system issues, combined with the urgency of imminent travel, would fall within the reasonable excuse provision."" The travel industry has complained the costs of tests are putting people off travelling Last week, a Welsh government spokesperson told BBC Wales that it was""reviewing"" the positionon insisting that travellers from Wales are only allowed to use approved NHS PCR Covid tests on their return fromgreen or amber list countries. In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland travellers are allowed to shop around with private providers to purchase their required day two test - and day eight test if unvaccinated - on arriving home from abroad. The UK government is currently considering areview to the travel rules for England- with travel industry bosses calling for the removal of Covid testing as a necessity of travel back to the UK, which they say puts customers off booking due to cost.

Twitter to label 'good' bot accounts,"Twitter has announced a new feature allowing accounts to self-identify as bots, by adding a label to their profile. Twitter said the update was based on research that found that people wanted more context about non-human accounts. The company gives several examples of ""good bots"" including accounts that share vaccination updates, information about seismic activity or material from public museums. The move will not be mandatory. The company will continue to remove inauthentic accounts it deems to break the company's platform rules. Example of Twitter's new label Bots are often associated with misinformation on social media platforms - and have caused a major headache for the company. A study byCarnegie Mellon University,externallast year found that nearly half of the Twitter accounts spreading messages on the social media platform about the coronavirus pandemic were likely automated accounts. Twitter has removed tens of millions of suspected bot accounts in recent years. Yet some automated accounts are seen by Twitter as having a positive impact on the platform.

Scotland to launch vaccine passports on 1 October,"People in Scotland will need proof they have been fully vaccinated before they can enter nightclubs and many large events from 1 October. The vaccine passport plan was formally approved by Holyrood after the SNP and Greens voted in favour. Some businesses have complained of a lack of detail about how the scheme will work in practice. The proposals were opposed by the Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats. Deputy First Minister John Swinney said the system would reduce the risk of transmission and help prevent venues - many of which have only recently reopened - from having to close again due to Covid. Apaper,externalpublished by the government on Thursday morning, just hours before the vote in the Scottish Parliament, said officials were still working to define what a nightclub actually is. And it said evidence was still being gathered about the effectiveness of similar schemes elsewhere in the world. I need to prove I'm fully vaccinated - how do I do it? What do we know about Scotland's vaccine passport? People in England will need to have a ""Covid pass"" to access ""higher risk"" settings such as nightclubsfrom the end of this month. There are no current plans to introduce a similar scheme in Wales or Northern Ireland. The new rules will mean people over the age of 18 in Scotland will need to show they have had both doses of the vaccine before they are allowed entry to: Nightclubs and adult entertainment venues Unseated indoor live events, with more than 500 people in the audience Unseated outdoor live events, with more than 4,000 people in the audience Any event, of any nature, which has more than 10,000 people in attendance It means that many major sporting events - particularly football matches - will be affected, as will concerts and music festivals. People who have had two vaccines in Scotland can already download or get a paper copy of a certificate with a QR code. By the end of the month, it is expected that this code will also be available on a new NHS Scotland Status app. These codes can be scanned at a venue to confirm the user is fully vaccinated. Anyone who has good reasons for not getting fully vaccinated - including children and people with particular medical conditions - will be exempt. People will need to show a QR code before they are allowed into some venues A major goal of the scheme is to encourage more younger people to be vaccinated - with the latest figures showing that uptake among those under the age of 40 in Scotland has been lower than older age groups. Many areas of Scotland have seen some of the highest Covid rates in Europe in recent weeks - although there are signs thatthe surge in cases is beginning to slow down. The number of people in hospital and intensive care units has also been steadily rising, with health professionals warning that that NHS is coming under increasing strain. Mr Swinney said Scotland was in a ""fragile position"" with Covid-19 case rates still high, telling MSPs that ""we all recognise the need to try all we can to protect the return to greater normality that we have experienced in recent weeks"". He said the scheme would reduce the risk of transmission in some settings, allowing those venues to ""operate more safely when the potential alternative would be closure"". Mr Swinney said it would also protect vulnerable people who cannot be vaccinated, and would encourage others to come forward for a jab. He said: ""On balance - given the benefits to individuals, to the health of the population, and as a way to keep certain venues and events open - a certification scheme is a proportionate step to take."" Mr Swinney had been critical of vaccine passports when the proposals for England were unveiled by the prime minister, as had Health Secretary Humza Yousaf and the SNP's partners in government, the Scottish Greens. Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie said the facts on the ground had changed - and that the scheme was ""worth considering when cases are running at around 7,000 a day and once the entire adult population has had two doses"". Hospitality groups have called for more details about how the system will work, while a football supporters association said it was ""concerned about inequalities"" shutting some fans out of games. Leon Thompson of the trade body UK Hospitality Scotland told BBC Scotland there had been ""very rushed and hurried conversations with officials"" in recent days, with members ""very concerned"" about the practicalities of the plans. Dr Liz Cameron, chief executive of Scottish Chambers of Commerce, said it would ""directly impact on consumer confidence and risks creating further financial damage to those sectors who have already been hardest hit by Covid-19"". CBI Scotland director Tracy Black said vaccine passports had the potential to be ""a useful tool in managing risk in large venues"" - but that there needed to be ""close cooperation and coordination"" with businesses. The Scottish Tories voted against the proposals despite the Conservative UK government planning to introduce a similar system. Leader Douglas Ross said not enough detail had been provided about the Scottish scheme, and that the government should not be asking MSPs to ""impose"" a vaccine certification scheme on establishments it was not able to define. He said: ""A responsible government should bring forward proposals that are able to be enacted. ""We are in a really difficult position as politicians seeking to make a decision on an extremely difficult subject if the government cannot even give us simple information."" Scottish Labour also opposed the plans, with deputy leader Jackie Baillie saying there was a ""practical question about the government's ability to even implement this"". She said people with a vaccination certificate could still have the virus and be infectious, saying ministers were in danger of giving people a false sense of confidence that they were ""invincible"". Ms Baillie said the government should ""not simply reach for anything just to be seen to take action, and end up making things worse"". And Alex Cole-Hamilton said his Scottish Liberal Democrats were ""fundamentally opposed to the plans, which he said set the country on a ""disturbing and illiberal course"". He added: ""Medical ID cards will be introduced by this coalition tonight and liberals will immediately begin the campaign to see their abolition.""

Why is the US falling behind with its vaccinations?,"President Joe Biden is urging Americans to get jabbed as Covid infections rise across the country. But in some states fewer than half of residents have received their first dose. We've looked into where vaccinations are lagging, and why this might be. Supply isn't generally a problem in the US, and anyone over the age of 12 is eligible to receive an authorised vaccine. But after being one of the world leaders in vaccine uptake until the middle of April, the US vaccination rate has slowed down. The US now lags behind neighbouring Canadain terms of doses administered as share of total population, as well as the UK, Italy and Germany. It's still ahead of some major economies such as Japan, but the vaccination rate in the US is dropping off more significantly than in other developed countries. On 2 August, the US reached the goal of giving one dose to 70% of all adults - a target originally set by President Biden for 4 July. Daily infections have increased by more than six-fold in the US in the past month - and according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the vast majority of new cases and deaths are among the unvaccinated. States in the south of the US tend to have the lowest vaccine uptake. Mississippi has the lowest - with less than 40% of residents having received at least one dose. North-eastern states tend to have among the highest vaccine uptake - with about 75% of people in Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut receiving at least one dose. Prof Peter Hotez, a vaccine expert at the Baylor College of Medicine, says: ""It's practically halted in the southern states - despite the widespread availability of the vaccine, we have a sharp divide."" ""In the southern states, and in the mountain west states, most of older adults are vaccinated but a lot of the younger ones are not - and that's where the big gap lies."" Health workers in Mississippi are working to increase the number of people vaccinated Data shows that in states such as Mississippi, Alabama and Louisiana, around 80% of people over 65 are vaccinated, but only around 40% of under-65s are. In contrast, in Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut almost everyone over 65 has received at least one dose, as have almost 80% of those under 65. In the middle of April, the US was administering more than three million doses a day, but it is now down to about 650,000 a day - although this is a slight increase from mid-July levels. This is partly because there aren't as many people to vaccinate - the UK has also seen its vaccination rate drop off, although not as rapidly as the US. And the UK and other developed countries have typically reached a larger share of their population before their vaccination rate has dipped. Experts say there is a lack of urgency among some healthy young people in the US, who aren't in a rush to get a vaccine. Concern about vaccine safety and resistance to the idea of having vaccines are also issues. A protest against vaccinations in New York Dr Jennifer Kates, vice-president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, which monitors vaccine sentiment, says: ""Some people raise safety concerns, and say they may be more likely to get vaccinated when a vaccine is fully approved vs just authorised."" The vaccines used in the US are not yet formally approved, but have received emergency authorisation due to the urgency of the pandemic. Dr Kates adds: ""A persistent share of about 20% are hold-outs, who say they won't get vaccinated at all, or only will if required by their employer."" The Biden administration has blamed online misinformationin large part for the resistance to vaccines. The White House surgeon general has said: ""It's one of several reasons why people are not getting vaccinated, but it's a very important one, because of what we know from polls."" We've reported on many examples of misinformation spreading online throughout the pandemic -such as the baseless theory that the vaccine is being used to microchip and track people. A recent poll suggests some of these unfounded claims have taken hold - withone in five Americans believing the microchip theory.,external Polling also suggests resistance to vaccinations is divided down political lines - with almost 30% of Republicans saying they will not get vaccinated, compared with just 4% of Democrats. Biden tells states to offer $100 vaccine incentive as cases rise Twitter suspends Marjorie Taylor Greene over 'misleading' Covid posts Biden rows back on Facebook 'killing people' comment This would partly explain why vaccine uptake is lower in southern states, which are typically home to more Republican voters. Prof Hotez says: ""The biggest reason from my perspective is defiance along a political divide. ""The messaging coming from conservative news outlets and conservative members of Congress is if you're a young person you don't need it because the death rates are low and vaccines are being used as an instrument of control by the liberals."" This video can not be played How to tell a Covid-19 vaccine sceptic the facts But there are also access issues for some people. Dr Kates says: ""Despite supply not being an issue, there are still people who face barriers to getting vaccinated - not sure they can get time off work, lack of transportation, and the worry that they might have to pay."" Federal rules say Americans shouldn't have to pay anything for vaccines, regardless of their immigration or health insurance status.
