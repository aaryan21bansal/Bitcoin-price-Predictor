LiveMPs debate Brexit deal27 minutes ago27 minutes ago 'This deal divides people...we've got to get back to a more rational politics''This deal divides people...we've got to get back to a more rational politics'51 minutes ago 'Only a minority of UK now want to leave the EU - SNP'Only a minority of UK now want to leave the EU - SNP52 minutes ago Listen: MPs resume Brexit deal debateListen: MPs resume Brexit deal debate,"MPs continue debate on the governmentâs Brexit deal They will vote on whether to approve the deal next Tuesday MPs usually debate private members' bills on a Friday Richard Morris, Sophie Morris and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says the PM should strike 29 March as Brexit day from UK law if her deal is voted down. House of CommonsParliament With the completion of the debate on Brexit, the Commons adjourns until next week. On Monday, the Brexit debate continues after questions and any urgent questions or statements. Then, on Tuesday, it's the final day of debate followed by the big vote on whether or not Parliament approves the agreement reached between the UK and EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says that the government ""has made it clear"" that EU citizens rights will be protected whether or not the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He says he thinks that he agrees with Julia Lopez, who said that people will no longer trust politicians if Brexit is not delivered. He urges Labour MPs to ""stop playing games"" and reminds them that leave-voting Labour members will ""never forgive them"" if they try to stop Brexit. He adds that there will be no limit on the number of international students who can study in the UK. He concludes by saying that ""we are now in the final stages"" of leaving an organisation which ""has been central to our national life for 46 years"". ""Let us rise to the moment,"" he finishes. With that, the Commons moves on to the adjournment debate. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says that maybe it's the flu she's suffering, but the debate seems to have a remarkable air of ""deja vu"" about it. She says that the prime minister is ""running around Europe obtaining invisible concessions on Brexit"" and she says there is ""nothing new"" to this document that has changed since 5 December. ""This deal jeopardises all the co-operation we've come to rely with the EU,"" she states. She says that the deal ""cedes control to Europe"" on many areas of UK law. ""Nothing has been achieved from five weeks of delay,"" she adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Mike Gapes says it was the Labour government of Tony Blair which made ""such an impact"" on the development of the European Union. In 1975 he says he was putting out anti-Common Market leaflets the day before a Cambridge final exam, ""the Labour Party is in a bizarre position...we are going for a sensible Brexit,"" but he adds, ""there is no such thing as a jobs first Brexit, it is entirely about mitigating the damage"". He says he doesn't believe that any government would be able to negotiate anything different to what has been proposed. He'll be voting to stay in the European Union if the Commons gets the chance, he adds. 'Rebelling with a heavy heart' Conservative Michael Tomlinson says his constituents have been saying for ""a number of months"" that they just want ""to get on with it"". He adds that the proposal ""does not get on with it"". He says that it is not ""taking back control"". He states that while the UK will not be subject to the CJEU, it will still have ""leverage"" in the UK, and he describes the court as ""highly political"". ""The proposal threatens the integrity"" of the UK, he continues. ""I have never rebelled against the government...and I do so with a heavy heart, but with a clear head,"" he adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Julia Lopez says that the political class ""could soon find itself despised"" if it does not do what has been requested in the referendum. The agreement will lead to another ""two years"" of ""discord and indecision"" from warring factions. The UK will ""have given up all our negotiating leverage"", she adds. Labour's Martin Whitfield says ""the big problem is"" that there is no plan for where the country is going. ""Once upon a time were told we'd hold all the cards, and it would be easy,"" he states. He says that ""there is no disrespect in re-evaluating"" a decision when the facts become known. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Another Conservative MP Peter Heaton-Jones says he will also be supporting the prime minister's deal, saying it best represents the desire of the people he represents. He says he and his constituents want to ""get on with it"". Labour's Thangam Debbonaire says she wants an immigration system that Remain and Leave voters can trust. She says she does not believe anyone will be satisfied with the government's proposed immigration system. ""I want to talk about immigration,"" she says. ""I want to see an improved response to refugees...but I don't think I've come across anyone who thinks our current system is working well."" EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Mike Penning says he will not ""Vote for anything that doesn't protect the union"". He calls on the PM to return to the EU to ""sort the backstop out"". Next is Labour MP Ian Murray, who says there are 77 days to go and ""the stakes could not be higher"". He calls on the government to rule out a no-deal scenario. He says the prime minister has united Leavers and Remainers against the deal, by sticking to the red lines she set down. He calls for a 'People's Vote' on the deal. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative Kemi Badenoch says she will be supporting the prime minister's deal. She says the guarantees it gives on citizens' rights are important, and asks how MPs could vote against the deal, opening the possibility of no-deal and therefore the loss of citizens' rights. Labour MP Stephen Pound says he was ""seduced"" by Margaret Thatcher and voted to join the European Union. He says the EU set global standards for decency, human rights, freedom and environmental legislation. If we leave the EU on 29 March this year, we must make sure our European brothers and sisters know that we will work with them. ""We will not stop being Europeans,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative James Duddridge says in voting against the deal he feels he is representing his constituents. Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick says the issue has become toxic, as shown by what has been happening outside and inside Parliament this week. Conservative MP Anna Soubry wassubjected to abusefrom protesters as she did broadcast interviews this week, and other MPs have been on the receiving end of abuse and harassment. He says he is talking himself into talking Theresa May's deal, because of the danger of a no-deal. We're covering today's debate in the Commons - unusually it's being held on a Friday - and we'll have live page coverage of Monday and Tuesday's debates too. If you want to know more about Parliament, and look at every day's order paper, you should visitParliament's website,external. And, of course, the official record of parliamentary proceedings arerecorded in Hansard,external. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to stop a no-deal Brexit by backing another referendum. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Rosindell says that his constituents voted 70% to leave, and that nothing has changed their minds. ""I truly believe that our nation is up for this,"" he says. Labour's Matt Western says he ""cannot vote for any deal that will lead to people being worse off"". He says that Parliament is ""seeing the work of an autocratic tendency"" in the prime minister, ""this is not a debate, it is neither leadership,"" he states, referring to how Mrs May says that it is either her deal or no deal. But Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to ""stop people committing national suicide"". EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says that she was elected to try to stop Brexit. She says she is regularly stopped in the street by constituents who tell her they ""want an end to this mess"". ""We have to be honest with them,"" she says. ""Brexit isn't going to solve"" any of the issues that caused people to vote for it. ""Poll after poll shows that the will of the people has changed since 2016,"" she says, adding that there was breaking of electoral law. ""People should be allowed to change their mind,"" she adds. She says that MPs must ask themselves if this new deal is better than the deal we already have from the EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir David Amess says he is ""heartily sick of the word Brexit"" and is ""less than pleased"" on how the UK has gone about trying to leave the EU. ""There are a number of reasons why I cannot support this agreement,"" one of them being ""because it threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom"", he says. Labour's Jo Stevens says she will be voting against the deal with the ""overwhelming support"" of her constituents. She says that in the past month nothing has changed, like over the past two years of negotiations. ""The referendum was drenched in illegality by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns,"" she adds. The result of the referendum does not apply ""in perpetuity"", she says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Mark Francois says that anyone who would call Remain-supporting MP Sir Nicholas Soames ""a traitor"" ""has clearly never met him"". Anyone who calls him that should ""go away and shut up"", he says. He states that he has been ""fairly consistent"" on European matters during his parliamentary career, in speaking against the EU. He says that the ""political declaration"" is ""legally completely meaningless"", and he adds that it is the ""legal equivalent of 'I promise I will respect you in the morning'"". He adds that he is ""utterly determined to vote against"" the deal. Having just been through ""considerable austerity"" it is wrong to pay Â£39bn to the EU for a deal with ""no guarantees"", he states. The UK is also not ""taking back control of our laws"" as the UK still has to ""obey EU laws"" but has lost the ability to influence them, under the deal, he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Luciana Berger says that few of the debates in the Commons have ever had ""such an impact"" on all constituents across the country. She accuses the prime minister of presenting a ""false choice"" of no deal or May's deal. ""It is beyond reproach that this [no deal] option has not been ruled out,"" she criticises the government for spending money on no deal preparations. Constituents will no longer be covered by EU Health Insurance Cards when they go abroad, she states. The NHS ""will suffer as we are are unable to properly recruit from EU countries"", she adds. A no-deal Brexit would ""isolate and hobble Britain's universities"", she says. There are 1.4m young people who are eligible to vote today who weren't before, 74% of her constituents wants a People's Vote, she states. Â© 2025 BBC.

Man City hit nine in Burton thrashingThey are almost certain to reach the Carabao Cup final after scoring nine in the semi-final first leg.BBC SportComments,"Burton Albion's 9-0 defeat is the heaviest League Cup defeat by any side since Liverpool beat Fulham 10-0 back in September 1986, and is the largest ever margin of defeat in the semi-final of the competition Irresistible Manchester City scored nine goals as they thrashed Burton Albion with an incredible display of attacking football in the first leg of their Carabao Cup semi-final at Etihad Stadium. Gabriel Jesus scored four, with Kevin de Bruyne, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Phil Foden, Kyle Walker and Riyad Mahrez also scoring against Nigel Clough's beleaguered League One side. Headers from De Bruyne and Jesus made it 2-0, the Brazilian tapped in a third and Zinchenko's curler put City four up. Jesus added two more headers, with Foden, Walker and Mahrez scoring further goals. This was the first time in more than 31 years that City had scored more than eight goals in a single match - they beat Huddersfield Town 10-1 in a second-tier league encounter in November 1987. It means City have scored 16 goals in four days after thrashing Rotherham United 7-0 in the third round of the FA Cup on Sunday. The second leg, merely a formality, takes place at the Pirelli Stadium on Wednesday, 23 January, with the final at Wembley Stadium on Sunday, 24 February. City, the Carabao Cup holders, are set to meet either Tottenham or Chelsea in the final, with Spurs leading 1-0 after Harry Kane's penalty gave them a first-leg victory at Wembley on Tuesday. Hours stuck on the M6 to witness a 9-0 loss... if they even got there - Burton fans' night to forget 'Of course we're in the final' - Guardiola on 9-0 first-leg win Relive Manchester City's win over Burton Albion as it happened Before the game, Guardiola called the tournament ""a more local competition"" and said ""everybody is happy to win but no-one is sad to go out"". However, the Spaniard still named a strong team that included De Bruyne, Silva, Mahrez, Sane and Jesus, with starts for 20-year-old goalkeeper Aro Muric and Spanish centre-half Eric Garcia, on his 18th birthday. It only took them five minutes to break through with De Bruyne's header, and Sane almost added a second but fired into the side netting. But three goals in a seven-minute spell in the first half took the tie away from Nigel Clough's side. Manchester City have won the League Cup five times in their history Jesus got his first with a header after Sane's effort had been parried by goalkeeper Brad Collins, and the Brazilian tapped in from Sane's cross to make it 3-0, with the goal given after a video assistant referee check to see if he had been onside, which he was. Zinchenko got his first City goal when he looped the ball over Collins from the edge of the penalty area, with Mahrez denied a fifth when the Burton goalkeeper tipped over his effort. City did not let up after the break as Jesus completed his hat-trick when he headed in from Silva's cross, and the sixth goal was scored by Foden, following up after Collins had denied Jesus. But the Brazilian grabbed his fourth of the game three minutes later, with a tap-in from Sane's low delivery. Walker made it 8-0 with a side-footed finish and Silva hit the outside of the post, although the ninth was not far away as Mahrez bundled in another goal. City had a chance to get a 10th but Zinchenko's header was saved on the line by Collins. City have won this competition in three of the past five years and their 2018 success was Guardiola's first trophy in English football. With City playing eight matches in a hectic January, Guardiola will now have the luxury of resting some players for the second leg. Burton - ninth in League One, 51 places below City - were playing in their first major cup semi-final, and around 3,000 of their supporters had tickets for the match at Etihad Stadium. However, numerous traffic incidents caused tailbacks on the M6 with only one of their 31 fan coaches at the ground an hour before kick-off. Some of their fans had still not taken their seats when De Bruyne's header put the hosts in front, but the away fans should have been celebrating an equaliser seven minutes later, although Marcus Harness could only shoot over when unmarked 12 yards from goal. After that miss, Burton were outclassed by a ruthless City side. Clough's side still created chances, though, and Scott Fraser had an effort saved by Muric and shot just over early in the second half as the Brewers fans were denied the goal they wanted. Burton had beaten five teams to reach this stage - including Premier League Burnley and Championship sides Aston Villa, Nottingham Forest and Middlesbrough - but were powerless to stop a rampant City outfit. Gabriel Jesus has scored 12 goals for Manchester City this season, including five in the Carabao Cup Dion Dublin, former Aston Villa striker on BBC Radio 5 live When you have got so much quality pushing quality, you are going to get better performances. Pep Guardiola knows he is going to push Liverpool all the way in the Premier League title race, and this performance shows that he has players fighting for those shirts. It doesn't matter to a centre-forward about the opposition. When the ball leaves any part of your body and goes into the back of the net, that is the feeling you work so hard for. Tonight will give Gabriel Jesus a lot of confidence. Manchester City have won 13 of their past 15 League Cup matches against sides from a lower division (drawing two), scoring 50 goals. City are the first side in the top four tiers of English football to score at least seven goals in back-to-back matches in all competitions since Leeds United did so back in October 1967 (9-0 v Spora Luxembourg in the Fairs Cup and 7-0 v Chelsea in the top flight). Manchester City have scored eight goals in a single match in any competition for the first time since November 1987, when they beat Huddersfield 10-1 in a second-tier encounter. Their 9-0 victory is Pep Guardiola's joint-largest margin of victory as a manager, alongside Barcelona's 9-0 thrashing of L'Hospitalet during a Copa del Rey match in December 2011. Since his League Cup debut for Manchester City in September 2015, Kevin de Bruyne has scored more goals in the competition than any other player (nine). Gabriel Jesus has now scored two hat-tricks at Etihad Stadium; only Carlos Tevez (four) and Sergio Aguero (10) have managed more home trebles for Manchester City since their move away from Maine Road. Gabriel Jesus (12) has reached double figures for goals scored in all competitions for the second successive season after netting 17 times in 2017-18 - only Sergio Aguero (14) has netted more than the Brazilian for Manchester City in 2018-19. Manchester City striker Gabriel Jesus on Sky Sports:""I have never scored four before in my career; I am so happy for this. We played very well and with respect, that's important. ""Players like me want to play more, to help the team, and we went out there to win."" Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola:""The result was good and of course we are already in the final but we have to play the second leg. We will take it seriously. Burton have had an incredible tournament. They have to be so proud, they did so well. ""Strikers need to score goals, Gabriel Jesus has had chances in the last few games and today he has scored. He is so important. ""It is not easy to play this type of game against a lower team. We made good runs in behind and we took it seriously. After the second and third goal it was easier, we were faster and quicker. ""I am off for a glass of wine with Nigel Clough. I know how important his father was for English football, he was a genius. Incredible. It will be a pleasure to share some minutes with him."" Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough:""We didn't expect anything less with the gulf between the two teams. We thought it could have been more. We didn't too much wrong. With two or three of the goals we could have done more but we didn't do too badly."" ""We have made history in getting this far. It wasn't about tonight, it was about the achievement of getting here. We kept going right to the end, they [the fans] were shouting 'we want 10' and we stopped them, that's a positive for us. Some of the youngsters have had an experience that you can't buy. ""It's not nice when the goals are going in and you can do nothing to stop it. Pep said 'come in for a glass of wine' and I hope he's got more than a glass. They are capable of doing that to Premier League teams."" Manchester City return to Premier League action on Monday, 14 January at home to Wolves (20:00 GMT) and then face Huddersfield away on the following Sunday, before the second leg against on 23 January. For Burton, they have a home match in League One with Gillingham on Saturday and an away game at Doncaster the following week before facing Guardiola's side again.

Savile Row tailor calls in administrators,"Grime star Tinie Tempah has worn Hardy Amies suits Men's tailor Hardy Amies has gone into administration for the second time in its 73-year history. Founded by the former dressmaker to the Queen, it was previously rescued from collapse in 2008. Administrators at Menzies said it had been trading at a loss for ""some time"". Founded by the late Sir Hardy Amies, it has one shop on London's Savile Row. Menzies is seeking buyers for its brand's UK operations and intellectual property rights. Sir Hardy, who died in 2003, founded the firm initially as a men's shop at 14 Savile Row in 1946, central London, which is still the group's base. The former wartime intelligence officer began dressing Princess Elizabeth in 1952 and was granted a royal warrant three years later. He was knighted in 1989. In the 1960s and 1970s, Hardy Amies designed outfits for a number of high-profile clients including the 1966 England World Cup team and the 1972 British Olympic squad.

Mysterious radio signals from deep space,"Artwork: A highly magnetised rotating neutron star. Astronomers say one of these could be a source of the signals Astronomers have revealed details of mysterious signals emanating from a distant galaxy, picked up by a telescope in Canada. The precise nature and origin of the blasts of radio waves is unknown. Among the 13 fast radio bursts, known as FRBs, was a very unusual repeating signal, coming from the same source about 1.5 billion light years away. Such an event has only been reported once before, by a different telescope. ""Knowing that there is another suggests that there could be more out there,"" said Ingrid Stairs, an astrophysicist from the University of British Columbia (UBC). ""And with more repeaters and more sources available for study, we may be able to understand these cosmic puzzles - where they're from and what causes them."" The CHIME observatory, located in British Columbia's Okanagan Valley, consists of four 100-metre-long, semi-cylindrical antennas, which scan the entire northern sky each day. The telescope only got up and running last year, detecting 13 of the radio bursts almost immediately, including the repeater. Canada's new radio telescope, CHIME The research has now been published in the journalNature,external. ""We have discovered a second repeater and its properties are very similar to the first repeater,"" said Shriharsh Tendulkar of McGill University, Canada. ""This tells us more about the properties of repeaters as a population."" FRBs are short, bright flashes of radio waves. Light shed on mystery space radio pulses Mystery cosmic radio bursts pinpointed So far, scientists have detected about 60 single fast radio bursts and two that repeat. They believe there could be as many as a thousand FRBs in the sky every day. There are a number of theories about what could be causing them. They include a neutron star with a very strong magnetic field that is spinning very rapidly, two neutron stars merging together, and, among a minority of observers, some form of alien spaceship.

"Breaking|Breaking newsJayden Moodie murder police find carCar believed to be involved in murder case of Jayden Moodie, 14, found by police in LondonEngland","Jaden Moodie lived in the area with his mother, police said A car believed to be involved in the murder of 14-year-old Jaden Moodie has been found by police in London. The teenager was struck by a vehicle while on his moped, and then stabbed to death in what police believe was a targeted attack. He was found wounded in Bickley Road, Waltham Forest, on Tuesday evening. The black Mercedes B Class was recovered in the Carlisle Road area of Leyton during the afternoon. No arrests have been made, the Met Police said. The teenager was knocked off the moped at about 18:30 GMT, and then stabbed several times by three attackers as he lay unconscious in the road. The car was found a few hundred metres away, and has remained at that site for forensic examination. Det Ch Insp Chris Soole, from the Homicide and Major Crime Command, who is leading the investigation, said: ""We are treating the recovery of the car as a significant development in our enquiries, which are still very much in their early stages. ""Jaden's family are being fully supported and kept updated by our team. ""This is a truly heartbreaking time for them and we are doing everything we can to find out who was responsible for Jaden's death."" Moped crash boy, 14, stabbed to death Jaden, who police said lived in the area with his mother, is believed to be the youngest victim to die on London's streets in the past year. There were 132 homicides in 2018, the highest total since 2008. Police have not said whether they believe the murder was gang-related. The teenager and his mother had recently moved to London from Nottingham to be closer to some of his family. His godmother, Zoe Grant, described him as ""full of life, fun loving and a ray of sunshine"". ""He was a beautiful boy, so intelligent and had everything to live for,"" she said. Marcellus Baz, who was Jaden's youth worker when he lived in Nottingham, said the schoolboy's death was ""absolutely shocking"". The teenager was knocked off the moped at about 18:30 GMT on Tuesday Det Ch Insp Soole said additional police officers were in the area and members of the public were being encouraged to talk to them about any concerns they had, or to share information they think could help enquiries. ""I would urge anyone who has information about those responsible but who has not yet made contact with police to do so straight away. ""If you do not want to speak to police, please contact Crimestoppers, 100% anonymously,"" he said.

"Breaking|Breaking newsTrump 'walks out of shutdown talks'Democrats say Trump slammed the table and walked out of shutdown talks, while president calls meeting waste of timeUS & Canada","This video can not be played US shutdown: ""My son wants to sell art to pay our bills"" President Donald Trump has walked out of a meeting with Democratic leaders as negotiations broke down on the 19th day of a partial US government shutdown. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer stuck by their refusal to fund his US-Mexico border wall, prompting Mr Trump to call the meeting ""a total waste of time"". Democrats again accused the president of throwing a ""temper tantrum"". The first payday since the shutdown began is due on Friday for 800,000 federal workers, who will go unpaid. Where do we go from here? Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Mr Trump has demanded $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) to build a steel barrier, which would deliver on a key campaign pledge. But Democrats - who control the House of Representatives - have refused to back the funding. It was certainly brief, at only 14 minutes. The president hosted the Democratic leaders in the Situation Room, the conference centre in the West Wing basement. Mr Trump posed a direct question to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about whether she would fund the wall. His tweet following the meeting reflected the outcome of that - he said ""bye-bye"" and left: This video can not be played Trump v Democrats on the border wall and government shutdown Mr Schumer, the top Democrat in the Senate, confirmed the exchange, saying: ""He [Mr Trump] asked Speaker Pelosi, 'Will you agree to my wall?' She said No. ""And he just got up and said, 'Then we have nothing to discuss,' and he just walked out. Again, we saw a temper tantrum because he couldn't get his way."" Mr Schumer reportedly asked Mr Trump: ""You are using people as leverage; why won't you open the government and stop hurting people?"" A White House official told the New York Times Mr Trump had said: ""I am trying to do the right thing for the country. This isn't about politics."" Mr Schumer also said Mr Trump had ""slammed the table"" - prompting an angry response from the president denying it and insisting he had been polite. Allow Twitter content?

Kevin McCarthy, Republican leader in the House of Representatives, said he found the Democrats' behaviour ""embarrassing"". On Tuesday, Mr Trump delivered his first televised Oval Office address to the nation, where he described the border as a humanitarian and security crisis. The Democrats called the president's claims a fake threat. Mr Trump is going to the border on Thursday. He will visit a border patrol station in McAllen, in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. He will get an update on security at what is the busiest section of the border for illegal crossings. Republican leaders and Mr Trump insist the party is ""totally unified"" behind him, and most of the party appear to back his uncompromising stance.

Mr Trump still has the option of declaring a national emergency on the issue, opening up defence department funding for the wall. But this would be hugely controversial and would prompt a lengthy legal battle. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US The Democrats are refusing to budge, believing the public mostly blame Mr Trump for the shutdown. A new opinion poll suggests just over half of Americans (51%) blame President Trump, although 77% of Republican voters back his demand for wall funding. Partial shutdowns occur when Congress cannot agree a budget by a certain deadline or the president refuses to sign it. Fourteen ways the US shutdown is hurting This shutdown, which began on 22 December, has affected 25% of the government and some 800,000 federal employees. About 350,000 of them are furloughed - a kind of temporary lay off - the rest are continuing to work without pay. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall The first pay day since the shutdown falls on Friday and will pass without workers getting salaries. After past shutdowns, workers have generally been refunded with back pay, although that does not apply to those working for third-party contractors. The refunds are also not automatic - Congress must approve the measure. Some affected federal workers who spoke to the BBC said they had resorted to a number of measures, including taking other jobs, racking up credit card bills, tapping into savings or taking on loans at high interest rates to pay their bills. Thousands have also applied for unemployment benefits. The Office of Personnel Management, which oversees federal workers, has urged them to reach out to creditors and landlords for a deferral or reduction of payments. This weekend the shutdown will become the longest in US history.

"What's next in US shutdown stalemate?Democrats say Trump ""manufactured"" a border crisis, but he refuses to back down. What happens next?US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump v Democrats on the border wall and government shutdown President Donald Trump's standoff with Democrats over a border wall has dragged the US into the longest-ever government shutdown. Both sides appear to be dug in, so how might it end? Mr Trump continues to call the border a national security crisis while Democrats say he is holding America hostage over an exaggerated threat. As the nation waits for Washington to move forward, here are a few ways the situation could evolve. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher also chips in with his thoughts and his probability rating. Airport security staff, who have been working without pay since December, have begun leaving their jobs,according to officials,external. Terminals in some major airports have begun experiencing delays or are closing as a result. Food safety has also come into question as agencies struggle to operate. And on Tuesday the White House said it had doubled its estimate of the economic strain caused by the shutdown. Mr Trump's public opinion is also suffering,according to new polling,external. Anthony:There's always the possibility that the president could just throw in the towel. He did it when the heat became intolerable on his family-separation policy last year. He could do it again, if it becomes increasingly unlikely that Democrats are going to make concessions and the extended shutdown starts eating into the robust US economic growth that he frequently touts. The big question would be whether his base would go along with this. Would they view a three-week shutdown as enough of an effort to fulfil this campaign promise? Mr Trump would certainly take heat from conservative commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, but at some point the price of the shutdown might exceed the pain of backing down. Chances:20% Sixteen ways the US shutdown is hurting Mr Trump has been meeting congressional leaders but last week's attempts to resolve the shutdown ended with him walking out when Democrats refused to budge. But as it drags on, pressure is mounting on Capitol Hill. Anthony:It's a testament to the determination of both sides in the shutdown confrontation that, for the most part, partisan ranks appear to be holding firm. A handful of Republicans in the House of Representatives have voted to reopen the government without wall funding, while the Republican leadership of the Senate has successfully squelched calls for a vote of any kind. Meanwhile, Democrats have been steadfast - at least publicly - in their resistance to any kind of wall funding. That deadlock may not hold for much longer, however. As the pain from the shutdown spills out beyond just the 800,000 federal employees affected into the public at large, the pressure to reach any kind of a deal is growing. In the end the most probable deal would involve some new, vaguely worded border security funding that doesn't explicitly give the president money for his much-promised wall. Both sides could declare victory, and both sides would be right (and wrong). Chances:40% and creeping up How much of Trump's wall has been built? Six things that could topple Trump's border wall Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the president reopen the government for three weeks of negotiations. If talks are still stalled by the end, he could declare a national emergency. The following day, President Trump appeared to reject that plan. But Mr Graham was undeterred, joining forces with other senators from both parties to draft a letter - obtained by Axios - requesting a short-term spending bill. According toa leaked draft of the letter,external, the senators are requesting Mr Trump pause the shutdown ""to give Congress time to develop and vote on a bipartisan agreement"". It does not mention a border wall or national emergency. Anthony:Graham is drafting a letter to the president that suggests a full debate on border security in exchange for a 30-day reopening of the government. It's an offer the president has rejected in the past - but it at least buys both sides some time (and gets federal employees their past-due paycheques). Chances:10% This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall If Mr Trump does invoke his presidential powers, he could bypass Congress and obtain the means for his wall through military resources. Emergencies are usually declared in times of crisis, when the White House needs funds quickly and cannot wait for Congress to approve it. Critics would consider this a flagrant misuse of power and both political and legal battles would ensue. But the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which doled out unilateral authority in emergencies to presidents, as well as a court history of deferring to the president's national security decisions, could be in his favour. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Trump holds up a photo of a 'typical standard wall design' as he speaks during a roundtable discussion on border security Anthony Zurcher:For a while, it seemed like this would be a clever way for Mr Trump to extricate himself from the shutdown crisis. He could make the announcement to redirect existing funds to the border, sign legislation reopening the government and declare victory. Yes, the action would get bogged down in the courts, but a protracted legal fight might be a useful campaign issue in 2020. But some Republicans have balked at the prospect of a Democratic president using emergency declarations to enact gun control, nationalised healthcare or stringent environmental regulation. At some point Mr Trump might get so frustrated he ignores the concerns of his fellow Republicans, of course. It wouldn't be the first time. Chances:20% and dropping Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Little sign of a capitulation happening, with the leadership steadfast in their refusal to bow to President Trump's demands for a wall. Seven House Democrats accepted the president's invitation to the White House for talks on Wednesday, but their statement afterwards gave no hint of compromise. Anthony:The parody websiteThe Onion recently ran an article,externalabout how even Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was surprised he hadn't caved yet to Republican demands. It's meant as a joke, but there's some truth to it. In the past Democrats have been more keen to seek middle ground and compromise, even when their base thought they conceding too much. This time around, however, the Democrats have shown hardly a crack in their resistance. Mr Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have stood almost literally arm-in-arm in their opposition to Mr Trump's demands. The rank and file have largely been quiet, even though the pain being felt by government employees - whose unions are big Democratic supporters - has been acute. Instead, Ms Pelosi has been playing hardball, even suggesting the president should delay his high-profile State of the Union Address scheduled for later this month. Democrats are buoyed by a number of polls showing that not only is a majority of the public opposed to Mr Trump's proposal for an expanded border wall, they blame the president for the shutdown as well. For the moment, the Democrats have the high ground in this confrontation - and they are acting like it. Chances:9% No, it's not an ending, as such. It's the opposite of an ending, but it's a way forward - it's possible the shutdown may just carry on. Some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheque this month. Many have been furloughed - temporarily laid off - but those deemed essential have been working since 22 December without pay. Close to 50,000 workers have now been called back by the administration to work unpaid on key tasks like tax refunds and food safety. Over the last 26 days, federal employees have shared their fears of affording rent, making credit card payments and putting food on the table. Hundreds have turned to fundraising or side-jobs to make ends meet. Thousands of contract workers - who are not entitled to any back pay from Congress - and small businesses working closely with federal agencies have also been suffering. Allow Twitter content?

Anthony Zurcher:The president has ordered tens of thousands of federal employees back to work - without pay. It's an acknowledgment that the consequences of the government shutdown are worsening and a way of alleviating some of the pain. Many Americans are anxious to get their federal tax returns, and the Internal Revenue Service is getting the manpower to handle the paperwork. That may buy the president some time and allow the shutdown to drag on. But federal employees can't work for free forever. Some are suing the government to end this practice. Others are threatening to call in sick or quit en masse. The shutdown may stretch on, but it can't continue forever. Chances:1% Five questions about Trump's border wall.

Breath-test gadgets tell you what to eat,"This video can not be played WATCH: Chris Fox tries out Lumen, the breath test gadget that gives dietary advice Two gadgets that analyse the gases in people's breath in an effort to reveal how they should improve their diet are being showcased at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. Lumen and FoodMarble are both pocket-sized devices that users blow into. They pair smartphone apps that tell people things like how well they are digesting food or burning calories. But one expert said such technology has yet to be properly validated by scientists. Lumen has raised almost $2m (Â£1.57m) on the crowdfunding site Indiegogo. It has designed an inhaler-shaped product that measures carbon dioxide levels in the user's breath. The firm says this provides a way of monitoring a person's metabolism - the chemical processes that, among other things, convert food into energy. ""You don't need to guess how much sugar was in that kung pao chicken or how many calories you did on that run,"" explained founder Dror Cedar. Instead, he told the BBC, the app simply explains whether the user is burning carbs or fat. It then suggests recipes that help burn fat and, over time, Lumen learns what diet is most appropriate for each user. Lumen's app gives advice on what its owner should eat that day Lumen has been trialled by ""hundreds"" of users in the US, according to Mr Cedar. However, studies measuring the effectiveness of the product havenot yet been peer-reviewed,external. It will go on sale for $299 (Â£235) this summer, though people who pre-order will pay $250. The app might charge a subscription fee in the future, but it will be free for everyone during its first year. More from CES 2019: IBM's hourly weather reports will cover entire Earth Hyundai shows off 'walking car' at CES Samsung adds rival Apple's iTunes to smart TVs Conversely, FoodMarble measures hydrogen levels in an attempt to make deductions about a person's digestive health. It was released in December. The firm has racked up nearly $1 million in pre-ordered devices, which have now been shipped. Founder Lisa Ruttledge told the BBC that hydrogen in the breath can be a sign that someone is having trouble digesting a recent meal. FoodMarble says your digestive health can be tracked simply by detecting hydrogen in your breath ""That's happening because there's fermentation happening in your gut and some hydrogen created in that process is exhaled,"" she said. The idea is to help people who experience bloating, abdominal pain and other gastrointestinal symptoms. Through revealing foods that result in hydrogen production, FoodMarble could help them tailor healthier diets. However, although such tests are sometimes used by doctors and dieticians, some question whether they are accurate. ""There is only limited scientific research showing that these validated tests carried out in a hospital environment can tell you what foods you are sensitive to,"" said Kevin Whelan, a professor of diatetics at King's College London. This is because various factors can influence breath results - including the time taken for a meal to be digested, which is not always the same. ""Portable, user-driven machines that test breath gas have never been used in scientific studies to show what foods people may be sensitive to,"" he added. Ruttledge said that one of her firm's goals was to have FoodMarble become the first such device to be evaluated in a scientific study.

Multiple arrests target drugs trade,"An arrest under way in Barrow Police say 22 people have been arrested and 10 charged, in raids tackling the supply of illegal drugs to Cumbria. The arrests, on Tuesday and Wednesday, took place in Barrow-in-Furness, Coventry and London. Some of those arrested are alleged to have been involved in sending drugs from London to Barrow, a process known as county lines. Police are increasingly targeting the town's drug dealers, after a big spike in drug-related deaths in early 2018. Drugs leave 12 dead in a Cumbrian town Boy used as 'foot soldier' by drugs gang The raids are the culmination of an undercover police investigation, called Operation Horizon, that Cumbria Constabulary has been running since May. Its main aim was an attempt to disrupt what police say was a county lines drug dealing gang, operating under the name Barry, who were allegedly moving drugs and people from London and Coventry to Barrow-in-Furness. The force's Supt Rob O'Connor said the arrests demonstrated how seriously police were taking the issue. He added that it also showed ""how determined we are to stem the flow of drugs into south Cumbria"" after his officers had travelled to arrest people in London and Cumbria. Police also seized thousands of pounds in cash and quantities of heroin and crack cocaine in the raids. Some of the cash seized in Barrow Between December 2017 and April 2018, there were 12 drug-related deaths in Barrow,a figure completely out of proportion to the size of the town.,external Much of the blame for the spike in deaths was put down, in particular, to the increasing supply of heroin and crack cocaine. Gangs from London and the West Midlands had started supplying into the town, adding to the usual dealers from Liverpool and Manchester. In October,a drill music rapper from south London was sentenced to seven years in prison. The deaths sparked police, council and health officials to improve the support services available to drug users in Barrow. One of the schemes now being offered is an outreach service, where counsellors from The Well, a drug rehabilitation charity, go to the local hospital, Furness General to meet  patients who have drug or alcohol problems. The project, which has been running since June, sees counsellors, who are all volunteers and have themselves previously struggled with addictions, approach people while in their hospital beds, and offer to help them overcome their problems. The deputy medical director at the hospital, Dr Paul Grout, says the scheme has made a huge difference. ""By being able to provide support for these patients before they leave hospital, which has then continued when they are out in the community, it prevents the revolving door problem with these patients that we've had until now,"" he said. Former drug users counsel people struggling with addictions at The Well Cumbria County Council have also set up a drug-related deaths panel, to understand why so many people have died in the town. ""They were estranged from their families, had mental health issues, or suffered benefit sanctions,"" says Lesley Graham, who chairs the panel. ""Males living alone, extremely high-risk people, a lot of polydrug use, it wasn't just one single drug, it was a mixture and, when we did toxicology reports, we found extremely high contents of cocaine and heroin."" This combination of initiatives appears to be having an effect and the rate of drug-related deaths in the town has fallen; police believe there have been only five since April. Despite the police raids, everyone in Barrow accepts that arrests alone will not solve the town's long-term problem with illegal drugs. Ensuring that users continue to have ready access to good quality health and support services is vital, as is giving the town's children alternatives to turning to drugs in the first place. ""I've two children myself -  OK, they're 26 and 24 - and one day I hope to have grandchildren,"" says Ms Graham. ""I want to make sure that anything that we put in place improves Barrow and is sustainable.""

Loans for forced marriage victims dropped,"Victims of forced marriages overseas will no longer have to take out loans to pay for their return to the UK. It emerged last week in aninvestigation by The Times,externalthat those unable to cover flights, food and shelter were made to take out an emergency loan. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the policy was changing as victims ""may have endured particular suffering"". Existing loans will be written off and the women's passports returned. Victims asked to pay rescue costs Javid promises forced marriage crackdown Mr Hunt said the Foreign Office would try to get most repatriation costs covered by imposing so-called Forced Marriage Protection Orders on the people and families who arranged the forced marriage. But the small number who would have had to take out a loan will now have their repatriation costs paid for by the Foreign Office. Between 2016 and 2017, 82 people were repatriated with the support of the government's Forced Marriage Unit. Of those victims, between 8 and 12 had to take out loans. When the Times reported the practice, MPs condemned the loans as ""astonishing"" and ""immoral"". Mr Hunt said: ""Whereas the Foreign Office rightly expects that adult Britons who receive consular assistance will, in general, pay for their own travel home, victims of forced marriage may have endured particular suffering. ""They will often have travelled abroad against their wishes, or under false pretences."" Mr Hunt said the unit's staff ""carry out profoundly necessary work"" and added: ""Our treatment of vulnerable Britons abroad should always be guided by compassion."" Mr Hunt revealed the policy change in a letter to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat.

Cheap common drugs may help mental illness,"Cheap and widely used drugs for diabetes and heart health have potential for treating severe mental illness, a study hints. It showed the number of times patients needed hospital treatment fell by up to a fifth when they took the drugs. The researchers at University College London say their findings have ""enormous potential"". But they, and independent experts, say the results now need to be tested in clinical trials. The starting point for the researchers was a list of currently prescribed medications that science predicts could also help patients with severe mental health disorders. The team focused on: anti-cholesterol drugs called statins - which may calm inflammation linked to mental health problems or help the body absorb anti-psychotic medications blood pressure drugs - which may alter the calcium signalling in the brain that has been linked to bipolar disorder and schizophrenia type 2 diabetes drug metformin - which may alter mood But rather than test them in trials, the scientists went looking for evidence in the real world. They analysed life-long medical records of 142,691 people in Sweden who had schizophrenia, bipolar disorder or other severe mental illnesses. They then compared the number of times each was admitted to a psychiatric hospital clinic when they were taking those medications and when they were not. Dr Joseph Hayes, one of the researchers at UCL, said: ""The paper suggests a 10-20% reduction in the number of episodes when on the medications rather than off."" The results, published in the journal JAMA Psychiatry, also showed a reduction in self-harm. ""It's incredibly exciting,"" Dr Hayes said. ""It's got enormous potential and I'm pleased with the way it has turned out. ""But this is really just a starting point."" Depression: A revolution in treatment? Magic mushrooms can 'reset' depressed brain Body clock linked to mood disorders He wants the drugs to now be tested in large clinical trials, which should give a final answer. In the meantime, Dr Hayes says people should not go out and try to get the drugs themselves. But, he says, there are many patients who should be on these drugs for their physical health who are not getting them. ""The thing to do would be to see your GP about full physical health review,"" Dr Hayes said. ""There's a huge number of people that may benefit from a statin for their heart health and there's a potential knock-on for their mental health, similarly with metformin."" Dr James MacCabe, from the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said: ""These findings are very compelling. ""The findings strongly suggest a potential role for repurposing these drugs to improve mental health outcomes."" But there is one nagging doubt, even from the researchers, around the way the study was designed. A lot of studies compare one group of patients taking a drug with another group not taking it. This one compared patients at different stages of their life when they were either on the drug or not. The approach has many advantages but it could mean that when people are in a good place mentally and less likely to be admitted to hospital, they are also more likely to look after themselves and take other medications. In other words, statins and other drugs could just be a red herring. This is why Prof Naveed Sattar, from University of Glasgow, remains sceptical and says: ""I would be strongly cautious with these findings and would only change my mind if effects are proven to be robust in a randomised trial."" The research group took steps to counter this effect but agree clinical trials are the next step. Follow Jameson Twitter.,external Depression: A revolution in treatment?

World's richest man Jeff Bezos divorces,"The pair said that they had had a great life together Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and his wife, MacKenzie, are to divorce after a 25-year marriage. The pair announced the move in a joint statement on Wednesday on Twitter. ""After a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends,"" the couple said in the statement. Amazon, formed 25 years ago, this week eclipsed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable listed company. Mr Bezos, 54, who founded Amazon, is the world's wealthiest manaccording to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index,external, with an estimated wealth of $137bn, some $45bn ahead of Bill Gates. The 48-year-old MacKenzie Bezos is a novelist, the author of The Testing of Luther Albright (2005) and Traps (2013). How Jeff Bezos took Amazon to the top The Bezos backlash: Is 'big philanthropy' a charade? ""We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other,"" the couple's statement said. The couple got married in 1993, after meeting at a job interview ""If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again. We've had such a great life together as a married couple and we also see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures. Amazon becomes most valuable public firm World's richest man in $2bn charity move ""Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends."" Last year they launched a charity project together, the Day One Fund, with the aim of helping homeless families and building pre-schools in low-income communities. The couple have four children - three sons, and an adopted daughter. US media report thatMr Bezos has been romantically involved with a former Fox TV host, Lauren SÃ¡nchez,external. Entertainment news site TMZ, citing sources linked to Ms SÃ¡nchez, said the presenter has been ""seeing"" Mr Bezos as of late last year. In 2013, MacKenzie Bezos told Vogue Magazine thatshe had met Jeff when he interviewed her for a job at a hedge fund in New York,external. They got engaged after three months of dating and married shortly after, in 1993. One year later he founded Amazon - which began as an online book retailer. The company has since expanded into an e-commerce giant. Amazon was worth $797bn (Â£634bn) when the US stock market closed on Monday, after rising 3.4% and moving past Microsoft, valued at $789bn.

What's next in US shutdown stalemate?,"This video can not be played Trump v Democrats on the border wall and government shutdown President Donald Trump's standoff with Democrats over a border wall has dragged the US into the longest-ever government shutdown. Both sides appear to be dug in, so how might it end? Mr Trump continues to call the border a national security crisis while Democrats say he is holding America hostage over an exaggerated threat. As the nation waits for Washington to move forward, here are a few ways the situation could evolve. The BBC's Anthony Zurcher also chips in with his thoughts and his probability rating. Airport security staff, who have been working without pay since December, have begun leaving their jobs,according to officials,external. Terminals in some major airports have begun experiencing delays or are closing as a result. Food safety has also come into question as agencies struggle to operate. And on Tuesday the White House said it had doubled its estimate of the economic strain caused by the shutdown. Mr Trump's public opinion is also suffering,according to new polling,external. Anthony:There's always the possibility that the president could just throw in the towel. He did it when the heat became intolerable on his family-separation policy last year. He could do it again, if it becomes increasingly unlikely that Democrats are going to make concessions and the extended shutdown starts eating into the robust US economic growth that he frequently touts. The big question would be whether his base would go along with this. Would they view a three-week shutdown as enough of an effort to fulfil this campaign promise? Mr Trump would certainly take heat from conservative commentators such as Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, but at some point the price of the shutdown might exceed the pain of backing down. Chances:20% Sixteen ways the US shutdown is hurting Mr Trump has been meeting congressional leaders but last week's attempts to resolve the shutdown ended with him walking out when Democrats refused to budge. But as it drags on, pressure is mounting on Capitol Hill. Anthony:It's a testament to the determination of both sides in the shutdown confrontation that, for the most part, partisan ranks appear to be holding firm. A handful of Republicans in the House of Representatives have voted to reopen the government without wall funding, while the Republican leadership of the Senate has successfully squelched calls for a vote of any kind. Meanwhile, Democrats have been steadfast - at least publicly - in their resistance to any kind of wall funding. That deadlock may not hold for much longer, however. As the pain from the shutdown spills out beyond just the 800,000 federal employees affected into the public at large, the pressure to reach any kind of a deal is growing. In the end the most probable deal would involve some new, vaguely worded border security funding that doesn't explicitly give the president money for his much-promised wall. Both sides could declare victory, and both sides would be right (and wrong). Chances:40% and creeping up How much of Trump's wall has been built? Six things that could topple Trump's border wall Appearing on Fox News Sunday, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham suggested the president reopen the government for three weeks of negotiations. If talks are still stalled by the end, he could declare a national emergency. The following day, President Trump appeared to reject that plan. But Mr Graham was undeterred, joining forces with other senators from both parties to draft a letter - obtained by Axios - requesting a short-term spending bill. According toa leaked draft of the letter,external, the senators are requesting Mr Trump pause the shutdown ""to give Congress time to develop and vote on a bipartisan agreement"". It does not mention a border wall or national emergency. Anthony:Graham is drafting a letter to the president that suggests a full debate on border security in exchange for a 30-day reopening of the government. It's an offer the president has rejected in the past - but it at least buys both sides some time (and gets federal employees their past-due paycheques). Chances:10% This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall If Mr Trump does invoke his presidential powers, he could bypass Congress and obtain the means for his wall through military resources. Emergencies are usually declared in times of crisis, when the White House needs funds quickly and cannot wait for Congress to approve it. Critics would consider this a flagrant misuse of power and both political and legal battles would ensue. But the 1976 National Emergencies Act, which doled out unilateral authority in emergencies to presidents, as well as a court history of deferring to the president's national security decisions, could be in his favour. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? Trump holds up a photo of a 'typical standard wall design' as he speaks during a roundtable discussion on border security Anthony Zurcher:For a while, it seemed like this would be a clever way for Mr Trump to extricate himself from the shutdown crisis. He could make the announcement to redirect existing funds to the border, sign legislation reopening the government and declare victory. Yes, the action would get bogged down in the courts, but a protracted legal fight might be a useful campaign issue in 2020. But some Republicans have balked at the prospect of a Democratic president using emergency declarations to enact gun control, nationalised healthcare or stringent environmental regulation. At some point Mr Trump might get so frustrated he ignores the concerns of his fellow Republicans, of course. It wouldn't be the first time. Chances:20% and dropping Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Little sign of a capitulation happening, with the leadership steadfast in their refusal to bow to President Trump's demands for a wall. Seven House Democrats accepted the president's invitation to the White House for talks on Wednesday, but their statement afterwards gave no hint of compromise. Anthony:The parody websiteThe Onion recently ran an article,externalabout how even Democratic Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was surprised he hadn't caved yet to Republican demands. It's meant as a joke, but there's some truth to it. In the past Democrats have been more keen to seek middle ground and compromise, even when their base thought they conceding too much. This time around, however, the Democrats have shown hardly a crack in their resistance. Mr Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi have stood almost literally arm-in-arm in their opposition to Mr Trump's demands. The rank and file have largely been quiet, even though the pain being felt by government employees - whose unions are big Democratic supporters - has been acute. Instead, Ms Pelosi has been playing hardball, even suggesting the president should delay his high-profile State of the Union Address scheduled for later this month. Democrats are buoyed by a number of polls showing that not only is a majority of the public opposed to Mr Trump's proposal for an expanded border wall, they blame the president for the shutdown as well. For the moment, the Democrats have the high ground in this confrontation - and they are acting like it. Chances:9% No, it's not an ending, as such. It's the opposite of an ending, but it's a way forward - it's possible the shutdown may just carry on. Some 800,000 federal workers missed their first paycheque this month. Many have been furloughed - temporarily laid off - but those deemed essential have been working since 22 December without pay. Close to 50,000 workers have now been called back by the administration to work unpaid on key tasks like tax refunds and food safety. Over the last 26 days, federal employees have shared their fears of affording rent, making credit card payments and putting food on the table. Hundreds have turned to fundraising or side-jobs to make ends meet. Thousands of contract workers - who are not entitled to any back pay from Congress - and small businesses working closely with federal agencies have also been suffering. Allow Twitter content?

Anthony Zurcher:The president has ordered tens of thousands of federal employees back to work - without pay. It's an acknowledgment that the consequences of the government shutdown are worsening and a way of alleviating some of the pain. Many Americans are anxious to get their federal tax returns, and the Internal Revenue Service is getting the manpower to handle the paperwork. That may buy the president some time and allow the shutdown to drag on. But federal employees can't work for free forever. Some are suing the government to end this practice. Others are threatening to call in sick or quit en masse. The shutdown may stretch on, but it can't continue forever. Chances:1% Five questions about Trump's border wall.

New prisons to ditch bars on windows,"Traditional prison window bars are to be phased out in England and Wales, under Ministry of Justice (MoJ) plans. New jails will instead be fitted with toughened glass and air vents. Ministers said the windows would be hard to break and better for stopping prisoners ""accessing contraband"". Campaigners said bars were ""yesterday's technology"" and windows would provide a more normal environment in which people would take responsibility for their own lives. But ex-prisoner turned charity worker and author, Leroy Smith, described the changes as ""a pointless gesture"" - adding that prisoners needed better education and training. ""Otherwise nothing is going to change,"" he said. Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons? Ministers under fire over 'squalid' jail Prison refers to inmates as 'residents' Bars on prison cell windows are used in most jails, including the most modern buildings such as Berwyn, north Wales and Oakwood, Wolverhampton. The MoJ has promised to replace old and expensive prison accommodation with 10,000 ""modern and safe"" spaces. And the first new prisons are expected to be built on the site of former jails at Wellingborough, Northamptonshire and Glen Parva, Leicestershire in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Ministers also want to build new prisons in south Wales and near HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire, in addition to redeveloping existing prisons at Hindley, Greater Manchester and Rochester, Kent. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Secure, sealed windows with toughened glass and narrow vents will be used in all cells in future prisons. ""These windows are difficult to break, making them more effective in stopping prisoners from accessing contraband."" Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust said: ""A normal environment in which people take responsibility for as much of their own lives as possible is preparation for successful release. ""Bars in windows is yesterday's technology."" The move comes as researchers begin a study to examine the impact of a more relaxed and humane prison by examining changes at HMP Berwyn. There, prisoners are referred to as men, housed in communities rather than blocks, and locked up in ""rooms"" rather than cells. There have also been attempts at the prison to fill empty wall space with photos of the local Welsh landscape. Professor Yvonne Jewkes from the University of Bath said the changes were ""relatively simple"" but could have ""an important effect when it comes to making prisoners feel that they are treated with respect and dignity"".

Well.... at least that's cheered Rotherham up a bit. You've got to feel for Burton though, their best moment came after about 14 seconds. Downhill after that. Matt, Norwich That is the real story of the night. Superb work. And we are so glad that Richard was able to get in. Even if he did have to see his team ship nine goals. Man City 9-0 Burton BBC Radio 5 live Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Burton fan Emily who we have featured all night, said:""My brother Richard is based in Sheffield normally but he is up working in Glasgow this week. I'm London based so I thought I would drive up in half a day. Normally I would take the train but I'm moving house so I decided to drive because there are no trains coming back late at night. I left at 13:00 and I passed Burton-on-Trent about 15:45. I got onto the M6 and nothing showed on my sat nav as a problem but I obviously got onto the road when it happened. ""I was stuck on the M6 for around four hours in total. My brother said he was just going to go to the ground to try and blag it in, but I sent him a picture of his ticket with the bar code on it, and they actually scanned the photograph of the ticket. He had to convince stewards it was true, and showed them the reporting on the BBC Sport website, but they let him in."" Asked what now, Emily said:""I am going to go back to my brother's place in Sheffield because I've got to have a rest before getting back to London in the morning. I'm not going down the M6 because I'm told it's bad south bound so I'll head back down the M1 from Sheffield. It was a long journey for 15 minutes of football but having been stuck for four hours, I thought I wasn't going to go home so I just caught the final bit.""

four tiers of English football to score at least seven goals in back-to-back

Man City 9-0 Burton BBC Radio 5 live Speaking to BBC Radio 5 live, Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough said:""It is not very pleasant when you are losing by that scoreline but it was nothing more than we expected. The only thing we can make the players aware of is the runs their players make, but making them aware and stopping them are two different things. ""We had a great chance at 1-0 and I don't think it would have altered the evening too much, but it would have been nice to have scored a goal. The worst part about it was knowing a lot of supporters were stuck on the motorway, but the ones that were here, were here to celebrate us reaching this point."" Man City 9 (Nine)-0 Burton Burton Albion manager Nigel Clough:""We didn't expect anytihng less with the gulf between the two teams, we thought it could have been more. We didn't too much wrong, two or three of the goals we could have done more but we didn't too badly."" When did you think it could get messy?""When the draw was made. ""Do I wish we hadn't played Not at all, we have made history in getting this far. It wasn't about tonight it was about the achievement of getting here. We kept going right to the end, they were shouting 'we want 10' and we stopped them, that's a positive for us. Some of the youngsters have had an experience that you can't buy. ""It's not nice when the goals are going in and you can do nothing to stop it. Pep said come in for a glass of wine and I hope he's got more than a glass. They are capable of doing that to Premier League teams. ""I can't wait for the second leg..."" You're paying, Pep... Man City 9 (Nine)-0 Burton Manchester City Manchester City manager Pep Guardiola:""The result was good and of course we are already in the final but we have to play the second leg. We will take it seriously. Burton have had an incredible tournament. They have to be so proud, they did so well. ""Strikers need to score goals, Gabriel Jesus has had chances in the last few games and today he has scored. He is so important. ""It is not easy to play this type of game against a lower team, we made good runs in behind and we took it seriously. After the second and third goal it was easier, we were faster and quicker. ""I am off for a glass of wine with Nigel Clough, I know how important his father was for English football, he was a genius. Incredible. It will be apleasure to share some minutes with him.""

Bercow's ruling could change Brexit,"John Bercow has been the Speaker for almost a decade Boom! After a humdrum, almost completely unrevealing Prime Minister's Questions, the Commons erupted over Speaker John Bercow's decision to allow an attempt to change the rules for the resumed ""meaningful vote"" debate. This is no mere technicality. The amendment proposed by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve would require the government to come back within three days, rather than 21, to debate the implications of not having a Brexit deal - if the prime minister's deal is indeed voted down next Tuesday. Under the previous rules, that debate would be kicked back to late February, with the Brexit clock ticking remorselessly in the background. The new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum, via a ""Norway option"" or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table. If a majority could be found for anything, it would not have the force of law - but it would at least indicate a policy which had the support of MPs. Fresh Brexit setback for May in MPs' vote Parliament live: MPs debate Brexit deal How voters want Brexit to be sorted out This is, in short, a massive ruling by the Speaker, made, apparently, against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler. I don't want to delve too deeply into the arcana of Business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the Crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. The decisions will come much faster, and potentially, those plotting an alternative course to the PM's would have more space in which to work. And it may also set a sweeping precedent allowing MPs far more grip over their debates, on Brexit and pretty much anything else. If such a precedent can be made to stick, it would be a huge blow against any government's accustomed control over the business of the Commons. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Anti-Brexit sticker belongs to my wife"" This is the biggest thing the Speaker has done, or is likely to do, easily eclipsing his decision to allow an extra amendment to the 2013 Queens' Speech, kicking off the Commons campaign which ultimately led to an EU Referendum becoming official Conservative policy. He got through a testing hour of points of order - which represents a victory of sorts, because he wasn't toppled by angry MPs in the way Michael Martin was a decade ago. But there will be consequences. For a start, a motion of no confidence in him now looks pretty certain. It may just languish in the ""Remaining Orders and Notices"" section of the Commons Order Paper, but it may take off and attract a critical mass of support from enraged Tories. Beyond that, the Speaker already has Conservatives openly accusing him of pro-Labour bias. Once unthinkable, that has now become a daily event, and may now become an hourly event. Criticism of other aspects of his running of Commons business (too many urgent questions, emergency debates and over-running PMQs) may become continual. Things are about to become very uncomfortable in the Chamber. Above all there's the bullying inquiry and the allegations levelled against the Speaker himself, which have been repeatedly denied, that he has bullied colleagues. This is an inquiry that should not be postponed to protect the Speaker, nor weaponised to destroy him; but it could well be. I suspect that, one way or another, Mr Bercow's turbulent tenure in the Commons chair is coming to an end. Perhaps in months rather than weeks, but not before the big Brexit votes (and it's not impossible that somewhere along the way, he might have to make this kind of ruling again). The basic question his would-be successors will have to answer is how much of the Bercow revolution in the way the Commons works should be scrapped - and how much should be retained?

Can MPs stop a no-deal Brexit?,"There's a big problem facing members of Parliament who want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. They can't just show there is a majority in the House of Commons against no deal - they need to prove there is a majority in favour of an alternative outcome. That's because leaving the EU - with or without a deal - is currently the default. If the prime minister fails to get a deal through the House of Commons, the UK will leave with no deal at all unless something changes, because leaving the EU is written into UK law. The EU Withdrawal Act sets 29 March as the date of departure. The wording of the act does allow a minister to change the definition of ""exit day"" relatively quickly using a statutory instrument - a piece of secondary legislation - rather than an entirely new act of Parliament that would need to be debated. A minister would have to propose the change and MPs would have to approve it. But there is a second and more significant reason why no deal would become the default position: that's what EU law says. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the formal route for any country leaving the EU and it allows for a two-year process of negotiation. At the end of that period ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. The most obvious way therefore to stop a no-deal Brexit, or any form of Brexit, is to revoke Article 50. Minister talks down Brexit delay claim Bid to limit tax powers if no-deal Brexit Is the EU about to rescue Theresa May? TheEuropean Court of Justice has ruledthe UK can do that on its own, without asking the other 27 countries, and stay a member of the EU on its current terms - including opting-out of key policies, and keeping the budget rebate. But it seems highly unlikely that the House of Commons would vote to revoke Article 50 unless there had been another referendum, or maybe an election, in which the public backed the UK remaining in the EU. The government rejects the idea of holding another referendum anyway - and the time to do so before the end of March has run out. So, the other way to avoid a no-deal Brexit in the short term is to play for time and extend the Article 50 period. The government would need to propose that and MPs would have to approve it. But, crucially, unlike in the case of revoking Article 50, to extend it the UK would also need the agreement of all 27 other EU countries. It would probably need to persuade them that something important had changed in UK politics to warrant an extension - perhaps a looming election, or another referendum, rather than more of the same argument. One of the constraints for the rest of the EU is that European elections will take place at the end of May and the new European Parliament (without UK MEPs if Brexit has taken place) is due to meet for the first time in July. The only other circumstance in which a brief extension to Article 50 would probably be approved by the EU is if there had been a vote in favour of Theresa May's deal but a little more time was needed to dot the ""i""s and cross the ""t""s. But if Article 50 was extended without a deal passing the House of Commons, no deal would still remain the default outcome at the end of the extended negotiating period. In a word, amendments. An amendment to the Finance Bill, limiting the Treasury's ability to make no-deal preparations unless authorised by Parliament, was backed by MPs by 303 to 296 votes. This amendment will make it ""harder for the government to drift into no deal without Parliament being able to direct it"", according to Labour MP Yvette Cooper. A cross-party coalition of MPs against no deal is now flexing its muscles, and what we're likely to see over the next couple of months is what some are calling ""guerrilla warfare by amendment"" in the House of Commons. Yvette Cooper says her amendment has support from Remain and Leave MPs The trade bill is likely to be another target - it would be needed in the event of no deal, to try to keep the UK trading on the same terms as it has now with the rest of the world. The idea behind all this parliamentary manoeuvring is to demonstrate that there is a clear majority in the House of Commons against no deal. But none of it, taken in isolation, will prevent the Article 50 clock ticking away until it stops at the end of March. That's why a growing number of MPs support the idea of holding a series of ""indicative votes"" on different potential outcomes, to try to find an alternative to no deal that would enjoy broad  (or even sufficient) support. Senior MPs argue that the government would be unable to ignore the political pressure if the will of the House of Commons was clearly expressed on numerous occasions. But political pressure is not the same as legal reality. Three ministers have said publicly they would resign if the government pursued a no-deal strategy, while others are thought to hold the same position in private. A handful of backbench MPs have said they would quit the party. The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, is understood to have told cabinet that history would take a dim view of the government if it accepted no deal and it would leave the UK a less safe country. But if the prime minister did decide to press on regardless, it may well be that the only way MPs could stop a no-deal Brexit at the last moment would be to vote down the government itself. UPDATE -This article was updated on Wednesday 9 Jan to include the new amendment asking government to return to Parliament with new plans within three days of a vote against the Prime Minister's withdrawal deal.

MP cleared of election expenses fraud,"This video can not be played Craig Mackinlay thanked his South Thanet constituents for standing by him Conservative politician Craig Mackinlay has been cleared of knowingly falsifying election expenses. The MP for South Thanet had denied making false declarations during his 2015 campaign, when he beat then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage to the seat. Mr Mackinlay, 52, had been accused of failing to declare more than Â£60,000 spent on staffing, hotels and adverts. Tory party employee Marion Little, 63, was given a suspended sentence after being found guilty of two charges. Little, who had effectively run the 2015 election campaign, was found guilty of two counts of encouraging or assisting an offence, but cleared of a third. The long-time Tory party member, from Ware, Hertfordshire, had ""acted dishonestly by preparing returns she knew were not completed nor accurate,"" Judge Mr Justice Edis said. He described Little as being ""a senior and respected employee of the Conservative Party at its Central Headquarters and has been so for many years"", and said her actions were a ""sustained and deliberate course of conduct"". The judge said Little had presented falsified documents to Mr Mackinlay and Mr Gray for signing which ""they did so in good faith not knowing what she had done"". ""No-one can know whether her misconduct had any effect on the outcome of that election but she plainly intended that it would. ""She was the author and origin of this falsehood."" Handing her a nine-month sentence, suspended for two years, the judge said Little had been ""carried away by her conviction"" that defeating Mr Farage was an ""overwhelmingly important political objective"". He said the only reason she was not being given a custodial sentence was because she was caring for her husband, who is terminally ill. Jurors at Southwark Crown Court had deliberated for more than 53 hours before reaching their verdicts. Marion Little told the court she would never falsify documents Mr Mackinlay responded on Twitter, simply writing #notguilty. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prosecutor Michelle Nelson told jurors South Thanet would usually have been seen as a safe seat, but Mr Farage's run as UKIP candidate had been regarded as the chance to ""knock him out"" of politics. Mr Mackinlay told the court the Conservative Party HQ had ""recognised the fear of Farage"" and offered to pay for a campaign manager. He said the South Thanet seat would be ""looked at and pored over very carefully"" and said he was told during the 2015 campaign that spending was ""perilously close"" to the limit. The prosecution's case centred around claims some costs for activists and party workers were recorded as national rather than local election expenses, to ensure spending limits weren't breached. Declared spending came in under the Â£52,000 constituency limit, but prosecutors claimed more than Â£60,000 went undeclared. Mr Mackinlay eventually won the seat, in whatthe court previously heard was a ""nasty"" election. The MP's agent,Nathan Gray, was acquitted on 13 December. Mr Gray, 29, of Hawkhurst in Kent had faced one count of making a false election expenses declaration. Mr Mackinlay said: ""It's been nearly three years of pure hell. This has been a really tough time. ""There are questions that need to be asked and the Electoral Commission needs to get together with political parties to make sure that never again a candidate or an agent can be accused of these things."" By Helen Catt, political editor, BBC News South East This trial has given a rare glimpse behind the rosettes, the posters and the doorstep handshakes into the party machines behind election campaigns. In this case, it's not been a pleasant one. A tale of a ""win at any cost"" mentality that led to spending laws being deliberately breached and then hidden by a party official from the Conservatives' own candidate and his election agent. Craig Mackinlay described himself as a ""small cog in a big gearbox"" but it was he who ended up seeing his job, his reputation and even his freedom in jeopardy. That has made other MPs nervous. The 2015 election in South Thanet was held under a unique set of circumstances but could the fallout force a rethink of the way election campaigns are conducted in future? A spokesman for the Conservative Party said while being ""disappointed"" with Little's conviction the case had ""highlighted just how unclear and fragmented electoral law was in 2015"". He said: ""There is clearly a need for greater clarity and guidance on the law. We will take further legal advice and continue to meet with the Electoral Commission to seek this."" Mr Farage said: ""This verdict shows that there are no election rules for the big parties in British politics, they can wilfully overspend without any consequences."" The Election Commission has welcomed Little's conviction. A spokesman said: ""It is vital that offences under electoral law are properly investigated, including by the police when appropriate. ""This outcome should serve as a deterrent to anyone who would seek to circumvent the proper reporting of campaign spending."" He said the commission was continuing to call for for electoral law to be reviewed. Correction 1 February 2019: We previously reported Craig Mackinlay was cleared of ""falsifying election expenses"". We have changed this to ""knowingly falsifying election expenses"". We also previously said Marion Little was a ""party activist"", however, the judge described her as ""a senior and respected employee of the Conservative Party"", so we have amended our story to reflect that.

UN 'considers Saudi woman a refugee',"This video can not be played The #SaveRahaf campaign went viral after Rahaf started tweeting about her plight for asylum A Saudi woman who fled her family and refused to leave a Bangkok hotel has been declared a legitimate refugee by the UN, the Australian government says. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, refused to board a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait on Monday and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room. She said she had renounced Islam, which is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. The UN's refugee agency has referred her case to Australia for possible resettlement. Thai immigration officials had initially said she should return to Kuwait, where her family were waiting. She then started a social media campaign, live-tweeting her case and attracting international attention. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, pictured at Bangkok airport, says she ""wants to be free"" away from Saudi Arabia In a brief statement, Australia's Department of Home Affairs said it would ""consider this referral in the usual way"". Ms Mohammed al-Qunun posted a message on Twitter following the announcement, saying: ""Don't let anyone break your wings, you're free. Fight and get your rights!"" Allow Twitter content?

Refugee status is normally granted by governments, but the UNHCR can grant it where states are ""unable or unwilling to do so"",according to its website,external.

Arrested for disobeying your father Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West Saudi asylum seeker 'taken home' by family Officials in Australia have hinted that her request will be accepted. ""If she is found to be a refugee, then we will give very, very, very serious consideration to a humanitarian visa,"" Health Minister Greg Hunt told the ABC network before the UN determination was made public. But Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned there would be ""no special treatment"" for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. 'Sara', Saudi woman speaking toBBC OS on the World Service Rahaf is an inspiration. But she's not the first one who did this and definitely not the last one. What we are going through is awful. We think about this every day because us women here do not know what it feels like to go out. We don't know what freedom tastes like. Dad keeps my passport with him all the time, we go to hotels and he puts it next to him when he sleeps. Unfortunately it's not a revolution. Every girl that is tweeting about this, it's either that she has already escaped or she's using a fake account like me. Some people tweeted me or DMed me to tell me to use my real account, for me to be brave. We do not want the guardianship any more. I want to go out of the house and drink coffee from Starbucks. I don't have to take my whole family. This is just way too harsh on us. Living this life is exhausting. Renunciation of Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. ""My life is in danger,"" she told the Reuters news agency. ""My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things."" Saudi Arabia's restrictions on women explained A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety. Campaign groups like Human Rights Watch (HRW) have expressed grave concerns for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director off HRW, told Reuters: ""She said very clearly that she has suffered both physical and psychological abuse. She said she has made a decision to renounce Islam. And I knew once she said that, she is in serious trouble"". On Tuesday morning she retweeted her original appeal for asylum, pleading for the UK, Canada, the US or Australia to take her in.

Ms Mohammed al-Qunun says she was on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight on 4 January. She was trying to head to Australia via a connecting flight in Bangkok. Because she did not have a visa to enter Thailand, Thai police had denied her entry and were in the process of repatriating her, an official said. Police in Thailand had denied entry to the woman and were in the process of repatriating her She began to live-tweet her ordeal, sharing her Twitter password with friends so they too could assist in spreading the message on social media. But some social media users in her own country strongly criticized her actions. A video showed how she resisted deportation efforts by hiding in an airport hotel room, putting a table against the door to stop people from entering. She told the BBC: ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want."" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun has been housed in a secure location in Bangkok since Monday night, when the Thai government allowed her to leave the airport. Her father and brother have arrived in Thailand but she is refusing to see them. Thailand's immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said the pair would remain there until it was clear where Ms Mohammed al-Qunun would receive asylum. Mr Surachate said the father had denied allegations that the family were abusing her physically and emotionally. ""He wanted to make sure that his daughter was safe... he told me that he wanted to take her home,"" he said.

'Deep concern' at super-gonorrhoea spread,"Two women in the UK have been infected with super-gonorrhoea, sparking deep concern from sexual health doctors. A European ""party destination"" is one line of inquiry and health officials are trying to contact subsequent sexual partners in the UK. Both women have since been cured of their infections, which were resistant to the main therapy. Public Health England encouraged people to use condoms with new and casual partners. One of the women appears to have been infected in mainland Europe. The other acquired the infection in the UK, but this case also has strong links to Europe. Dr Nick Phin, from Public Health England, said it was ""unfair"" to say super-gonorrhoea was currently circulating in the UK. But he told the BBC: ""It really brings home the message that these organisms will spread globally and you can get them in the UK."" The disease is caused by the bacteriumNeisseria gonorrhoeae. The infection is spread by unprotected vaginal, oral and anal sex. Symptoms can include a thick green or yellow discharge from sexual organs, pain when urinating and bleeding between periods. However, vaginal and rectal infections often have no symptoms. An untreated infection can lead to infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease and can be passed on to a child during pregnancy. There is no personal connection or established chain of sexual partners that links the two women. But both were infected with a version of gonorrhoea that was resistant to the first choice antibiotics - a combination of azithromycin and ceftriaxone. The cases were not related to the ""world's worst case"",which was detected in the UK in 2018 after a trip to South East Asia. Dr Phin said: ""We tried to follow up contacts as much as possible, but it can be difficult - particularly if people don't have details you can contact them with. ""It is possible there may be other cases, these are definitely the first two we have picked up and at the moment there are two."" The bacteriumNeisseria gonorrhoeahas rapidly developed resistance to new antibiotics. There have been growing levels of super-gonorrhoea around the world with similar cases reported in Japan, Canada and Australia. Dr Olwen Williams, president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said: ""We are deeply concerned by these new developments."" Paddy Horner, from the University of Bristol, told the BBC: ""We've got to wait and see what happens over next few months and whether more cases appear, but it is only a matter of time before it arrives in the UK. ""When people mix sexually it can spread quite rapidly and the concern is this could become established - if not from this infection, then one in the future. Follow James on Twitter,external.

Loans for forced marriage victims droppedThe Foreign Office had been criticised for making some women take out loans to pay for flights home.UK,"Victims of forced marriages overseas will no longer have to take out loans to pay for their return to the UK. It emerged last week in aninvestigation by The Times,externalthat those unable to cover flights, food and shelter were made to take out an emergency loan. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the policy was changing as victims ""may have endured particular suffering"". Existing loans will be written off and the women's passports returned. Victims asked to pay rescue costs Javid promises forced marriage crackdown Mr Hunt said the Foreign Office would try to get most repatriation costs covered by imposing so-called Forced Marriage Protection Orders on the people and families who arranged the forced marriage. But the small number who would have had to take out a loan will now have their repatriation costs paid for by the Foreign Office. Between 2016 and 2017, 82 people were repatriated with the support of the government's Forced Marriage Unit. Of those victims, between 8 and 12 had to take out loans. When the Times reported the practice, MPs condemned the loans as ""astonishing"" and ""immoral"". Mr Hunt said: ""Whereas the Foreign Office rightly expects that adult Britons who receive consular assistance will, in general, pay for their own travel home, victims of forced marriage may have endured particular suffering. ""They will often have travelled abroad against their wishes, or under false pretences."" Mr Hunt said the unit's staff ""carry out profoundly necessary work"" and added: ""Our treatment of vulnerable Britons abroad should always be guided by compassion."" Mr Hunt revealed the policy change in a letter to the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Tom Tugendhat.

"Trump escalates migrant wall stand-offIn his first TV address from the Oval Office, he calls the situation on the Mexico border a ""crisis"".US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump v Democrats on the border wall and government shutdown US President Donald Trump has made his first TV address to the nation from the Oval Office, escalating a stand-off with Congress that has led to an 19-day partial government shutdown. Mr Trump insisted on funding for his long-promised border wall with Mexico. However, he did not declare an emergency that would enable him to bypass the lower house of Congress now controlled by the opposition Democrats. Democratic leaders accused him of holding the American people hostage. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Read Trump and Democrats' speeches in full Fourteen ways the US shutdown is hurting The Republican president wants $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) to build a steel barrier, which would deliver on a key campaign pledge. But Democrats - who recently took control of the House of Representatives - are adamantly opposed to giving him the funds. The ongoing closure of a quarter of federal agencies is the second-longest in history, leaving hundreds of thousands of government workers unpaid. In an eight-minute live address on Tuesday night, he blamed the Democrats for the government shutdown. The situation at the border was, he said, a ""humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul"". Mexico, he said, would pay for the wall through a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is yet to be ratified. Economists have disputed this. Mexico has never agreed to pay for the wall. The president also said that 90% of heroin sold in the US comes from Mexico, though US government figures make clear all but a small percentage is smuggled through legal points of entry. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall Mr Trump correctly pointed out that Democrats including Mr Schumer had voted for a physical barrier to cover 700 miles (1,120km) in 2006. Mr Trump also cited cases of American citizens ""savagely murdered in cold blood"" by undocumented immigrants. On Thursday, he is due to visit the actual border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer demanded that Mr Trump end the shutdown. ""The fact is the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge,"" said Mrs Pelosi. How much of Trump's wall has been built? Six things that could topple Trump's border wall She accused President Trump of ""holding the American people hostage"" and ""manufacturing a crisis"". Mr Schumer accused Mr Trump of trying to ""govern by temper tantrum"" and appealing to ""fear, not facts"". Democrats argue that maintaining existing border fencing, using high-tech tools to scan vehicles at ports of entry and hiring more personnel would be cheaper and more effective than a wall. There were two audiences for Donald Trump's address to the nation on Tuesday night. The first was the American public, who polls indicate are generally uninterested in his border wall proposal, viewing the president as responsible for the government shutdown. The other was Republicans in Congress, who Mr Trump needs to keep in the fold if he is going to get anything out of this extended political confrontation. It seems unlikely that the president said anything that will move the needle with the public at large. The arguments were familiar - and some have already been debunked. The president has been saying there's a ""crisis"" at the border practically since he first started campaigning for the job. As for congressional Republicans, the speech was a demonstration that Mr Trump is going to use every arrow in his presidential quiver to get his wall. The president may have bought himself a bit more time for negotiations. It's just not clear what good it will do him. The border is 1,954 miles long, with about 650 miles of various types of fencing already in place through California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Fencing along the US-Mexican border at Ciudad Juarez Mr Trump says much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. Border authorities say work has begun on building improved security infrastructure, and money made available has largely been tied to existing barrier designs. Illegal border crossings fell from 1.6 million in 2000 to fewer than 400,000 last year, and research indicates that undocumented immigrants are much less likely to commit crime than native-born American citizens. On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been caught attempting to enter America illegally, and referred to the Mexican border as the ""most vulnerable point of entry"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said later that Ms Sanders had been referring to US government figures for 2017, when 3,775 known or suspected terrorists were prevented from entering America. What it feels like to cross the US border Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US A clarification by the US department for homeland security states that most of these interceptions occurred at airports,externalwhile adding, ""The number of terror-watchlisted individuals encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive..."" Only six immigrants on a federal watch list were stopped on the southern border in the first half of 2018. He is backed by most of his party, although a handful of moderate Republican senators have called for an end to the shutdown before the border wall issue is resolved. The sole Republican among the nine Congress members who represent southern border districts is, like his Democratic colleagues,opposed to Mr Trump's wall plan,external, CBS News reports. A new opinion poll suggests just over half of Americans (51%) blame President Trump for the government shutdown. However, 77% of Republicans say they support his refusal to approve a budget without taxpayer dollars for the US-Mexico border wall, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. In theory, it would allow the president to bypass the usual political process, and access military spending to fund his barrier. Analysts say such a declaration may still follow. But the president would be accused of usurping Congress's constitutional power of the purse, and the move would be bogged down in a quagmire of legal challenges.

Buyer 'willing to pay ÃÂ£100k for Banksy',"Steelworker Ian Lewis discovered the mural on the back of his garage one week before Christmas Someone is willing to pay about Â£100,000 for the Banksy on a garage in Port Talbot, an art dealer has said. Garage owner Ian Lewis has received several approaches from private collectors hoping to buy the piece. Art dealer and Banksy expert John Brandler said his client would offer a six-figure sum ""because it fits nicely into his collection"". Mr Lewis is understood to be meeting the Welsh Government and Arts Council of Wales to discuss other options. Earlier this week, he said howhe was struggling to cope with the pressureof owning such a sought-after piece of art. Neath Port Talbot council hasoffered to meet the full cost of ""loaning"" the graffiti to the public. The Welsh Government said on Wednesday afternoon it had offered to take over running security at the site on an interim basis to ""provide some breathing space for Mr Lewis as he considers some options for the future"". Banksy souvenirs on sale for visitors Mystery artist highlights potholes with penises Painting fetches world record Â£61m Banksy piece mistakenly painted over Volunteers estimate more than 20,000 people have visited the Banksy Mr Brandler said any offer his client was likely to make would be close to Â£100,000. ""He collects Banksy and he collects other street art, he collects a range of art,"" he added. ""He's got the grounds to display it from day one himself but I think he'd be more than willing to consider the social part of it as well."" The dealer said the collector would consider keeping the piece in Port Talbot for a few years as part of any deal. ""It could be a good way of drawing people to the centre of town, which would help the local businesses, because Port Talbot isn't generally considered a number one tourist destination, so it would help the local community in that way."" Art dealer John Brandler said people would complain if the Welsh Government spent Â£100,000 on the artwork as it was not going to ""hospitals, teachers, nurses"" Whatever the outcome, Mr Brandler said it would most likely cost ""tens of thousands of pounds"" to move the piece. One option could be to paint the back of the brickwork with a hard-setting resin, which would then allow part of the wall to be cut out without cracks appearing. Mr Brandler said if the mural had been painted on a similar-sized canvas, it could have fetched up to Â£500,000. ""The fact that this is so big means most people in the country couldn't look after this piece if you gave it to them - and that's what has happened unfortunately to the owner here,"" he added.

Kuenssberg: 'Plan B' timetable,"Theresa May heads to the Commons for Prime Minister's Questions The big debate is back on. As I wrote yesterday, in terms of Brexit itself, not much has changed - although Theresa May is that little bit more dug into Downing Street, weakened, but protected after that confidence vote last month. But the other factor that's different this time is, well, time itself. MPs to resume debate on PM's plan Reality Check: Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit? Stormont EU 'veto' plans to be published This whole process is on a deadline. Those who like to think of themselves as moderate are now feeling very radical about forcing the timetable, should the expected happen and the prime minister's plan be rejected by MPs next Tuesday. As things stand, if the government hasn't been able to get its deal agreed in Parliament, they have a couple of weeks to come back and reveal their plan B - the one that Mrs May has been unwilling to share (not surprising when Cabinet leaks like a sieve) and the one that some of her colleagues fear she doesn't actually have. There are moves afoot in the form of an amendment today that would force the government to come back with their alternative plan much more quickly - within three days of the likely defeat next week. After Prime Minister's Questions, MPs may well be able to ram that through to accelerate the process. If you are fed up of the government's handling and delays over Brexit, so are plenty of MPs. There is, inevitably, an issue before this idea can be voted on. Traditionally, this isn't the kind of motion that can be amended by backbenchers at this stage - in other words, only the government should normally be able to mess about with their plan before other people start weighing in. And if the Speaker allows a vote on this idea to take place, it is a big deal and would set a big precedent. But if a vote on this is not allowed or fails today, one former minister told me they were willing to go further, maybe even calling for a motion of contempt in the prime minister herself if she continues, as they see it, to try to keep Parliament as far out of the process as possible and to run the clock down as late as she possibly can. They told me: ""If I need to try to collapse the government, so be it."" These could be momentous days, but with Brexit, it may well not work out that way. PS: Of course, this latest wheeze reminds us how it wouldn't be a Brexit day if the big question wasn't proceeded by a row over parliamentary procedure. Those copies of Erskine May, the bible of the Parliamentary rules, must be getting pretty tatty from over use by now.

How Bercow's ruling could change Brexit,"John Bercow has been the Speaker for almost a decade Boom! After a humdrum, almost completely unrevealing Prime Minister's Questions, the Commons erupted over Speaker John Bercow's decision to allow an attempt to change the rules for the resumed ""meaningful vote"" debate. This is no mere technicality. The amendment proposed by former Attorney General Dominic Grieve would require the government to come back within three days, rather than 21, to debate the implications of not having a Brexit deal - if the prime minister's deal is indeed voted down next Tuesday. Under the previous rules, that debate would be kicked back to late February, with the Brexit clock ticking remorselessly in the background. The new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum, via a ""Norway option"" or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table. If a majority could be found for anything, it would not have the force of law - but it would at least indicate a policy which had the support of MPs. Fresh Brexit setback for May in MPs' vote Parliament live: MPs debate Brexit deal How voters want Brexit to be sorted out This is, in short, a massive ruling by the Speaker, made, apparently, against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler. I don't want to delve too deeply into the arcana of Business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the Crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. The decisions will come much faster, and potentially, those plotting an alternative course to the PM's would have more space in which to work. And it may also set a sweeping precedent allowing MPs far more grip over their debates, on Brexit and pretty much anything else. If such a precedent can be made to stick, it would be a huge blow against any government's accustomed control over the business of the Commons. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Anti-Brexit sticker belongs to my wife"" This is the biggest thing the Speaker has done, or is likely to do, easily eclipsing his decision to allow an extra amendment to the 2013 Queens' Speech, kicking off the Commons campaign which ultimately led to an EU Referendum becoming official Conservative policy. He got through a testing hour of points of order - which represents a victory of sorts, because he wasn't toppled by angry MPs in the way Michael Martin was a decade ago. But there will be consequences. For a start, a motion of no confidence in him now looks pretty certain. It may just languish in the ""Remaining Orders and Notices"" section of the Commons Order Paper, but it may take off and attract a critical mass of support from enraged Tories. Beyond that, the Speaker already has Conservatives openly accusing him of pro-Labour bias. Once unthinkable, that has now become a daily event, and may now become an hourly event. Criticism of other aspects of his running of Commons business (too many urgent questions, emergency debates and over-running PMQs) may become continual. Things are about to become very uncomfortable in the Chamber. Above all there's the bullying inquiry and the allegations levelled against the Speaker himself, which have been repeatedly denied, that he has bullied colleagues. This is an inquiry that should not be postponed to protect the Speaker, nor weaponised to destroy him; but it could well be. I suspect that, one way or another, Mr Bercow's turbulent tenure in the Commons chair is coming to an end. Perhaps in months rather than weeks, but not before the big Brexit votes (and it's not impossible that somewhere along the way, he might have to make this kind of ruling again). The basic question his would-be successors will have to answer is how much of the Bercow revolution in the way the Commons works should be scrapped - and how much should be retained?

'Right to repair' gathers forceEU and US states are to introduce laws helping people to mend appliances that break down.Science & Environment,"It is frustrating: you buy a new appliance then just after the warranty runs out, it gives up the ghost. You canât repair it and canât find anyone else to at a decent price, so it joins the global mountain of junk. Youâre forced to buy a replacement, which fuels climate change from the greenhouse gases released in the manufacturing process. But help is at hand, because citizens in the EU and parts of the USA will soon get a""right to repair"" - of sorts.,external This consists of a series of proposals from European environment ministers to force manufacturers to make goods that last longer and are easier to mend. The European proposals refer to lighting, televisions and large home appliances. At least 18 US states are considering similar laws,externalin a growing backlash against products which canât be prised apart because theyâre glued together, or which donât have a supply of spare parts, or repair instructions. European environment ministers have a series of proposals forcing manufacturers to make goods that last longer and are easier to mend. The European proposals refer to lighting, televisions and large home appliances. Plans for the EU Ecodesign Directive are complex and controversial. Manufacturers say the proposed rules on repairability are too strict and will stifle innovation. Consumer campaigners complain the EU Commission has allowed firms to keep control of the repair process by insisting some products are mended by professionals under the control of manufacturers. The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) said: âThis restricts the access of independent repairers to spare parts and information - and that limits the scope and affordability of repair services.â The EEB also wants other products like smart phones and printers included in the legislation. Green groups say legislation under way in Europe and the US represents progress towards saving carbon emissions and using resources more wisely. Libby Peake from the think tank Green Alliance told BBC News: âThe new rules are a definite improvement. We think they could have been better, but itâs good news that at last politicians are waking up to an issue that the public have recognised as a problem for a long time. The new rules will benefit the environment and save resources.â The policies have been driven by some arresting statistics. One study showed that between 2004 and 2012, the proportion of major household appliances that died within five years rose from 3.5% to 8.3%. An analysis of junked washing machines at a recycling centre showed that more than 10% were less than five years old. Another study estimates that because of the CO2 emitted in the manufacturing process, a long-lasting washing machine will generate over two decades 1.1 tonnes less CO2 than a short-lived model. Many lamps sold in Europe come with individual light bulbs that canât be replaced. So when one bulb packs in, the whole lamp has to be jettisoned. This is no simple question. Resource analysts say, as a rule of thumb, if your current appliance is old and has a very low energy efficiency rating, it can sometimes be better in terms of lifetime CO2 emissions to replace it with a new model rated A or AA. In most other cases it produces fewer emissions sticking with the old model. Thereâs another debate about how readily consumers should be allowed to mend appliances. The Right to Repair movement wants products that can be fully disassembled  and repaired with spare parts and advice supplied by the manufacturer. Some manufacturers fear that bungling DIY repairers will damage the machines theyâre trying to fix, and potentially render them dangerous. One industry group, Digital Europe, said: âWe understand the political ambition to integrate strict energy and resource efficiency aspects in Ecodesign, but we are concerned that some requirements are either unrealistic or provide no added value. âThe draft regulations limit market access, deviate from internationally-recognised best practices and compromise intellectual property.â What should I do with my broken kettle? The British government has welcomed the new rules and will almost certainly need to replicate them if UK firms are to export to Europe. Environment Minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey told BBC News resource efficiency was ""key to improving our productivity and making best use of precious resources"". ""That is why we are supporting measures in the new Ecodesign Directive product regulations to encourage repair and re-use of a range of products.â This is a very different tone from the one adopted by critics of the EUâs previous initiatives on energy efficiency. There were warnings thatforcing vacuum cleaners to use less powerwould leave Britainâs floors dirty. It transpired that the rules had forced manufacturers to makenew cleaners that cleaned equally well â but using less power,external, thanks to better floorhead design.

"UN 'considers Saudi woman a refugee'Rahaf al-Qunun, 18, refused to board a flight from Bangkok and barricaded herself in her hotel room.Australia","This video can not be played The #SaveRahaf campaign went viral after Rahaf started tweeting about her plight for asylum A Saudi woman who fled her family and refused to leave a Bangkok hotel has been declared a legitimate refugee by the UN, the Australian government says. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, refused to board a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait on Monday and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room. She said she had renounced Islam, which is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. The UN's refugee agency has referred her case to Australia for possible resettlement.

Ransom sought for magnate's missing wife,"Mrs Hagen disappeared from her home near Oslo on 31 October The wife of a Norwegian multi-millionaire businessman has been missing for months after being abducted, police have now confirmed. Anne-Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen, 68, disappeared from her home near Oslo on 31 October. The investigation has been continuing since then, police said, but was given ""a low profile"" because ""very serious threats have been made"". The kidnappers have demanded â¬9m ($10m; Â£8m), Norwegian media report. Broadcaster NRK said the ransom had been demanded in an equivalent amount of the cryptocurrency Monero - a digital currency similar to Bitcoin. Mrs Hagen is married to Tom Hagen, a businessman with an estimated fortune of 1.7bn Norwegian krone (â¬174m; Â£156m) made in the real estate and energy industries. Norway's financial magazine Kapital named him 172nd on its list of the country's wealthiest people. NRK says the couple live a ""secluded lifestyle"" in Lorenskog, east of Oslo, describing Tom Hagen as ""media-shy and private"". There has been no evidence since she disappeared that Mrs Hagen is safe, police say. ""As the case now stands, police have advised the family not to settle the claim,"" Tommy Broske, head of the investigation unit, said. News of the months-long disappearance was first reported by the newspaper Aftenposten early on Wednesday, which said it had known about the case for some time but had chosen not to publish details to protect Mrs Hagen. It said Mrs Hagen appeared to have been abducted from the bathroom of her home and that there had been ""limited dialogue"" with the alleged kidnappers over the internet. On Wednesday morning, as Aftenposten published its report, police put a cordon around the couple's home. Mr and Mrs Hagen live in an unassuming home at the end of a cul-de-sac In a statement, police said they had made the decision to make the case public despite threats from the kidnappers, in order to appeal for more information. The police statement said the main hypothesis ""has always been that the woman was abducted against her will"" and that ""extensive"" forensic work has been carried out at the home. ""Our goal is to find the woman alive and reunite her with the family,"" said Mr Broske. ""As in all serious criminal cases, time is an important factor, and we rely on tips... to help us find the missing woman."" Mr Hagen's lawyers have told news outlets he will not comment on the story at this time. Bitcoin exchange chief kidnapped in Kiev Bitcoin buster?

Stella & Dot 'to exit European market',"The firm was founded by Jessica Herrin in 2003 San Francisco-based jewellery firm Stella & Dot appears to be exiting the European market after seven years. A number of its UK sales reps, some of whom host parties to sell jewellery, have posted messages on social media. They say they have been messaged by the firm to say it has been hit by declines in the value of the pound and euro. Stella & Dot, founded in 2003, targets women looking for work and says it ""creates flexible entrepreneurial opportunities"". Messages have been posted online by the sales reps from chief executive and founder Jessica Herrin, who also founded WeddingChannel.com. Allow Twitter content?

In them, she says the once profitable European business is now operating at a loss. ""Sadly the market conditions in Europe have become very difficult. In the last few years the British pound and Euro have devalued against the US dollar by almost 20%, causing a deep decline in our margin, whilst at the same time operating costs have increased,"" she writes. It is of ""utmost importance"" to exit gracefully, she says, according to the messages posted by UK sales representatives. They will be able to continue to sell products and earn commissions until 7 April. She wrote the decision to close had been taken with a ""heavy heart"" and after ""countless deliberations"". Its sales reps - known as stylists - hold trunk shows, similar to Tupperware parties, and also sell though websites.  As well as jewellery, clothes and bags are available for sale. The company did not immediately respond to requests to comment on the social media posts. Laura McFadden, a mother of two young children from Bristol, became one of Stella & Dot's 3,000 UK stylists in August 2017, when her younger child started school. Initially, she became part of a team headed by a Stella & Dot mentor, before building up a small team of her own. Stylists buy jewellery and other products from Stella & Dot at a discount. The main way of selling to customers is through ""style sessions"", parties held in people's homes, where the stylists take along their wares, talk about them and give people a chance to try them. If someone wants to buy something the order is placed online at the party, directly with Stella & Dot. Laura describes stylists as a ""shop front"" for the company's products. Her commission was 25%-30% on sales before tax. In addition, if she and her team both did well in terms of sales, she could earn extra  commission from Stella & Dot as well. She says she made an average of Â£300-Â£400 a month through her involvement with the company. Some 80% of Stella & Dot's UK stylists have other jobs. Laura runs a bridal wear business from her home, but she says ""that extra Â£300-400 will be missed"". However, she says she feels ""more distraught"" for those women for whom the Stella and Dot was their main income. Laura found out the company was pulling out of Europe on Monday evening. Jessica Herrin held a conference call for UK stylists during which Ms Herrin was ""close to tears"", says Laura. ""Many of us feel very protective of Stella & Dot and feel they have looked after our interests in what is a very difficult time for them. ""Their main mission is to give women the opportunity to have a flexible income that fits into their lives and they are devastated that this has been taken away from their stylists. ""It will be really upsetting when it's gone from my life.""

'Right to repair' gathers force,"It is frustrating: you buy a new appliance then just after the warranty runs out, it gives up the ghost. You canât repair it and canât find anyone else to at a decent price, so it joins the global mountain of junk. Youâre forced to buy a replacement, which fuels climate change from the greenhouse gases released in the manufacturing process. But help is at hand, because citizens in the EU and parts of the USA will soon get a""right to repair"" - of sorts.,external This consists of a series of proposals from European environment ministers to force manufacturers to make goods that last longer and are easier to mend. The European proposals refer to lighting, televisions and large home appliances. At least 18 US states are considering similar laws,externalin a growing backlash against products which canât be prised apart because theyâre glued together, or which donât have a supply of spare parts, or repair instructions. European environment ministers have a series of proposals forcing manufacturers to make goods that last longer and are easier to mend. The European proposals refer to lighting, televisions and large home appliances. Plans for the EU Ecodesign Directive are complex and controversial. Manufacturers say the proposed rules on repairability are too strict and will stifle innovation. Consumer campaigners complain the EU Commission has allowed firms to keep control of the repair process by insisting some products are mended by professionals under the control of manufacturers. The European Environmental Bureau (EEB) said: âThis restricts the access of independent repairers to spare parts and information - and that limits the scope and affordability of repair services.â The EEB also wants other products like smart phones and printers included in the legislation. Green groups say legislation under way in Europe and the US represents progress towards saving carbon emissions and using resources more wisely. Libby Peake from the think tank Green Alliance told BBC News: âThe new rules are a definite improvement. We think they could have been better, but itâs good news that at last politicians are waking up to an issue that the public have recognised as a problem for a long time. The new rules will benefit the environment and save resources.â The policies have been driven by some arresting statistics. One study showed that between 2004 and 2012, the proportion of major household appliances that died within five years rose from 3.5% to 8.3%. An analysis of junked washing machines at a recycling centre showed that more than 10% were less than five years old. Another study estimates that because of the CO2 emitted in the manufacturing process, a long-lasting washing machine will generate over two decades 1.1 tonnes less CO2 than a short-lived model. Many lamps sold in Europe come with individual light bulbs that canât be replaced. So when one bulb packs in, the whole lamp has to be jettisoned. This is no simple question. Resource analysts say, as a rule of thumb, if your current appliance is old and has a very low energy efficiency rating, it can sometimes be better in terms of lifetime CO2 emissions to replace it with a new model rated A or AA. In most other cases it produces fewer emissions sticking with the old model. Thereâs another debate about how readily consumers should be allowed to mend appliances. The Right to Repair movement wants products that can be fully disassembled  and repaired with spare parts and advice supplied by the manufacturer. Some manufacturers fear that bungling DIY repairers will damage the machines theyâre trying to fix, and potentially render them dangerous. One industry group, Digital Europe, said: âWe understand the political ambition to integrate strict energy and resource efficiency aspects in Ecodesign, but we are concerned that some requirements are either unrealistic or provide no added value. âThe draft regulations limit market access, deviate from internationally-recognised best practices and compromise intellectual property.â What should I do with my broken kettle? The British government has welcomed the new rules and will almost certainly need to replicate them if UK firms are to export to Europe. Environment Minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey told BBC News resource efficiency was ""key to improving our productivity and making best use of precious resources"". ""That is why we are supporting measures in the new Ecodesign Directive product regulations to encourage repair and re-use of a range of products.â This is a very different tone from the one adopted by critics of the EUâs previous initiatives on energy efficiency. There were warnings thatforcing vacuum cleaners to use less powerwould leave Britainâs floors dirty. It transpired that the rules had forced manufacturers to makenew cleaners that cleaned equally well â but using less power,external, thanks to better floorhead design.

CES: 'Award-winning' sex toy banned,"The Ose robot massager has been banned from CES A sex toy designed for women has been banned from the technology show CES. Lora DiCarlo said it had been invited to display its robotic Ose vibrator at CES, after winning an innovation award. CES organiser the Consumer Technology Association, which granted the award, said it had included the device by mistake and could withdraw any immoral or obscene entry at any time. Lora DiCarlo chief executive Lora Haddock said the CES and CTA had a history of gender bias. In a statement toThe Next Web,external, the CTA said: ""The product does not fit into any of our existing product categories and should not have been accepted. ""We have apologised to the company for our mistake."" But, in a statement on theLora DiCarlo website,external, Ms Haddock cites several examples of other female-oriented products included in the award category the vibrator was in. ""Two robotic vacuum cleaners, one robotic skateboard, four children's toys, one shopping companion robot - looks like all of women's interests are covered, right?"" she said. ""Ose clearly fits the robotics and drone category - and CTA's own expert judges agree."" The product had been designed in partnership with a robotics laboratory at Oregon State University and had eight patents pending for ""robotics, biomimicry, and engineering feats"", Ms Haddock said. ""We firmly believe that women, non-binary, gender non-conforming, and LGBTQI folks should be vocally claiming our space in pleasure and tech,"" she said. Allow Twitter content?

Kate Bush: 'I'm not a Tory supporter',"The star rarely makes public statements Kate Bush has written a statement to clarify she does not support the Conservative party, two years after praising Theresa May in an interview. The star was speaking to Canadian websiteMacleans,externalin 2016 when she was asked about Hilary Clinton and ""the fear of women's power"". In response, she said it was ""great to have a woman in charge"" of the UK. ""I think it's the best thing that's happened to us in a long time,"" she said of May's ascension to power. ""I actually really like her and think she's wonderful. She's a very intelligent woman but I don't see much to fear."" Her comments were interpreted at the time as anendorsement of Brexit,externalandconservative policy.,external Kate Bush says Theresa May is 'wonderful' But writing on her website, Bush said her comments were quoted ""out of context"" and that she found the experience ""deeply frustrating"". She continued,external: ""At the time I discussed the idea of responding to it with close friends and we all agreed it was best to let it go."" However, the quote continued to resurface - most recently in coverage of her remastered back catalogue, and a book of her lyrics, which was published last month, prompting her to issue a clarification. ""My response to the interviewer was not meant to be political but rather was in the defence of women in power,"" she said. ""I felt he was putting a really negative slant on powerful women, referring to a witch hunt involving Hillary Clinton. In response I said that we had a woman in charge of our country, and that I felt it was a good thing to have women in power. ""I should have been clearer when I then said it was the best thing that had happened to us for a long time - because I greatly disliked the behaviour of the previous PM [David Cameron], who at that point I felt had abandoned us and everybody felt angry and let down."" She added that the article ""could make it seem like I am a Tory supporter, which I want to make clear I am not"". The star rarely gives interviews and talks about politics even less frequently.

But Democrats - who recently took control of the House of Representatives - are adamantly opposed to giving him the funds. The ongoing closure of a quarter of federal agencies is the second-longest in history, leaving hundreds of thousands of government workers unpaid. In an eight-minute live address on Tuesday night, he blamed the Democrats for the government shutdown. The situation at the border was, he said, a ""humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul"". Mexico, he said, would pay for the wall through a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is yet to be ratified. Economists have disputed this. Mexico has never agreed to pay for the wall. The president also said that 90% of heroin sold in the US comes from Mexico, though US government figures make clear all but a small percentage is smuggled through legal points of entry. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall Mr Trump correctly pointed out that Democrats including Mr Schumer had voted for a physical barrier to cover 700 miles (1,120km) in 2006. Mr Trump also cited cases of American citizens ""savagely murdered in cold blood"" by undocumented immigrants. On Thursday, he is due to visit the actual border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer demanded that Mr Trump end the shutdown. ""The fact is the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge,"" said Mrs Pelosi. How much of Trump's wall has been built? Six things that could topple Trump's border wall She accused President Trump of ""holding the American people hostage"" and ""manufacturing a crisis"". Mr Schumer accused Mr Trump of trying to ""govern by temper tantrum"" and appealing to ""fear, not facts"". Democrats argue that maintaining existing border fencing, using high-tech tools to scan vehicles at ports of entry and hiring more personnel would be cheaper and more effective than a wall. There were two audiences for Donald Trump's address to the nation on Tuesday night. The first was the American public, who polls indicate are generally uninterested in his border wall proposal, viewing the president as responsible for the government shutdown. The other was Republicans in Congress, who Mr Trump needs to keep in the fold if he is going to get anything out of this extended political confrontation. It seems unlikely that the president said anything that will move the needle with the public at large. The arguments were familiar - and some have already been debunked. The president has been saying there's a ""crisis"" at the border practically since he first started campaigning for the job. As for congressional Republicans, the speech was a demonstration that Mr Trump is going to use every arrow in his presidential quiver to get his wall. The president may have bought himself a bit more time for negotiations. It's just not clear what good it will do him. The border is 1,954 miles long, with about 650 miles of various types of fencing already in place through California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Fencing along the US-Mexican border at Ciudad Juarez Mr Trump says much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. Border authorities say work has begun on building improved security infrastructure, and money made available has largely been tied to existing barrier designs. Illegal border crossings fell from 1.6 million in 2000 to fewer than 400,000 last year, and research indicates that undocumented immigrants are much less likely to commit crime than native-born American citizens. On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been caught attempting to enter America illegally, and referred to the Mexican border as the ""most vulnerable point of entry"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said later that Ms Sanders had been referring to US government figures for 2017, when 3,775 known or suspected terrorists were prevented from entering America. What it feels like to cross the US border Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US A clarification by the US department for homeland security states that most of these interceptions occurred at airports,externalwhile adding, ""The number of terror-watchlisted individuals encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive..."" Only six immigrants on a federal watch list were stopped on the southern border in the first half of 2018. He is backed by most of his party, although a handful of moderate Republican senators have called for an end to the shutdown before the border wall issue is resolved. The sole Republican among the nine Congress members who represent southern border districts is, like his Democratic colleagues,opposed to Mr Trump's wall plan,external, CBS News reports. A new opinion poll suggests just over half of Americans (51%) blame President Trump for the government shutdown. However, 77% of Republicans say they support his refusal to approve a budget without taxpayer dollars for the US-Mexico border wall, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. In theory, it would allow the president to bypass the usual political process, and access military spending to fund his barrier. Analysts say such a declaration may still follow. But the president would be accused of usurping Congress's constitutional power of the purse, and the move would be bogged down in a quagmire of legal challenges.

MPs' anger at Bercow Brexit vote ruling,"The government lost by 11 votes Rebel Conservative MPs have joined forces with Labour to inflict a fresh blow on Theresa May's government in a Commons Brexit vote. It means the government will have to come up with revised plans within three days if Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week. It could also open the door to alternatives, such as a referendum. No 10 said Mrs May's deal was in the national interest but if MPs disagreed, the government would ""respond quickly"". The setback for the PM came as MPs started five days of debate on the withdrawal agreement with the EU, and the framework for future relations, ahead of the meaningful vote next Tuesday. The government was expecting to have 21 days to come up with a ""plan B"" for Brexit if, as widely expected, Mrs May's deal is voted down. How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Bercow Brexit ruling 'extremely concerning' Brexit: A really simple guide But MPs backed calls for it to respond within three working Parliamentary days, a deadline likely to fall on Monday 21 January. Theresa May lost by 11 votes, with 297 MPs siding with the government and 308 against. Among those voting against were 17 Conservatives, including former ministers Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah and Jo Johnson who want to see another referendum to decide whether the UK should leave or not.

Please upgrade your browser to view this interactive Enter a postcode, or the name or constituency of your MP If you can't see the look-up click here,external. Former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who led the rebellion, said he hoped for a ""serious dialogue"" between government and Parliament on alternatives to Mrs May's deal to avert a possible crisis. He told ITV's Peston that it would be up to Mrs May to decide what she wanted to do if her deal was rejected, but MPs would be able to vote on any motion she put forward within seven days. While the PM would have the right to say she wanted the Commons to re-consider her deal, he said MPs could amend the motion, telling her in effect ""we want you to do something else"". Fellow rebel Sarah Wollaston said she and other MPs opposed to a no-deal exit were engaged in a ""guerrilla campaign"" to show that it would never get the consent of Parliament. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Anti-Brexit sticker belongs to my wife"" By BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy The new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum, via a ""Norway option"" or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table. If a majority could be found for anything, it would not have the force of law - but it would at least indicate a policy which had the support of MPs. This is, in short, a massive ruling by the Speaker, made, apparently, against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler. I don't want to delve too deeply into the arcana of Business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the Crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. Read Mark's full blog But Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who favours leaving without a withdrawal agreement, said it would not stop the UK exiting on 29 March. ""It merely requires a motion to be tabled not even debated,"" he said. And prisons minister Rory Stewart, who backs the PM's deal, said requiring Mrs May to restart complex negotiations with the EU and come back with changes in three days, was ""unreasonable"". He said Mr Grieve was ""trying to provide more support for what he wants, which is a second referendum"". Downing Street said it would consider the repercussions of Wednesday's defeat but its intention had always been to ""provide certainty"" as soon as possible. Labour has said it will table a motion of no confidence in the government if Mrs May's deal is voted down. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to ""take control of what happens next"" and suggested delaying the date of the UK's exit beyond 29 March might be ""inevitable"". He warned the UK's options were narrowing given the need to avoid, at all costs, a no-deal exit which he claimed was ""simply not viable for practical reasons"". Allow Twitter content?

Commons Speaker John Bercow faced an angry backlash from some Conservative MPs over his decision to allow MPs to vote on the issue. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. The MPs claim Mr Bercow broke Commons rules and ignored the advice of his own clerks. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom was among MPs to challenge his ruling in a series of points of order after Prime Minister's Questions. They argued that the business motion, tabled by the government, was not amendable and said the Speaker was breaking with precedent. Mr Bercow said he had made an ""honest judgement"" after consulting his clerks but rejected calls from Ms Leadsom to publish the advice he had received. He insisted he was ""not setting himself up against the government but championing the rights of the House of Commons"", adding that if people wanted to vote against the amendment they could. But a number of Tory MPs said the decision cast doubt on Mr Bercow's impartiality, with Crispin Blunt questioning whether he remained a ""neutral referee of our affairs"". The Commons defeat was the second in the space of 24 hours for the government on Brexit. On Tuesday, MPs, headed by former Tory ministers Mr Grieve and Oliver Letwin, defied the government on an amendment aimed at making it more difficult to leave the EU without a deal. The clashes in the Commons came as the PM, who cancelled a vote on her deal last month at the last minute to avoid a humiliating defeat, launched a fresh push to convince MPs. She is hopingnew proposals on Northern Ireland,externalwill change enough MPs' minds to save the deal. Stormont EU 'veto' proposals published Under the plans, the Northern Ireland Assembly would have a say on new EU rules if the backstop plan to prevent physical checks on the Irish border comes into force after Brexit. But the Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, have already rejected the so-called ""Stormont lock"" plans as ""cosmetic"" and ""meaningless"". Ministers have also accepted calls for MPs to be able to vote next year on alternatives to activating the backstop, such as extending the proposed 21-month transition period.

Is there a border crisis?,"The number of migrants detained in May was the highest since 2006 Congress approved a humanitarian aid plan for migrants at the US-Mexico border, but the political crisis over how to deal with migrants attempting to reach the US continues. Migrants continue to die en route to the border, including a Salvadorean father and daughter whose bodies were photographed lying face down in a river near the border.The photo has led to condemnation. President Donald Trump has repeatedly used the term ""invasion"" to describe the situation on the US southern border. In February he declared a ""national emergency"" in order to force through funding for his planned border wall. However his opponents say his government has created a ""manufactured crisis"". Trump wall - all you need to know about US border in seven charts So what's really happening? The number of border apprehensions dropped by 28% in June, according to US authorities. The decline follows a record number of apprehensions between ports of entry in May - the highest in over a decade. Drops in migrations are typical during the summer months, where temperatures can soar above 32C, but this June saw a sharper decline than previous years. Trump administration officials have attributed the decrease to new policies with Mexico to curb migration. It's impossible to say for certain, but US Border Patrol says it has made 688,375 southwest border apprehensions since October 2018. The previous US fiscal year there were 303,916, according to US Customs and Border Protection (CBP). The number fell dramatically in President Trump's first year but rose again last year. The number of migrants apprehended at the border surged in May to the highest level since 2006, with 132,887 detained - including 11,507 unaccompanied children. It was the first time that detentions had exceeded 100,000 since April 2007. The UN Missing Migrants project reports that 170 migrants have died or are missing on the US-Mexico border so far in 2019 - including 13 children. Border Patrol figures show that 283 died last year, but human rights activists say the number is likely to be higher. Looking at the wider picture, until numbers rose this spring, there has been a sharp fall in the number of people arrested in the last 18 years. But even before the 2019 spike, when migration numbers were in fact at historic lows, Mr Trump described the situation on the border as a national security crisis. This year's surge in migration is significant, if not the highest ever. And changing migrant demographics have undoubtedly overwhelmed US agencies - but the situation along the border is a different kind of crisis than what the president described for years. Apprehension numbers released by the CBP include asylum seekers (a person who applies for refugee status at a US port of entry or from within the country). In fiscal year 2018, 92,959 people were deemed to have made claims of credible fear"" and asked for asylum at the border. That's a pretty big jump from fiscal year 2017, when 55,584 claims were made. This video can not be played Justice department says toothbrush and soap 'not required' for migrants Kate Jastram, senior staff attorney for the Center for Gender and Refugee Studies at the University of California Hastings College of the Law, says that families fleeing violence in Central America began to make up a much larger part of border crossings beginning in 2014. She says that has more to do with conditions in those countries than any immigration policy implemented by the Trump administration. ""Single men from Mexico were by and large not seeking asylum, they were looking for work,"" says Jastram. ""[Now] we have families and children specifically seeking protection."" In November 2018,a caravan of 7,000 migrants arrived at the US-Mexico border, many claiming to be fleeing violence in countries like Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador. Mr Trump labelled the caravan an ""invasion"". Overall, the rate of asylum denials is on the rise in the US and has been forthe past six years,external. President Trump and his administration have tried a variety of deterrent measures affecting both illegal entrants and asylum seekers in recent years. They are: asylum seekers caught crossing illegally must wait across the border in Mexico for adjudication border officials have decreased the number of asylum cases they process each day, a strategy called ""metering"" last June, then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced that claims of domestic and gang violence would no longer qualify as grounds for asylum in the US - this was defeated in court most controversially, in spring, thousands of migrant children were separated from their parents at the border as a part of a ""zero tolerance policy"" that prosecuted anyone found crossing illegally ""This situation is child abuse,"" Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi said of the government's policy. ""It is an atrocity that violates every value we have, not only as Americans, but as moral beings.""

Who decided to take away children at the US border? Illegal border crossings are not limited to the southern border - in 2017, for example, there were also 3,027 illegal apprehensions along the Canadian border and 3,588 from the coastal border. While cross-border migrants often make headlines, the largest number of illegal migrants settling in the US each year is those who stay in the country after their visas expire. This has been the case since 2007, official statistics say. This video can not be played What happens if Mexico doesn't stem the migrant flow? In 2016, there were a total of 739,478 overstays, compared to 563,204 illegal border crossings. It's also important to note that, according to the Pew Research Center, overallthe number of immigrants living in the US illegally has actually declined since 2007,external, in large part due to a dip in the number of people coming from Mexico. Apprehensions at the south-western border peaked at 1.64 million in 2000. Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US What's the state of illegal immigration in US? In total, Pew estimates that in 2017 there were 10.5 million unauthorised immigrants living in the US.

Ways US shutdown is hurting,"A woman wearing a ""hungry hostage"" headband protests on Capitol Hill President Donald Trump's standoff with Democrats over funding for his proposed border wall has resulted in the longest government shutdown in US history. How has it affected American life so far? Mr Trump insists the government will stay closed until he gets that funding, and as the shutdown enters day 34, Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have remained equally firm that there will be no congressional funding for a wall. A quarter of the federal government has been unfunded since 22 December, leaving 800,000 employees without pay. Here is some of the misery Washington's political gridlock is inflicting on the nation at large. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, who oversee airport security, have been calling in sick or quitting as the shutdown drags on, though the agency insists standards have not been compromised. Flight traffic controllers are alsofeeling the effects of the shutdown,external, working long shifts to cope with with record low numbers of fully-certified staff to handle over 43,000 daily flights. On Wednesday, the National Air Traffic Controllers Association the Air Line Pilots Association, and the Association of Flight Attendants released a bleak joint statement. ""We cannot even calculate the level of risk currently at play, nor predict the point at which the entire system will break. It is unprecedented."" President Sara Nelson of the flight attendant's association has alsocalled for a general nationwide worker's strike,externalto end the shutdown. Resources at the Federal Bureau of Investigation are quickly running out, according to a new report comprised of agent stories from across the nation.

US shutdown leaves websites insecure The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has suspended all non-essential work, causing nationwide concerns over unsafe food as most inspections have stopped. FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb on Wednesday said the agency was working to ensure ""high risk"" facility checks continue. He said about one third of the FDA's food inspections are considered high risk, looking at goods like cheese, fresh produce and seafood. ""It's not business as usual, and we are not doing all the things we would do under normal circumstances,"" Mr Gottliebtold NBC News,external.

"Moped crash boy, 14, stabbed to death","Jaden Moodie lived in the area with his mother, police said A 14-year-old boy has been stabbed to death by attackers who knocked him off a moped, in what police believe was a targeted attack. Jaden Moodie was found wounded in Bickley Road, Waltham Forest, at 18:30 GMT on Tuesday. Detectives believe the moped had been involved in a crash with a car, after which three men got out the vehicle, stabbed the teenager and drove off. He died at the scene. No arrests have been made and a cordon is in place. Jaden, who police said lived in the area with his mother, is believed to be the youngest victim to die on London's streets in the past year. There were 132 homicides in 2018, the highest total since 2008. There were 132 homicides in 2018, the highest total since 2008 Jaden's godmother described him as ""full of life, fun loving and a ray of sunshine"". Zoe Grant, from Nottingham, said the teenager and his mother had recently moved to London from the East Midlands to be closer to some of his family. ""He was a beautiful boy, so intelligent and had everything to live for,"" she said. ""He went to London and then this happens, it's just so unfair. The violence in London is out of hand, it's not right."" Marcellus Baz, who was Jaden's youth worker when he lived in Nottingham, said he found the news of the schoolboy's death ""absolutely shocking"". ""He was a polite kid, he was really respectful. He's a good kid,"" he said. Police are appealing for witnesses The minimum age to drive a moped in the UK is 16 Det Ch Insp Larry Smith, of the Metropolitan Police, said: ""Everything that we have learned about this attack so far indicates it was targeted and intent on lethal force from the outset. ""We are doing everything we can to catch those who carried out this cowardly attack and bring them to justice."" A section 60 order has been put in place, allowing officers to search anyone in the vicinity of the scene for weapons. Motives and circumstances behind killings varied - as did the age and gender of the victims. Faces of London's dead: All the victims of 2018 How the capital's bloody year unfolded Police have not said whether they believe the murder was gang-related but all lines of inquiry remain open. Officers are trying to trace the vehicle used in the attack, which is believed to be a black Mercedes B Class with extensive frontal damage. Floral tributes were left on Lea Bridge Road, near the scene of the crime Kerry-Ann Honeygahn said she ""wasn't surprised"" to hear of the latest violence Kerry-Ann Honeygahn told the BBC how a few weeks ago, her friend took a knife away from the boy. The 38-year-old youth mentor said she ""wasn't surprised"" to hear of the violence. ""Another young life has been taken on the streets of London."" There were 132 homicides in 2018, the highest total since 2008 Around the corner from the crime scene is a narrow street with several garages. Mechanics there say the boy used to come by for a chat, riding on a moped with another boy - thought to be either his friend or his brother. Garage owner Anthony Anderson said he felt like a father figure to the ""nice little boy"" and was ""very sad"" to hear he had died. ""I used to encourage him to go to school, to stay out of trouble. He used to chat to me about growing up."" The 56-year-old, who has two children and worries ""what will happen next"", believes the killing was gang-related. Anthony Anderson said he was like a father figure to the boy On Wednesday, just streets away from the scene of the fatal stabbing, a man had his face slashed in an attack. Police were called at 13:28 to reports of a man being chased by a group of youths on St Stephen's Close - about half a mile from the cordon. Officers found a man with a wound to his face in nearby Bromley Road and he was taken to hospital, police said. A Met spokesman said no one had been arrested and officers were trying to establish if this was the man who was being chased. Officers in plain clothes attended the scene of a second violent attack not far from the Bickley Road crime scene One resident claimed the area was linked to an ongoing postcode war Of the 132 murders in 2018, 77 were stabbings, compared to 80 the year before. In April,the Met set up a Â£15m violent crime taskforce, which in its first six months made 1,361 arrests, seized 340 knives, and recovered 258 offensive weapons. But has been the subject of criticism and described as""just a sticking plaster"". Met commissioner Cressida Dick told Radio 4's Today Programme on 27 December that knife crime in London had ""levelled off"", praising the ""Herculean effort"" of officers. London mayor Sadiq Khan, who said he was ""greatly saddened"" by the latest death, also set up the Violence Reduction Unit with Â£500,000 of funding in September to ""treat violence like a disease"". Stella Creasy, the MP for Walthamstow, said she was ""devastated"" by the news from her constituency, describing it as a ""terrible, horrific event"". Waltham Forest Council leader, Clare Coghill, called for those with information to come forward, warning that ""to stay silent is to support murderers"". The Waltham Forest borough has had problems with gang crime and the local authority has spent Â£3 million on a four-year prevention programme. It commissioned a report,published last summer,,externalwhich found that so-called county lines drug gangs - which often target children and vulnerable youngsters - were operating in the area.

MP cleared of election expenses fraudConservative MP Craig Mackinlay was accused of falsifying declarations in the 2015 General Election.Kent,"This video can not be played Craig Mackinlay thanked his South Thanet constituents for standing by him Conservative politician Craig Mackinlay has been cleared of knowingly falsifying election expenses. The MP for South Thanet had denied making false declarations during his 2015 campaign, when he beat then-UKIP leader Nigel Farage to the seat. Mr Mackinlay, 52, had been accused of failing to declare more than Â£60,000 spent on staffing, hotels and adverts. Tory party employee Marion Little, 63, was given a suspended sentence after being found guilty of two charges. Little, who had effectively run the 2015 election campaign, was found guilty of two counts of encouraging or assisting an offence, but cleared of a third. The long-time Tory party member, from Ware, Hertfordshire, had ""acted dishonestly by preparing returns she knew were not completed nor accurate,"" Judge Mr Justice Edis said. He described Little as being ""a senior and respected employee of the Conservative Party at its Central Headquarters and has been so for many years"", and said her actions were a ""sustained and deliberate course of conduct"". The judge said Little had presented falsified documents to Mr Mackinlay and Mr Gray for signing which ""they did so in good faith not knowing what she had done"". ""No-one can know whether her misconduct had any effect on the outcome of that election but she plainly intended that it would. ""She was the author and origin of this falsehood."" Handing her a nine-month sentence, suspended for two years, the judge said Little had been ""carried away by her conviction"" that defeating Mr Farage was an ""overwhelmingly important political objective"". He said the only reason she was not being given a custodial sentence was because she was caring for her husband, who is terminally ill. Jurors at Southwark Crown Court had deliberated for more than 53 hours before reaching their verdicts. Marion Little told the court she would never falsify documents Mr Mackinlay responded on Twitter, simply writing #notguilty. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prosecutor Michelle Nelson told jurors South Thanet would usually have been seen as a safe seat, but Mr Farage's run as UKIP candidate had been regarded as the chance to ""knock him out"" of politics. Mr Mackinlay told the court the Conservative Party HQ had ""recognised the fear of Farage"" and offered to pay for a campaign manager. He said the South Thanet seat would be ""looked at and pored over very carefully"" and said he was told during the 2015 campaign that spending was ""perilously close"" to the limit. The prosecution's case centred around claims some costs for activists and party workers were recorded as national rather than local election expenses, to ensure spending limits weren't breached. Declared spending came in under the Â£52,000 constituency limit, but prosecutors claimed more than Â£60,000 went undeclared. Mr Mackinlay eventually won the seat, in whatthe court previously heard was a ""nasty"" election. The MP's agent,Nathan Gray, was acquitted on 13 December. Mr Gray, 29, of Hawkhurst in Kent had faced one count of making a false election expenses declaration. Mr Mackinlay said: ""It's been nearly three years of pure hell. This has been a really tough time. ""There are questions that need to be asked and the Electoral Commission needs to get together with political parties to make sure that never again a candidate or an agent can be accused of these things."" By Helen Catt, political editor, BBC News South East This trial has given a rare glimpse behind the rosettes, the posters and the doorstep handshakes into the party machines behind election campaigns. In this case, it's not been a pleasant one. A tale of a ""win at any cost"" mentality that led to spending laws being deliberately breached and then hidden by a party official from the Conservatives' own candidate and his election agent. Craig Mackinlay described himself as a ""small cog in a big gearbox"" but it was he who ended up seeing his job, his reputation and even his freedom in jeopardy. That has made other MPs nervous. The 2015 election in South Thanet was held under a unique set of circumstances but could the fallout force a rethink of the way election campaigns are conducted in future? A spokesman for the Conservative Party said while being ""disappointed"" with Little's conviction the case had ""highlighted just how unclear and fragmented electoral law was in 2015"". He said: ""There is clearly a need for greater clarity and guidance on the law. We will take further legal advice and continue to meet with the Electoral Commission to seek this."" Mr Farage said: ""This verdict shows that there are no election rules for the big parties in British politics, they can wilfully overspend without any consequences."" The Election Commission has welcomed Little's conviction. A spokesman said: ""It is vital that offences under electoral law are properly investigated, including by the police when appropriate. ""This outcome should serve as a deterrent to anyone who would seek to circumvent the proper reporting of campaign spending."" He said the commission was continuing to call for for electoral law to be reviewed. Correction 1 February 2019: We previously reported Craig Mackinlay was cleared of ""falsifying election expenses"". We have changed this to ""knowingly falsifying election expenses"". We also previously said Marion Little was a ""party activist"", however, the judge described her as ""a senior and respected employee of the Conservative Party"", so we have amended our story to reflect that.

"Museum in row over Great Pyramid stoneThe Museum of Scotland is confident it has permission to exhibit a casing stone from an Egyptian pyramid.Edinburgh, Fife & East Scotland","The museum claims the stone is the only casing stone from the Great Pyramid of Giza to be displayed outside Egypt The Museum of Scotland has been caught up in a row about whether it has permission to exhibit a casing stone from an Egyptian pyramid. It was announced last weekthat a block of limestone from the Great Pyramid of Giza was to go on display in Edinburgh. Egypt's Antiquities Repatriation Department has since cast doubt over its authenticity and documentation. However, the museum has insisted that a British engineer was given permission to take the stone in 1872. The pyramid stone is due to go on public display for the first time next month as the centrepiece of an exhibition on ancient Egypt in Edinburgh. But Shabaan Abdel Gawwad, supervisor-general of Egypt's Antiquities Repatriation Department, has said he wants an official team to visit Scotland, asking for a certificate of possession and export documents. He said measures would be taken to repatriate any artefacts found to have been illegally smuggled out of his country. Mr Abdel Gawwad also said he did not believe the stone was from the Great Pyramid of Giza, as the museum claims. He said: ""The ministry of antiquities has addressed the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take necessary measures to contact Scottish authorities and the museum asking for a certificate of possession and export documents for the casing stone and how it left Egypt and when the museum obtained it. ""We want to see all certificates of possession for other Egyptian artefacts due to be exhibited in the museum as well. ""The Egyptian law on protection of monuments no.117 for 1983 stipulates that trading or exporting antiquities is a crime. ""If it's proven that this block or any other artefact were found to have been illegally smuggled, necessary measures will be taken to repatriate them."" An illustration by Charles Piazzi Smyth who arranged for the casing stone to come to the UK Officials at the museum, in Edinburgh's Chambers Street, told the BBC Scotland news website the casing stone came from the Great Pyramid of Giza, and was found by British engineer Waynman Dixon, working on behalf of the Astronomer Royal of Scotland, Charles Piazzi Smyth. He uncovered it in a rubble heap from road works being undertaken by the Egyptian government in 1869. A spokeswoman for National Museums Scotland said: ""In 1865 Piazzi Smyth had initiated a programme of research including the first largely accurate survey of the Great Pyramid. ""In doing so, he had the official permission of the Viceroy of Egypt and the assistance of the Egyptian Antiquities Service. ""The stone was brought to the UK by Waynman Dixon in 1872 and transported to Charles Piazzi Smyth in Edinburgh. ""After reviewing all the documentary evidence we hold, we are confident that the appropriate permissions and documentation were obtained, in line with common practice at the time."" It hasbeen reported in Egypt that the casing stone could not be from the Great Pyramid of Giza,externalbecause it is made of the wrong material. Egyptian experts said that the outer layer of the pyramid was made of granite, like the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure, and not of limestone as the National Museum of Scotland claims the casing stone is made from. However, a museum spokeswoman added: ""The Great Pyramid was originally clad in fine Tura limestone. ""Even today, some limestone casing stones still remain at the base of the pyramid. ""The block in our collections was discovered at the foot of the Great Pyramid, and we are confident that it is a casing stone from it."" Built for King Khufu and dating about 2589-2566 BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex. The museum said the stone was one of the few surviving casing stones from the Great Pyramid and will be displayed in a new, permanent gallery at the museum called Ancient Egypt Rediscovered. It forms the centrepiece of the Museum of Scotland's display about the design and construction of pyramids in ancient Egypt, and will be the only display of its kind in the UK when it goes on show on 8 February.

New prisons to have no bars on windows,"Traditional prison window bars are to be phased out in England and Wales, under Ministry of Justice (MoJ) plans. New jails will instead be fitted with toughened glass and air vents. Ministers said the windows would be hard to break and better for stopping prisoners ""accessing contraband"". Campaigners said bars were ""yesterday's technology"" and windows would provide a more normal environment in which people would take responsibility for their own lives. But ex-prisoner turned charity worker and author, Leroy Smith, described the changes as ""a pointless gesture"" - adding that prisoners needed better education and training. ""Otherwise nothing is going to change,"" he said. Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons? Ministers under fire over 'squalid' jail Prison refers to inmates as 'residents' Bars on prison cell windows are used in most jails, including the most modern buildings such as Berwyn, north Wales and Oakwood, Wolverhampton. The MoJ has promised to replace old and expensive prison accommodation with 10,000 ""modern and safe"" spaces. And the first new prisons are expected to be built on the site of former jails at Wellingborough, Northamptonshire and Glen Parva, Leicestershire in 2021 and 2022 respectively. Ministers also want to build new prisons in south Wales and near HMP Full Sutton, Yorkshire, in addition to redeveloping existing prisons at Hindley, Greater Manchester and Rochester, Kent. A Prison Service spokesperson said: ""Secure, sealed windows with toughened glass and narrow vents will be used in all cells in future prisons. ""These windows are difficult to break, making them more effective in stopping prisoners from accessing contraband."" Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust said: ""A normal environment in which people take responsibility for as much of their own lives as possible is preparation for successful release. ""Bars in windows is yesterday's technology."" The move comes as researchers begin a study to examine the impact of a more relaxed and humane prison by examining changes at HMP Berwyn. There, prisoners are referred to as men, housed in communities rather than blocks, and locked up in ""rooms"" rather than cells. There have also been attempts at the prison to fill empty wall space with photos of the local Welsh landscape. Professor Yvonne Jewkes from the University of Bath said the changes were ""relatively simple"" but could have ""an important effect when it comes to making prisoners feel that they are treated with respect and dignity"". The Â£600,000 study has been funded by the Economic and Social Research Council. Prison refers to inmates as 'residents' Reality Check: What's the problem with prisons?

Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says the PM should strike 29 March as Brexit day from UK law if her deal is voted down. House of CommonsParliament With the completion of the debate on Brexit, the Commons adjourns until next week. On Monday, the Brexit debate continues after questions and any urgent questions or statements. Then, on Tuesday, it's the final day of debate followed by the big vote on whether or not Parliament approves the agreement reached between the UK and EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says that the government ""has made it clear"" that EU citizens rights will be protected whether or not the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He says he thinks that he agrees with Julia Lopez, who said that people will no longer trust politicians if Brexit is not delivered. He urges Labour MPs to ""stop playing games"" and reminds them that leave-voting Labour members will ""never forgive them"" if they try to stop Brexit. He adds that there will be no limit on the number of international students who can study in the UK. He concludes by saying that ""we are now in the final stages"" of leaving an organisation which ""has been central to our national life for 46 years"". ""Let us rise to the moment,"" he finishes. With that, the Commons moves on to the adjournment debate. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says that maybe it's the flu she's suffering, but the debate seems to have a remarkable air of ""deja vu"" about it. She says that the prime minister is ""running around Europe obtaining invisible concessions on Brexit"" and she says there is ""nothing new"" to this document that has changed since 5 December. ""This deal jeopardises all the co-operation we've come to rely with the EU,"" she states. She says that the deal ""cedes control to Europe"" on many areas of UK law. ""Nothing has been achieved from five weeks of delay,"" she adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Mike Gapes says it was the Labour government of Tony Blair which made ""such an impact"" on the development of the European Union. In 1975 he says he was putting out anti-Common Market leaflets the day before a Cambridge final exam, ""the Labour Party is in a bizarre position...we are going for a sensible Brexit,"" but he adds, ""there is no such thing as a jobs first Brexit, it is entirely about mitigating the damage"". He says he doesn't believe that any government would be able to negotiate anything different to what has been proposed. He'll be voting to stay in the European Union if the Commons gets the chance, he adds. 'Rebelling with a heavy heart' Conservative Michael Tomlinson says his constituents have been saying for ""a number of months"" that they just want ""to get on with it"". He adds that the proposal ""does not get on with it"". He says that it is not ""taking back control"". He states that while the UK will not be subject to the CJEU, it will still have ""leverage"" in the UK, and he describes the court as ""highly political"". ""The proposal threatens the integrity"" of the UK, he continues. ""I have never rebelled against the government...and I do so with a heavy heart, but with a clear head,"" he adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Julia Lopez says that the political class ""could soon find itself despised"" if it does not do what has been requested in the referendum. The agreement will lead to another ""two years"" of ""discord and indecision"" from warring factions. The UK will ""have given up all our negotiating leverage"", she adds. Labour's Martin Whitfield says ""the big problem is"" that there is no plan for where the country is going. ""Once upon a time were told we'd hold all the cards, and it would be easy,"" he states. He says that ""there is no disrespect in re-evaluating"" a decision when the facts become known. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Another Conservative MP Peter Heaton-Jones says he will also be supporting the prime minister's deal, saying it best represents the desire of the people he represents. He says he and his constituents want to ""get on with it"". Labour's Thangam Debbonaire says she wants an immigration system that Remain and Leave voters can trust. She says she does not believe anyone will be satisfied with the government's proposed immigration system. ""I want to talk about immigration,"" she says. ""I want to see an improved response to refugees...but I don't think I've come across anyone who thinks our current system is working well."" EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Mike Penning says he will not ""Vote for anything that doesn't protect the union"". He calls on the PM to return to the EU to ""sort the backstop out"". Next is Labour MP Ian Murray, who says there are 77 days to go and ""the stakes could not be higher"". He calls on the government to rule out a no-deal scenario. He says the prime minister has united Leavers and Remainers against the deal, by sticking to the red lines she set down. He calls for a 'People's Vote' on the deal. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative Kemi Badenoch says she will be supporting the prime minister's deal. She says the guarantees it gives on citizens' rights are important, and asks how MPs could vote against the deal, opening the possibility of no-deal and therefore the loss of citizens' rights. Labour MP Stephen Pound says he was ""seduced"" by Margaret Thatcher and voted to join the European Union. He says the EU set global standards for decency, human rights, freedom and environmental legislation. If we leave the EU on 29 March this year, we must make sure our European brothers and sisters know that we will work with them. ""We will not stop being Europeans,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative James Duddridge says in voting against the deal he feels he is representing his constituents. Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick says the issue has become toxic, as shown by what has been happening outside and inside Parliament this week. Conservative MP Anna Soubry wassubjected to abusefrom protesters as she did broadcast interviews this week, and other MPs have been on the receiving end of abuse and harassment. He says he is talking himself into talking Theresa May's deal, because of the danger of a no-deal.

Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to stop a no-deal Brexit by backing another referendum. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Rosindell says that his constituents voted 70% to leave, and that nothing has changed their minds. ""I truly believe that our nation is up for this,"" he says. Labour's Matt Western says he ""cannot vote for any deal that will lead to people being worse off"". He says that Parliament is ""seeing the work of an autocratic tendency"" in the prime minister, ""this is not a debate, it is neither leadership,"" he states, referring to how Mrs May says that it is either her deal or no deal. But Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to ""stop people committing national suicide"". EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says that she was elected to try to stop Brexit. She says she is regularly stopped in the street by constituents who tell her they ""want an end to this mess"". ""We have to be honest with them,"" she says. ""Brexit isn't going to solve"" any of the issues that caused people to vote for it. ""Poll after poll shows that the will of the people has changed since 2016,"" she says, adding that there was breaking of electoral law. ""People should be allowed to change their mind,"" she adds. She says that MPs must ask themselves if this new deal is better than the deal we already have from the EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir David Amess says he is ""heartily sick of the word Brexit"" and is ""less than pleased"" on how the UK has gone about trying to leave the EU. ""There are a number of reasons why I cannot support this agreement,"" one of them being ""because it threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom"", he says. Labour's Jo Stevens says she will be voting against the deal with the ""overwhelming support"" of her constituents. She says that in the past month nothing has changed, like over the past two years of negotiations. ""The referendum was drenched in illegality by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns,"" she adds. The result of the referendum does not apply ""in perpetuity"", she says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Mark Francois says that anyone who would call Remain-supporting MP Sir Nicholas Soames ""a traitor"" ""has clearly never met him"". Anyone who calls him that should ""go away and shut up"", he says. He states that he has been ""fairly consistent"" on European matters during his parliamentary career, in speaking against the EU. He says that the ""political declaration"" is ""legally completely meaningless"", and he adds that it is the ""legal equivalent of 'I promise I will respect you in the morning'"". He adds that he is ""utterly determined to vote against"" the deal. Having just been through ""considerable austerity"" it is wrong to pay Â£39bn to the EU for a deal with ""no guarantees"", he states. The UK is also not ""taking back control of our laws"" as the UK still has to ""obey EU laws"" but has lost the ability to influence them, under the deal, he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Luciana Berger says that few of the debates in the Commons have ever had ""such an impact"" on all constituents across the country. She accuses the prime minister of presenting a ""false choice"" of no deal or May's deal. ""It is beyond reproach that this [no deal] option has not been ruled out,"" she criticises the government for spending money on no deal preparations. Constituents will no longer be covered by EU Health Insurance Cards when they go abroad, she states. The NHS ""will suffer as we are are unable to properly recruit from EU countries"", she adds. A no-deal Brexit would ""isolate and hobble Britain's universities"", she says. There are 1.4m young people who are eligible to vote today who weren't before, 74% of her constituents wants a People's Vote, she states. Â© 2025 BBC.

MPs to resume debate on PM's plan,"The government lost by 11 votes Rebel Conservative MPs have joined forces with Labour to inflict a fresh blow on Theresa May's government in a Commons Brexit vote. It means the government will have to come up with revised plans within three days if Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week. It could also open the door to alternatives, such as a referendum. No 10 said Mrs May's deal was in the national interest but if MPs disagreed, the government would ""respond quickly"". The setback for the PM came as MPs started five days of debate on the withdrawal agreement with the EU, and the framework for future relations, ahead of the meaningful vote next Tuesday. The government was expecting to have 21 days to come up with a ""plan B"" for Brexit if, as widely expected, Mrs May's deal is voted down. How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Bercow Brexit ruling 'extremely concerning' Brexit: A really simple guide But MPs backed calls for it to respond within three working Parliamentary days, a deadline likely to fall on Monday 21 January. Theresa May lost by 11 votes, with 297 MPs siding with the government and 308 against. Among those voting against were 17 Conservatives, including former ministers Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah and Jo Johnson who want to see another referendum to decide whether the UK should leave or not.

Former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who led the rebellion, said he hoped for a ""serious dialogue"" between government and Parliament on alternatives to Mrs May's deal to avert a possible crisis. He told ITV's Peston that it would be up to Mrs May to decide what she wanted to do if her deal was rejected, but MPs would be able to vote on any motion she put forward within seven days. While the PM would have the right to say she wanted the Commons to re-consider her deal, he said MPs could amend the motion, telling her in effect ""we want you to do something else"". Fellow rebel Sarah Wollaston said she and other MPs opposed to a no-deal exit were engaged in a ""guerrilla campaign"" to show that it would never get the consent of Parliament. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Anti-Brexit sticker belongs to my wife"" By BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy The new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum, via a ""Norway option"" or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table. If a majority could be found for anything, it would not have the force of law - but it would at least indicate a policy which had the support of MPs. This is, in short, a massive ruling by the Speaker, made, apparently, against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler. I don't want to delve too deeply into the arcana of Business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the Crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. Read Mark's full blog But Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who favours leaving without a withdrawal agreement, said it would not stop the UK exiting on 29 March. ""It merely requires a motion to be tabled not even debated,"" he said. And prisons minister Rory Stewart, who backs the PM's deal, said requiring Mrs May to restart complex negotiations with the EU and come back with changes in three days, was ""unreasonable"". He said Mr Grieve was ""trying to provide more support for what he wants, which is a second referendum"". Downing Street said it would consider the repercussions of Wednesday's defeat but its intention had always been to ""provide certainty"" as soon as possible. Labour has said it will table a motion of no confidence in the government if Mrs May's deal is voted down. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to ""take control of what happens next"" and suggested delaying the date of the UK's exit beyond 29 March might be ""inevitable"". He warned the UK's options were narrowing given the need to avoid, at all costs, a no-deal exit which he claimed was ""simply not viable for practical reasons"". Allow Twitter content?

Commons Speaker John Bercow faced an angry backlash from some Conservative MPs over his decision to allow MPs to vote on the issue. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. The MPs claim Mr Bercow broke Commons rules and ignored the advice of his own clerks. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom was among MPs to challenge his ruling in a series of points of order after Prime Minister's Questions. They argued that the business motion, tabled by the government, was not amendable and said the Speaker was breaking with precedent. Mr Bercow said he had made an ""honest judgement"" after consulting his clerks but rejected calls from Ms Leadsom to publish the advice he had received. He insisted he was ""not setting himself up against the government but championing the rights of the House of Commons"", adding that if people wanted to vote against the amendment they could. But a number of Tory MPs said the decision cast doubt on Mr Bercow's impartiality, with Crispin Blunt questioning whether he remained a ""neutral referee of our affairs"". The Commons defeat was the second in the space of 24 hours for the government on Brexit. On Tuesday, MPs, headed by former Tory ministers Mr Grieve and Oliver Letwin, defied the government on an amendment aimed at making it more difficult to leave the EU without a deal. The clashes in the Commons came as the PM, who cancelled a vote on her deal last month at the last minute to avoid a humiliating defeat, launched a fresh push to convince MPs. She is hopingnew proposals on Northern Ireland,externalwill change enough MPs' minds to save the deal. Stormont EU 'veto' proposals published Under the plans, the Northern Ireland Assembly would have a say on new EU rules if the backstop plan to prevent physical checks on the Irish border comes into force after Brexit. But the Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, have already rejected the so-called ""Stormont lock"" plans as ""cosmetic"" and ""meaningless"". Ministers have also accepted calls for MPs to be able to vote next year on alternatives to activating the backstop, such as extending the proposed 21-month transition period.

Love Island star's testicular cancer warning,"A Love Island contestant who had a check for testicular cancer on live TV says his brother has been diagnosed with the disease. Chris Hughes was praised for raising awareness with his appearance on ITV's This Morning two months ago. The reality star says his brother Ben checked for lumps the day after Chris was on the show. Chris revealed the news on Instagram, alongside two pictures of the pair as children, urging others to get checked. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Chris, who's 26, was flooded with messages of support from his 1.9 million followers, who thanked him for raising awareness of the disease. In November he was also praised for stripping off and showing men that there is nothing to be embarrassed about by getting their testicles examined. Allow Twitter content?

The reality star, who was on the 2017 series of Love Island, decided to go public to encourage other men to get checked, after having his own health scare when he was a teenager and three operations on his left testicle. He revealed on This Morning that his cousin had testicular cancer and that both of his brothers were infertile. He also admitted that he didn't get examined until he was 20 years old, saying: ""Because it doesn't come with a lot of pain it's easy to neglect. ""Everyone thinks they know their body. There's a right way to check them. I'll be honest with you it's not something you grab hold of in everyday life. You wash yourself but don't necessarily use your fingers to identify."" Testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in young men, and Cancer Research UK says around 2,200 men in the UK are diagnosed each year. It is more likely if you have a family history of the disease. But research from male cancer charity Orchid shows that 68% of men don't know how to check their testicles properly. The Movember Foundation's advice is: ""If you notice a change in size or shape, a lump that wasn't there before, or if they become painful to touch, see a doctor."" Chris echoes their message: ""Testicular cancer is a silent killer, men need to realise this and check themselves regularly. It takes 10 seconds. Please do it."" A good time to check your testicles is after a warm bath or shower, when the skin is relaxed. Cup your hand under them and check for swelling and lumps. Roll each testicle between your finger and thumb and feel the weight. The NHS says most men's testicles are around the same size, although it's common for one to be slightly bigger than the other or hang lower. There might be something wrong if you find a hard lump on the front or side of a testicle, a testicle is swollen, or if there's pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum (the sack that holds the testicles). There's more advice from the NHShere,external. Jack Broadley, 26, discovered a lump on his testicle when he was 20. He tells Newsbeat that despite his dad having testicular cancer when he was 24, he still didn't have the confidence to get checked straight away. ""You'd have thought it would have made me go to the GP sooner, but it didn't because I was so worried about it being cancer."" It turned out that Jack had an aggressive form of the disease that had spread to his abdomen. As a result he needed three months of chemotherapy. ""I was scared going through it all, I felt very alone,"" he says. ""If you do find a lump, don't be afraid to go to the doctors and get yourself checked out. I was 21 when I was diagnosed and I know of a lot of other young guys who've been diagnosed. It is a young man's disease."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Museum in row over Great Pyramid stone,"The museum claims the stone is the only casing stone from the Great Pyramid of Giza to be displayed outside Egypt The Museum of Scotland has been caught up in a row about whether it has permission to exhibit a casing stone from an Egyptian pyramid. It was announced last weekthat a block of limestone from the Great Pyramid of Giza was to go on display in Edinburgh. Egypt's Antiquities Repatriation Department has since cast doubt over its authenticity and documentation. However, the museum has insisted that a British engineer was given permission to take the stone in 1872. The pyramid stone is due to go on public display for the first time next month as the centrepiece of an exhibition on ancient Egypt in Edinburgh. But Shabaan Abdel Gawwad, supervisor-general of Egypt's Antiquities Repatriation Department, has said he wants an official team to visit Scotland, asking for a certificate of possession and export documents. He said measures would be taken to repatriate any artefacts found to have been illegally smuggled out of his country. Mr Abdel Gawwad also said he did not believe the stone was from the Great Pyramid of Giza, as the museum claims. He said: ""The ministry of antiquities has addressed the Egyptian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to take necessary measures to contact Scottish authorities and the museum asking for a certificate of possession and export documents for the casing stone and how it left Egypt and when the museum obtained it. ""We want to see all certificates of possession for other Egyptian artefacts due to be exhibited in the museum as well. ""The Egyptian law on protection of monuments no.117 for 1983 stipulates that trading or exporting antiquities is a crime. ""If it's proven that this block or any other artefact were found to have been illegally smuggled, necessary measures will be taken to repatriate them."" An illustration by Charles Piazzi Smyth who arranged for the casing stone to come to the UK Officials at the museum, in Edinburgh's Chambers Street, told the BBC Scotland news website the casing stone came from the Great Pyramid of Giza, and was found by British engineer Waynman Dixon, working on behalf of the Astronomer Royal of Scotland, Charles Piazzi Smyth. He uncovered it in a rubble heap from road works being undertaken by the Egyptian government in 1869. A spokeswoman for National Museums Scotland said: ""In 1865 Piazzi Smyth had initiated a programme of research including the first largely accurate survey of the Great Pyramid. ""In doing so, he had the official permission of the Viceroy of Egypt and the assistance of the Egyptian Antiquities Service. ""The stone was brought to the UK by Waynman Dixon in 1872 and transported to Charles Piazzi Smyth in Edinburgh. ""After reviewing all the documentary evidence we hold, we are confident that the appropriate permissions and documentation were obtained, in line with common practice at the time."" It hasbeen reported in Egypt that the casing stone could not be from the Great Pyramid of Giza,externalbecause it is made of the wrong material. Egyptian experts said that the outer layer of the pyramid was made of granite, like the pyramids of Khafre and Menkaure, and not of limestone as the National Museum of Scotland claims the casing stone is made from. However, a museum spokeswoman added: ""The Great Pyramid was originally clad in fine Tura limestone. ""Even today, some limestone casing stones still remain at the base of the pyramid. ""The block in our collections was discovered at the foot of the Great Pyramid, and we are confident that it is a casing stone from it."" Built for King Khufu and dating about 2589-2566 BC, the Great Pyramid of Giza is the oldest and largest of the three pyramids in the Giza pyramid complex. The museum said the stone was one of the few surviving casing stones from the Great Pyramid and will be displayed in a new, permanent gallery at the museum called Ancient Egypt Rediscovered. It forms the centrepiece of the Museum of Scotland's display about the design and construction of pyramids in ancient Egypt, and will be the only display of its kind in the UK when it goes on show on 8 February.

Christmas decorations kill NZ birds,"SPCA staff removing tinsel attached to a pigeon Dozens of birds have been found dead or injured in New Zealand with Christmas decorations tied around their necks and wings. Sparrows and pigeons with ""decorative trinkets"" tied to them have been reported in Wellington. Some of them died of starvation as they were unable to fly and find food, according to animal welfare group SPCA. Although there have been similar incidents since 2015, there has been a spike in sightings in recent weeks. Authorities believe the birds are being deliberately ""decorated"",externalas the tinsel and bows are tightly and carefully attached, the New Zealand Herald reported. ""Many try to pry the foreign objects off their bodies with their beaks and feet, becoming further entangled and preventing them from eating, drinking and flying. With others, the decorations are wrapped so tightly it completely cuts off their blood circulation,"" SPCA spokesperson Paige Janssen said in an email to the BBC. ""Those that do survive and arrive at our centre are always in a very bad state, and are so malnourished and distressed that we have had to humanely euthanise them,"" Birds have been found with tinsel and other decorations tied around their necks or wings According to Ms Janssen, there have been several reported cases of ""decorated"" birds since 2015. However the number of sightings increased over the recent Christmas and New Year period. ""We received around 30 calls alone just over this period. They were multiple sightings of a dozen birds that are still mobile and flying around the Kilbirnie area [in Wellington's south-east] that we are unable to reach,"" she said. SPCA Wellington is looking for the suspect behind this ""case of cruelty"" and last week put out a plea to the public to come forward with any information. In a breakthrough on Tuesday, the group rescued seven ""decorated"" pigeons from a property in Kilbirnie.  But the SPCA is continuing its investigation and is still encouraging members of the public to come forward with any information. The pigeons were found to have been in a ""distressed but healthy condition"". Bird found dead with tinsel attached to it Some of the rescued pigeons were also painted the same colour as the tinsel tied around them. ""One pigeon had quite bright red Christmas tinsel wrapped around its wings and then the top of its head had been painted with red paint as well as its wings had been tipped with red paint,"" the New Zealand Herald quoted SPCA regional manager for the central region Ros Alsford as saying.

Military called in after Heathrow drone sighting,"The military is helping police after sightings of a drone temporarily halted flights at Heathrow airport on Tuesday. Scotland Yard said a ""full criminal investigation"" had been launched into the incident - and that officers were among those to see the drone. Departures from the west London airport were suspended for about an hour. It comes after thousands of passengers were caught up in disruption at Gatwick Airport last month following reports of drone sightings. Heathrow airport, which is also working with the Met Police, said it was monitoring the situation and apologised to passengers affected by the disruption. Speaking on Wednesday morning, the airport said ""business was back to normal"". How can a drone cause so much chaos? New powers to tackle illegal drone use The Met's Commander Stuart Cundy confirmed military assistance had been brought in but would not discuss tactics in detail. He said the drone sighting was reported just after 17:00 GMT, with departing flights stopped as a precaution while initial inquiries were made. ""We are carrying out extensive searches around the Heathrow area to identify any people who may be responsible for the operation of the drone,"" he said. ""The illegal operation of drones at an airfield is extremely dangerous."" Heathrow is one of the busiest airports in the world Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said,externalduring the incident that he was in contact with the airport about the drone sighting, and had spoken to the home secretary and defence secretary. BBC cameraman Martin Roberts, who works with drones, said he was driving on the M25 past Heathrow airport at about 17:45 GMT when he saw what he believes was a drone. ""I could see, I'd say around 300 feet up, very bright, stationary flashing red and green lights, over the Harmondsworth area,"" he said. ""I could tell it was a drone - these things have got quite distinctive lights - not a helicopter."" Gatwick said last weekthat it had spent Â£5m to prevent future attacks. Heathrow also confirmed it would be buying systems to guard against drones. Andit was announced this weekthat police would be given new powers to tackle the illegal use of drones. In light of the Heathrow incident, British Airline Pilots' Association general secretary Brian Strutton called on ministers to further strengthen drone legislation and to ensure airports invested in protection technology. ""It's time to act swiftly and decisively,"" he added. Speaking to ITV, Cabinet Office minister David Lidington said: ""Clearly, the government is looking at the law to see whether there are ways in which it could be strengthened."" He added that airports also needed to ""step up"" investment in technology to detect and stop drones from flying. BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said while the ""significant"" incident did not cause the same disruption as at Gatwick, it raised the question of how UK airports can deal with drones. While they are looking at the latest technology, it is clear they are ""playing catch-up"" he said - adding that the aviation industry had been calling for ""drastic action on this for months"". Alice Evans, BBC London, at Heathrow A couple of hours after the first reports of a drone in the skies above Heathrow, it was business as usual in the Terminal 5 departure lounge - in a low blow to Gatwick, one member of staff told me it's because ""we're a good airport"". Although flights were up and running again pretty quickly, there are still plenty of passengers who have faced disruption. One of those is Catriona Walsh, who was on a flight from Basel. Ms Walsh, who was doing a couple of days of work despite being on maternity leave, said her flight was held on the runway for about 50 minutes as staff told passengers about the drone. ""It was all calm - frustrating rather than worrying,"" she said. Michael, a fellow passenger on the flight who did not want to provide his surname, was less optimistic. ""I was worried I might have to camp here,"" he said. He said the problems here and at Gatwick have shown ""exactly how to shut a country - this country - down"", adding that police need to ""just shoot drones down"" as soon as they are sighted. More than 140,000 passengers at Gatwick were affected during 36 hours of chaos between 19 and 21 December. About 1,000 flights were cancelled there over three days due to the drone sightings.

Sainsbury's sees Christmas sales fall,"Sainsbury's has seen sales fall over Christmas after non-food trading was hit by consumer caution. Like-for-like retail sales, which exclude sales from new stores, fell by 1.1% across the Christmas period. General merchandise sales, including at Sainsbury's-owned Argos, fell by 2.3% and overall clothing sales by 0.2%. Chief executive Mike Coupe said: ""Retail markets are highly competitive and very promotional and the consumer outlook continues to be uncertain."" He added: ""General merchandise sales grew strongly over the key Christmas weeks and outperformed the market over the quarter. ""Sales declined in the quarter due to cautious customer spending and our decision to reduce promotional activity across Black Friday.  Clothing performed well, with strong full-price sales growth in a tough market."" This video can not be played Shoppers in Nottingham reveal whether they spent more or less this Christmas He said shoppers also cut back on their spending on food over Christmas, with slower sales growth for the premium Taste the Difference range. However, the supermarket giant said in the 15 weeks to 9 January, grocery sales grew by 0.4%, with groceries online and in convenience stores up by 6% and 3%. Sainsbury's shares were ahead by 2.18% in midday trading in London. Pundits had expected Sainsbury's to have the weakest Christmas numbers of the big four grocery chains. They were right - but for the wrong reasons. Sainsbury's core grocery business did quite well given the fierce competition from the mainstream rivals Tesco, Morrisons and Asda, and the extra squeeze from the German-owned discounters Aldi and Lidl. The weakness came in so-called general merchandise, which includes Argos, which Sainsbury's bought two years ago. The problem, Sainsbury's said, was not Christmas trading, but Black Friday. It chose not to follow rivals' fierce discounting and sales suffered accordingly. While this explanation is undoubtedly correct, it will not impress investors, who will point out that Argos was meant to provide diversification away from the super-competitive grocery market, and that complaining about discounting on Black Friday is like complaining about cold weather in January. All this week's trading updates show only sales. We will not know the real winners - which retailers turned those sales into profits - until later in the year, in Sainsbury's case in the full-year results in May. The third-quarter retail sales figure was worse than analysts had expected, having predicted a 0.2% decline. Retail analyst Teresa Wickham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""It is a mixed bag. Christmas has clearly been difficult for them."" She said Sainsbury's had had to make difficult decisions about how far it should go down the promotional route in order to compete with Aldi and Lidl. But she added that the UK's second-largest grocery chain had a ""very valuable property in Argos"", despite the fall in merchandise sales. And Richard Lim, chief executive at Retail Economics said: ""These results aren't disastrous but demonstrate the significant challenges faced by the big grocers."" Sainsbury's plans to merge with rival Asda, with a verdict on the plan due from the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) in February. Sainsbury's customers cut back on their food spending during the festive period Mr Coupe denied that the emphasis on the merger meant Sainsbury's management had lost direction.  He said there were about 20 people dealing with the merger, but more than 100,000 members of staff focused on Sainsbury's customers. He said the firm continued to have constructive talks with the CMA and was confident a merger would ""bring lower prices for consumers"". Meanwhile, Sainsbury's, like other UK supermarkets, is preparing for the possibility that the UK will leave the EU without a deal. Mr Coupe said a no-deal Brexit would be very challenging for retailers, given that UK retailers bring in more than 30% of their volumes from continental Europe. ""There is only so much contingency planning you can do,"" he said. ""We have 20 distribution centres and each one can hold about a week's worth of food. But it is not as if there are another 20 distribution centres out there."" How have other retailers fared over Christmas? Baker Greggs has seen annual sales to January rise by 7.2%, driven by growth in new categories such as vegan-friendly foods. Like-for-like sales at company-managed shops were up 2.9% across the year, and in the Christmas fourth quarter by 5.2%. Fashion retailer Ted Baker reported higher sales in the holiday period. In the five weeks to 5 January, they were up 12.2%. Online sales jumped 18.7% to make up more than a quarter of retail sales. Majestic Wine has said the Christmas trading period was more challenging than expected, but total sales were 6.3% higher in the 10 weeks to 31 December, accelerating from the 3.2% growth rate seen at the same time last year. Mr Coupe said a lot of the stock that the firm brought in from mainland Europe was fresh fruit and vegetables, which could only be held for short periods of times and not be stockpiled. ""It would be hugely disruptive if there was a no-deal Brexit, and we would have to manage that on a day-to-day, week-to-week basis,"" he added. ""We don't have the capacity to manage more than one week's worth of stock.""

Saudi woman 'given refugee status',"This video can not be played The #SaveRahaf campaign went viral after Rahaf started tweeting about her plight for asylum A Saudi woman who fled her family and refused to leave a Bangkok hotel has been declared a legitimate refugee by the UN, the Australian government says. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, 18, refused to board a flight from Bangkok to Kuwait on Monday and barricaded herself into her airport hotel room. She said she had renounced Islam, which is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. The UN's refugee agency has referred her case to Australia for possible resettlement. Thai immigration officials had initially said she should return to Kuwait, where her family were waiting. She then started a social media campaign, live-tweeting her case and attracting international attention. Rahaf Mohammed al-Qunun, pictured at Bangkok airport, says she ""wants to be free"" away from Saudi Arabia In a brief statement, Australia's Department of Home Affairs said it would ""consider this referral in the usual way"". Ms Mohammed al-Qunun posted a message on Twitter following the announcement, saying: ""Don't let anyone break your wings, you're free. Fight and get your rights!"" Allow Twitter content?

""If she is found to be a refugee, then we will give very, very, very serious consideration to a humanitarian visa,"" Health Minister Greg Hunt told the ABC network before the UN determination was made public. But Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton warned there would be ""no special treatment"" for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. 'Sara', Saudi woman speaking toBBC OS on the World Service Rahaf is an inspiration. But she's not the first one who did this and definitely not the last one. What we are going through is awful. We think about this every day because us women here do not know what it feels like to go out. We don't know what freedom tastes like. Dad keeps my passport with him all the time, we go to hotels and he puts it next to him when he sleeps. Unfortunately it's not a revolution. Every girl that is tweeting about this, it's either that she has already escaped or she's using a fake account like me. Some people tweeted me or DMed me to tell me to use my real account, for me to be brave. We do not want the guardianship any more. I want to go out of the house and drink coffee from Starbucks. I don't have to take my whole family. This is just way too harsh on us. Living this life is exhausting. Renunciation of Islam is punishable by death in Saudi Arabia. ""My life is in danger,"" she told the Reuters news agency. ""My family threatens to kill me for the most trivial things."" Saudi Arabia's restrictions on women explained A spokesperson for her family told the BBC that they did not wish to comment and all they cared about was the young woman's safety. Campaign groups like Human Rights Watch (HRW) have expressed grave concerns for Ms Mohammed al-Qunun. Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director off HRW, told Reuters: ""She said very clearly that she has suffered both physical and psychological abuse. She said she has made a decision to renounce Islam. And I knew once she said that, she is in serious trouble"". On Tuesday morning she retweeted her original appeal for asylum, pleading for the UK, Canada, the US or Australia to take her in.

Ms Mohammed al-Qunun says she was on a trip to Kuwait with her family when she fled on a flight on 4 January. She was trying to head to Australia via a connecting flight in Bangkok.

Police in Thailand had denied entry to the woman and were in the process of repatriating her She began to live-tweet her ordeal, sharing her Twitter password with friends so they too could assist in spreading the message on social media.

A video showed how she resisted deportation efforts by hiding in an airport hotel room, putting a table against the door to stop people from entering. She told the BBC: ""I shared my story and my pictures on social media and my father is so angry because I did this... I can't study and work in my country, so I want to be free and study and work as I want."" Ms Mohammed al-Qunun has been housed in a secure location in Bangkok since Monday night, when the Thai government allowed her to leave the airport. Her father and brother have arrived in Thailand but she is refusing to see them. Thailand's immigration chief Surachate Hakparn said the pair would remain there until it was clear where Ms Mohammed al-Qunun would receive asylum. Mr Surachate said the father had denied allegations that the family were abusing her physically and emotionally. ""He wanted to make sure that his daughter was safe... he told me that he wanted to take her home,"" he said.

Egypt recovers smuggled artefact from UK,"The archaeological item is said to be part of a tablet carving of Egyptian King Amenhotep I An ancient Egyptian artefact illegally smuggled out of the country has been returned after being displayed at an auction hall in London, officials say. It was retrieved following searches of international auction websites, Egypt's ministry of antiquities said. Steps were then taken to stop the sale and withdraw the listing, the ministry added in a Facebook post. It is not clear how or when the relic, a cartouche of King Amenhotep I, was originally smuggled out of the country. The archaeological item was earlier exhibited at the open museum of the ancient Temple of Karnak in the city of Luxor,external, the ministry's director-general, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, said. The antiquities ministry worked with the Egyptian foreign ministry, Egypt's embassy in London and British authorities to recover the section of tablet, he said, adding that the embassy in London had received it last September. The artefact was displayed at the Temple of Karnak in Luxor, a popular tourist site Egypt has stepped up efforts to stop the trafficking of its antiquities in recent years. The country has warned that it will not co-operate with foreign museums in relation to exhibits on ancient Egyptian sites unless smuggled artefacts are returned. Earlier this month, it was announced thatthe only casing stone from the Great Pyramid of Giza to be displayed anywhere outside Egypt will be on showat the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh from 8 February. The large block of fine white limestone will be on public view for the first time since it arrived in Scotland in 1872.

Olivia Colman's film is Bafta favourite,"This video can not be played The 2019 Bafta nominations have been announced, Lizo Mzimba looks at the front runners Olivia Colman's film The Favourite leads the race for this year's Bafta Awards, with 12 nominations. The announcement comes days afterColman won a Golden Globefor playing Queen Anne in the period comedy-drama. It's some way ahead of its nearest Bafta rivals Bohemian Rhapsody, A Star Is Born, First Man and Roma, which have seven nominations each. Steve Coogan, Christian Bale, Claire Foy, Rachel Weisz and Richard E Grant are the other British acting nominees. The Favourite is the only production to be up for both best film and outstanding British film. It has also proved popular at box offices, making Â£4m in the UK and Ireland in its first week. Colman is nominated for best actress, while her co-stars Weisz and Emma Stone - who vie for the monarch's affections in the film - are both in the running for best supporting actress. In full: Bafta nominations 2019 Olivia Colman's varied career in pictures Who was the queen brought to life by Olivia Colman? Left-right: Emma Stone, Olivia Colman and Rachel Weisz are all nominated for acting awards ""There's a lot of love for this film,"" film critic Jason Solomons told BBC Breakfast. ""It's already doing very well at the box office and it's only been out there a week officially. ""Olivia Colman is such a popular figureâ¦ I think people are just falling for her performance as Queen Anne, supported brilliantly of course by Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone."" Colman has won three Bafta TV Awards in the past - for Broadchurch, Twenty Twelve and Accused - but this is her first nomination in the film section. Actress Hayley Squires, who helped announce the nominations, said: ""After a year of Time's Up and #MeToo and the conversation that was happening so strongly last year, I think it's fantastic that it's a film that's led by three women. ""And also [they're] in roles where they're not necessarily being beautiful, but roles where they get to be quite ugly and vicious and really tear into each other, and into quite a vicious, strong script. I love the fact it's up there with those nominations."" Rami Malek will hope to add a Bafta to the Golden Globe he won for playing Freddie Mercury Rami Malek is another star who will be hoping to followa Golden Globe victorywith a win at the Baftas. He is nominated for playing late Queen frontman Freddie Mercury in Bohemian Rhapsody, which is also shortlisted for outstanding British film. But it is not in the overall best film category.

Hotel Negresco owner Augier dies at 95,"Jeanne Augier, pictured here in 2002, inherited the famous Negresco hotel from her father One of France's most flamboyant hoteliers, Jeanne Augier, has died aged 95, bringing to a close an era of glitz and glamour on the French Riviera. Augier ran the pink-domed Negresco hotel on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice for more than 60 years after inheriting it from her father in 1957. There, she welcomed guests including the Beatles and the Sultan of Brunei. Augier devoted her life to the hotel on the seafront, whose flags were at half-mast following news of her death. Her success in building the hotel up into a favourite among celebrities saw it develop a client list with names such as Salvador Dali and Elton John, who featured the hotel in the video for his hit song ""I'm Still Standing"". Augier, instantly recognisable by her auburn hair and bright red lipstick, once famously told Microsoft founder Bill Gates that he was not rich enough to buy her hotel. In an interview with French newspaper Liberation in 2009, she said: ""I must have a hundred offers a year to buy the Negresco. It's out of the question."" Augier with her dogs Lily (left) and Lilou in the Versailles lounge of the Negresco hotel in 2011 The hotel, with its chandelier-lit dining room and sweeping views of the Mediterranean, describes itself on its website as ""a place where everything is possible... flamboyance served on a tray,external"". It is named after its Romanian-born founder, Henri Negresco, and has more than 100 rooms, each with their own unique furnishings and French art ""collection pieces"". The hotel opened in 1913 and quickly became popular with European royalty. In 2016, the Negresco hotel was used as a field hospital following the Bastille Day lorry attack that killed 84 people in the city.

MPs to resume debate on PM's Brexit plan,"The government lost by 11 votes Rebel Conservative MPs have joined forces with Labour to inflict a fresh blow on Theresa May's government in a Commons Brexit vote. It means the government will have to come up with revised plans within three days if Mrs May's EU withdrawal deal is rejected by MPs next week. It could also open the door to alternatives, such as a referendum. No 10 said Mrs May's deal was in the national interest but if MPs disagreed, the government would ""respond quickly"". The setback for the PM came as MPs started five days of debate on the withdrawal agreement with the EU, and the framework for future relations, ahead of the meaningful vote next Tuesday. The government was expecting to have 21 days to come up with a ""plan B"" for Brexit if, as widely expected, Mrs May's deal is voted down. How voters want Brexit to be sorted out Activists urge Corbyn to back EU referendum Bercow Brexit ruling 'extremely concerning' Brexit: A really simple guide But MPs backed calls for it to respond within three working Parliamentary days, a deadline likely to fall on Monday 21 January. Theresa May lost by 11 votes, with 297 MPs siding with the government and 308 against. Among those voting against were 17 Conservatives, including former ministers Justine Greening, Sam Gyimah and Jo Johnson who want to see another referendum to decide whether the UK should leave or not.

Former attorney general Dominic Grieve, the Conservative MP who led the rebellion, said he hoped for a ""serious dialogue"" between government and Parliament on alternatives to Mrs May's deal to avert a possible crisis. He told ITV's Peston that it would be up to Mrs May to decide what she wanted to do if her deal was rejected, but MPs would be able to vote on any motion she put forward within seven days. While the PM would have the right to say she wanted the Commons to re-consider her deal, he said MPs could amend the motion, telling her in effect ""we want you to do something else"". Fellow rebel Sarah Wollaston said she and other MPs opposed to a no-deal exit were engaged in a ""guerrilla campaign"" to show that it would never get the consent of Parliament. This video can not be played Bercow: ""Anti-Brexit sticker belongs to my wife"" By BBC Parliamentary Correspondent Mark D'Arcy The new Grieve amendment, now passed by MPs, means that in the event the PM loses next week, the Commons will then have a chance to vote on alternative policies - everything from a ""managed no-deal"" to a further referendum, via a ""Norway option"" or a reheated version of the current deal, could be on the table. If a majority could be found for anything, it would not have the force of law - but it would at least indicate a policy which had the support of MPs. This is, in short, a massive ruling by the Speaker, made, apparently, against the advice of the Commons Clerk, Sir David Natzler. I don't want to delve too deeply into the arcana of Business of the House motions only amendable by ministers of the Crown, but this drove a coach and horses through accepted normal practice, and will have huge implications for the course of Brexit. Read Mark's full blog But Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg, who favours leaving without a withdrawal agreement, said it would not stop the UK exiting on 29 March. ""It merely requires a motion to be tabled not even debated,"" he said. And prisons minister Rory Stewart, who backs the PM's deal, said requiring Mrs May to restart complex negotiations with the EU and come back with changes in three days, was ""unreasonable"". He said Mr Grieve was ""trying to provide more support for what he wants, which is a second referendum"". Downing Street said it would consider the repercussions of Wednesday's defeat but its intention had always been to ""provide certainty"" as soon as possible. Labour has said it will table a motion of no confidence in the government if Mrs May's deal is voted down. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said Parliament had to ""take control of what happens next"" and suggested delaying the date of the UK's exit beyond 29 March might be ""inevitable"". He warned the UK's options were narrowing given the need to avoid, at all costs, a no-deal exit which he claimed was ""simply not viable for practical reasons"". Allow Twitter content?

Commons Speaker John Bercow faced an angry backlash from some Conservative MPs over his decision to allow MPs to vote on the issue. A ""no-deal"" Brexit is where the UK would cut ties with the European Union overnight without a transition period. Theresa May's government, and many others, believe this would be hugely damaging and want a more gradual withdrawal. But if Parliament can't agree on that, and nothing else takes its place, the UK could still leave without a deal. This would mean the UK would not have to obey EU rules. Instead, it would need to follow World Trade Organization terms on trade. Many businesses would see new taxes on imports, exports and services, which are likely to increase their operating costs. That means the prices of some goods in UK shops could go up. The UK would also lose the trade agreements it had with other countries as a member of the EU, all of which would need to be renegotiated alongside the new agreement with the EU itself. Manufacturers in the UK expect to face delays in components coming across the border. The UK would be free to set its own immigration controls. However some UK professionals working in the EU and UK expats could face uncertainty. Some countries, such as Spain, Germany and the Netherlands, have given temporary guarantees about residency status and rights, but there is not yet an agreed policy for UK citizens across the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The situation for holidays and business trips is a little clearer, as the European Commission has said that even in a no-deal scenario, UK travellers won't need a visa for short visits of up to 90 days. The border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic would become an external frontier for the EU with customs and immigration controls, though how and where any checks would be made is not clear. Some Leave supporters think that leaving without a deal would be positive if the right preparations were made. They say criticism is scaremongering and any short term pain would be for long term gain. But critics - including both Brexit supporters and opponents - say that leaving without a deal would be a disaster for the UK: driving up food prices, leading to shortages of goods and gridlock on some roads in the South East resulting from extra border checks. The MPs claim Mr Bercow broke Commons rules and ignored the advice of his own clerks. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom was among MPs to challenge his ruling in a series of points of order after Prime Minister's Questions. They argued that the business motion, tabled by the government, was not amendable and said the Speaker was breaking with precedent. Mr Bercow said he had made an ""honest judgement"" after consulting his clerks but rejected calls from Ms Leadsom to publish the advice he had received. He insisted he was ""not setting himself up against the government but championing the rights of the House of Commons"", adding that if people wanted to vote against the amendment they could. But a number of Tory MPs said the decision cast doubt on Mr Bercow's impartiality, with Crispin Blunt questioning whether he remained a ""neutral referee of our affairs"". The Commons defeat was the second in the space of 24 hours for the government on Brexit. On Tuesday, MPs, headed by former Tory ministers Mr Grieve and Oliver Letwin, defied the government on an amendment aimed at making it more difficult to leave the EU without a deal. The clashes in the Commons came as the PM, who cancelled a vote on her deal last month at the last minute to avoid a humiliating defeat, launched a fresh push to convince MPs. She is hopingnew proposals on Northern Ireland,externalwill change enough MPs' minds to save the deal. Stormont EU 'veto' proposals published Under the plans, the Northern Ireland Assembly would have a say on new EU rules if the backstop plan to prevent physical checks on the Irish border comes into force after Brexit. But the Democratic Unionist Party, on whom Theresa May relies for her Commons majority, have already rejected the so-called ""Stormont lock"" plans as ""cosmetic"" and ""meaningless"". Ministers have also accepted calls for MPs to be able to vote next year on alternatives to activating the backstop, such as extending the proposed 21-month transition period.

Trains run after Paddington lights failure,"One of London's main railway terminuses was plunged into darkness late on Tuesday when the station lights failed. Paddington Station was illuminated by little more than shop lighting and digital display boards, as station staff used torches to guide passengers. Network Rail said engineers were sent to identify the cause of the problem, which arose at about 22:00 GMT and triggered delays to some services. A spokesman said the lights were restored at about 01:30 on Wednesday. Passengers had been advised tocheck live information,externalbefore travelling but most services were running on time ahead of Wednesday's rush hour. Paddington connects South Wales and the West of England to London, serving stations including Reading, Oxford, Cardiff, Exeter St David's and Penzance. BBC journalist Patrick Jackson arrived at a gloomier-than-normal station at about 23:15 GMT on Tuesday. He said lights above platforms one to four went out about five minutes later.

""It was pretty dark by the platforms,"" he said. ""It was a bit weird but there was no panic. ""People just stood there waiting. They didn't want to bring trains into the station in the dark but we saw two crawling in and we boarded about 20 minutes later. ""The staff just turned on their torches and phones and were directing us towards the carriages."" Mr Jackson said his Cardiff-bound train left about 20 minutes late. Shortly after midnight, a Network Rail spokesman told the BBC the problem was affecting services arriving at and departing from Paddington but that the station remained open for overnight travellers. ""We are telling passengers to check before they travel. We have got engineers on site to try to work out the cause and fix the problem,"" he added.

Hotel Negresco owner Augier dies at 95Jeanne Augier's death brings to a close an era of glitz and glamour on the French Riviera.Europe,"Jeanne Augier, pictured here in 2002, inherited the famous Negresco hotel from her father One of France's most flamboyant hoteliers, Jeanne Augier, has died aged 95, bringing to a close an era of glitz and glamour on the French Riviera. Augier ran the pink-domed Negresco hotel on the Promenade des Anglais in Nice for more than 60 years after inheriting it from her father in 1957. There, she welcomed guests including the Beatles and the Sultan of Brunei. Augier devoted her life to the hotel on the seafront, whose flags were at half-mast following news of her death. Her success in building the hotel up into a favourite among celebrities saw it develop a client list with names such as Salvador Dali and Elton John, who featured the hotel in the video for his hit song ""I'm Still Standing"". Augier, instantly recognisable by her auburn hair and bright red lipstick, once famously told Microsoft founder Bill Gates that he was not rich enough to buy her hotel. In an interview with French newspaper Liberation in 2009, she said: ""I must have a hundred offers a year to buy the Negresco. It's out of the question."" Augier with her dogs Lily (left) and Lilou in the Versailles lounge of the Negresco hotel in 2011 The hotel, with its chandelier-lit dining room and sweeping views of the Mediterranean, describes itself on its website as ""a place where everything is possible... flamboyance served on a tray,external"". It is named after its Romanian-born founder, Henri Negresco, and has more than 100 rooms, each with their own unique furnishings and French art ""collection pieces"". The hotel opened in 1913 and quickly became popular with European royalty. In 2016, the Negresco hotel was used as a field hospital following the Bastille Day lorry attack that killed 84 people in the city.

Love Island star's testicular cancer warningChris Hughes says his brother found a lump after he had a live examination on This Morning.Newsbeat,"A Love Island contestant who had a check for testicular cancer on live TV says his brother has been diagnosed with the disease. Chris Hughes was praised for raising awareness with his appearance on ITV's This Morning two months ago. The reality star says his brother Ben checked for lumps the day after Chris was on the show. Chris revealed the news on Instagram, alongside two pictures of the pair as children, urging others to get checked. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

Chris, who's 26, was flooded with messages of support from his 1.9 million followers, who thanked him for raising awareness of the disease.

The reality star, who was on the 2017 series of Love Island, decided to go public to encourage other men to get checked, after having his own health scare when he was a teenager and three operations on his left testicle. He revealed on This Morning that his cousin had testicular cancer and that both of his brothers were infertile. He also admitted that he didn't get examined until he was 20 years old, saying: ""Because it doesn't come with a lot of pain it's easy to neglect. ""Everyone thinks they know their body. There's a right way to check them. I'll be honest with you it's not something you grab hold of in everyday life. You wash yourself but don't necessarily use your fingers to identify."" Testicular cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in young men, and Cancer Research UK says around 2,200 men in the UK are diagnosed each year. It is more likely if you have a family history of the disease. But research from male cancer charity Orchid shows that 68% of men don't know how to check their testicles properly. The Movember Foundation's advice is: ""If you notice a change in size or shape, a lump that wasn't there before, or if they become painful to touch, see a doctor."" Chris echoes their message: ""Testicular cancer is a silent killer, men need to realise this and check themselves regularly. It takes 10 seconds. Please do it."" A good time to check your testicles is after a warm bath or shower, when the skin is relaxed. Cup your hand under them and check for swelling and lumps. Roll each testicle between your finger and thumb and feel the weight. The NHS says most men's testicles are around the same size, although it's common for one to be slightly bigger than the other or hang lower. There might be something wrong if you find a hard lump on the front or side of a testicle, a testicle is swollen, or if there's pain or discomfort in a testicle or in the scrotum (the sack that holds the testicles). There's more advice from the NHShere,external. Jack Broadley, 26, discovered a lump on his testicle when he was 20. He tells Newsbeat that despite his dad having testicular cancer when he was 24, he still didn't have the confidence to get checked straight away. ""You'd have thought it would have made me go to the GP sooner, but it didn't because I was so worried about it being cancer."" It turned out that Jack had an aggressive form of the disease that had spread to his abdomen. As a result he needed three months of chemotherapy. ""I was scared going through it all, I felt very alone,"" he says. ""If you do find a lump, don't be afraid to go to the doctors and get yourself checked out. I was 21 when I was diagnosed and I know of a lot of other young guys who've been diagnosed. It is a young man's disease."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"Pension cold-calling ban takes effectThe ban, first announced two years ago, is aimed at preventing scams that cost victims thousands of pounds.Business","A ban on nuisance calls about pensions has now come into force but people are still being urged to be on their guard. Cold-calling has been used by fraudsters trying to steal life savings or persuade people to invest in high-risk schemes. Some 10.9 million unsolicited pension calls and messages are made a year, according to Citizens Advice. Any firm found flouting the rules faces a fine of up to Â£500,000, but experts suggest fraudsters may ignore the ban. John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Pension scammers are the lowest of the low. They rob savers of their hard-earned retirement and devastate lives. We know that cold-calling is the pension scammers' main tactic, which is why we've made them illegal."" The government has faced criticism over the time taken to introduce the ban, which was first announced nearly two years ago, although restrictions on unsolicited texts and emails about pensions have already been put in place. Pension scams start with an unexpected call, text, social media approach or email - offering a free pension review, or a way to make attractive returns on pension savings. But the money may be simply stolen or transferred into a high-risk scheme completely inappropriate for retirement savings. Many offer eye-catching returns or high-rolling investments in hotels or green energy schemes that never materialise, or instead lead to losses. Research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found that pension scam victims lose an average of Â£91,000 each. In August, Jennifer Ringstead told the BBC about how she and her husband, from the Vale of Glamorgan, invested - and lost - their pension pots. Together, the losses totalled more than Â£50,000. They were tricked when their finances were already overstretched. She said that the story the fraudster told was convincing and came when they were at their most financially vulnerable. ""He was just perfect. I did not think for a second that anything was amiss. I asked questions, he had the answers to everything,"" she said. It is thought that only a minority of pension scams are ever reported. Certain types of cold calls, including those involving mortgages, are already banned. Now, the new ban prohibits cold-calling in relation to pensions, except where the caller is authorised by the FCA, or is the trustee or manager of an occupational or personal pension scheme, and the recipient of the call consents to calls, or has an existing relationship with the caller. Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, said: ""The cold calling ban sends a very clear message - if anyone calls you about your pension, it's an attempt to steal your savings. ""The ban draws a line in the sand for scammers. Cross it and you should expect to be prosecuted."" Tom Selby, of pensions firm AJ Bell, said: ""Prohibiting cold-calling is only part of the solution and will by no means eradicate the threat of scam activity altogether. Pensions remain a juicy target for fraudsters and some will inevitably look to circumvent the ban or simply ignore it altogether."" He urged anyone who received a call out of the blue about pensions to simply hang up the phone. Kay Ingram, director of public policy at financial adviser LEBC, was one of a number of commentators who said the cold calling ban of itself would not deter determined criminals. ""Success will depend upon the public having confidence that no legitimate adviser or pension provider would approach them in this way. The government, pension providers and the regulatory bodies will need to do more to stamp out this crime,"" she said.

Ways the US shutdown is hurting,"A woman wearing a ""hungry hostage"" headband protests on Capitol Hill President Donald Trump's standoff with Democrats over funding for his proposed border wall has resulted in the longest government shutdown in US history. How has it affected American life so far? Mr Trump insists the government will stay closed until he gets that funding, and as the shutdown enters day 34, Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have remained equally firm that there will be no congressional funding for a wall. A quarter of the federal government has been unfunded since 22 December, leaving 800,000 employees without pay. Here is some of the misery Washington's political gridlock is inflicting on the nation at large. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers, who oversee airport security, have been calling in sick or quitting as the shutdown drags on, though the agency insists standards have not been compromised.

Pension cold-calling ban takes effect,"A ban on nuisance calls about pensions has now come into force but people are still being urged to be on their guard. Cold-calling has been used by fraudsters trying to steal life savings or persuade people to invest in high-risk schemes. Some 10.9 million unsolicited pension calls and messages are made a year, according to Citizens Advice. Any firm found flouting the rules faces a fine of up to Â£500,000, but experts suggest fraudsters may ignore the ban. John Glen, economic secretary to the Treasury, said: ""Pension scammers are the lowest of the low. They rob savers of their hard-earned retirement and devastate lives. We know that cold-calling is the pension scammers' main tactic, which is why we've made them illegal."" The government has faced criticism over the time taken to introduce the ban, which was first announced nearly two years ago, although restrictions on unsolicited texts and emails about pensions have already been put in place. Pension scams start with an unexpected call, text, social media approach or email - offering a free pension review, or a way to make attractive returns on pension savings. But the money may be simply stolen or transferred into a high-risk scheme completely inappropriate for retirement savings. Many offer eye-catching returns or high-rolling investments in hotels or green energy schemes that never materialise, or instead lead to losses. Research by the City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), found that pension scam victims lose an average of Â£91,000 each. In August, Jennifer Ringstead told the BBC about how she and her husband, from the Vale of Glamorgan, invested - and lost - their pension pots. Together, the losses totalled more than Â£50,000. They were tricked when their finances were already overstretched. She said that the story the fraudster told was convincing and came when they were at their most financially vulnerable. ""He was just perfect. I did not think for a second that anything was amiss. I asked questions, he had the answers to everything,"" she said. It is thought that only a minority of pension scams are ever reported. Certain types of cold calls, including those involving mortgages, are already banned. Now, the new ban prohibits cold-calling in relation to pensions, except where the caller is authorised by the FCA, or is the trustee or manager of an occupational or personal pension scheme, and the recipient of the call consents to calls, or has an existing relationship with the caller. Lesley Titcomb, chief executive of the Pensions Regulator, said: ""The cold calling ban sends a very clear message - if anyone calls you about your pension, it's an attempt to steal your savings. ""The ban draws a line in the sand for scammers. Cross it and you should expect to be prosecuted."" Tom Selby, of pensions firm AJ Bell, said: ""Prohibiting cold-calling is only part of the solution and will by no means eradicate the threat of scam activity altogether. Pensions remain a juicy target for fraudsters and some will inevitably look to circumvent the ban or simply ignore it altogether."" He urged anyone who received a call out of the blue about pensions to simply hang up the phone. Kay Ingram, director of public policy at financial adviser LEBC, was one of a number of commentators who said the cold calling ban of itself would not deter determined criminals. ""Success will depend upon the public having confidence that no legitimate adviser or pension provider would approach them in this way. The government, pension providers and the regulatory bodies will need to do more to stamp out this crime,"" she said.

Boss quits after vegetative patient has baby,"The chief executive of the corporation in charge of an Arizona nursing home where a woman in a vegetative state gave birth has resigned. Bill Timmons's resignation was unanimously accepted by directors, the company said in a statement. The woman had been a patient in a clinic run by Hacienda HealthCare near Phoenix for over a decade and required round-the-clock care. Police have launched a sexual assault investigation into the incident. The woman, who has not been identified, is thought to have given birth on 29 December. ""From what I've been told she was moaning and they didn't know what was wrong with her,"" an unidentified source told CBS Phoenix affiliate KPHO-TV. ""None of the staff were aware that she was pregnant until she was pretty much giving birth."" Gary Orman, the executive vice president of the company's board, said it would ""accept nothing less than a full accounting of this absolutely horrifying situation"". ""And we will do everything in our power to ensure the safety of every single one of our patients and our employees."" The New York Times reports that fresh allegations of abuse,externalhave emerged, including inadequate privacy for patients while they were naked or being showered. A Phoenix police spokesman said that ""the matter is currently under investigation"" but declined to give any further details of the case. Protocol at the clinic has been changed, the source said, and men now have to be accompanied by a woman on entering the room of a female patient. Hacienda HealthCare said it was fully co-operating with the authorities. The Arizona Department of Health Services said it had sent inspectors to check on patients at the facility and had implemented ""heightened safety measures"".

Salmond sexual harassment probe 'unlawful'The former first minister wins his legal fight against the Scottish government over its investigation.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Alex Salmond: ""While I am glad about the victory that has been achieved today I am sad it was necessary to take this action."" The Scottish government has admitted acting unlawfully while investigating sexual harassment claims against Alex Salmond. Allegations against the former first minister, which he denies, were made to the Scottish government a year ago. The government has now admitted it breached its own guidelines by appointing an investigating officer who had ""prior involvement"" in the case. As a result, it conceded defeat in its legal fight with Mr Salmond. Mr Salmond's case focused entirely on the fairness of the government's procedures and will have no bearing on a separate police inquiry into the allegations, which is still ongoing. Q&A: Alex Salmond legal victory Who is Leslie Evans? Look back at Sturgeon's statement Speaking outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said the case had resulted in ""abject humiliation"" for the Scottish government, which he led from 2007 until 2014. He added: ""The last time I was in that court was to be sworn in as first minister of Scotland. I never thought it possible that at any point I would be taking the Scottish government to court. ""Therefore while I am glad about the victory which has been achieved today, I am sad that it was necessary to take this action."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""It is deeply regrettable that we are in the situation that we are in today."" Mr Salmond also repeated his calls for the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, to consider her position, and warned that the case could cost the public purse Â£500,000. And he thanked the 4,000 people who contributed more than Â£100,000 to a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for his legal challenge to the government's handling of the case. With the government agreeing to pay his legal costs, he said the money will go to good causes in Scotland and elsewhere. The former first minister raised more than Â£100,000 for his case through a crowdfunding appeal The government's admission that it had not followed the correct procedures came during a hearing at the Court of Session on Tuesday morning. Judge Lord Pentland subsequently said that the government's actions had been ""unlawful in respect that they were procedurally unfair"" and had been ""tainted with apparent bias"". The Scottish government's admission centred on an official it appointed to investigate the complaints against Mr Salmond, which were made by two women. Its lawyer, Roddy Dunlop QC, told the court that the investigating officer was a ""dedicated HR professional"" who acted in good faith, but did have some contact with the complainers before being appointed to the case. This video can not be played Lord Pentland told the court the government acted unlawfully Mr Dunlop said this had led the government to accept there had been a ""failure"" in one aspect of the investigation, which could have given the impression that they were not acting impartially. But he said the government did not accept a claim by Mr Salmond's legal team that the investigating officer had effectively been ""assisting the complainers"" and ""giving them encouragement"". He also said there was ""no question of an individual being held up as a sacrifice"", and that the government had a ""duty to investigate the serious complaints"" that had been made. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she has not spoken to Mr Salmond since July of last year Mr Salmond's successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told BBC Scotland that ""in one particular aspect of the application of this procedure the Scottish government got it wrong"", but that there was ""no suggestion of any partiality in the process"". She also said it was ""not my view"" that Ms Evans, the Scottish government's permanent secretary, should resign. Ms Sturgeon asked Ms Evans to draw up new procedures for handling sexual harassment claims, which the first minister signed-off, shortly before the complaints against Mr Salmond were made in January of last year. The first minister said: ""It is deeply regrettable that we are in the situation we are in today, not least for the complainants who had a right to expect that this process would be in every respect robust. ""I think the permanent secretary was absolutely right when these complaints came forward to subject them to an investigation and not to sweep them under the carpet because of the identity of the person complained about. ""That principle remains - the Scottish government, like any organisation has a duty when it gets things wrong to learn the lessons so that people who have complaints in the future feel confident in bringing them."" Ms Sturgeon has backed her permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, despite Mr Salmond calling for her to resign She later told the Scottish Parliament that she had met Mr Salmond three times after the complaints against him were made -  at her home in Glasgow on 2 April, on 7 June ahead of the SNP conference in Aberdeen, and at her home on 7 July. Ms Sturgeon added: ""I also spoke with him on the telephone on 23 of April and 18 July. I have not spoken to Alex Salmond since 18 July. ""On 2 April he informed me about the complaints against him, which of course in line with the procedure the permanent secretary had not done, and he set out his various concerns about the process. ""In the other contacts he reiterated his concerns about the process and told me about proposals he was making to the Scottish government for mediation and arbitration. ""However I was always clear that I had no role in the process and I did not seek to intervene in it at any stage, nor indeed did I feel under any pressure to do so."" There were smiles and handshakes for Alex Salmond's legal team at the Court of Session, but it was a day of mixed feelings for the former first minister. In the very room where he was sworn into Scotland's highest office, Mr Salmond found himself taking legal action against the government he once led. Addressing the media outside, the former SNP leader said he was at once ""delighted"" to have won, but ""sad"" that it had come about in court. And he turned almost every question to the future of the government's permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, who he says is responsible for the ""abject surrender"". He was careful not to direct any ire towards his successor, Nicola Sturgeon. She says she has full confidence in her most senior civil servant - and has insisted the government's processes are robust, despite the ""deeply regrettable"" failure to apply them properly in this case. Away from the politics, this is the end of the judicial review, but it's by no means the end of the road. A police investigation into the complaints against Mr Salmond continues, and has not been affected by this court case in any way. And the government has confirmed that the complaints it received in January 2018 have not been withdrawn - so the option of re-investigating them remains on the table, once the police probe has run its course. In astatement released immediately after the case was resolved,external, Ms Evans said she wanted to ""apologise to all involved for the failure in the proper application of this one particular part of the procedure"", and in particular the two complainers. But she insisted: ""There is nothing to suggest that the investigating officer did not conduct their duties in an impartial way. ""Unfortunately, the interactions with the complainants in advance of the complaints being made meant that the process was flawed, however impartially and fairly the investigating officer conducted the investigation."" Ms Evans stressed that it was ""right and proper that these complaints were investigated"", and that the ""procedural flaw in the investigation does not have implications, one way or the other, for the substance of the complaints or the credibility of the complainers"". And she said it was open to the Scottish government to re-investigate the complaints, adding that ""subject to the views of the complainants, it would be our intention to consider this"". But Ms Evans said this would ""only be once ongoing police inquiries have concluded"". A four-day hearing on the case had been due to begin at the Court of Session in Edinburgh next week, but that will now not go ahead. The allegations against Mr Salmond date back to 2013, when he was still first minister. He has described the claims as ""patently ridiculous"". The former MSP and MP, who lost his Westminster seat in the 2017 general election,resigned from the SNP in Augustbut said on Tuesday he wants to rejoin. Salmond 'sad' at taking government to court.

Egypt 'recovers smuggled artefact' from UK,"The archaeological item is said to be part of a tablet carving of Egyptian King Amenhotep I An ancient Egyptian artefact illegally smuggled out of the country has been returned after being displayed at an auction hall in London, officials say. It was retrieved following searches of international auction websites, Egypt's ministry of antiquities said. Steps were then taken to stop the sale and withdraw the listing, the ministry added in a Facebook post. It is not clear how or when the relic, a cartouche of King Amenhotep I, was originally smuggled out of the country. The archaeological item was earlier exhibited at the open museum of the ancient Temple of Karnak in the city of Luxor,external, the ministry's director-general, Shaaban Abdel Gawad, said. The antiquities ministry worked with the Egyptian foreign ministry, Egypt's embassy in London and British authorities to recover the section of tablet, he said, adding that the embassy in London had received it last September. The artefact was displayed at the Temple of Karnak in Luxor, a popular tourist site Egypt has stepped up efforts to stop the trafficking of its antiquities in recent years. The country has warned that it will not co-operate with foreign museums in relation to exhibits on ancient Egyptian sites unless smuggled artefacts are returned. Earlier this month, it was announced thatthe only casing stone from the Great Pyramid of Giza to be displayed anywhere outside Egypt will be on showat the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh from 8 February. The large block of fine white limestone will be on public view for the first time since it arrived in Scotland in 1872.

"Police under pressure over MP harassmentThe Commons Speaker calls the abuse of MPs ""a type of fascism"" and urges tougher police action.UK Politics","This video can not be played Brexit protesters chant ""Nazi and scum"" at Conservative MP Anna Soubry Speaker John Bercow has described the abuse and harassment of MPs outside Parliament as ""a type of fascism"" and called for a change of policing policy. He said recent incidents, includingTory MP Anna Soubry being verbally abusedon Monday, were ""intolerable"". At least 115 MPs have called on police to improve their response to abusive protesters outside Parliament. The Metropolitan Police has said it is ready to ""deal robustly"" with any instances of criminal harassment. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Laurence Taylor said the force was assessing whether any crimes had been committed, following a third-party report of a public order offence on College Green, opposite the Houses of Parliament. He said Scotland Yard will be ""enhancing the policing presence"" in the run-up to next week's vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal. Revised advice was issued to MPs by Parliament security on Tuesday. Meanwhile, a man has been arrested on suspicion of trespassing after he tried to get into Parliament. Armed officers arrested him at about 19:20 GMT on Tuesday after he got through Carriage Gates, at the entrance to the Houses of Parliament. He was taken to a police station, the Metropolitan Police said. The incident is not being treated as terror-related. Why do broadcasters use College Green? May: 'Be careful about language' on Brexit 'I'm frightened for my safety' - MP The BBC has no plans to stop broadcasting from College Green but does not intend to report from there every day. A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We are working closely with authorities and other broadcasters to ensure the safety of our reporters and interviewees at all times."" Ms Soubry was shouted at - including being called a liar and a Nazi - during live TV interviews on BBC News and Sky. The former minister - a supporter of a fresh Brexit referendum - was later called ""scum"" and jostled as she tried to re-enter the Palace of Westminster. She criticised police for not intervening and called for the protesters to be prosecuted under public order laws. This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""The real concern is the threat to democracy"" Section 5 of the 1986 Public Order Act means that ""threatening or abusive words or behaviour, or disorderly behaviour"" might be deemed a criminal offence. But Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) and Article 11 (right to freedom of peaceful assembly and to freedom of association) of the European Convention on Human Rights contain the rights to peaceful protest. College Green is regularly used by media to interview politicians, as well as being a popular site for protesters to gather. Social media abuse of politicians' staff Abusive tweets to MPs 'more than double' Ms Soubry told the BBC she had ""no problem with people protesting"", saying this was a ""very small group of far-right extremists who just want to undermine democracy"". The MP for Broxtowe said: ""There is a very clear distinction between peaceful, lawful protest and robust debate - holding MPs to account, and it can be face to face - and some of the scenes we have seen in the last six weeks here at Parliament."" The cross-party group of MPs who have signed the letter - which includes those both for and against Brexit - said many of the concerns had been ""repeatedly raised"" with officers and senior policing staff. ""We write to express our serious concerns about the deteriorating public order and security situation in and around the exterior of the Parliamentary estate including College Green,"" the letter, co-ordinated by Labour MP Stephen Doughty, read. This video can not be played John Bercow: ""This situation cannot stand"" ""After months of peaceful and calm protests by groups representing a range of political views on Brexit, an ugly element of individuals with strong far-right and extreme right connections - which your officers are well aware of - have increasingly engaged in intimidatory and potentially criminal acts targeting Members of Parliament, journalists, activists and members of the public."" The letter said there appeared to be a ""lack of co-ordination in the response from the police and appropriate authorities"". This video can not be played Anna Soubry: ""This is astonishing. This is what has happened to our country"" Sky News presenter Kay Burley said the ""increasingly vile, aggressive and intimidating"" abuse had forced her to change her own route to Parliament and she now had to have security protection. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she had been interviewed three times by the police about the situation, but the protesters knew their rights and what they could and couldn't get away with. But she added: ""How far does it have to escalate before the police have to take it seriously?"" Labour's Mary Creagh said the ""really vile, misogynistic thuggery"" that had been seen was not an isolated incident. She pointed to the murder of MP Jo Cox,who was killed in her West Yorkshire constituency by right-wing extremist Thomas Mair in June 2016. Commons Speaker John Bercow said he was ""concerned"" about a ""pattern of protest"" targeting female MPs and journalists and called it a ""type of fascism"". In his letter to the Met Police chief on Tuesday, he said he recognised it was ""a difficult job striking the balance between allowing peaceful protests and intervening when things turn sour"". But he added: ""It's one thing demonstrating from a distance with placards, or calling out slogans - and another, where the protester invades the personal space of a member, subjects him or her to a tirade of menacing, racist, sexist and misogynistic abuse, and follows them back to their place of work."" Met Police commissioner Cressida Dick took up the job in 2017 Labour MP Jess Phillips, who has previously spoken out against online abuse, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme that some protesters were ""organised right-wing groups"" trying to ""scare our politicians into making decisions based on fringe views"". ""People deserve to be safe at work,"" the Birmingham Yardley MP said. ""I didn't come here to be bullied by far-right bullies, far-left bullies, or anyone, we came here to do what we felt was best."" Also on Monday, political commentator Owen Jones published a video on Twitter that he had recorded while being followed and shouted at by a group of protesters outside Parliament. Last month, a video emerged of prominent Brexiteer Michael Gove being accosted by a protester dressed as Santa as he walked to Parliament. Mr Bercow said he was aware of protests in recent weeks around the Palace of Westminster ""involving aggressive and threatening behaviour towards members by assorted groups that have donned the yellow vests seen in France"" - a reference to last year's ""gilet jaune"" anti-government demonstrations. Jump in far-right extremism referrals Far-right 'moving increasingly online' By Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent A recognisable figure in the group that surrounded Anna Soubry on Monday is online far-right campaigner James Goddard. He says there can be no peace while Islam exists in the West and that the establishment is riven with paedophiles. He told police outside Parliament they were ""fair game"" and ""if you want a war, we will give you a war"". Mr Goddard emerged as a DIY far-right campaigner last year as he began to gather followers after campaigning in support of the then-jailed anti-Islam activist, Stephen Lennon aka Tommy Robinson. Before the incident at Parliament involving Ms Soubry, he'd been helping to organise France-style ""yellow vest"" protests - including attempts to block bridges in London. Mr Goddard relies on donations from his followers - he frequently runs crowdfunding appeals for his campaigns. On Tuesday evening, Facebook confirmed it has closed his account. ""We will not tolerate hate speech on Facebook which creates an environment of intimidation and which may provoke real-world violence,"" said a spokesman. Minutes later, his separate Paypal crowdfunding page disappeared too. No 10 said the incident was ""unacceptable"" and MPs ""should be free to do their jobs without any form of intimidation"". The BBC and other broadcasters have set up temporary studios on College Green ahead of the Commons vote on Mrs May's Brexit deal on 15 January. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said some MPs had expressed unease privately about being interviewed there, given the frequency and vehemence of the protests.

Slender Man stabbing teen appeals sentenceOne of the girls convicted of trying to kill to impress Slender Man asks for sentence reduction.,"A US teenager convicted of trying to kill her friend in order to please the fictional online character Slender Man has asked for her sentence to be reduced. Morgan Geyser is serving 40 years in a psychiatric hospital after the near fatal attack in Wisconsin in May 2014. Along with her classmate Anissa Weier, she lured Payton Leutner into woods and stabbed her 19 times. Payton managed to crawl free on to a path and survived. All three girls were 12 at the time. Geyser stood trial for attempted first-degree intentional homicide in adult court, where crimes that severe are usually heard. Her lawyers claim that because Geyser believed Slender Man would hurt her family if she didn't kill Payton, she should have instead stood trial for the second-degree version in youth court. As a juvenile, the 12-year-old would have been locked up for a maximum of three years if found guilty and then supervised until she was 18 but, as it was, the judge gave her the full sentence prosecutors asked for - arguing she was a risk to herself and others. The appeal also argues that when she agreed to be interviewed by detectives at the time, resulting in her confession, Morgan Geyser wouldn't have been able to understand what rights she had given up. Doctors gave conflicting opinions on the severity of her mental health and the treatment she needed. Slender Man isthought to have originatedfrom an internet competition in 2009, which asked for a modern myth that could terrify people. He's described in fictional stories as an unnaturally tall, thin, demon-like figure that lacks facial features, lives in a mansion in a forest and abducts children. Authorities say the girls had hoped to live in that fictional home after the attack. The film Slender Man was released in 2018 based on the story of the character.

Trump demands funds to end border 'crisis',"This video can not be played Trump v Democrats on the border wall and government shutdown US President Donald Trump has made his first TV address to the nation from the Oval Office, escalating a stand-off with Congress that has led to an 19-day partial government shutdown. Mr Trump insisted on funding for his long-promised border wall with Mexico. However, he did not declare an emergency that would enable him to bypass the lower house of Congress now controlled by the opposition Democrats. Democratic leaders accused him of holding the American people hostage. Is there a crisis on the US-Mexico border? Read Trump and Democrats' speeches in full Fourteen ways the US shutdown is hurting The Republican president wants $5.7bn (Â£4.5bn) to build a steel barrier, which would deliver on a key campaign pledge. But Democrats - who recently took control of the House of Representatives - are adamantly opposed to giving him the funds. The ongoing closure of a quarter of federal agencies is the second-longest in history, leaving hundreds of thousands of government workers unpaid. In an eight-minute live address on Tuesday night, he blamed the Democrats for the government shutdown. The situation at the border was, he said, a ""humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul"". Mexico, he said, would pay for the wall through a revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which is yet to be ratified. Economists have disputed this. Mexico has never agreed to pay for the wall. The president also said that 90% of heroin sold in the US comes from Mexico, though US government figures make clear all but a small percentage is smuggled through legal points of entry. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall Mr Trump correctly pointed out that Democrats including Mr Schumer had voted for a physical barrier to cover 700 miles (1,120km) in 2006. Mr Trump also cited cases of American citizens ""savagely murdered in cold blood"" by undocumented immigrants. On Thursday, he is due to visit the actual border. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer demanded that Mr Trump end the shutdown. ""The fact is the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge,"" said Mrs Pelosi. How much of Trump's wall has been built? Six things that could topple Trump's border wall She accused President Trump of ""holding the American people hostage"" and ""manufacturing a crisis"". Mr Schumer accused Mr Trump of trying to ""govern by temper tantrum"" and appealing to ""fear, not facts"". Democrats argue that maintaining existing border fencing, using high-tech tools to scan vehicles at ports of entry and hiring more personnel would be cheaper and more effective than a wall. There were two audiences for Donald Trump's address to the nation on Tuesday night. The first was the American public, who polls indicate are generally uninterested in his border wall proposal, viewing the president as responsible for the government shutdown. The other was Republicans in Congress, who Mr Trump needs to keep in the fold if he is going to get anything out of this extended political confrontation. It seems unlikely that the president said anything that will move the needle with the public at large. The arguments were familiar - and some have already been debunked. The president has been saying there's a ""crisis"" at the border practically since he first started campaigning for the job. As for congressional Republicans, the speech was a demonstration that Mr Trump is going to use every arrow in his presidential quiver to get his wall. The president may have bought himself a bit more time for negotiations. It's just not clear what good it will do him. The border is 1,954 miles long, with about 650 miles of various types of fencing already in place through California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. Fencing along the US-Mexican border at Ciudad Juarez Mr Trump says much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. Border authorities say work has begun on building improved security infrastructure, and money made available has largely been tied to existing barrier designs. Illegal border crossings fell from 1.6 million in 2000 to fewer than 400,000 last year, and research indicates that undocumented immigrants are much less likely to commit crime than native-born American citizens. On Friday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said nearly 4,000 known or suspected terrorists had been caught attempting to enter America illegally, and referred to the Mexican border as the ""most vulnerable point of entry"". White House adviser Kellyanne Conway said later that Ms Sanders had been referring to US government figures for 2017, when 3,775 known or suspected terrorists were prevented from entering America. What it feels like to cross the US border Six surprising statistics about immigrants in the US A clarification by the US department for homeland security states that most of these interceptions occurred at airports,externalwhile adding, ""The number of terror-watchlisted individuals encountered at our Southern Border has increased over the last two years. The exact number is sensitive..."" Only six immigrants on a federal watch list were stopped on the southern border in the first half of 2018. He is backed by most of his party, although a handful of moderate Republican senators have called for an end to the shutdown before the border wall issue is resolved. The sole Republican among the nine Congress members who represent southern border districts is, like his Democratic colleagues,opposed to Mr Trump's wall plan,external, CBS News reports. A new opinion poll suggests just over half of Americans (51%) blame President Trump for the government shutdown. However, 77% of Republicans say they support his refusal to approve a budget without taxpayer dollars for the US-Mexico border wall, according to the Reuters/Ipsos poll. In theory, it would allow the president to bypass the usual political process, and access military spending to fund his barrier. Analysts say such a declaration may still follow. But the president would be accused of usurping Congress's constitutional power of the purse, and the move would be bogged down in a quagmire of legal challenges.

Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall?,"This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall US President Donald Trump plans to make use of emergency powers to secure funding for his proposed US-Mexico border wall. Invoking a national emergency could enable Mr Trump to bypass Congress and access military funds and resources. But what are these emergency powers, and is using them that simple? A state of emergency is usually declared in times of national crisis. In this case, Mr Trump has claimed there is a migration crisis on the US-Mexico border. Declaring a national emergency gives the president ""access to special powers that are contained in more than 100 other laws"", said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program. Those powers effectively allow the president to bypass the usual political process. ""Obviously, the intent is to provide for badly needed flexibility when there are urgent crises which Congress does not have time to address,"" Ms Goitein said. Isthere really a border emergency? More than 2,000 people were turned away or arrested at the border each day during November 2018. Supporters of Mr Trump's plans for a wall have said the numbers constitute an emergency. Others argue the migration across the southern border is far lower than a decade ago, and many of the thousands of people who travelled north from countries like Honduras are presenting themselves as asylum seekers, looking to enter the country legally. 6 things that could topple Donald Trump's border wall How much of Trump's wall has been built? Ms Goitein, an expert on presidential emergency powers, said she did not believe the situation constituted a national emergency. ""It needs to be something fast-moving, totally unforeseen, it is meant to be a stopgap measure,"" she said. ""This is not such a thing and it would be a tremendous abuse of power to invoke just to short-circuit the political process."" Ms Goitein pointed to two sections of the law which Mr Trump could take advantage of. One would allow the redirection of funds for military projects already approved by Congress, the other would require the administration to prove the wall amounts to a military construction. Neither are a ""slam dunk"" for the president, who must cite one of the laws as the legal basis for his declaration, Ms Goitein said. The National Emergencies Act contains a clause that allows Congress to terminate the emergency status - provided both houses agree and the president does not veto. With a comfortable majority in the House, Democrats could pass such a resolution to the Senate. The Republicans control the Senate, but a number of Republican senators have been vocal in their unease about the president invoking a national emergency. The dissenting Republicans include 2012 presidential candidate and new senator for Utah Mitt Romney, the Florida senator Marco Rubio, and the senator from Alaska Lisa Murkowski, who said the move was ""of dubious constitutionality"". The resolution would however still require Mr Trump's signature to pass, allowing him to veto it. A supermajority in both houses of Congress is needed to overturn a presidential veto. Harry Truman, pictured in 1953, tried - unsuccessfully - to use the powers There is another option of blocking the move through the courts - which is what happened when President Harry Truman tried to nationalise the steel industry during the Korean War, setting a legal precedent. ""If Harry Truman couldn't nationalise the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border,"" Adam Schiff, the House intelligence committee chairman, told CNN. How frequently do presidents usetheemergencyact? Mr Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, used it 13 times, while his predecessor George W Bush used it 12 times. If Mr Trump goes ahead with declaring a national emergency, it would be the fourth of his administration. But emergency declarations by previous presidents have been overwhelmingly used for addressing foreign policy crises - including blocking terrorism-linked entities from accessing funds or prohibiting investment in nations associated with human rights abuses. ""It's extremely rare for a president to declare a national emergency in a bid to fund domestic construction projects, particularly one that Congress has explicitly refused to fund,"" Andrew Boyle, an attorney in the national security program at the Brennan Center for Justice, told the Associated Press news agency. ""The ones that former presidents declared are of a different sort."" Mr Trump's decision to apply the powers to overcome a partisan impasse over border security has struck politicians on both sides of the aisle as a deviation from the intended use of the act. ""It would be a pretty dramatic expansion of how this was used in the past,"" said the Republican senator Ron Johnson. Some previous uses were for issues like the H1N1 influenza epidemic and have since ended. Others are more general and continue to this day, like blocking the property of people ""engaging in significant malicious cyber-enabled activities"". Perhaps the most well-known occasion a president used his powers was in the case of Franklin D Roosevelt, who used them to order the internment of more than 110,000 Japanese-Americans in the months after the 1941 attack on Pearl Harbour. George W Bush used emergency powers in the wake of the 11 September 2001 World Trade Centre attack to sign off wiretapping and interrogation methods later decried as torture.

Can Parliament stop a no-deal Brexit?,"There's a big problem facing members of Parliament who want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. They can't just show there is a majority in the House of Commons against no deal - they need to prove there is a majority in favour of an alternative outcome. That's because leaving the EU - with or without a deal - is currently the default. If the prime minister fails to get a deal through the House of Commons, the UK will leave with no deal at all unless something changes, because leaving the EU is written into UK law. The EU Withdrawal Act sets 29 March as the date of departure. The wording of the act does allow a minister to change the definition of ""exit day"" relatively quickly using a statutory instrument - a piece of secondary legislation - rather than an entirely new act of Parliament that would need to be debated. A minister would have to propose the change and MPs would have to approve it. But there is a second and more significant reason why no deal would become the default position: that's what EU law says. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the formal route for any country leaving the EU and it allows for a two-year process of negotiation. At the end of that period ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. The most obvious way therefore to stop a no-deal Brexit, or any form of Brexit, is to revoke Article 50. Minister talks down Brexit delay claim Bid to limit tax powers if no-deal Brexit Is the EU about to rescue Theresa May? TheEuropean Court of Justice has ruledthe UK can do that on its own, without asking the other 27 countries, and stay a member of the EU on its current terms - including opting-out of key policies, and keeping the budget rebate. But it seems highly unlikely that the House of Commons would vote to revoke Article 50 unless there had been another referendum, or maybe an election, in which the public backed the UK remaining in the EU. The government rejects the idea of holding another referendum anyway - and the time to do so before the end of March has run out. So, the other way to avoid a no-deal Brexit in the short term is to play for time and extend the Article 50 period. The government would need to propose that and MPs would have to approve it. But, crucially, unlike in the case of revoking Article 50, to extend it the UK would also need the agreement of all 27 other EU countries. It would probably need to persuade them that something important had changed in UK politics to warrant an extension - perhaps a looming election, or another referendum, rather than more of the same argument. One of the constraints for the rest of the EU is that European elections will take place at the end of May and the new European Parliament (without UK MEPs if Brexit has taken place) is due to meet for the first time in July. The only other circumstance in which a brief extension to Article 50 would probably be approved by the EU is if there had been a vote in favour of Theresa May's deal but a little more time was needed to dot the ""i""s and cross the ""t""s. But if Article 50 was extended without a deal passing the House of Commons, no deal would still remain the default outcome at the end of the extended negotiating period. In a word, amendments. An amendment to the Finance Bill, limiting the Treasury's ability to make no-deal preparations unless authorised by Parliament, was backed by MPs by 303 to 296 votes. This amendment will make it ""harder for the government to drift into no deal without Parliament being able to direct it"", according to Labour MP Yvette Cooper. A cross-party coalition of MPs against no deal is now flexing its muscles, and what we're likely to see over the next couple of months is what some are calling ""guerrilla warfare by amendment"" in the House of Commons. Yvette Cooper says her amendment has support from Remain and Leave MPs The trade bill is likely to be another target - it would be needed in the event of no deal, to try to keep the UK trading on the same terms as it has now with the rest of the world. The idea behind all this parliamentary manoeuvring is to demonstrate that there is a clear majority in the House of Commons against no deal. But none of it, taken in isolation, will prevent the Article 50 clock ticking away until it stops at the end of March. That's why a growing number of MPs support the idea of holding a series of ""indicative votes"" on different potential outcomes, to try to find an alternative to no deal that would enjoy broad  (or even sufficient) support. Senior MPs argue that the government would be unable to ignore the political pressure if the will of the House of Commons was clearly expressed on numerous occasions. But political pressure is not the same as legal reality. Three ministers have said publicly they would resign if the government pursued a no-deal strategy, while others are thought to hold the same position in private. A handful of backbench MPs have said they would quit the party. The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, is understood to have told cabinet that history would take a dim view of the government if it accepted no deal and it would leave the UK a less safe country. But if the prime minister did decide to press on regardless, it may well be that the only way MPs could stop a no-deal Brexit at the last moment would be to vote down the government itself. UPDATE -This article was updated on Wednesday 9 Jan to include the new amendment asking government to return to Parliament with new plans within three days of a vote against the Prime Minister's withdrawal deal.

Government loses Brexit measure vote,"MPs continue debate on the governmentâs Brexit deal They will vote on whether to approve the deal next Tuesday MPs usually debate private members' bills on a Friday Richard Morris, Sophie Morris and Robbie Hawkins The UK and EU begin a new relationship on 1 January 2021. Brexit officially happened on 31 January but the UK is now in a transition period until the end of 2020. Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says the PM should strike 29 March as Brexit day from UK law if her deal is voted down. House of CommonsParliament With the completion of the debate on Brexit, the Commons adjourns until next week. On Monday, the Brexit debate continues after questions and any urgent questions or statements. Then, on Tuesday, it's the final day of debate followed by the big vote on whether or not Parliament approves the agreement reached between the UK and EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt says that the government ""has made it clear"" that EU citizens rights will be protected whether or not the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He says he thinks that he agrees with Julia Lopez, who said that people will no longer trust politicians if Brexit is not delivered. He urges Labour MPs to ""stop playing games"" and reminds them that leave-voting Labour members will ""never forgive them"" if they try to stop Brexit. He adds that there will be no limit on the number of international students who can study in the UK. He concludes by saying that ""we are now in the final stages"" of leaving an organisation which ""has been central to our national life for 46 years"". ""Let us rise to the moment,"" he finishes. With that, the Commons moves on to the adjournment debate. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry says that maybe it's the flu she's suffering, but the debate seems to have a remarkable air of ""deja vu"" about it. She says that the prime minister is ""running around Europe obtaining invisible concessions on Brexit"" and she says there is ""nothing new"" to this document that has changed since 5 December. ""This deal jeopardises all the co-operation we've come to rely with the EU,"" she states. She says that the deal ""cedes control to Europe"" on many areas of UK law. ""Nothing has been achieved from five weeks of delay,"" she adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Mike Gapes says it was the Labour government of Tony Blair which made ""such an impact"" on the development of the European Union. In 1975 he says he was putting out anti-Common Market leaflets the day before a Cambridge final exam, ""the Labour Party is in a bizarre position...we are going for a sensible Brexit,"" but he adds, ""there is no such thing as a jobs first Brexit, it is entirely about mitigating the damage"". He says he doesn't believe that any government would be able to negotiate anything different to what has been proposed. He'll be voting to stay in the European Union if the Commons gets the chance, he adds. 'Rebelling with a heavy heart' Conservative Michael Tomlinson says his constituents have been saying for ""a number of months"" that they just want ""to get on with it"". He adds that the proposal ""does not get on with it"". He says that it is not ""taking back control"". He states that while the UK will not be subject to the CJEU, it will still have ""leverage"" in the UK, and he describes the court as ""highly political"". ""The proposal threatens the integrity"" of the UK, he continues. ""I have never rebelled against the government...and I do so with a heavy heart, but with a clear head,"" he adds. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Julia Lopez says that the political class ""could soon find itself despised"" if it does not do what has been requested in the referendum. The agreement will lead to another ""two years"" of ""discord and indecision"" from warring factions. The UK will ""have given up all our negotiating leverage"", she adds. Labour's Martin Whitfield says ""the big problem is"" that there is no plan for where the country is going. ""Once upon a time were told we'd hold all the cards, and it would be easy,"" he states. He says that ""there is no disrespect in re-evaluating"" a decision when the facts become known. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Another Conservative MP Peter Heaton-Jones says he will also be supporting the prime minister's deal, saying it best represents the desire of the people he represents. He says he and his constituents want to ""get on with it"". Labour's Thangam Debbonaire says she wants an immigration system that Remain and Leave voters can trust. She says she does not believe anyone will be satisfied with the government's proposed immigration system. ""I want to talk about immigration,"" she says. ""I want to see an improved response to refugees...but I don't think I've come across anyone who thinks our current system is working well."" EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir Mike Penning says he will not ""Vote for anything that doesn't protect the union"". He calls on the PM to return to the EU to ""sort the backstop out"". Next is Labour MP Ian Murray, who says there are 77 days to go and ""the stakes could not be higher"". He calls on the government to rule out a no-deal scenario. He says the prime minister has united Leavers and Remainers against the deal, by sticking to the red lines she set down. He calls for a 'People's Vote' on the deal. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate Conservative Kemi Badenoch says she will be supporting the prime minister's deal. She says the guarantees it gives on citizens' rights are important, and asks how MPs could vote against the deal, opening the possibility of no-deal and therefore the loss of citizens' rights. Labour MP Stephen Pound says he was ""seduced"" by Margaret Thatcher and voted to join the European Union. He says the EU set global standards for decency, human rights, freedom and environmental legislation. If we leave the EU on 29 March this year, we must make sure our European brothers and sisters know that we will work with them. ""We will not stop being Europeans,"" he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative James Duddridge says in voting against the deal he feels he is representing his constituents. Labour MP Jim Fitzpatrick says the issue has become toxic, as shown by what has been happening outside and inside Parliament this week. Conservative MP Anna Soubry wassubjected to abusefrom protesters as she did broadcast interviews this week, and other MPs have been on the receiving end of abuse and harassment. He says he is talking himself into talking Theresa May's deal, because of the danger of a no-deal.

Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to stop a no-deal Brexit by backing another referendum. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Rosindell says that his constituents voted 70% to leave, and that nothing has changed their minds. ""I truly believe that our nation is up for this,"" he says. Labour's Matt Western says he ""cannot vote for any deal that will lead to people being worse off"". He says that Parliament is ""seeing the work of an autocratic tendency"" in the prime minister, ""this is not a debate, it is neither leadership,"" he states, referring to how Mrs May says that it is either her deal or no deal. But Tory rebel Dominic Grieve says MPs have a duty to ""stop people committing national suicide"". EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Liberal Democrat Layla Moran says that she was elected to try to stop Brexit. She says she is regularly stopped in the street by constituents who tell her they ""want an end to this mess"". ""We have to be honest with them,"" she says. ""Brexit isn't going to solve"" any of the issues that caused people to vote for it. ""Poll after poll shows that the will of the people has changed since 2016,"" she says, adding that there was breaking of electoral law. ""People should be allowed to change their mind,"" she adds. She says that MPs must ask themselves if this new deal is better than the deal we already have from the EU. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Sir David Amess says he is ""heartily sick of the word Brexit"" and is ""less than pleased"" on how the UK has gone about trying to leave the EU. ""There are a number of reasons why I cannot support this agreement,"" one of them being ""because it threatens the integrity of the United Kingdom"", he says. Labour's Jo Stevens says she will be voting against the deal with the ""overwhelming support"" of her constituents. She says that in the past month nothing has changed, like over the past two years of negotiations. ""The referendum was drenched in illegality by the Vote Leave and Leave.EU campaigns,"" she adds. The result of the referendum does not apply ""in perpetuity"", she says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative Mark Francois says that anyone who would call Remain-supporting MP Sir Nicholas Soames ""a traitor"" ""has clearly never met him"". Anyone who calls him that should ""go away and shut up"", he says. He states that he has been ""fairly consistent"" on European matters during his parliamentary career, in speaking against the EU. He says that the ""political declaration"" is ""legally completely meaningless"", and he adds that it is the ""legal equivalent of 'I promise I will respect you in the morning'"". He adds that he is ""utterly determined to vote against"" the deal. Having just been through ""considerable austerity"" it is wrong to pay Â£39bn to the EU for a deal with ""no guarantees"", he states. The UK is also not ""taking back control of our laws"" as the UK still has to ""obey EU laws"" but has lost the ability to influence them, under the deal, he says. EU Withdrawal Agreement Debate House of CommonsParliament Labour's Luciana Berger says that few of the debates in the Commons have ever had ""such an impact"" on all constituents across the country. She accuses the prime minister of presenting a ""false choice"" of no deal or May's deal. ""It is beyond reproach that this [no deal] option has not been ruled out,"" she criticises the government for spending money on no deal preparations. Constituents will no longer be covered by EU Health Insurance Cards when they go abroad, she states. The NHS ""will suffer as we are are unable to properly recruit from EU countries"", she adds. A no-deal Brexit would ""isolate and hobble Britain's universities"", she says. There are 1.4m young people who are eligible to vote today who weren't before, 74% of her constituents wants a People's Vote, she states. Â© 2025 BBC.

Salmond sexual harassment probe 'unlawful',"This video can not be played Alex Salmond: ""While I am glad about the victory that has been achieved today I am sad it was necessary to take this action."" The Scottish government has admitted acting unlawfully while investigating sexual harassment claims against Alex Salmond. Allegations against the former first minister, which he denies, were made to the Scottish government a year ago. The government has now admitted it breached its own guidelines by appointing an investigating officer who had ""prior involvement"" in the case. As a result, it conceded defeat in its legal fight with Mr Salmond. Mr Salmond's case focused entirely on the fairness of the government's procedures and will have no bearing on a separate police inquiry into the allegations, which is still ongoing. Q&A: Alex Salmond legal victory Who is Leslie Evans? Look back at Sturgeon's statement Speaking outside the Court of Session in Edinburgh, Mr Salmond said the case had resulted in ""abject humiliation"" for the Scottish government, which he led from 2007 until 2014. He added: ""The last time I was in that court was to be sworn in as first minister of Scotland. I never thought it possible that at any point I would be taking the Scottish government to court. ""Therefore while I am glad about the victory which has been achieved today, I am sad that it was necessary to take this action."" This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: ""It is deeply regrettable that we are in the situation that we are in today."" Mr Salmond also repeated his calls for the Scottish government's most senior civil servant, Leslie Evans, to consider her position, and warned that the case could cost the public purse Â£500,000. And he thanked the 4,000 people who contributed more than Â£100,000 to a crowdfunding appeal to help pay for his legal challenge to the government's handling of the case. With the government agreeing to pay his legal costs, he said the money will go to good causes in Scotland and elsewhere. The former first minister raised more than Â£100,000 for his case through a crowdfunding appeal The government's admission that it had not followed the correct procedures came during a hearing at the Court of Session on Tuesday morning. Judge Lord Pentland subsequently said that the government's actions had been ""unlawful in respect that they were procedurally unfair"" and had been ""tainted with apparent bias"". The Scottish government's admission centred on an official it appointed to investigate the complaints against Mr Salmond, which were made by two women. Its lawyer, Roddy Dunlop QC, told the court that the investigating officer was a ""dedicated HR professional"" who acted in good faith, but did have some contact with the complainers before being appointed to the case. This video can not be played Lord Pentland told the court the government acted unlawfully Mr Dunlop said this had led the government to accept there had been a ""failure"" in one aspect of the investigation, which could have given the impression that they were not acting impartially. But he said the government did not accept a claim by Mr Salmond's legal team that the investigating officer had effectively been ""assisting the complainers"" and ""giving them encouragement"". He also said there was ""no question of an individual being held up as a sacrifice"", and that the government had a ""duty to investigate the serious complaints"" that had been made. Ms Sturgeon told the Scottish Parliament she has not spoken to Mr Salmond since July of last year Mr Salmond's successor as first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, told BBC Scotland that ""in one particular aspect of the application of this procedure the Scottish government got it wrong"", but that there was ""no suggestion of any partiality in the process"". She also said it was ""not my view"" that Ms Evans, the Scottish government's permanent secretary, should resign. Ms Sturgeon asked Ms Evans to draw up new procedures for handling sexual harassment claims, which the first minister signed-off, shortly before the complaints against Mr Salmond were made in January of last year. The first minister said: ""It is deeply regrettable that we are in the situation we are in today, not least for the complainants who had a right to expect that this process would be in every respect robust. ""I think the permanent secretary was absolutely right when these complaints came forward to subject them to an investigation and not to sweep them under the carpet because of the identity of the person complained about. ""That principle remains - the Scottish government, like any organisation has a duty when it gets things wrong to learn the lessons so that people who have complaints in the future feel confident in bringing them."" Ms Sturgeon has backed her permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, despite Mr Salmond calling for her to resign She later told the Scottish Parliament that she had met Mr Salmond three times after the complaints against him were made -  at her home in Glasgow on 2 April, on 7 June ahead of the SNP conference in Aberdeen, and at her home on 7 July. Ms Sturgeon added: ""I also spoke with him on the telephone on 23 of April and 18 July. I have not spoken to Alex Salmond since 18 July. ""On 2 April he informed me about the complaints against him, which of course in line with the procedure the permanent secretary had not done, and he set out his various concerns about the process. ""In the other contacts he reiterated his concerns about the process and told me about proposals he was making to the Scottish government for mediation and arbitration. ""However I was always clear that I had no role in the process and I did not seek to intervene in it at any stage, nor indeed did I feel under any pressure to do so."" There were smiles and handshakes for Alex Salmond's legal team at the Court of Session, but it was a day of mixed feelings for the former first minister. In the very room where he was sworn into Scotland's highest office, Mr Salmond found himself taking legal action against the government he once led. Addressing the media outside, the former SNP leader said he was at once ""delighted"" to have won, but ""sad"" that it had come about in court. And he turned almost every question to the future of the government's permanent secretary, Leslie Evans, who he says is responsible for the ""abject surrender"". He was careful not to direct any ire towards his successor, Nicola Sturgeon. She says she has full confidence in her most senior civil servant - and has insisted the government's processes are robust, despite the ""deeply regrettable"" failure to apply them properly in this case. Away from the politics, this is the end of the judicial review, but it's by no means the end of the road. A police investigation into the complaints against Mr Salmond continues, and has not been affected by this court case in any way. And the government has confirmed that the complaints it received in January 2018 have not been withdrawn - so the option of re-investigating them remains on the table, once the police probe has run its course. In astatement released immediately after the case was resolved,external, Ms Evans said she wanted to ""apologise to all involved for the failure in the proper application of this one particular part of the procedure"", and in particular the two complainers. But she insisted: ""There is nothing to suggest that the investigating officer did not conduct their duties in an impartial way. ""Unfortunately, the interactions with the complainants in advance of the complaints being made meant that the process was flawed, however impartially and fairly the investigating officer conducted the investigation."" Ms Evans stressed that it was ""right and proper that these complaints were investigated"", and that the ""procedural flaw in the investigation does not have implications, one way or the other, for the substance of the complaints or the credibility of the complainers"". And she said it was open to the Scottish government to re-investigate the complaints, adding that ""subject to the views of the complainants, it would be our intention to consider this"". But Ms Evans said this would ""only be once ongoing police inquiries have concluded"". A four-day hearing on the case had been due to begin at the Court of Session in Edinburgh next week, but that will now not go ahead. The allegations against Mr Salmond date back to 2013, when he was still first minister. He has described the claims as ""patently ridiculous"". The former MSP and MP, who lost his Westminster seat in the 2017 general election,resigned from the SNP in Augustbut said on Tuesday he wants to rejoin. Salmond 'sad' at taking government to court.

Delays as lighting fails at Paddington,"One of London's main railway terminuses was plunged into darkness late on Tuesday when the station lights failed. Paddington Station was illuminated by little more than shop lighting and digital display boards, as station staff used torches to guide passengers. Network Rail said engineers were sent to identify the cause of the problem, which arose at about 22:00 GMT and triggered delays to some services. A spokesman said the lights were restored at about 01:30 on Wednesday. Passengers had been advised tocheck live information,externalbefore travelling but most services were running on time ahead of Wednesday's rush hour. Paddington connects South Wales and the West of England to London, serving stations including Reading, Oxford, Cardiff, Exeter St David's and Penzance. BBC journalist Patrick Jackson arrived at a gloomier-than-normal station at about 23:15 GMT on Tuesday. He said lights above platforms one to four went out about five minutes later.

""It was pretty dark by the platforms,"" he said. ""It was a bit weird but there was no panic. ""People just stood there waiting. They didn't want to bring trains into the station in the dark but we saw two crawling in and we boarded about 20 minutes later. ""The staff just turned on their torches and phones and were directing us towards the carriages."" Mr Jackson said his Cardiff-bound train left about 20 minutes late. Shortly after midnight, a Network Rail spokesman told the BBC the problem was affecting services arriving at and departing from Paddington but that the station remained open for overnight travellers. ""We are telling passengers to check before they travel. We have got engineers on site to try to work out the cause and fix the problem,"" he added.

World economy faces 'darkening skies',"The predicted slowdown is focused on rich countries, particularly the US The World Bank is warning of increasing risks, or what it calls ""darkening skies"", for the world economy. In its annual assessment of global prospects the Bank predicts continued, though somewhat slower, growth this year and next. The Bank's forecast for the global economy is expansion this year of 2.9% and 2.8% in 2020. But overhanging the broadly favourable outlook are rising concerns that could mean economic performance falls short. There is certainly some good news in this report. While the global economy is slowing down it's likely to be what the Bank's economists call a ""soft landing"". The slowdown started in the middle of last year and it has so far been ""orderly"". The predicted slowdown is focused on the rich countries, particularly the US, although it will continue to expand more rapidly than either the Eurozone or Japan according to the Bank's forecasts. The US slowdown is the result of the fading impact of President Trump's tax cuts and by 2021 its growth will have almost halved - to 1.6% compared with 2.9% last year. On the other hand, growth in emerging markets and developing economies is likely to gather pace somewhat despite the continued cooling down in China - a process which began at the start of the decade. By 2021 growth in China is expected to be 6%, which is still pretty strong, but it is a marked change of gear for an economy that expanded by an average of 10% annually between 1980 and 2010. Franziska Ohnsorge, a World Bank economist and lead author of the report said in a BBC interview: ""In China it's policy engineered, a very deliberate slowdown towards more stable long term growth."" That is what the Bank thinks is the likely performance of the world economy over the next few years. But there are risks that could mean that it doesn't work out so well. That is reflected in the title of this year's report: ""Darkening Skies"". Some of the clouds are familiar ones. International commerce is already weakening, and conflict over trade especially between the US and China is one of the major risks. These are the two largest national economies on the planet. The Bank has calculated that 2.5% of global trade is affected by the new tariffs - trade taxes - that were imposed last year, and it would be double that if the further tariffs that have been discussed were implemented. The risk of rising protection remains high, the report says.  It could depress economic activity in these two giant economies. Slower growth in China is particularly an issue for developing countries that export industrial commodities, energy and metals, as China is such a big buyer of these products. Franziska Ohnsorge says between them the US and China account for 20% of global trade and 40% of global GDP. If their economies are both hit she says, ""it's something that's felt all around [the world]"". The Bank does not expect a recession in either of these economies, though some commentators are now suggesting the US could be heading for one next year. But if it were to happen the risk of a global recession would increase sharply.  In the past, the report says, the risk of a global recession in any one year was 7%. But if the US has a downturn, the probability goes up to 50%. Financial markets are also a risk. The chances of disorderly developments have increased.  If interest rates are increased again in the US, or if the dollar gains sharply, it could have an impact on emerging and developing economies. Brexit appears in the Bank's assessment as a possible risk for countries that are especially reliant on selling to Europe. If the UK's exit takes place with no agreement there is a chance of significant economic damage to both the UK and the EU which could then affect countries in Eastern Europe and North Africa which are closely integrated with Europe. And even in the Bank's central, relatively optimistic, picture there are some depressing prospects for parts of the developing world - which is the group the World Bank exists to help. For about a third of countries concerned growth in per capita terms won't be enough to restart what the report calls ""the catch-up"" with the developed world, the narrowing of the gap between living standards. And in Sub-Saharan Africa per capita growth is likely to be less than 1%, insufficient to drive significant progress in alleviating poverty.

Trump appeals to US TV audience over wallHe will argue the case for the border barrier in his first primetime address from the Oval Office.,"US President Donald Trump is set to argue that an immigration ""crisis"" requires his long-promised wall along the Mexican border. Mr Trump will make his case in his first speech from the Oval Office at 21:00EST (0200 GMT Wednesday), ahead of a trip to the border on Thursday. A partial government shutdown has been in effect for 17 days after lawmakers failed to break a budget impasse. The president is insisting that $5bn (Â£4bn) be included for the border wall. Can Trump use emergency powers to build wall? The impact of the government shutdown Shutdown 'embarrassing' to US tech industry White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a tweet that Mr Trump would use his visit to the border on Thursday to ""meet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis"". Ahead of the speech on Tuesday, Vice-President Mike Pence said Mr Trump's decision to address the nation ""comes from this president's deep desire to do his job to protect the American people"". Donald Trump says there is a growing crisis along the US-Mexico border that demands immediate and drastic action. The challenge for Mr Trump is that he has been calling for a wall - a bigger, longer one - since he announced his presidential bid in 2015. That has made it hard for his opponents to believe there is a new situation that requires the same solution, except smaller and shorter. What's more, administration officials have been vague - perhaps intentionally - on the numbers supporting their claims. They say 4,000 ""terrorists"" have been caught entering the US, but it turns out most stops happen at airports. There have been only a handful apprehended at the Mexican border (fewer than at the border with Canada). The White House has recently painted this as a humanitarian problem - and Central American families are, in fact, fleeing poverty and violence. But can he make the case that a wall is the humanitarian answer, and not just a way of making refugee suffering less visible to Americans? The president must convince a sceptical public that his wall is worth the pain the shutdown is causing government workers and the nation at large. He has eight minutes on Tuesday to do it. This video can not be played Five questions about Trump's border wall The decision by the major US TV networks to set aside at least eight minutes of airtime for the speech has sparked controversy and fuelled debate on social media. Critics pointed out that the networks aired President George W Bush's prime-time address on immigration in 2006, but did not air one by President Barack Obama in 2014. Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer announced on Tuesday that they would deliver a joint rebuttal from the halls of Congress after Mr Trump has spoken. Some reporters have called on the White House to provide the text of his remarks in advance to be fact-checked. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Monday, living former US presidents disputed Mr Trump's claim that some of them had privately told him they regretted not building a border wall during their administrations. ""I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump, and do not support him on the issue,"" former President Jimmy Carter said in a statement issued by the Carter Center on Monday. A spokesman for George W Bush said he had never discussed the border wall with Mr Trump. A representative for Bill Clinton denied it and said that the two men had not spoken since Mr Trump took office, according to CBS. Mr Obama has not explicitly denied Mr Trump's claim, but has extensively campaigned against the president on the issue. In Mr Pence's interview with NBC on Tuesday,external, he sought to clarify the president's original claim, saying ""that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents"". ""I know I've seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security, the importance of addressing the issue of illegal immigration,"" he added. Mr Trump will visit the US-Mexico border on Thursday The White House has been under fire amid a partial government shutdown, which began on 22 December and affects a quarter of the government. Some 800,000 federal employees have been temporarily laid off - or are working without pay. Nine departments have been affected, including Homeland Security, Justice, Housing, Agriculture, Commerce, Interior and the Treasury. US media are reporting that Mr Trump will not declare a national emergency on Tuesday evening, in a bid to launch construction of a wall by circumventing Congress. US law allows the president to direct military construction projects during war or national emergency, but that money would have to come from defence department funds allocated by Congress for other purposes,the BBC's Anthony Zurcher says. Such a move would prompt members of Congress who are tasked with allocating tax money - including some Republicans - to push back, he says. Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president in 2016. During the campaign for the mid-term elections in November 2018, he repeatedly warned of a ""caravan"" of Central American migrants making its way towards the US-Mexico border. In a reaction that many saw as a political ploy during a campaign season, he deployed 5,800 US troops to the border due to what he described as an ""invasion"". Last month, Mr Trump suggested that the US military could be used to build the wall. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
