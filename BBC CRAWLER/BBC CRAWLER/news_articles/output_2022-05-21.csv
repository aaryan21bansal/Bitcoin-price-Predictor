Spain eases Covid entry rules for UK travellers,"Spanish minister Reyes Maroto said lifting the ban was ""excellent news"" for tourism UK citizens who have not had a coronavirus jab can now travel to Spain by showing a negative PCR or antigen test on arrival. The Spanish government confirmed that non-vaccinated travellers from outside the EU can enter the country from Saturday. Fully vaccinated passengers will still need to show proof of vaccination. TheUK removed all its remaining international Covid travel restrictions,externalfor entry on 18 March. This included passenger locator forms and tests for passengers who do not qualify as vaccinated. Other European countries followed suit, with Austria, Greece, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Sweden, Serbia, Slovenia and Slovakia no longer having any Covid travel restrictions for visitors. Previously, heightened restrictions meant UK travellers were only allowed to enter Spain with vaccine certification or proof of recovery from the virus. As thelatest wave of that strain dissipated,countries across the world loosened their Covid travel restrictions to welcome visitors again. Covid infections down again to one in 50, says ONS Vulnerable adults set for autumn Covid booster jab And on Saturday, Spanish tourism minister Reyes Maroto said the ""new phase of the pandemic"" meant the country was able to relax the rules by equating non-EU travellers with those of the EU and Schengen-associated countries. ""This is excellent news, much awaited by the tourism sector,"" said Ms Maroto, adding: ""Spain is becoming one of the most desired destinations in the world."" We love Spain. Mallorca, Marbella and Madrid are some of our holiday favourites. In 2019, 18 million visitors from the UK arrived at Spanish airports - and the Spanish want to see the same numbers hitting their beaches again this year. Demand is high for holiday destinations across Europe, with airlines and tour operators reporting surges for summer sun bookings almost everywhere. But Spain wants to retain its crown as Britain's favourite, and to do that it has to be open to everyone. That's why they've followed European holiday rivals and started allowing unvaccinated travellers - with a negative test - from today. More holidaymakers means more euros arriving and that's good for the Spanish economy, where tourism is crucial. From 21 May, all visitors entering Spain at air or sea borders, wherever they are travelling from, must provide one of the following three certificates: Vaccination certificate meeting the government's requirements A negative test certificate (PCR or similar) Certificate of recovery at least 11 days after testing positive Spain accepts the UK's proof of Covid-19 vaccination record, either digitally, or as a printed download. PCR tests must be carried out in the 72 hours prior to departure to Spain or an antigen test in the 24 hours prior to departure. Proof of recovery certificates will be valid for 180 days from the date of the positive test. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from submitting any type of certificate. Abta says this summer is expected to be the busiest holiday season since the Covid pandemic began Julia Lo Bue-Said from the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel agent group, said: ""This is very good news just ahead of the May half-term and peak season."" Describing it as ""extremely positive"" for holidaymakers and the travel industry, she added: ""However, it is disappointing that Spain has not gone further and removed the need for pre-arrival tests for unvaccinated travellers given the minimal benefit these tests have for public health. ""Consumers want to travel with ease and if destinations prohibit this, then they will go elsewhere."" The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the relaxation of the rules was great news as Spain is the most popular summer holiday destination for Britons. The travel industry trade body said: ""This summer is expected to be the busiest holiday season since the start of the pandemic, with 70% of families saying they have a holiday abroad booked this year."" Abta said that France, Italy, Greece and Portugal were also proving popular. WhileGreece,externalhas scrapped all Covid travel restrictions, the other three countries still require visitors to meet certain entry rules. Travellers either need proof of vaccination or to have taken a negative test before leaving the UK, while Italy and Portugal will also accept a Covid recovery certificate.

How Australia became the anxious country,"Millions of Australians will vote in a federal election on Saturday. But, asks Nick Bryant, is the country's luck running out? Australia feels right now more like an Anxious Country. Gone is the economic swagger that came from its almost 30-year run without plunging into recession. Absent is the kind of hope and expectation that election campaigns are supposed to engender. Instead, it is possible to detect a widespread sense of nervousness that the second quarter of the 21st Century could be more joyless for Australians than the first. Australians face a cost of living crisis, exacerbated by the first hike in interest rates since November 2010. Almost 40% of homeowners are thought to be experiencing mortgage stress. Property prices, which serve almost as a gauge of national wellbeing, are levelling off, and in some places falling. But even though the property boom has subsided, homes remain unaffordable for younger Australians especially. Home improvements - carrying out a ""reno"" is something of a national pastime - are becoming prohibitively expensive because of the spiralling cost of raw materials. Add to that the climate emergency, evident in the once-in-a-century natural disasters that now come along every few years - or in some communities, like Lismore, New South Wales, every few months. During my first stint in Australia eight years ago, I came to look upon this country as the lifestyle superpower of the world. But global warming alone puts that status in peril. Climate change and Covid have challenged Australia's lifestyle There is the ongoing threat from the pandemic, which has had a splintering effect on Australia, a commonwealth of states and territories that have come to feel more like silos. People are tired and exhausted. The sluggish vaccine roll-out and unavailability of rapid antigen tests during the Omicron outbreak undermined the faith in government. Then there is the troublesome relationship with China, the country's largest trading partner, which not only poses an economic threat but a national security dilemma as well. Little more than eight months after the Australian foreign policy establishment went into orgasmic paroxysms of joy over the Aukus nuclear deal signed with the US and UK, it had a freak-out moment over Beijing's security agreement with the Solomon Islands. The deal, fiercely resisted both by Canberra and Washington, raises the spectre of a Chinese military presence in Australia's backyard. The war in Ukraine, and even an unusually grey and wet southern summer and early autumn have contributed to a flat national mood. Things aren't right. Things aren't settled. There is a nagging sense of unease. No longer does Australia feel quite such a Lucky Country - although it is always worth remembering that the term coined by the public intellectual Donald Horne in the mid-1960s was intended to be self-flagellatory rather than self-congratulatory. In his excoriating polemic, Horne noted: ""Australia is a Lucky Country run mainly by second-rate people."" I am loath to trot out such a dog-eared quote yet again. However, if he were alive today, watching what has widely been regarded as a dismal campaign, maybe Donald Horne would draw the same conclusion. One of the reasons why his book has remained so relevant is because his words have remained so reverberant. The second leaders' debate was an ugly shouting match Arguably, Australia is paying the price for the brutality of its politics over the course of the past 15 years. Canberra's coup culture killed off two of the country's most substantive recent prime ministers, Labor's Kevin Rudd and the Liberal Party's Malcolm Turnbull. Nor did Julia Gillard, its first female prime minister, last long. A frequent grumble that you hear from voters is that a country of 26 million people should produce a better choice than Prime Minister Scott Morrison or the Labour leader Anthony Albanese. There is a none-of-the-above feel to this contest. That partly explains the rise of the so-called ""teal independents"", a group of female candidates challenging Liberal MPs in what are ordinarily fairly safe conservative seats. The term ""teal"" comes from the colour of the pamphlets and posters that many of these candidates use, and my suburb of Sydney is awash with them. Maybe we will witness a teal tide. With many voters actively seeking alternative options, this election might also produce the lowest level of support for the two major parties since the war. The 'teal' forces hoping to redefine politics Why the election is big for the planet Is Australia still a Covid success story? This video can not be played Durack: The Australian electoral seat six times the size of Britain It has been a scrappy six-week campaign, marked more by lowlights than the high. The second leaders debate, which was hosted by Channel Nine, was an ugly shout-fest. The media has faced criticism for often pursuing a gotcha line of questioning. Anthony Albanese's failure to be able to quote the unemployment rate on the first day of the campaign dominated the entire first week, and set the tone for press conferences throughout the campaign. Some voters will regard this as legitimate media scrutiny. Others might look upon it as a mind-numbing game of trivial pursuit. Big ideas and overarching narratives have been in short supply. With the Labor Party so determined to fight what party insiders call a small target campaign, there's been surprisingly little talk of a post-pandemic build back better agenda. After the fracturing of Australia during Covid, when some states like Western Australia acted more like independent countries, there has been no appeal for national reunification. Instead, negative partisanship has been a recurring theme: with leaders often spending more time attacking their opponents rather than advancing their own ideas. Partly because of the savagery of Canberra politics, the Australian system has become better at producing effective opposition leaders than effective prime ministers. In short, the political leaders of a nation of natural storytellers have seemingly lost the ability to come up with a galvanising national narrative, a vision of Australia's future. This election campaign has been marked more by anxiety than ambition. Nick Bryant is a Senior Fellow at Sydney University's Policy Lab. Is Australian democracy in good health?

Senedd reform to keep Labour in power - UK minister,"David TC Davies accused Labour of ""removing local representation and fiddling with the voting system"" The Welsh Labour government is seeking to ""lock"" itself in power ""forever"" with proposals to expand the Senedd, a UK government minister has said. Labour and Plaid Cymru's plan,set out earlier this month, would increase the number of Senedd members from 60 to 96. Wales Office minister and Tory Monmouth MP David TC Davies said the electoral system envisaged would ""concentrate power in the hands of"" party managers. He was addressing his party's Welsh conference in Newtown on Saturday. Q&A: How will this work? Bigger Senedd plans 'could freeze out Lib Dems' Under the plan, unveiled earlier in May, people would vote for parties, rather than candidates, with 96 Members of the Senedd (MSs) spread over 16 constituencies. The new system would use what is known as a ""closed list system"", where voters back a party list rather than a candidate, and cannot reject any individual candidates nominated. Parties would be forced to nominate lists equally made up of men and women, with candidate lists alternating between men and women in a system known as zipping. The plan would mean scrapping the first past the post system, currently used to elect 40 of the 60 Senedd members as well as MPs at Westminster, for Welsh Parliament polls. The proposals were laid out in a joint paper by Labour First Minister Mark Drakeford and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price, whose party is in a co-operation agreement with Welsh ministers. They were submitted to a cross-party committee on Senedd reform, due to report at the end of the month. Between them Labour and Plaid have the two-thirds majority required to get the plan through the Welsh Parliament. Labour and Plaid Cymru have the numbers in the Senedd chamber to get their plan through But Mr Davies told the conference that ""by creating huge constituencies and using close PR [proportional representation] lists they're going to remove the local accountability, which was supposed to be one of the advantages of having a Senedd, and concentrate power in the hands of a few party managers"". ""The simple fact that they kept these plans a secret until the day after the local council elections tells us all we need to know,"" he said. It was, he said, the task of Conservatives to ""fight against Welsh government plans to try and lock in a Labour government forever by removing local representation and fiddling with the voting system"". Welsh government Deputy Climate Change Minister Lee Waters hasdefended the proposalson the basis ""everybody's got their own favourite electoral system, and not one electoral system is without its drawbacks"". ""And it gives us a law-making tax raising parliament that is up to the task of scrutinising the government and taking Wales forward,"" he told BBC Wales last week. The Welsh Parliament has direct law-making powers and some tax-raising powers, unlike the institution that was created as the Welsh Assembly in 1999. The argument for a larger Senedd is that 60 members is insufficient to scrutinise government decisions and proposed laws in the main chamber and committee rooms in Cardiff Bay. Sajid Javid called the NHS waiting list figures for Wales ""astonishing"" Later, England's Health Secretary Sajid Javid launched a fierce attack on Labour's handling of the Welsh NHS. Labour ministers were ""more focused on expanding the number of politicians in the Senedd than the number of appointments in hospital"" and ""failing to support doctors and nurses and patients when they need it"", he said. ""The latest data, here in Wales, shows that one in five Welsh people are on the waiting list, with an astonishing one in four Welsh patients waiting for over a year for treatment. ""You cannot trust Labour to manage the health service."" Figures published on Thursday showed thewaiting list for planned treatments in Wales had risen to more than 700,000for the first time. The Welsh Health Minister, Eluned Morgan, said the whole system was under ""huge pressure"" but more than 250,000 outpatients had been seen in the previous month. ""We're working with health boards to make sure that they put the measures in place to make sure that they hit the target so that we're not expecting anybody to wait more than a year for outpatients by the end of this year,"" she said.

HRT swaps to fix supply shortage for UK women,"Pharmacists are being given temporary power to make swaps to women's hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions, amid ongoing shortages of some products in the UK. Products that may be substituted by a pharmacist without a new prescription from a doctor include some gels - Oestrogel and another called Sandrena. Ovestin cream and a spray called Lenzettoare also on the list.,external Hormone patches would be a good swap, and these are in plentiful supply. Anyone who has questions or concerns about HRT should speak to their pharmacist or doctor, experts advise. 'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying' The Royal Pharmaceutical Society welcomed the move but said it would still like to seea permanent change in the lawto make it easier for pharmacists to make swift appropriate swaps for all types of medicine - not just certain HRT products when they are in short supply. The government says it has been looking at a variety of ways to improve supply quickly after it heard how women were experiencing distressing symptoms, because they were unable to get their choice of medication. Madeline McTernan - the new HRT tsar whose job is to help solve the crisis - said the situation was improving. She said: ""I am very encouraged by the constructive engagement across the sector, and enthusiasm with which suppliers and pharmacists are looking to work with us to meet this challenge. ""Focusing both on measures that ensure we can use stocks most efficiently, whilst also ensuring supply is increased, is critical."" Women's health minister Maria Caulfield said manufacturers had told the government that by June ""they should be in a better position [on supplies]"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that of more than 70 HRT products available in the UK, ""it is only about 10 where there is a struggle with supply"". She added that ""we are looking at all options"" when asked about making permanent the temporary powers pharmacies have to swap prescriptions. Prof Claire Anderson, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ""The advice on which HRT product to substitute with another has been drawn up by experts, and women can be confident they will receive what's appropriate for them. ""This short-term measure will help women access supplies of HRT medicines, which are difficult to get hold of. ""This is a very fluid situation with some products due to return to normal availability shortly."" Availability of a tablet called Premique Low Dose has improved, and there are now good stocks of it in pharmacies. TheBritish Menopause Society,externalhas information on choosing HRT products, as does the health advisory bodythe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).,external HRT is a treatment designed to relieve symptoms of the menopause. The shortage has meantsome women turning to the black market. Some pharmaceutical companies say increased demand is the main reason why some supplies have run low. That demand is driven by a greater awareness around the menopause - thanks to campaigns - and more confidence around prescribing HRT. Prescriptions for HRT in England have more than doubled since 2017. Have you been affected by the HRT shortages? Have you used any substitute treatments? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Moldova should be equipped to Nato standard - Truss,"Moldova should be ""equipped to Nato standard"" to help it guard against the threat of a Russian invasion, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said. Ms Truss told the Telegraph that talks were under way with allies about how to help smaller nations defend themselves. She said it was clear that, despite limited success in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin retained ""ambitions to create a greater Russia"". Moldova, once a Soviet republic, sits on Ukraine's south-western border. It does not share a border with Russia, but is close to some of the regions currently occupied by Russian forces in Ukraine's south. Moldova is not a member of Nato, although it did apply to join the European Union less than two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine. Ms Truss said that discussions about upgrading Ukrainian defences to deter future aggression would also cover ""other vulnerable states such as Moldova"". ""I would want to see Moldova equipped to Nato standard,"" she said. ""This is a discussion we're having with our allies."" Could Ukraine's war spread to Moldova? What might swing the Ukraine war? How do you join Nato? Is the Ukraine war spreading? Asked whether that was because Russia was thought to pose a security threat to Moldova, she said: ""Absolutely. I mean, Putin has been clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia. ""And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren't successful, doesn't mean he's abandoned those ambitions."" Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, is home to many ethnic Ukrainians and has taken in more than 437,000 refugees from the war. In a country of 2.6 million people that is higher than any other for the size of its population. Moldova's President Maia Sandu is strongly pro-EU, but her predecessor Igor Dodon - who still has many supporters - was pro-Russian. Russia supports separatists who control a breakaway region called Transnistria and has around 1,500 troops there. In late April, the Transnistrian authorities said that explosions had targeted their state security HQ in the main city of Tiraspol, Soviet-era radio masts used to broadcast Russian news, and a military unit in a village outsider Tiraspol. Separatist authorities blamed Ukrainian ""infiltrators"" but Kyiv said Russian special services were responsible. Dr Jack Watling, senior research fellow at defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There isn't an immediate threat against Moldova from the Russian military but there is definitely a significant threat from Russian subversive activity and destabilisation actions."" He said it was ""sensible"" to build up ""appropriate capabilities"" so Moldova ""can stand on its own two feet"" given that Russia has publicly indicated that it has designs on that country. ""It is worth doing that while you have the time to do it properly rather than coming to the problem when the threat is very acute"", he added. Ms Truss' comments come just weeks after she said the West ""must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support"" for Ukraine. Speaking in London, she said: ""If Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again."" She also called for an increase in the UK's defence spending and said that the Nato target of 2% of GDP should be a ""floor, not a ceiling"". In April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised that the UK would provide Ukraine with more military equipment. In a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky, he pledged that more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons would be sent. On Friday, the PM also held a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan in which they discussed recent applications for Nato membership by Sweden and Finland. Turkey has signalled an intention to veto the applications, accusing the countries of not taking a ""clear stance"" against Kurdish groups it considers to be terrorists. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson had told Mr ErdoÄan that Finland and Sweden would be valuable additions to the Nato alliance, and had encouraged him to work with counterparts in both countries to address any concerns ahead of a summit of the military alliance in Madrid in June.

The Spanish government confirmed that non-vaccinated travellers from outside the EU can enter the country from Saturday. Fully vaccinated passengers will still need to show proof of vaccination. TheUK removed all its remaining international Covid travel restrictions,externalfor entry on 18 March. This included passenger locator forms and tests for passengers who do not qualify as vaccinated. Other European countries followed suit, with Austria, Greece, Switzerland, Bulgaria, Croatia, Lithuania, Sweden, Serbia, Slovenia and Slovakia no longer having any Covid travel restrictions for visitors. Previously, heightened restrictions meant UK travellers were only allowed to enter Spain with vaccine certification or proof of recovery from the virus. As thelatest wave of that strain dissipated,countries across the world loosened their Covid travel restrictions to welcome visitors again. Covid infections down again to one in 50, says ONS Vulnerable adults set for autumn Covid booster jab And on Saturday, Spanish tourism minister Reyes Maroto said the ""new phase of the pandemic"" meant the country was able to relax the rules by equating non-EU travellers with those of the EU and Schengen-associated countries. ""This is excellent news, much awaited by the tourism sector,"" said Ms Maroto, adding: ""Spain is becoming one of the most desired destinations in the world."" We love Spain. Mallorca, Marbella and Madrid are some of our holiday favourites. In 2019, 18 million visitors from the UK arrived at Spanish airports - and the Spanish want to see the same numbers hitting their beaches again this year. Demand is high for holiday destinations across Europe, with airlines and tour operators reporting surges for summer sun bookings almost everywhere. But Spain wants to retain its crown as Britain's favourite, and to do that it has to be open to everyone. That's why they've followed European holiday rivals and started allowing unvaccinated travellers - with a negative test - from today. More holidaymakers means more euros arriving and that's good for the Spanish economy, where tourism is crucial. From 21 May, all visitors entering Spain at air or sea borders, wherever they are travelling from, must provide one of the following three certificates: Vaccination certificate meeting the government's requirements A negative test certificate (PCR or similar) Certificate of recovery at least 11 days after testing positive Spain accepts the UK's proof of Covid-19 vaccination record, either digitally, or as a printed download. PCR tests must be carried out in the 72 hours prior to departure to Spain or an antigen test in the 24 hours prior to departure. Proof of recovery certificates will be valid for 180 days from the date of the positive test. Children under the age of 12 are exempt from submitting any type of certificate. Abta says this summer is expected to be the busiest holiday season since the Covid pandemic began Julia Lo Bue-Said from the Advantage Travel Partnership, an independent travel agent group, said: ""This is very good news just ahead of the May half-term and peak season."" Describing it as ""extremely positive"" for holidaymakers and the travel industry, she added: ""However, it is disappointing that Spain has not gone further and removed the need for pre-arrival tests for unvaccinated travellers given the minimal benefit these tests have for public health. ""Consumers want to travel with ease and if destinations prohibit this, then they will go elsewhere."" The Association of British Travel Agents (Abta) said the relaxation of the rules was great news as Spain is the most popular summer holiday destination for Britons. The travel industry trade body said: ""This summer is expected to be the busiest holiday season since the start of the pandemic, with 70% of families saying they have a holiday abroad booked this year."" Abta said that France, Italy, Greece and Portugal were also proving popular. WhileGreece,externalhas scrapped all Covid travel restrictions, the other three countries still require visitors to meet certain entry rules. Travellers either need proof of vaccination or to have taken a negative test before leaving the UK, while Italy and Portugal will also accept a Covid recovery certificate.

"Elon Musk denies sexual misconduct allegationsA report claims Musk's company SpaceX paid an employee $250,000 to settle the claim against him.US & Canada","The world's richest man, Elon Musk, has denied claims that he groped and exposed himself to an employee at his SpaceX rocket company six years ago. A report in the Business Insider news outlet on Thursday alleged SpaceX paid the ex-flight attendant $250,000 (Â£200,000) to settle the claim. ""Those wild accusations are utterly untrue,"" he wrote on Twitter. Mr Musk told Business Insider its article was a ""politically motivated hit piece"". The SpaceX founder suggested the piece was intended to interfere with his stalled $44bn (Â£35bn) acquisition of Twitter and malign the recent shift in his politics. He had used the social media site to announce he ""can no longer support"" the Democratic Party on Wednesday, saying he plans to vote for Republicans in future elections. Shares in his electric car company, Tesla, dropped on Friday. Who is Elon Musk? Elon Musk puts $44bn Twitter deal on hold How Elon Musk might change Twitter According to Business Insider, SpaceX paid the unnamed woman a severance agreement that was settled out of court and, as part of the deal, she was not allowed to sue the company or talk about the alleged incident. The magazine quotes an anonymous friend of the flight attendant, who it claimed had provided a signed declaration as part of the settlement process. The friend said Mr Musk had exposed himself to the former employee - a cabin crew member on contract for SpaceX's corporate jet fleet - in 2016 while receiving a massage from her aboard his private jet. He is said to have exposed his genitals to her, touched her leg without consent, and offered to buy her a gift if she would ""do more"" - referring to the performance of sex acts. The BBC has not been able to confirm these reports independently. In a series of tweets late on Thursday night, he alleged the friend quoted in the report was ""a far left activist/actress in [Los Angeles] with a major political axe to grind"" - and challenged her to verify the claims by describing his intimate body parts. Nicholas Carlson, the magazine's editor-in-chief, defended his outlet's work, writing on Twitter: ""We stand by our story, which is based on documents and interviews and speaks for itself.""

"Only diplomacy can end Ukraine war, says Zelensky","Polandâs president has given the first address in person by a foreign leader to the Ukrainian parliament since the Russian invasion began Andrzej Duda received a standing ovation after he declared that only Ukrainians themselves could decide their future Earlier, the Ukrainian government said Kyiv would not agree a ceasefire deal with Moscow that involved giving away any territory Presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak, said making concessions would result in Moscow starting an even larger, more bloody offensive in the longer term Russian forces have continued their attacks on the eastern Donbas region following their capture of Mariupol They are said to have made limited advances towards Severodonetsk â where it is thought they are planning a new siege Edited by Ben Tobias We're pausing our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for a few hours. We'll be back on Monday morning Ukraine time. You can find all our most recent coverage of the war on our website. The Polish leader was given a standing ovation for his address in Ukraine's parliament Thanks for joining our live coverage of the war in Ukraine. Here's a snapshot of the day's headlines. Oleksandr Zinchenko draped the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy After winning the English Premier League title for the fourth time with his club Manchester City, Ukrainian footballer Oleksandr Zinchenko has said he found it hard to even think about football after Russia invaded Ukraine in February. Speaking to Sky Sports after draping the Ukrainian flag around the Premier League trophy, an emotional Zinchenko called it an unforgettable moment. ""I'm so proud to be Ukrainian,"" he said. ""I would love to one day bring this title to Ukraine, for all Ukrainian people, because they deserve it."" Zinchenko said the time since the invasion began was the ""toughest period in my life"". In an interview with BBC Sport's Gary Linekersoon after the start of the war, the Manchester City defender said he could not count the number of times he had cried since Russia's invasion began. Lithuania is no longer importing energy from Russia as of today. Its energy minister said purchases of gas, oil and electricity from Moscow were stopping to show ""solidarity"" with Ukraine - and to cut funding for the ""Russian war machine"". He hoped electricity demands could be met through local green energy production instead. Lithuania, a former Soviet state and a Nato member, is a strong ally of Ukraine. Despite its invasion of Ukraine, Russia continues to provide fuel to many European countries. However, Finland's gas supply was cut off yesterday after it refused Moscow's demand to pay in roubles. The port city's been largely destroyed by Russian shelling People are being deported from Mariupol to other Russian-held territory at a faster and faster rate, according to a mayoral adviser in the fallen port city. Petro Andryushchenko wrote on the Telegram app that 313 Mariupol residents were taken away to a so-called ""filtration camp"" in Russian-occupied Bezimenne on Saturday. 55 of them were children. Andryushchenko said many of those being taken to camps were later being sent to Russia itself. The BBC has not been able confirmed the claims, and Russia has previously denied any forced deportations. Mariupol is now under total Russian control after its last defenders surrendered at an industrial plant on Friday. New pictures from the Reuters news agency have given a flavour of life for Ukraine's military personnel. Soldiers are seen performing exercises or taking breaks. The photos were taken in the Donetsk region in Ukraine's east - the focus of fierce fighting. An update now on Andriy Shevchyk, the man installed by Russia as the mayor of occupied Enerhodar. Shevchyk is now in intensive care after being injured in an explosion, Russia's state-run Ria Novosti news agency reports. No further details were available. Earlier we reported thatShevchyk and his bodyguards were hurtin what appeared to be a ""precise and targeted attack"", according to the city's elected mayor - who was ousted from power by the Russians. James FitzGeraldBBC News The Luhansk regional governor blamed Russian 'orcs' for destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk The governor of Ukraine's Luhansk region has accused Russian ""orcs"" of destroying a bridge between Severodonetsk and Lysychansk, amid fierce fighting in the area. Serhiy Haidai is just the latest Ukrainian official to compare Russian troops to a type of mythical monster popularised by JRR
Tolkienâs book The Lord of the Rings. In the epic novel, orcs are seen as âbrutal, aggressive
and chaoticâ says Ostap Slyvynsky, an associate
professor at Lviv University specialising in the literature of east-central
Europe. Some Ukrainians even call Russia itself
âMordorâ â alluding to a dark land in Tolkienâs fantasy. The images give Ukrainians an easy-to-understand metaphor for what's going on in real life. ""The fantasy world has a
very clear accent on what is good and what is bad,"" Slyvynsky explains. âThese terms are kind of euphemisms,â he adds. âIt is better to call Russians âorcsâ than more vulgar words.â The trend emerged some time after 2014 - the year Russia annexed the Crimean peninsula and Russian-backed
separatists seized parts of the eastern Donbas region. As for the Russians: they've been labelling Ukrainians âelvesâ - another Tolkien allusion - in the belief that those fictional beings embody weakness, Slyvynsky says. Adam EastonReporting from Warsaw The Polish president has delivered a message of strong support for Ukraine during the first address in person by a foreign leader to the parliament in Kyiv since the Russian invasion began. During his speech Andrzej Duda thanked Ukraine for defending Europe against what he called âRussian imperialismâ. âThe free worldâ, he said, âhas the face of Ukraineâ. Duda said recent calls for Kyiv to negotiate with President Putin, and even give into some of his demands, were disturbing. No decisions about your future will be made without you, he said. Poland has been one of Ukraineâs staunchest supporters, taking in millions of refugees fleeing the fighting and sending tanks and rocket launchers to the Ukrainian military. Duda, who received a standing ovation after his speech, said Poland would do everything it could to help Ukraine join the European Union. An exhibition of destroyed Russian tanks is proving popular with the public in Kyiv. The vehicles have gone on show at Mykhailivska Square. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine have met in Kyiv today Polish citizens living in Ukraine are to be
granted the same rights that Ukrainian refugees in Poland are
currently receiving. Ukraine's President Zelensky announced the plan during a visit from his Polish counterpart, Andrzej Duda. A bill will be tabled in parliament to make the changes happen. Poland has granted the right to live, work and claim
social security payments to more than three million Ukrainian refugees
who've fled Russia's invasion. The Ukrainian parliament has passed a bill banning symbols of the Russian invasion, including those containing the letters Z and V, MP Yaroslav Zheleznyak said on Telegram. Zheleznyak noted that the document included President Zelensky's proposals, which he submitted when he vetoed the previous draft law passed on 14 April. The new version of the law widens the range of cases when the display of the symbols is allowed, namely in museums, libraries, scientific works, textbooks and so on, according to our colleagues at BBC Monitoring. The new bill, however, bans the creation of NGOs which use Russian war symbols and whose activities are aimed at spreading war propaganda and undermining Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. The letters ""Z"" and ""V"", which don't exist in the Russian alphabet, have been widely used to symbolise support for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. They are used to mark Russian military vehicles on the battlefield. A bid by Ukraine to join the EU could not be finalised for ""15 or 20 years,"" France's minister for European affairs has said. Speaking on Radio J in Paris, Clement Beaune said: ""We have to be honest. If you say Ukraine is going to join the EU in six months, or a year or two, you're lying. ""It's probably in 15 or 20 years, it takes a long time."" His comments poured cold water on Volodymyr Zelensky's hopes for expedited entry to the bloc in the wake of Russia's invasion. Beaune repeated French President Emmanuel Macron's offer to create a looser ""European political community"" that could help integrate Ukraine sooner, adding: ""I don't want to offer Ukrainians any illusions or lies."" Zelensky has turned down what he called ""such compromises"" and insisted on an immediate start of the process towards full EU membership. Beaune said Macron's proposal is not ""an alternative to joining the European political community"", emphasising: ""It doesn't prevent membership later on."" Ukraine's aspirations to join the EU and Nato are seen as the main reason Russian President Vladimir Putin launched his invasion. Macron's European political community initiative is due to be debated at an EU summit in June. Ukraine has extended martial law for three months until 23 August. President Volodymyr Zelensky first signed the decree, along with a general military mobilisation call, on 24 February and since then has extended it for a month on two occasions. Today, Ukraine's parliament voted by an absolute majority for a third extension as Russia continues to focus its offensive on the eastern Donbas region. Zelensky's representative at the Constitutional Court, Fedir Venislavskyy, said the decision to extend it for 90 days this time is because a ""counter-offensive takes more time than defence"". Poland's President Andrzej Duda meets with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv If you're just joining us, here's a look at the main news from the war in Ukraine so far today: Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv Ukraine remains vulnerable to aerial strikes Military and financial support from Western
countries is increasingly making a difference. At the start of the war, President Zelensky was saying they
needed more and they needed it faster. But his position has gradually shifted, to acknowledge that the Ukrainians are getting the support they need with the urgency they
need. The big missing piece in the puzzle is still air defences. A statement yesterday from the Russians
- saying theyâd destroyed a big shipment of military aid â shows Ukraine is
still not getting the latest in air defence systems. On every other front, I think the support is starting to
come through. Iâve seen modern Western equipment being sent to the front lines. They are always going to need more though, especially
given the increased Russian pushes weâve been seeing. Andriy Shevchyk, a mayor installed by Russia in the occupied city of Enerhodar, has reportedly been injured in an explosion. The city's elected mayor Dmytro Orlov - who is currently in nearby Zaporizhzhia - wrote on the Telegram messaging app that Shevchyk and his bodyguards had been taken to hospital after being wounded. Orlov noted that the circumstances were still being established. He added that nobody else had been hurt in the blast - suggesting this had been a ""precise and targeted attack"". There was no immediate comment from the Russian side. Enerhodar, a city of about 50,000 people which serves Europe's largest nuclear power plant, has been occupied by Russian forces since March. The leaders of Poland and Ukraine embraced in the chamber earlier today ""Only Ukraine has the right to
decide its future"", the Polish president has said in a speech to the Ukrainian parliament. Andrzej Duda said ""worrying voices"" were suggesting Ukraine should give in to Russia's President Putin, according to comments quoted by the Reuters news agency. He told lawmakers that those voices should not be heeded - because ceding even an inch of Ukrainian territory would be a blow to the whole West. Duda also reportedly stressed that Poland supported Ukraine in its bid to gain full membership of the European Union - a matter on which EU countries have not reached a consensus. He was the first foreign leader to give an in-person speech to the Ukrainian parliament since Russia invaded on 24 February. Photos posted on Twitter by Duda's office showed him receiving a standing ovation in parliament and embracing Zelensky. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia attacked Ukrainian forces with airstrikes and artillery in the east and the south, targeting command centres, troops, and ammunition depots, according to an update from the Russian defence ministry. Maj Gen Igor Konashenkov, spokesman for the defence ministry, said air-launched missiles hit three command points, 13 areas where troops and Ukrainian military equipment were amassed, as well as four ammunition depots in the Donbas region, the Reuters news agency reported. In Ukraine's southern region of Mykolaiv, Russian rockets hit a mobile anti-drone system near the settlement of Hannivka, around 100km northeast of Mykolaiv city, Konashenkov said. The BBC has not been able to confirm this independently. Authorities in Ukraine's south-eastern Zaporizhzhia region have reported civilian injuries - following Russian missile strikes on a village. Explosions were said to have woken people up in the middle of the night. Emergency workers attended the scene, the regional administration posted on the Telegram messaging app. Â© 2025 BBC.

Labor to form Australia's new government - local networks,"Labor will form the next government after the Liberal-National coalition has failed to win enough seats But it is still not clear whether it will be a majority leadership or in coalition with independents and other parties Anthony Albanese will be the country's new prime minister overseeing the first Labor government in almost a decade Incumbent PM Scott Morrison has conceded defeat and congratulated Mr Albanese on his win Independents have also done well in the election so far, amid public dissatisfaction with the two major parties The rising cost of living and climate change have dominated this election as two key issues for voters It's nearly 3am in Sydney, where a few hours ago Australia's new PM Anthony Albanese gave a victory speech to thousands of cheering supporters. ""I want to bring Australia together. I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity, and not fear or division,""  said the 59-year-old veteran politician who has led Labor back to power after nearly a decade. Here's a recap of the day's biggest takeaways:  This live page was brought to you by Rebecca Seales, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Zubaidah Abdul Jalil and Aparna Alluri in Singapore, Jay Savage, Tiffanie Turnbull, Isabelle Rodd and Frances Mao in Sydney, Kirstan Ross in Melbourne, Zoe Kean in Hobart, and Tiffany Wertheimer in London. Thank you for joining us! As the day comes to an end, here's a look at some of the millions of Australians who cast their ballots today to elect a new government. Voters pose with their pooch outside a polling station in Melbourne A man votes at Bondi Beach, Sydney, wearing a pair of Speedos - what Australians affectionately call ""budgie smugglers"" Two year-old Lexi enjoys a ""democracy sausage"" - a staunch Australian tradition - after her parents voted in Dickson, Brisbane Brisbane voters wait in the rain to cast their ballots Peter Power enjoys a sausage sizzle after voting in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, with his dogs Lily and Dancer in tow Simon AtkinsonBBC News The first couple of days in a new job are often pretty cruisy right? Get set up on your email, find out where the stationery is kept, maybe discover what to do if there's a fire. But Anthony Albanese has got a more intense start. He will need to be sworn in as Prime Minister pretty quickly - perhaps as soon as Sunday. Because on Monday he will fly to Tokyo for the Quad leader's meeting with US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. France's outgoing Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said Scott Morrison's defeat at the polls on Saturday ""suits me fine"". There has been a political rift between the two countries since Australia scrapped a $37bn (Â£27bn) submarine deal with France last year, and instead made a new pact with the US and UK - so-called Aukus.  The move enraged French President Emmanuel Macron,who famously accused Mr Morrison of lying to him. ""The prime minister's defeat suits me fine,"" Mr Le Drian was quoted by AFP as saying. ""I hope we can resume frank and constructive dialogue with Australia in the future."" Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Less than half an hour after becoming Australiaâs
prime minister-elect, Anthony Albanese faced his first major challenge - being ""doorstepped"" by the BBC. For a man so new to the job of running Australia,
he was surprisingly quick to talk about international policy, saying he was a
huge supporter of theAukus defence alliancebetween Australia, the UK and the
US. Mr Albanese also said that he wanted to follow in
the UKâs footsteps in being a climate action leader. Anthony Albanese with his beloved dog Toto Anthony Albanese is set to become Australia's next prime minister after leading the Labor Party to its first election victory in almost a decade. One of the country's longest-serving politicians, he promised voters ""safe change"" as he worked to kick out the conservative Liberal-National coalition which has been in power since 2013. Where ousted Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a self-described ""bulldozer"", Mr Albanese vows to be a ""builder"". After the pandemic, which saw Australian states cut off from each other and cities splintered by strict lockdowns, fostering unity is a top priority for the new leader. So who is Albo? Mr Albanese has earned a reputation as a defender of Australia's free healthcare system, an advocate for the LGBT community, a republican, and a passionate rugby league fan. The 59-year-old - nicknamed Albo - was raised in social housing by a single mother on a disability pension. He has often cited his upbringing as the foundation for his progressive beliefs. Read more here. Going into the election, all signs indicated incumbent PM Scott Morrison was in trouble. His tenure has been dominated by disasters and the pandemic, but also by his governmentâs many scandals. There was the ill-timed holiday to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia and the way his government treated women and handled sexual harassment claims. His character has also come under fire, from members of his own party and even the French President who accused him of lying. Last election he was dubbed a ""miracle-worker"" for pulling off an unexpected victory. So how did things go so wrong for ScoMo?Read more here. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney Every sentence Anthony Albanese delivered at Labor HQ was met with rapturous applause. Whether it was a commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, making Australia the leader in renewable energy as part of a major shift in climate policy, or protecting the minimum wages of young workers to make sure they  kept up with inflation - with his call for optimism, not fear, Anthony Albanese outlined a different vision for Australia from the one projected by Scott Morrison. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken to Twitter to congratulate new Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese. ""I look forward to working with you as we reap the rewards of our comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, the AUKUS partnership and the unmatched closeness between the British and Australian people,"" he wrote. More from Anthony Albanese's speech. The incoming PM preached a message of unity and hope, saying he wanted to ""bring Australians together"". ""I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity and optimism, not fear and division. It is a show of strength to collaborate and work with people, not weakness."" He also urged Australians to seize opportunities ""to shape change, rather than be shaped by it"", and said that together the country could ""end the climate wars"", become a renewable energy ""superpower"", as well as strengthen the economy, healthcare, and childcare. He also promised to establish a national anti-corruption commission, and reaffirmed his commitment to womens and Indigenous people's rights. He ended his speech thanking his party colleagues, campaign team, family, and finally his mum who is ""beaming down on us"". ""I hope there are families in public housing watching this tonight. Because I want every parent to be able to tell their child no matter where you live or where you come from, in Australia the doors of opportunity are open to us all."" Peter Dutton has scraped through in his Queensland seat of Dickson, paving the way for him to become the next Liberal Party leader after Scott Morrison's resignation. If he does put his hand up, it'll be Mr Dutton's second tilt at the top job. He unsuccessfully challenged then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2018 after a dispute over energy policy. But it was Scott Morrison who ultimately won the party room support to replace Mr Turnbull. Mr Dutton - from the party's right faction - has been a controversial figure, and there are questions over whether he'll be able to win back support that the party lost in more progressive, metropolitan seats. Incoming Prime Minister Albanese said that PM Scott Morrison had in an earlier phone call ""very graciously wished me well"". ""I thanked him for that and I wish him well. And I thank him for the service that he has given to our country as Prime Minister."" Albanese went on to refer to his own humble beginnings as the ""son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing"". ""I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars. I want Australia to continue to be acountry that no matter where you live, who you worship, who you love or what your last name is, that places no restrictions on your journey in life."" At this point Albanese was drowned out by repeated cheering and chants of his name, to which he jokingly responded: ""I know at the beginning of the campaign they said people didn't know me but I reckon they've got [the name by now].... Can we have a bit of order? I intend to run an orderly government and it starts here, so behave."" Anthony Albanese, Australia's next prime minister, has just arrived at Labor's party headquarters to thunderous applause and cheers. He began his speech thanking Australians ""for this extraordinary honour"". ""Tonight the Australian people have voted for change. I am humbled by this victory and I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia. ""My Labor team will work every day to bring Australians together. And I will lead a government worthy of the people of Australia. A government as courageous and hard working and caring as the Australian people are themselves."" Australia's Treasurer and Liberal party member Josh Frydenberg has acknowledged it will be difficult to hold onto his Kooyong seat in Melbourne, as independent ""teal"" candidate Monique Ryan looks set to win. Kooyong has long been a Liberal seat, and this will mark a shock loss to a complete political newcomer. Frydenberg will also become one of the highest-ranking cabinet ministers to ever be voted out. ""While it's mathematically possible that we win in Kooyong, it's definitely difficult,"" Frydenberg told supporters in a televised speech. His mood was markedly different earlier today when he posed for pictures with voters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The first Indigenous person to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to serve as a minister has lost his seat. Ken Wyatt's seat of Hasluck has fallen to Labor as the Liberal Party suffer a massive swing against them in the state of Western Australia. Mr Wyatt - who has Noongar, Yamatji and Wongi heritage - was elected in 2010, and became the Assistant Minister for Health in 2015. He's held a number of portfolios since then, and in 2019 become the first Aboriginal person to be the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Liberal colleague Senator Simon Birmingham said his defeat is a huge loss for the parliament. ""While there are many colleagues I would grieve for tonight, it is important that we note the historic contribution that Ken Wyatt made to the parliament, as an Indigenous Australian, to serve at the highest levels of office,"" he said. ""We pay tribute to him tonight.""  Ken Wyatt was elected in 2010 Anthony Albanese will be Australia's next PM, but Scott Morrison's Liberal-National coalition appears to be in the lead on first-preference votes (see the chart below). Why is that? It's because Australia uses a preferential voting system - each ballot is numbered by voters from their most to least preferred. Candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated, but votes for them are still counted - theyâre re-distributed to the next preference listed on each ballot. The process is repeated until only two candidates are left, and the person with the majority is declared the winner. So under preferential voting, many of the Greens votes, for instance, are likely to move to Labor - as those voters are likely to have preferenced Labor above the Liberals. Nationally, networks are projecting that just over half the first-preference vote will go to Labor. Morrison took to the stage amid chants of ""Scomo, Scomo"" More on Morrison's concession speech - he said he was quitting as the leader of the Liberals, following their unsuccessful outing at the polls. Morrison, who led the country through bushfires and a pandemic, also gave thanks for ""the miracle of the Australian people"". ""What Australians have endured over these past few years has shown a tremendous depth of character and resilience and strength,"" he said. ""It has been the Australian people under the strong support of a strong government that's enabled all of us to come through to where we are today, and that's something that all Australians can give thanks for as 
we move forward.â He added that his party was handing over a country that was ""in a stronger position... than we inherited it when we came to government those years ago under Tony Abbott"". âWe leave government having secured our borders many years ago. And we leave government 

having restored our nation's defences.â A huge roar - the biggest of the night - erupted as Morrison ended his speech saying he ""looks ahead to victory"" in the next election, reports the BBC's Phil Mercer who was at the scene. Morrison was mobbed by television crews as he left the stage. Scott Morrison has just arrived at his Liberal party's headquarters and has conceded defeat to Labor's Anthony Albanese. He congratulated Albanese on his election success, and adds: ""This has been a time of great upheaval."" ""It is important for our nation to heal"" from disruption, he adds. The BBC's Phil Mercer who is at the scene says that a crowd of several hundred people, including former PM John Howard, had stayed behind to listen to Mr Morrison's speech. But the mood is not funereal, with free-flowing beer and wine keeping spirits up. It's hugs and cheers all round for Labor supporters this evening, as the party is set to form the country's new government. This is the first time Labor has come to power in almost a decade. Supporters were crossing their fingers for a win... ...then began to cheer as the results started coming in... ...and broke out in chants for ""Albo"" as networks called a Labor win. Labor's Sally Sitou was half-way through her victory speech when her supporters realised the party had won - and they broke out in cheers. Labor is still four seats short of the 76-mark for a majorty government, but that could change in the coming hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Concern over monkeypox impact on sexual healthStaff at sexual health clinics warn the virus is already stretching the workforce in many places.Health,"Twenty cases of monkeypox have now been confirmed in the UK Monkeypox could have a ""massive impact"" on access to sexual health services, doctors have warned. Staff at clinics are already having to isolate if they have come into contact with anyone infected. In London, where most of the UK's 20 identified cases have been detected, sexual health clinics have stopped people walking in altogether. The British Association for Sexual Health and HIV said it was concerned about the effect on other infections. Cases of monkeypox, which is generally mild, are rare outside Central and West Africa, butabout 80 cases have been confirmed in at least 12 countries,the World Health Organization says. Infections were confirmed in Italy, Sweden, Spain, Portugal, the US and Canada, as well as the UK - where the first European case was reported. The WHO says another 50 suspected cases are being investigated. What is monkeypox? Time to worry or one to ignore? Eighty monkeypox cases confirmed in 11 countries Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, or through the eyes, nose or mouth. It has not previously been described as a sexually transmitted infection, but it can be passed on by direct contact during sex. And the most recent UK cases are in gay or bisexual men which has prompted the UK Health Security Agency to encourage men who have sex with men to be aware of any unusual rashes or lesions. They are being asked to contact their local sexual health service if they have concerns. Dr Claire Dewsnap, a consultant in genitourinary medicine and president of the British Association for Sexual Health and HIV, said staff in sexual health clinics were ""already under significant pressure"" and monkeypox was making that situation worse. ""It is already stretching the workforce and will have a massive impact if staff have to isolate if they are in close contact with someone who's infected,"" Dr Dewsnap said. ""I am concerned about the potential impact on access to sexual health generally."" In London, clinics are asking all patients to contact staff in advance and tell them their symptoms before being offered an appointment. This is so those with monkeypox symptoms can be kept away from waiting rooms or clinics where other people are present. Clinics elsewhere are asking only those with an unusual rash to call ahead so they can be seen in separate areas. Some staff in sexual health clinics have already received a smallpox vaccine to help protect them against monkeypox - a smallpox jab offers some good protection since the two viruses are quite similar. The rash changes and goes through different stages, and can look like chickenpox or syphilis, before finally forming a scab, which later falls off Monkeypox is usually associated with travel to Central or West Africa, but some of the cases that have been occurring outside these countries have had no travel link. It does not spread easily between people, but it can be spread through: touching clothing, bedding or towels used by someone with the monkeypox rash touching monkeypox skin blisters or scabs the coughs or sneezes of a person with the monkeypox rash If you get infected with monkeypox, it usually takes between five and 21 days for the first symptoms to appear. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, backache, swollen lymph nodes, chills and exhaustion. A rash can develop, often beginning on the face, then spreading to other parts of the body.

"HRT swaps to fix supply shortage for UK womenPharmacists will be able to give suitable replacements, without needing a brand new prescription.Health","Pharmacists are being given temporary power to make swaps to women's hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions, amid ongoing shortages of some products in the UK. Products that may be substituted by a pharmacist without a new prescription from a doctor include some gels - Oestrogel and another called Sandrena. Ovestin cream and a spray called Lenzettoare also on the list.,external Hormone patches would be a good swap, and these are in plentiful supply. Anyone who has questions or concerns about HRT should speak to their pharmacist or doctor, experts advise. 'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying' The Royal Pharmaceutical Society welcomed the move but said it would still like to seea permanent change in the lawto make it easier for pharmacists to make swift appropriate swaps for all types of medicine - not just certain HRT products when they are in short supply. The government says it has been looking at a variety of ways to improve supply quickly after it heard how women were experiencing distressing symptoms, because they were unable to get their choice of medication. Madeline McTernan - the new HRT tsar whose job is to help solve the crisis - said the situation was improving. She said: ""I am very encouraged by the constructive engagement across the sector, and enthusiasm with which suppliers and pharmacists are looking to work with us to meet this challenge. ""Focusing both on measures that ensure we can use stocks most efficiently, whilst also ensuring supply is increased, is critical."" Women's health minister Maria Caulfield said manufacturers had told the government that by June ""they should be in a better position [on supplies]"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that of more than 70 HRT products available in the UK, ""it is only about 10 where there is a struggle with supply"". She added that ""we are looking at all options"" when asked about making permanent the temporary powers pharmacies have to swap prescriptions. Prof Claire Anderson, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ""The advice on which HRT product to substitute with another has been drawn up by experts, and women can be confident they will receive what's appropriate for them. ""This short-term measure will help women access supplies of HRT medicines, which are difficult to get hold of. ""This is a very fluid situation with some products due to return to normal availability shortly."" Availability of a tablet called Premique Low Dose has improved, and there are now good stocks of it in pharmacies. TheBritish Menopause Society,externalhas information on choosing HRT products, as does the health advisory bodythe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).,external HRT is a treatment designed to relieve symptoms of the menopause. The shortage has meantsome women turning to the black market. Some pharmaceutical companies say increased demand is the main reason why some supplies have run low. That demand is driven by a greater awareness around the menopause - thanks to campaigns - and more confidence around prescribing HRT.

"Moldova should be equipped to Nato standard - TrussThe foreign secretary says smaller nations should be helped to counter Russian aggression.UKHRT swaps to fix supply shortage for UK womenPharmacists will be able to give suitable replacements, without needing a brand new prescription.Health","Moldova should be ""equipped to Nato standard"" to help it guard against the threat of a Russian invasion, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said. Ms Truss told the Telegraph that talks were under way with allies about how to help smaller nations defend themselves. She said it was clear that, despite limited success in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin retained ""ambitions to create a greater Russia"". Moldova, once a Soviet republic, sits on Ukraine's south-western border. It does not share a border with Russia, but is close to some of the regions currently occupied by Russian forces in Ukraine's south. Moldova is not a member of Nato, although it did apply to join the European Union less than two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine. Ms Truss said that discussions about upgrading Ukrainian defences to deter future aggression would also cover ""other vulnerable states such as Moldova"". ""I would want to see Moldova equipped to Nato standard,"" she said. ""This is a discussion we're having with our allies."" Could Ukraine's war spread to Moldova? What might swing the Ukraine war? How do you join Nato? Is the Ukraine war spreading? Asked whether that was because Russia was thought to pose a security threat to Moldova, she said: ""Absolutely. I mean, Putin has been clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia. ""And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren't successful, doesn't mean he's abandoned those ambitions."" Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, is home to many ethnic Ukrainians and has taken in more than 437,000 refugees from the war. In a country of 2.6 million people that is higher than any other for the size of its population. Moldova's President Maia Sandu is strongly pro-EU, but her predecessor Igor Dodon - who still has many supporters - was pro-Russian. Russia supports separatists who control a breakaway region called Transnistria and has around 1,500 troops there. In late April, the Transnistrian authorities said that explosions had targeted their state security HQ in the main city of Tiraspol, Soviet-era radio masts used to broadcast Russian news, and a military unit in a village outsider Tiraspol. Separatist authorities blamed Ukrainian ""infiltrators"" but Kyiv said Russian special services were responsible. Dr Jack Watling, senior research fellow at defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There isn't an immediate threat against Moldova from the Russian military but there is definitely a significant threat from Russian subversive activity and destabilisation actions."" He said it was ""sensible"" to build up ""appropriate capabilities"" so Moldova ""can stand on its own two feet"" given that Russia has publicly indicated that it has designs on that country. ""It is worth doing that while you have the time to do it properly rather than coming to the problem when the threat is very acute"", he added. Ms Truss' comments come just weeks after she said the West ""must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support"" for Ukraine. Speaking in London, she said: ""If Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again."" She also called for an increase in the UK's defence spending and said that the Nato target of 2% of GDP should be a ""floor, not a ceiling"". In April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised that the UK would provide Ukraine with more military equipment. In a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky, he pledged that more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons would be sent. On Friday, the PM also held a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan in which they discussed recent applications for Nato membership by Sweden and Finland. Turkey has signalled an intention to veto the applications, accusing the countries of not taking a ""clear stance"" against Kurdish groups it considers to be terrorists. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson had told Mr ErdoÄan that Finland and Sweden would be valuable additions to the Nato alliance, and had encouraged him to work with counterparts in both countries to address any concerns ahead of a summit of the military alliance in Madrid in June.

LiveLiveCounting starts in hard-fought Australia election7 minutes ago,"Labor will form the next government after the Liberal-National coalition has failed to win enough seats But it is still not clear whether it will be a majority leadership or in coalition with independents and other parties Anthony Albanese will be the country's new prime minister overseeing the first Labor government in almost a decade Incumbent PM Scott Morrison has conceded defeat and congratulated Mr Albanese on his win Independents have also done well in the election so far, amid public dissatisfaction with the two major parties The rising cost of living and climate change have dominated this election as two key issues for voters It's nearly 3am in Sydney, where a few hours ago Australia's new PM Anthony Albanese gave a victory speech to thousands of cheering supporters. ""I want to bring Australia together. I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity, and not fear or division,""  said the 59-year-old veteran politician who has led Labor back to power after nearly a decade. Here's a recap of the day's biggest takeaways:  This live page was brought to you by Rebecca Seales, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Zubaidah Abdul Jalil and Aparna Alluri in Singapore, Jay Savage, Tiffanie Turnbull, Isabelle Rodd and Frances Mao in Sydney, Kirstan Ross in Melbourne, Zoe Kean in Hobart, and Tiffany Wertheimer in London. Thank you for joining us! As the day comes to an end, here's a look at some of the millions of Australians who cast their ballots today to elect a new government. Voters pose with their pooch outside a polling station in Melbourne A man votes at Bondi Beach, Sydney, wearing a pair of Speedos - what Australians affectionately call ""budgie smugglers"" Two year-old Lexi enjoys a ""democracy sausage"" - a staunch Australian tradition - after her parents voted in Dickson, Brisbane Brisbane voters wait in the rain to cast their ballots Peter Power enjoys a sausage sizzle after voting in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, with his dogs Lily and Dancer in tow Simon AtkinsonBBC News The first couple of days in a new job are often pretty cruisy right? Get set up on your email, find out where the stationery is kept, maybe discover what to do if there's a fire. But Anthony Albanese has got a more intense start. He will need to be sworn in as Prime Minister pretty quickly - perhaps as soon as Sunday. Because on Monday he will fly to Tokyo for the Quad leader's meeting with US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. France's outgoing Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said Scott Morrison's defeat at the polls on Saturday ""suits me fine"". There has been a political rift between the two countries since Australia scrapped a $37bn (Â£27bn) submarine deal with France last year, and instead made a new pact with the US and UK - so-called Aukus.  The move enraged French President Emmanuel Macron,who famously accused Mr Morrison of lying to him. ""The prime minister's defeat suits me fine,"" Mr Le Drian was quoted by AFP as saying. ""I hope we can resume frank and constructive dialogue with Australia in the future."" Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Less than half an hour after becoming Australiaâs
prime minister-elect, Anthony Albanese faced his first major challenge - being ""doorstepped"" by the BBC. For a man so new to the job of running Australia,
he was surprisingly quick to talk about international policy, saying he was a
huge supporter of theAukus defence alliancebetween Australia, the UK and the
US. Mr Albanese also said that he wanted to follow in
the UKâs footsteps in being a climate action leader. Anthony Albanese with his beloved dog Toto Anthony Albanese is set to become Australia's next prime minister after leading the Labor Party to its first election victory in almost a decade. One of the country's longest-serving politicians, he promised voters ""safe change"" as he worked to kick out the conservative Liberal-National coalition which has been in power since 2013. Where ousted Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a self-described ""bulldozer"", Mr Albanese vows to be a ""builder"". After the pandemic, which saw Australian states cut off from each other and cities splintered by strict lockdowns, fostering unity is a top priority for the new leader. So who is Albo? Mr Albanese has earned a reputation as a defender of Australia's free healthcare system, an advocate for the LGBT community, a republican, and a passionate rugby league fan. The 59-year-old - nicknamed Albo - was raised in social housing by a single mother on a disability pension. He has often cited his upbringing as the foundation for his progressive beliefs. Read more here. Going into the election, all signs indicated incumbent PM Scott Morrison was in trouble. His tenure has been dominated by disasters and the pandemic, but also by his governmentâs many scandals. There was the ill-timed holiday to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia and the way his government treated women and handled sexual harassment claims. His character has also come under fire, from members of his own party and even the French President who accused him of lying. Last election he was dubbed a ""miracle-worker"" for pulling off an unexpected victory. So how did things go so wrong for ScoMo?Read more here. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney Every sentence Anthony Albanese delivered at Labor HQ was met with rapturous applause. Whether it was a commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, making Australia the leader in renewable energy as part of a major shift in climate policy, or protecting the minimum wages of young workers to make sure they  kept up with inflation - with his call for optimism, not fear, Anthony Albanese outlined a different vision for Australia from the one projected by Scott Morrison. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken to Twitter to congratulate new Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese. ""I look forward to working with you as we reap the rewards of our comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, the AUKUS partnership and the unmatched closeness between the British and Australian people,"" he wrote. More from Anthony Albanese's speech. The incoming PM preached a message of unity and hope, saying he wanted to ""bring Australians together"". ""I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity and optimism, not fear and division. It is a show of strength to collaborate and work with people, not weakness."" He also urged Australians to seize opportunities ""to shape change, rather than be shaped by it"", and said that together the country could ""end the climate wars"", become a renewable energy ""superpower"", as well as strengthen the economy, healthcare, and childcare. He also promised to establish a national anti-corruption commission, and reaffirmed his commitment to womens and Indigenous people's rights. He ended his speech thanking his party colleagues, campaign team, family, and finally his mum who is ""beaming down on us"". ""I hope there are families in public housing watching this tonight. Because I want every parent to be able to tell their child no matter where you live or where you come from, in Australia the doors of opportunity are open to us all."" Peter Dutton has scraped through in his Queensland seat of Dickson, paving the way for him to become the next Liberal Party leader after Scott Morrison's resignation. If he does put his hand up, it'll be Mr Dutton's second tilt at the top job. He unsuccessfully challenged then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2018 after a dispute over energy policy. But it was Scott Morrison who ultimately won the party room support to replace Mr Turnbull. Mr Dutton - from the party's right faction - has been a controversial figure, and there are questions over whether he'll be able to win back support that the party lost in more progressive, metropolitan seats. Incoming Prime Minister Albanese said that PM Scott Morrison had in an earlier phone call ""very graciously wished me well"". ""I thanked him for that and I wish him well. And I thank him for the service that he has given to our country as Prime Minister."" Albanese went on to refer to his own humble beginnings as the ""son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing"". ""I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars. I want Australia to continue to be acountry that no matter where you live, who you worship, who you love or what your last name is, that places no restrictions on your journey in life."" At this point Albanese was drowned out by repeated cheering and chants of his name, to which he jokingly responded: ""I know at the beginning of the campaign they said people didn't know me but I reckon they've got [the name by now].... Can we have a bit of order? I intend to run an orderly government and it starts here, so behave."" Anthony Albanese, Australia's next prime minister, has just arrived at Labor's party headquarters to thunderous applause and cheers. He began his speech thanking Australians ""for this extraordinary honour"". ""Tonight the Australian people have voted for change. I am humbled by this victory and I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia. ""My Labor team will work every day to bring Australians together. And I will lead a government worthy of the people of Australia. A government as courageous and hard working and caring as the Australian people are themselves."" Australia's Treasurer and Liberal party member Josh Frydenberg has acknowledged it will be difficult to hold onto his Kooyong seat in Melbourne, as independent ""teal"" candidate Monique Ryan looks set to win. Kooyong has long been a Liberal seat, and this will mark a shock loss to a complete political newcomer. Frydenberg will also become one of the highest-ranking cabinet ministers to ever be voted out. ""While it's mathematically possible that we win in Kooyong, it's definitely difficult,"" Frydenberg told supporters in a televised speech. His mood was markedly different earlier today when he posed for pictures with voters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The first Indigenous person to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to serve as a minister has lost his seat. Ken Wyatt's seat of Hasluck has fallen to Labor as the Liberal Party suffer a massive swing against them in the state of Western Australia. Mr Wyatt - who has Noongar, Yamatji and Wongi heritage - was elected in 2010, and became the Assistant Minister for Health in 2015. He's held a number of portfolios since then, and in 2019 become the first Aboriginal person to be the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Liberal colleague Senator Simon Birmingham said his defeat is a huge loss for the parliament. ""While there are many colleagues I would grieve for tonight, it is important that we note the historic contribution that Ken Wyatt made to the parliament, as an Indigenous Australian, to serve at the highest levels of office,"" he said. ""We pay tribute to him tonight.""  Ken Wyatt was elected in 2010 Anthony Albanese will be Australia's next PM, but Scott Morrison's Liberal-National coalition appears to be in the lead on first-preference votes (see the chart below). Why is that? It's because Australia uses a preferential voting system - each ballot is numbered by voters from their most to least preferred. Candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated, but votes for them are still counted - theyâre re-distributed to the next preference listed on each ballot. The process is repeated until only two candidates are left, and the person with the majority is declared the winner. So under preferential voting, many of the Greens votes, for instance, are likely to move to Labor - as those voters are likely to have preferenced Labor above the Liberals. Nationally, networks are projecting that just over half the first-preference vote will go to Labor. Morrison took to the stage amid chants of ""Scomo, Scomo"" More on Morrison's concession speech - he said he was quitting as the leader of the Liberals, following their unsuccessful outing at the polls. Morrison, who led the country through bushfires and a pandemic, also gave thanks for ""the miracle of the Australian people"". ""What Australians have endured over these past few years has shown a tremendous depth of character and resilience and strength,"" he said. ""It has been the Australian people under the strong support of a strong government that's enabled all of us to come through to where we are today, and that's something that all Australians can give thanks for as 
we move forward.â He added that his party was handing over a country that was ""in a stronger position... than we inherited it when we came to government those years ago under Tony Abbott"". âWe leave government having secured our borders many years ago. And we leave government 

having restored our nation's defences.â A huge roar - the biggest of the night - erupted as Morrison ended his speech saying he ""looks ahead to victory"" in the next election, reports the BBC's Phil Mercer who was at the scene. Morrison was mobbed by television crews as he left the stage. Scott Morrison has just arrived at his Liberal party's headquarters and has conceded defeat to Labor's Anthony Albanese. He congratulated Albanese on his election success, and adds: ""This has been a time of great upheaval."" ""It is important for our nation to heal"" from disruption, he adds. The BBC's Phil Mercer who is at the scene says that a crowd of several hundred people, including former PM John Howard, had stayed behind to listen to Mr Morrison's speech. But the mood is not funereal, with free-flowing beer and wine keeping spirits up. It's hugs and cheers all round for Labor supporters this evening, as the party is set to form the country's new government. This is the first time Labor has come to power in almost a decade. Supporters were crossing their fingers for a win... ...then began to cheer as the results started coming in... ...and broke out in chants for ""Albo"" as networks called a Labor win. Labor's Sally Sitou was half-way through her victory speech when her supporters realised the party had won - and they broke out in cheers. Labor is still four seats short of the 76-mark for a majorty government, but that could change in the coming hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Moldova should be equipped to Nato standard - TrussThe foreign secretary says smaller nations should be helped to counter Russian aggression.,"Moldova should be ""equipped to Nato standard"" to help it guard against the threat of a Russian invasion, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said. Ms Truss told the Telegraph that talks were under way with allies about how to help smaller nations defend themselves. She said it was clear that, despite limited success in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin retained ""ambitions to create a greater Russia"". Moldova, once a Soviet republic, sits on Ukraine's south-western border. It does not share a border with Russia, but is close to some of the regions currently occupied by Russian forces in Ukraine's south. Moldova is not a member of Nato, although it did apply to join the European Union less than two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine. Ms Truss said that discussions about upgrading Ukrainian defences to deter future aggression would also cover ""other vulnerable states such as Moldova"". ""I would want to see Moldova equipped to Nato standard,"" she said. ""This is a discussion we're having with our allies."" Could Ukraine's war spread to Moldova? What might swing the Ukraine war? How do you join Nato? Is the Ukraine war spreading? Asked whether that was because Russia was thought to pose a security threat to Moldova, she said: ""Absolutely. I mean, Putin has been clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia. ""And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren't successful, doesn't mean he's abandoned those ambitions."" Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, is home to many ethnic Ukrainians and has taken in more than 437,000 refugees from the war. In a country of 2.6 million people that is higher than any other for the size of its population. Moldova's President Maia Sandu is strongly pro-EU, but her predecessor Igor Dodon - who still has many supporters - was pro-Russian. Russia supports separatists who control a breakaway region called Transnistria and has around 1,500 troops there. In late April, the Transnistrian authorities said that explosions had targeted their state security HQ in the main city of Tiraspol, Soviet-era radio masts used to broadcast Russian news, and a military unit in a village outsider Tiraspol. Separatist authorities blamed Ukrainian ""infiltrators"" but Kyiv said Russian special services were responsible. Dr Jack Watling, senior research fellow at defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There isn't an immediate threat against Moldova from the Russian military but there is definitely a significant threat from Russian subversive activity and destabilisation actions."" He said it was ""sensible"" to build up ""appropriate capabilities"" so Moldova ""can stand on its own two feet"" given that Russia has publicly indicated that it has designs on that country. ""It is worth doing that while you have the time to do it properly rather than coming to the problem when the threat is very acute"", he added. Ms Truss' comments come just weeks after she said the West ""must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support"" for Ukraine. Speaking in London, she said: ""If Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again."" She also called for an increase in the UK's defence spending and said that the Nato target of 2% of GDP should be a ""floor, not a ceiling"". In April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised that the UK would provide Ukraine with more military equipment. In a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky, he pledged that more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons would be sent. On Friday, the PM also held a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan in which they discussed recent applications for Nato membership by Sweden and Finland. Turkey has signalled an intention to veto the applications, accusing the countries of not taking a ""clear stance"" against Kurdish groups it considers to be terrorists. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson had told Mr ErdoÄan that Finland and Sweden would be valuable additions to the Nato alliance, and had encouraged him to work with counterparts in both countries to address any concerns ahead of a summit of the military alliance in Madrid in June.

There has been a political rift between the two countries since Australia scrapped a $37bn (Â£27bn) submarine deal with France last year, and instead made a new pact with the US and UK - so-called Aukus.  The move enraged French President Emmanuel Macron,who famously accused Mr Morrison of lying to him. ""The prime minister's defeat suits me fine,"" Mr Le Drian was quoted by AFP as saying. ""I hope we can resume frank and constructive dialogue with Australia in the future."" Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Less than half an hour after becoming Australiaâs
prime minister-elect, Anthony Albanese faced his first major challenge - being ""doorstepped"" by the BBC. For a man so new to the job of running Australia,
he was surprisingly quick to talk about international policy, saying he was a
huge supporter of theAukus defence alliancebetween Australia, the UK and the
US. Mr Albanese also said that he wanted to follow in
the UKâs footsteps in being a climate action leader. Anthony Albanese with his beloved dog Toto Anthony Albanese is set to become Australia's next prime minister after leading the Labor Party to its first election victory in almost a decade. One of the country's longest-serving politicians, he promised voters ""safe change"" as he worked to kick out the conservative Liberal-National coalition which has been in power since 2013. Where ousted Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a self-described ""bulldozer"", Mr Albanese vows to be a ""builder"". After the pandemic, which saw Australian states cut off from each other and cities splintered by strict lockdowns, fostering unity is a top priority for the new leader. So who is Albo? Mr Albanese has earned a reputation as a defender of Australia's free healthcare system, an advocate for the LGBT community, a republican, and a passionate rugby league fan. The 59-year-old - nicknamed Albo - was raised in social housing by a single mother on a disability pension. He has often cited his upbringing as the foundation for his progressive beliefs. Read more here. Going into the election, all signs indicated incumbent PM Scott Morrison was in trouble. His tenure has been dominated by disasters and the pandemic, but also by his governmentâs many scandals. There was the ill-timed holiday to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia and the way his government treated women and handled sexual harassment claims. His character has also come under fire, from members of his own party and even the French President who accused him of lying. Last election he was dubbed a ""miracle-worker"" for pulling off an unexpected victory. So how did things go so wrong for ScoMo?Read more here. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney Every sentence Anthony Albanese delivered at Labor HQ was met with rapturous applause. Whether it was a commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, making Australia the leader in renewable energy as part of a major shift in climate policy, or protecting the minimum wages of young workers to make sure they  kept up with inflation - with his call for optimism, not fear, Anthony Albanese outlined a different vision for Australia from the one projected by Scott Morrison. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken to Twitter to congratulate new Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese. ""I look forward to working with you as we reap the rewards of our comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, the AUKUS partnership and the unmatched closeness between the British and Australian people,"" he wrote. More from Anthony Albanese's speech. The incoming PM preached a message of unity and hope, saying he wanted to ""bring Australians together"". ""I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity and optimism, not fear and division. It is a show of strength to collaborate and work with people, not weakness."" He also urged Australians to seize opportunities ""to shape change, rather than be shaped by it"", and said that together the country could ""end the climate wars"", become a renewable energy ""superpower"", as well as strengthen the economy, healthcare, and childcare. He also promised to establish a national anti-corruption commission, and reaffirmed his commitment to womens and Indigenous people's rights. He ended his speech thanking his party colleagues, campaign team, family, and finally his mum who is ""beaming down on us"". ""I hope there are families in public housing watching this tonight. Because I want every parent to be able to tell their child no matter where you live or where you come from, in Australia the doors of opportunity are open to us all."" Peter Dutton has scraped through in his Queensland seat of Dickson, paving the way for him to become the next Liberal Party leader after Scott Morrison's resignation. If he does put his hand up, it'll be Mr Dutton's second tilt at the top job. He unsuccessfully challenged then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2018 after a dispute over energy policy. But it was Scott Morrison who ultimately won the party room support to replace Mr Turnbull. Mr Dutton - from the party's right faction - has been a controversial figure, and there are questions over whether he'll be able to win back support that the party lost in more progressive, metropolitan seats. Incoming Prime Minister Albanese said that PM Scott Morrison had in an earlier phone call ""very graciously wished me well"". ""I thanked him for that and I wish him well. And I thank him for the service that he has given to our country as Prime Minister."" Albanese went on to refer to his own humble beginnings as the ""son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing"". ""I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars. I want Australia to continue to be acountry that no matter where you live, who you worship, who you love or what your last name is, that places no restrictions on your journey in life."" At this point Albanese was drowned out by repeated cheering and chants of his name, to which he jokingly responded: ""I know at the beginning of the campaign they said people didn't know me but I reckon they've got [the name by now].... Can we have a bit of order? I intend to run an orderly government and it starts here, so behave."" Anthony Albanese, Australia's next prime minister, has just arrived at Labor's party headquarters to thunderous applause and cheers. He began his speech thanking Australians ""for this extraordinary honour"". ""Tonight the Australian people have voted for change. I am humbled by this victory and I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia. ""My Labor team will work every day to bring Australians together. And I will lead a government worthy of the people of Australia. A government as courageous and hard working and caring as the Australian people are themselves."" Australia's Treasurer and Liberal party member Josh Frydenberg has acknowledged it will be difficult to hold onto his Kooyong seat in Melbourne, as independent ""teal"" candidate Monique Ryan looks set to win. Kooyong has long been a Liberal seat, and this will mark a shock loss to a complete political newcomer. Frydenberg will also become one of the highest-ranking cabinet ministers to ever be voted out. ""While it's mathematically possible that we win in Kooyong, it's definitely difficult,"" Frydenberg told supporters in a televised speech. His mood was markedly different earlier today when he posed for pictures with voters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The first Indigenous person to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to serve as a minister has lost his seat. Ken Wyatt's seat of Hasluck has fallen to Labor as the Liberal Party suffer a massive swing against them in the state of Western Australia. Mr Wyatt - who has Noongar, Yamatji and Wongi heritage - was elected in 2010, and became the Assistant Minister for Health in 2015. He's held a number of portfolios since then, and in 2019 become the first Aboriginal person to be the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Liberal colleague Senator Simon Birmingham said his defeat is a huge loss for the parliament. ""While there are many colleagues I would grieve for tonight, it is important that we note the historic contribution that Ken Wyatt made to the parliament, as an Indigenous Australian, to serve at the highest levels of office,"" he said. ""We pay tribute to him tonight.""  Ken Wyatt was elected in 2010 Anthony Albanese will be Australia's next PM, but Scott Morrison's Liberal-National coalition appears to be in the lead on first-preference votes (see the chart below). Why is that? It's because Australia uses a preferential voting system - each ballot is numbered by voters from their most to least preferred. Candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated, but votes for them are still counted - theyâre re-distributed to the next preference listed on each ballot. The process is repeated until only two candidates are left, and the person with the majority is declared the winner. So under preferential voting, many of the Greens votes, for instance, are likely to move to Labor - as those voters are likely to have preferenced Labor above the Liberals. Nationally, networks are projecting that just over half the first-preference vote will go to Labor. Morrison took to the stage amid chants of ""Scomo, Scomo"" More on Morrison's concession speech - he said he was quitting as the leader of the Liberals, following their unsuccessful outing at the polls. Morrison, who led the country through bushfires and a pandemic, also gave thanks for ""the miracle of the Australian people"". ""What Australians have endured over these past few years has shown a tremendous depth of character and resilience and strength,"" he said. ""It has been the Australian people under the strong support of a strong government that's enabled all of us to come through to where we are today, and that's something that all Australians can give thanks for as 
we move forward.â He added that his party was handing over a country that was ""in a stronger position... than we inherited it when we came to government those years ago under Tony Abbott"". âWe leave government having secured our borders many years ago. And we leave government 

having restored our nation's defences.â A huge roar - the biggest of the night - erupted as Morrison ended his speech saying he ""looks ahead to victory"" in the next election, reports the BBC's Phil Mercer who was at the scene. Morrison was mobbed by television crews as he left the stage. Scott Morrison has just arrived at his Liberal party's headquarters and has conceded defeat to Labor's Anthony Albanese. He congratulated Albanese on his election success, and adds: ""This has been a time of great upheaval."" ""It is important for our nation to heal"" from disruption, he adds. The BBC's Phil Mercer who is at the scene says that a crowd of several hundred people, including former PM John Howard, had stayed behind to listen to Mr Morrison's speech. But the mood is not funereal, with free-flowing beer and wine keeping spirits up. It's hugs and cheers all round for Labor supporters this evening, as the party is set to form the country's new government. This is the first time Labor has come to power in almost a decade. Supporters were crossing their fingers for a win... ...then began to cheer as the results started coming in... ...and broke out in chants for ""Albo"" as networks called a Labor win. Labor's Sally Sitou was half-way through her victory speech when her supporters realised the party had won - and they broke out in cheers. Labor is still four seats short of the 76-mark for a majorty government, but that could change in the coming hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

"HRT swaps to fix supply shortage for UK womenPharmacists will be able to give suitable replacements, without needing a brand new prescription.","Pharmacists are being given temporary power to make swaps to women's hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions, amid ongoing shortages of some products in the UK. Products that may be substituted by a pharmacist without a new prescription from a doctor include some gels - Oestrogel and another called Sandrena. Ovestin cream and a spray called Lenzettoare also on the list.,external Hormone patches would be a good swap, and these are in plentiful supply. Anyone who has questions or concerns about HRT should speak to their pharmacist or doctor, experts advise. 'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying' The Royal Pharmaceutical Society welcomed the move but said it would still like to seea permanent change in the lawto make it easier for pharmacists to make swift appropriate swaps for all types of medicine - not just certain HRT products when they are in short supply. The government says it has been looking at a variety of ways to improve supply quickly after it heard how women were experiencing distressing symptoms, because they were unable to get their choice of medication. Madeline McTernan - the new HRT tsar whose job is to help solve the crisis - said the situation was improving. She said: ""I am very encouraged by the constructive engagement across the sector, and enthusiasm with which suppliers and pharmacists are looking to work with us to meet this challenge. ""Focusing both on measures that ensure we can use stocks most efficiently, whilst also ensuring supply is increased, is critical."" Women's health minister Maria Caulfield said manufacturers had told the government that by June ""they should be in a better position [on supplies]"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that of more than 70 HRT products available in the UK, ""it is only about 10 where there is a struggle with supply"". She added that ""we are looking at all options"" when asked about making permanent the temporary powers pharmacies have to swap prescriptions. Prof Claire Anderson, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ""The advice on which HRT product to substitute with another has been drawn up by experts, and women can be confident they will receive what's appropriate for them. ""This short-term measure will help women access supplies of HRT medicines, which are difficult to get hold of. ""This is a very fluid situation with some products due to return to normal availability shortly."" Availability of a tablet called Premique Low Dose has improved, and there are now good stocks of it in pharmacies. TheBritish Menopause Society,externalhas information on choosing HRT products, as does the health advisory bodythe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).,external HRT is a treatment designed to relieve symptoms of the menopause. The shortage has meantsome women turning to the black market. Some pharmaceutical companies say increased demand is the main reason why some supplies have run low. That demand is driven by a greater awareness around the menopause - thanks to campaigns - and more confidence around prescribing HRT.

Boeing astronaut capsule launches on test flight,"For this demonstration flight, no humans are aboard The American Boeing company has launched its new astronaut capsule on a demonstration flight from Florida. Called Starliner, the vehicle left Cape Canaveral Space Force Station atop an Atlas rocket on a mission to showcase how it can ferry human crews to and from the International Space Station. It's the second such test flight. Theprevious demonstration, in 2019, encountered software problems that very nearly resulted in the loss of the capsule. Boeing had attempted to fly Thursday's mission in August last year but was forced to abandon that exercise when valves in the capsule's propulsion system wouldn't open and close properly on the launch pad. This issue still requires a permanent fix but engineers were happy to let the latest launch go ahead with temporary corrective measures in place. ""I'm really proud to be able to say that the Starliner had a good orbital insertion and it's on its way to the International Space Station,"" said Mark Nappi, vice president and programme manager of Boeing's Commercial Crew Programme. ""We're very, very proud of the team and what they've accomplished. This was a road of a lot of hard work to get here, and the team is just ecstatic about the accomplishments today."" No humans, but ""Rosie the Rocketeer"" will be aboard The US space agency, too, declared its satisfaction. Nasa has crews waiting to use a certified Starliner. It emerged post-launch that two of 12 larger thrusters used for the major manoeuvres in space were not working. But this was not a critical issue, said Steve Stich, who manages Nasa's Commercial Crew Programme. ""Overall, the spacecraft is doing really well. The communications has been excellent, the flight software has worked great, the cooling system has been working great,"" he told reporters. ""We're very excited to be here and looking forward to docking to the space station [on Friday]."" The Starliner - which is flying without a crew for the demonstration - began its ascent on the Atlas at 18:54 local time on Thursday (22:54 GMT; 23:54 BST). The automated docking with the station took place at 20:28 EDT on Friday (00:28 GMT on Saturday), more than an hour later than scheduled. Artwork: The flight time to the space station is about 24 hours It's almost 12 years since Boeing first presented its designfor Starliner, codenamed CST-100, at the Farnborough International Air Show in the UK. It was a response to the call for commercial companies to take over the responsibility for low-Earth orbit crew transportation, post the then soon-to-retire space shuttles. Nasa gave technical and financial support to both Boeing and California's SpaceX company, to help them develop new capsules. The idea was that the vehicles would then be engaged on a commercial basis whenever Nasa needed astronauts sent up to the ISS. But while SpaceX is now four crewed operational flights into this new era, Boeing has yet to run a single crewed mission in a Starliner. And a big part of that is because Boeing's first unpiloted ""Orbital Flight Test"" in December 2019 went seriously awry. The problems started with a clock error on the capsule just after launch that made the vehicle think it was in a different flight phase than was really the case. This prompted the onboard computer system to over-fire Starliner's thrusters and burn so much fuel it became impossible to reach the intended destination of a docking with the space station. Controllers on the ground could see the problem playing out but had difficulty communicating with the spacecraft. After the truncated mission, it also emerged that poorly designed software could have resulted in the capsule colliding with its aft service section when the two were commanded to separate just prior to re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. Fortunately, this issue was caught and prevented, and the capsule landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The post-mission review initiated a series of re-designs and upgrades that have enabled Boeing to approach an Orbital Flight Test 2 (OFT-2). It's 12 years since the initial proposal for Starliner was presented The re-run is following the same planned profile: an uncrewed mission to the International Space Station. That said, an anthropomorphic test device, more commonly known as a flight dummy, dubbed ""Rosie the Rocketeer"", is once again strapped in for the ride. Rosie and ""her"" capsule will stay attached to the station for four to five days, before departing for a parachute-assisted descent and landing at the White Sands Missile Range in New Mexico. Assuming everything goes to plan, touchdown is likely to occur on Wednesday next week. If Boeing can put the flaws of OFT-1 behind it, Nasa could clear Starliner to start carrying people before the end of the year. This would finally give Nasa the two new crew-transportation systems it sought when the shuttles were retired to museums in 2011. Kathy Lueders, the agency's associate administrator for space operations, congratulated everyone on Thursday's launch. ""But as we've talked about numerous times: we're doing this one step at a time; and we right now need to get this spacecraft through its paces, and learn some things and get it on its way to the International Space Station.""

"LiveLiveMillions of Australians head to polls to pick PMIt's the first election since 2019, and predicted to be tight - here's what's happening on the ground.Australia","Labor will form the next government after the Liberal-National coalition has failed to win enough seats But it is still not clear whether it will be a majority leadership or in coalition with independents and other parties Anthony Albanese will be the country's new prime minister overseeing the first Labor government in almost a decade Incumbent PM Scott Morrison has conceded defeat and congratulated Mr Albanese on his win Independents have also done well in the election so far, amid public dissatisfaction with the two major parties The rising cost of living and climate change have dominated this election as two key issues for voters It's nearly 3am in Sydney, where a few hours ago Australia's new PM Anthony Albanese gave a victory speech to thousands of cheering supporters. ""I want to bring Australia together. I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity, and not fear or division,""  said the 59-year-old veteran politician who has led Labor back to power after nearly a decade. Here's a recap of the day's biggest takeaways:  This live page was brought to you by Rebecca Seales, Yvette Tan, Tessa Wong, Zubaidah Abdul Jalil and Aparna Alluri in Singapore, Jay Savage, Tiffanie Turnbull, Isabelle Rodd and Frances Mao in Sydney, Kirstan Ross in Melbourne, Zoe Kean in Hobart, and Tiffany Wertheimer in London. Thank you for joining us! As the day comes to an end, here's a look at some of the millions of Australians who cast their ballots today to elect a new government. Voters pose with their pooch outside a polling station in Melbourne A man votes at Bondi Beach, Sydney, wearing a pair of Speedos - what Australians affectionately call ""budgie smugglers"" Two year-old Lexi enjoys a ""democracy sausage"" - a staunch Australian tradition - after her parents voted in Dickson, Brisbane Brisbane voters wait in the rain to cast their ballots Peter Power enjoys a sausage sizzle after voting in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, with his dogs Lily and Dancer in tow Simon AtkinsonBBC News The first couple of days in a new job are often pretty cruisy right? Get set up on your email, find out where the stationery is kept, maybe discover what to do if there's a fire. But Anthony Albanese has got a more intense start. He will need to be sworn in as Prime Minister pretty quickly - perhaps as soon as Sunday. Because on Monday he will fly to Tokyo for the Quad leader's meeting with US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. France's outgoing Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said Scott Morrison's defeat at the polls on Saturday ""suits me fine"". There has been a political rift between the two countries since Australia scrapped a $37bn (Â£27bn) submarine deal with France last year, and instead made a new pact with the US and UK - so-called Aukus.  The move enraged French President Emmanuel Macron,who famously accused Mr Morrison of lying to him. ""The prime minister's defeat suits me fine,"" Mr Le Drian was quoted by AFP as saying. ""I hope we can resume frank and constructive dialogue with Australia in the future."" Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Less than half an hour after becoming Australiaâs
prime minister-elect, Anthony Albanese faced his first major challenge - being ""doorstepped"" by the BBC. For a man so new to the job of running Australia,
he was surprisingly quick to talk about international policy, saying he was a
huge supporter of theAukus defence alliancebetween Australia, the UK and the
US. Mr Albanese also said that he wanted to follow in
the UKâs footsteps in being a climate action leader. Anthony Albanese with his beloved dog Toto Anthony Albanese is set to become Australia's next prime minister after leading the Labor Party to its first election victory in almost a decade. One of the country's longest-serving politicians, he promised voters ""safe change"" as he worked to kick out the conservative Liberal-National coalition which has been in power since 2013. Where ousted Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a self-described ""bulldozer"", Mr Albanese vows to be a ""builder"". After the pandemic, which saw Australian states cut off from each other and cities splintered by strict lockdowns, fostering unity is a top priority for the new leader. So who is Albo? Mr Albanese has earned a reputation as a defender of Australia's free healthcare system, an advocate for the LGBT community, a republican, and a passionate rugby league fan. The 59-year-old - nicknamed Albo - was raised in social housing by a single mother on a disability pension. He has often cited his upbringing as the foundation for his progressive beliefs. Read more here. Going into the election, all signs indicated incumbent PM Scott Morrison was in trouble. His tenure has been dominated by disasters and the pandemic, but also by his governmentâs many scandals. There was the ill-timed holiday to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia and the way his government treated women and handled sexual harassment claims. His character has also come under fire, from members of his own party and even the French President who accused him of lying. Last election he was dubbed a ""miracle-worker"" for pulling off an unexpected victory. So how did things go so wrong for ScoMo?Read more here. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney Every sentence Anthony Albanese delivered at Labor HQ was met with rapturous applause. Whether it was a commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, making Australia the leader in renewable energy as part of a major shift in climate policy, or protecting the minimum wages of young workers to make sure they  kept up with inflation - with his call for optimism, not fear, Anthony Albanese outlined a different vision for Australia from the one projected by Scott Morrison. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken to Twitter to congratulate new Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese. ""I look forward to working with you as we reap the rewards of our comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, the AUKUS partnership and the unmatched closeness between the British and Australian people,"" he wrote. More from Anthony Albanese's speech. The incoming PM preached a message of unity and hope, saying he wanted to ""bring Australians together"". ""I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity and optimism, not fear and division. It is a show of strength to collaborate and work with people, not weakness."" He also urged Australians to seize opportunities ""to shape change, rather than be shaped by it"", and said that together the country could ""end the climate wars"", become a renewable energy ""superpower"", as well as strengthen the economy, healthcare, and childcare. He also promised to establish a national anti-corruption commission, and reaffirmed his commitment to womens and Indigenous people's rights. He ended his speech thanking his party colleagues, campaign team, family, and finally his mum who is ""beaming down on us"". ""I hope there are families in public housing watching this tonight. Because I want every parent to be able to tell their child no matter where you live or where you come from, in Australia the doors of opportunity are open to us all."" Peter Dutton has scraped through in his Queensland seat of Dickson, paving the way for him to become the next Liberal Party leader after Scott Morrison's resignation. If he does put his hand up, it'll be Mr Dutton's second tilt at the top job. He unsuccessfully challenged then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2018 after a dispute over energy policy. But it was Scott Morrison who ultimately won the party room support to replace Mr Turnbull. Mr Dutton - from the party's right faction - has been a controversial figure, and there are questions over whether he'll be able to win back support that the party lost in more progressive, metropolitan seats. Incoming Prime Minister Albanese said that PM Scott Morrison had in an earlier phone call ""very graciously wished me well"". ""I thanked him for that and I wish him well. And I thank him for the service that he has given to our country as Prime Minister."" Albanese went on to refer to his own humble beginnings as the ""son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing"". ""I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars. I want Australia to continue to be acountry that no matter where you live, who you worship, who you love or what your last name is, that places no restrictions on your journey in life."" At this point Albanese was drowned out by repeated cheering and chants of his name, to which he jokingly responded: ""I know at the beginning of the campaign they said people didn't know me but I reckon they've got [the name by now].... Can we have a bit of order? I intend to run an orderly government and it starts here, so behave."" Anthony Albanese, Australia's next prime minister, has just arrived at Labor's party headquarters to thunderous applause and cheers. He began his speech thanking Australians ""for this extraordinary honour"". ""Tonight the Australian people have voted for change. I am humbled by this victory and I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia. ""My Labor team will work every day to bring Australians together. And I will lead a government worthy of the people of Australia. A government as courageous and hard working and caring as the Australian people are themselves."" Australia's Treasurer and Liberal party member Josh Frydenberg has acknowledged it will be difficult to hold onto his Kooyong seat in Melbourne, as independent ""teal"" candidate Monique Ryan looks set to win. Kooyong has long been a Liberal seat, and this will mark a shock loss to a complete political newcomer. Frydenberg will also become one of the highest-ranking cabinet ministers to ever be voted out. ""While it's mathematically possible that we win in Kooyong, it's definitely difficult,"" Frydenberg told supporters in a televised speech. His mood was markedly different earlier today when he posed for pictures with voters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The first Indigenous person to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to serve as a minister has lost his seat. Ken Wyatt's seat of Hasluck has fallen to Labor as the Liberal Party suffer a massive swing against them in the state of Western Australia. Mr Wyatt - who has Noongar, Yamatji and Wongi heritage - was elected in 2010, and became the Assistant Minister for Health in 2015. He's held a number of portfolios since then, and in 2019 become the first Aboriginal person to be the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Liberal colleague Senator Simon Birmingham said his defeat is a huge loss for the parliament. ""While there are many colleagues I would grieve for tonight, it is important that we note the historic contribution that Ken Wyatt made to the parliament, as an Indigenous Australian, to serve at the highest levels of office,"" he said. ""We pay tribute to him tonight.""  Ken Wyatt was elected in 2010 Anthony Albanese will be Australia's next PM, but Scott Morrison's Liberal-National coalition appears to be in the lead on first-preference votes (see the chart below). Why is that? It's because Australia uses a preferential voting system - each ballot is numbered by voters from their most to least preferred. Candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated, but votes for them are still counted - theyâre re-distributed to the next preference listed on each ballot. The process is repeated until only two candidates are left, and the person with the majority is declared the winner. So under preferential voting, many of the Greens votes, for instance, are likely to move to Labor - as those voters are likely to have preferenced Labor above the Liberals. Nationally, networks are projecting that just over half the first-preference vote will go to Labor. Morrison took to the stage amid chants of ""Scomo, Scomo"" More on Morrison's concession speech - he said he was quitting as the leader of the Liberals, following their unsuccessful outing at the polls. Morrison, who led the country through bushfires and a pandemic, also gave thanks for ""the miracle of the Australian people"". ""What Australians have endured over these past few years has shown a tremendous depth of character and resilience and strength,"" he said. ""It has been the Australian people under the strong support of a strong government that's enabled all of us to come through to where we are today, and that's something that all Australians can give thanks for as 
we move forward.â He added that his party was handing over a country that was ""in a stronger position... than we inherited it when we came to government those years ago under Tony Abbott"". âWe leave government having secured our borders many years ago. And we leave government 

having restored our nation's defences.â A huge roar - the biggest of the night - erupted as Morrison ended his speech saying he ""looks ahead to victory"" in the next election, reports the BBC's Phil Mercer who was at the scene. Morrison was mobbed by television crews as he left the stage. Scott Morrison has just arrived at his Liberal party's headquarters and has conceded defeat to Labor's Anthony Albanese. He congratulated Albanese on his election success, and adds: ""This has been a time of great upheaval."" ""It is important for our nation to heal"" from disruption, he adds. The BBC's Phil Mercer who is at the scene says that a crowd of several hundred people, including former PM John Howard, had stayed behind to listen to Mr Morrison's speech. But the mood is not funereal, with free-flowing beer and wine keeping spirits up. It's hugs and cheers all round for Labor supporters this evening, as the party is set to form the country's new government. This is the first time Labor has come to power in almost a decade. Supporters were crossing their fingers for a win... ...then began to cheer as the results started coming in... ...and broke out in chants for ""Albo"" as networks called a Labor win. Labor's Sally Sitou was half-way through her victory speech when her supporters realised the party had won - and they broke out in cheers. Labor is still four seats short of the 76-mark for a majorty government, but that could change in the coming hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Moldova should be 'equipped to Nato standard' - TrussThe foreign secretary says talks are under way on how to help smaller nations guard against Russian aggression.UK,"Moldova should be ""equipped to Nato standard"" to help it guard against the threat of a Russian invasion, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said. Ms Truss told the Telegraph that talks were under way with allies about how to help smaller nations defend themselves. She said it was clear that, despite limited success in Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin retained ""ambitions to create a greater Russia"". Moldova, once a Soviet republic, sits on Ukraine's south-western border. It does not share a border with Russia, but is close to some of the regions currently occupied by Russian forces in Ukraine's south. Moldova is not a member of Nato, although it did apply to join the European Union less than two weeks after the invasion of Ukraine. Ms Truss said that discussions about upgrading Ukrainian defences to deter future aggression would also cover ""other vulnerable states such as Moldova"". ""I would want to see Moldova equipped to Nato standard,"" she said. ""This is a discussion we're having with our allies."" Could Ukraine's war spread to Moldova? What might swing the Ukraine war? How do you join Nato? Is the Ukraine war spreading? Asked whether that was because Russia was thought to pose a security threat to Moldova, she said: ""Absolutely. I mean, Putin has been clear about his ambitions to create a greater Russia. ""And just because his attempts to take Kyiv weren't successful, doesn't mean he's abandoned those ambitions."" Moldova, one of Europe's poorest countries, is home to many ethnic Ukrainians and has taken in more than 437,000 refugees from the war. In a country of 2.6 million people that is higher than any other for the size of its population. Moldova's President Maia Sandu is strongly pro-EU, but her predecessor Igor Dodon - who still has many supporters - was pro-Russian. Russia supports separatists who control a breakaway region called Transnistria and has around 1,500 troops there. In late April, the Transnistrian authorities said that explosions had targeted their state security HQ in the main city of Tiraspol, Soviet-era radio masts used to broadcast Russian news, and a military unit in a village outsider Tiraspol. Separatist authorities blamed Ukrainian ""infiltrators"" but Kyiv said Russian special services were responsible. Dr Jack Watling, senior research fellow at defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There isn't an immediate threat against Moldova from the Russian military but there is definitely a significant threat from Russian subversive activity and destabilisation actions."" He said it was ""sensible"" to build up ""appropriate capabilities"" so Moldova ""can stand on its own two feet"" given that Russia has publicly indicated that it has designs on that country. ""It is worth doing that while you have the time to do it properly rather than coming to the problem when the threat is very acute"", he added. Ms Truss' comments come just weeks after she said the West ""must be prepared for the long haul and double down on our support"" for Ukraine. Speaking in London, she said: ""If Putin succeeds there will be untold further misery across Europe and terrible consequences across the globe. We would never feel safe again."" She also called for an increase in the UK's defence spending and said that the Nato target of 2% of GDP should be a ""floor, not a ceiling"". In April, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised that the UK would provide Ukraine with more military equipment. In a phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky, he pledged that more armoured vehicles, drones and anti-tank weapons would be sent. On Friday, the PM also held a call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip ErdoÄan in which they discussed recent applications for Nato membership by Sweden and Finland. Turkey has signalled an intention to veto the applications, accusing the countries of not taking a ""clear stance"" against Kurdish groups it considers to be terrorists. A Downing Street spokesperson said Mr Johnson had told Mr ErdoÄan that Finland and Sweden would be valuable additions to the Nato alliance, and had encouraged him to work with counterparts in both countries to address any concerns ahead of a summit of the military alliance in Madrid in June.

"HRT swaps to fix supply shortage for UK womenPharmacists will be able to give suitable replacement products, without needing a brand new prescription.Health","Pharmacists are being given temporary power to make swaps to women's hormone replacement therapy (HRT) prescriptions, amid ongoing shortages of some products in the UK. Products that may be substituted by a pharmacist without a new prescription from a doctor include some gels - Oestrogel and another called Sandrena. Ovestin cream and a spray called Lenzettoare also on the list.,external Hormone patches would be a good swap, and these are in plentiful supply. Anyone who has questions or concerns about HRT should speak to their pharmacist or doctor, experts advise. 'The thought of running out of HRT is terrifying' The Royal Pharmaceutical Society welcomed the move but said it would still like to seea permanent change in the lawto make it easier for pharmacists to make swift appropriate swaps for all types of medicine - not just certain HRT products when they are in short supply. The government says it has been looking at a variety of ways to improve supply quickly after it heard how women were experiencing distressing symptoms, because they were unable to get their choice of medication. Madeline McTernan - the new HRT tsar whose job is to help solve the crisis - said the situation was improving. She said: ""I am very encouraged by the constructive engagement across the sector, and enthusiasm with which suppliers and pharmacists are looking to work with us to meet this challenge. ""Focusing both on measures that ensure we can use stocks most efficiently, whilst also ensuring supply is increased, is critical."" Women's health minister Maria Caulfield said manufacturers had told the government that by June ""they should be in a better position [on supplies]"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that of more than 70 HRT products available in the UK, ""it is only about 10 where there is a struggle with supply"". She added that ""we are looking at all options"" when asked about making permanent the temporary powers pharmacies have to swap prescriptions. Prof Claire Anderson, president of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society, said: ""The advice on which HRT product to substitute with another has been drawn up by experts, and women can be confident they will receive what's appropriate for them. ""This short-term measure will help women access supplies of HRT medicines, which are difficult to get hold of. ""This is a very fluid situation with some products due to return to normal availability shortly."" Availability of a tablet called Premique Low Dose has improved, and there are now good stocks of it in pharmacies. TheBritish Menopause Society,externalhas information on choosing HRT products, as does the health advisory bodythe National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE).,external HRT is a treatment designed to relieve symptoms of the menopause. The shortage has meantsome women turning to the black market. Some pharmaceutical companies say increased demand is the main reason why some supplies have run low. That demand is driven by a greater awareness around the menopause - thanks to campaigns - and more confidence around prescribing HRT.

France's mustard shortage leaves sour tasteThe price of the condiment is up 10% due to poor harvests and the impact of the war in Ukraine.Europe,"Mustard is a popular ingredient in French cuisine French shoppers are facing a sour sight in supermarkets this summer - no mustard. The nationwide shortage is due to a lack of mustard seeds needed to produce the condiment. Severe drought in Canada, poor harvests in France and the war in Ukraine have combined to reduce the supplies of mustard seeds available to producers. The price of mustard has shot up by 10% in France as a result, and some shops are struggling to restock jars. Canada, where France imports many of its mustard seeds from, was hit by drought last year that collapsed crop yields in the country's agricultural west. Not all droughts are due to climate change, but excess heat in the atmosphere is drawing more moisture out of the earth and making droughts worse. The world has already warmed by about 1.2C since since the industrial era began and temperatures will keep rising unless governments around the world make steep cuts to emissions. Meanwhile in France domestic mustard seed harvests have fallen short of expectations for three years in a row, most recently due to a wet winter and cold spring. Luc Vondermaeson, who is managing director of France's third-largest mustard manufacturer La Reine de Dijon, told the BBC that production was running at 20-25% below normal. Seeds could still be found in January and February, he said, but availability had dwindled since then. ""The market is totally empty. Everything has been booked and we have difficulty obtaining seeds."" Mustard seed plants before harvest in France French producers had originally hoped to import additional mustard seeds from Russia or Ukraine to make up for the shortfall, but since the invasion this has no longer been possible. The war has disrupted global supply chains for many agricultural products. Russia's attacks on and blockade of Ukraine's Black Sea ports and Western sanctions on Moscow have combined to severely limit the amount of food either country is exporting to the rest of the world. Earlier this week theUnited Nations warned that the invasion could cause a global food crisis lasting for years.. And in the UK, disruption of supplies of sunflower oil from Ukraine last month led to supermarketslimiting how many bottles of cooking oil customers could buy.

I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity, and not fear or division,""  said the 59-year-old veteran politician who has led Labor back to power after nearly a decade.

Thank you for joining us! As the day comes to an end, here's a look at some of the millions of Australians who cast their ballots today to elect a new government. Voters pose with their pooch outside a polling station in Melbourne A man votes at Bondi Beach, Sydney, wearing a pair of Speedos - what Australians affectionately call ""budgie smugglers"" Two year-old Lexi enjoys a ""democracy sausage"" - a staunch Australian tradition - after her parents voted in Dickson, Brisbane Brisbane voters wait in the rain to cast their ballots Peter Power enjoys a sausage sizzle after voting in Bellevue Hill, Sydney, with his dogs Lily and Dancer in tow Simon AtkinsonBBC News The first couple of days in a new job are often pretty cruisy right? Get set up on your email, find out where the stationery is kept, maybe discover what to do if there's a fire. But Anthony Albanese has got a more intense start. He will need to be sworn in as Prime Minister pretty quickly - perhaps as soon as Sunday. Because on Monday he will fly to Tokyo for the Quad leader's meeting with US President Joe Biden, Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi. France's outgoing Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has said Scott Morrison's defeat at the polls on Saturday ""suits me fine"". There has been a political rift between the two countries since Australia scrapped a $37bn (Â£27bn) submarine deal with France last year, and instead made a new pact with the US and UK - so-called Aukus.  The move enraged French President Emmanuel Macron,who famously accused Mr Morrison of lying to him. ""The prime minister's defeat suits me fine,"" Mr Le Drian was quoted by AFP as saying. ""I hope we can resume frank and constructive dialogue with Australia in the future."" Shaimaa KhalilAustralia correspondent Less than half an hour after becoming Australiaâs
prime minister-elect, Anthony Albanese faced his first major challenge - being ""doorstepped"" by the BBC. For a man so new to the job of running Australia,
he was surprisingly quick to talk about international policy, saying he was a
huge supporter of theAukus defence alliancebetween Australia, the UK and the
US. Mr Albanese also said that he wanted to follow in
the UKâs footsteps in being a climate action leader. Anthony Albanese with his beloved dog Toto Anthony Albanese is set to become Australia's next prime minister after leading the Labor Party to its first election victory in almost a decade. One of the country's longest-serving politicians, he promised voters ""safe change"" as he worked to kick out the conservative Liberal-National coalition which has been in power since 2013. Where ousted Prime Minister Scott Morrison is a self-described ""bulldozer"", Mr Albanese vows to be a ""builder"". After the pandemic, which saw Australian states cut off from each other and cities splintered by strict lockdowns, fostering unity is a top priority for the new leader. So who is Albo? Mr Albanese has earned a reputation as a defender of Australia's free healthcare system, an advocate for the LGBT community, a republican, and a passionate rugby league fan. The 59-year-old - nicknamed Albo - was raised in social housing by a single mother on a disability pension. He has often cited his upbringing as the foundation for his progressive beliefs. Read more here. Going into the election, all signs indicated incumbent PM Scott Morrison was in trouble. His tenure has been dominated by disasters and the pandemic, but also by his governmentâs many scandals. There was the ill-timed holiday to Hawaii as bushfires raged across Australia and the way his government treated women and handled sexual harassment claims. His character has also come under fire, from members of his own party and even the French President who accused him of lying. Last election he was dubbed a ""miracle-worker"" for pulling off an unexpected victory. So how did things go so wrong for ScoMo?Read more here. Simon AtkinsonBBC News, Sydney Every sentence Anthony Albanese delivered at Labor HQ was met with rapturous applause. Whether it was a commitment to the Uluru Statement from the Heart, making Australia the leader in renewable energy as part of a major shift in climate policy, or protecting the minimum wages of young workers to make sure they  kept up with inflation - with his call for optimism, not fear, Anthony Albanese outlined a different vision for Australia from the one projected by Scott Morrison. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has taken to Twitter to congratulate new Australian prime minister Anthony Albanese. ""I look forward to working with you as we reap the rewards of our comprehensive Free Trade Agreement, the AUKUS partnership and the unmatched closeness between the British and Australian people,"" he wrote. More from Anthony Albanese's speech. The incoming PM preached a message of unity and hope, saying he wanted to ""bring Australians together"". ""I want to seek our common purpose and promote unity and optimism, not fear and division. It is a show of strength to collaborate and work with people, not weakness."" He also urged Australians to seize opportunities ""to shape change, rather than be shaped by it"", and said that together the country could ""end the climate wars"", become a renewable energy ""superpower"", as well as strengthen the economy, healthcare, and childcare. He also promised to establish a national anti-corruption commission, and reaffirmed his commitment to womens and Indigenous people's rights. He ended his speech thanking his party colleagues, campaign team, family, and finally his mum who is ""beaming down on us"". ""I hope there are families in public housing watching this tonight. Because I want every parent to be able to tell their child no matter where you live or where you come from, in Australia the doors of opportunity are open to us all."" Peter Dutton has scraped through in his Queensland seat of Dickson, paving the way for him to become the next Liberal Party leader after Scott Morrison's resignation. If he does put his hand up, it'll be Mr Dutton's second tilt at the top job. He unsuccessfully challenged then-Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in 2018 after a dispute over energy policy. But it was Scott Morrison who ultimately won the party room support to replace Mr Turnbull. Mr Dutton - from the party's right faction - has been a controversial figure, and there are questions over whether he'll be able to win back support that the party lost in more progressive, metropolitan seats. Incoming Prime Minister Albanese said that PM Scott Morrison had in an earlier phone call ""very graciously wished me well"". ""I thanked him for that and I wish him well. And I thank him for the service that he has given to our country as Prime Minister."" Albanese went on to refer to his own humble beginnings as the ""son of a single mum who was a disability pensioner, who grew up in public housing"". ""I hope that my journey in life inspires Australians to reach for the stars. I want Australia to continue to be acountry that no matter where you live, who you worship, who you love or what your last name is, that places no restrictions on your journey in life."" At this point Albanese was drowned out by repeated cheering and chants of his name, to which he jokingly responded: ""I know at the beginning of the campaign they said people didn't know me but I reckon they've got [the name by now].... Can we have a bit of order? I intend to run an orderly government and it starts here, so behave."" Anthony Albanese, Australia's next prime minister, has just arrived at Labor's party headquarters to thunderous applause and cheers. He began his speech thanking Australians ""for this extraordinary honour"". ""Tonight the Australian people have voted for change. I am humbled by this victory and I'm honoured to be given the opportunity to serve as the 31st Prime Minister of Australia. ""My Labor team will work every day to bring Australians together. And I will lead a government worthy of the people of Australia. A government as courageous and hard working and caring as the Australian people are themselves."" Australia's Treasurer and Liberal party member Josh Frydenberg has acknowledged it will be difficult to hold onto his Kooyong seat in Melbourne, as independent ""teal"" candidate Monique Ryan looks set to win. Kooyong has long been a Liberal seat, and this will mark a shock loss to a complete political newcomer. Frydenberg will also become one of the highest-ranking cabinet ministers to ever be voted out. ""While it's mathematically possible that we win in Kooyong, it's definitely difficult,"" Frydenberg told supporters in a televised speech. His mood was markedly different earlier today when he posed for pictures with voters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The first Indigenous person to be elected to the House of Representatives and the first to serve as a minister has lost his seat. Ken Wyatt's seat of Hasluck has fallen to Labor as the Liberal Party suffer a massive swing against them in the state of Western Australia. Mr Wyatt - who has Noongar, Yamatji and Wongi heritage - was elected in 2010, and became the Assistant Minister for Health in 2015. He's held a number of portfolios since then, and in 2019 become the first Aboriginal person to be the Minister for Indigenous Affairs. Liberal colleague Senator Simon Birmingham said his defeat is a huge loss for the parliament. ""While there are many colleagues I would grieve for tonight, it is important that we note the historic contribution that Ken Wyatt made to the parliament, as an Indigenous Australian, to serve at the highest levels of office,"" he said. ""We pay tribute to him tonight.""  Ken Wyatt was elected in 2010 Anthony Albanese will be Australia's next PM, but Scott Morrison's Liberal-National coalition appears to be in the lead on first-preference votes (see the chart below). Why is that? It's because Australia uses a preferential voting system - each ballot is numbered by voters from their most to least preferred. Candidates with the fewest votes are eliminated, but votes for them are still counted - theyâre re-distributed to the next preference listed on each ballot. The process is repeated until only two candidates are left, and the person with the majority is declared the winner. So under preferential voting, many of the Greens votes, for instance, are likely to move to Labor - as those voters are likely to have preferenced Labor above the Liberals. Nationally, networks are projecting that just over half the first-preference vote will go to Labor. Morrison took to the stage amid chants of ""Scomo, Scomo"" More on Morrison's concession speech - he said he was quitting as the leader of the Liberals, following their unsuccessful outing at the polls. Morrison, who led the country through bushfires and a pandemic, also gave thanks for ""the miracle of the Australian people"". ""What Australians have endured over these past few years has shown a tremendous depth of character and resilience and strength,"" he said. ""It has been the Australian people under the strong support of a strong government that's enabled all of us to come through to where we are today, and that's something that all Australians can give thanks for as 
we move forward.â He added that his party was handing over a country that was ""in a stronger position... than we inherited it when we came to government those years ago under Tony Abbott"". âWe leave government having secured our borders many years ago. And we leave government 

having restored our nation's defences.â A huge roar - the biggest of the night - erupted as Morrison ended his speech saying he ""looks ahead to victory"" in the next election, reports the BBC's Phil Mercer who was at the scene. Morrison was mobbed by television crews as he left the stage. Scott Morrison has just arrived at his Liberal party's headquarters and has conceded defeat to Labor's Anthony Albanese. He congratulated Albanese on his election success, and adds: ""This has been a time of great upheaval."" ""It is important for our nation to heal"" from disruption, he adds. The BBC's Phil Mercer who is at the scene says that a crowd of several hundred people, including former PM John Howard, had stayed behind to listen to Mr Morrison's speech. But the mood is not funereal, with free-flowing beer and wine keeping spirits up. It's hugs and cheers all round for Labor supporters this evening, as the party is set to form the country's new government. This is the first time Labor has come to power in almost a decade. Supporters were crossing their fingers for a win... ...then began to cheer as the results started coming in... ...and broke out in chants for ""Albo"" as networks called a Labor win. Labor's Sally Sitou was half-way through her victory speech when her supporters realised the party had won - and they broke out in cheers. Labor is still four seats short of the 76-mark for a majorty government, but that could change in the coming hours. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
