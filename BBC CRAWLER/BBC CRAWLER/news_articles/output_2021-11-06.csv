Suspending parts of NI Protocol would be 'stupid',"Sir John Major said triggering Article 16 would be a ""difficult and dangerous road to go down"" Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has said that triggering Article 16 and suspending parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol would be ""colossally stupid"". He added that to suspend parts of the protocol ""would be absurd"". The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The EU hasproposed measuresto ease the checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? But the UK is demanding fundamental reform and there is growing speculation it will trigger Article 16 - which allows parts of the protocol to beunilaterally suspended if they are causing serious difficulties- in the coming weeks. Sir John told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the government did this, ""it would be seen as very bad faith indeed, it would be seen as irresponsible"". ""It would add to destabilisation in Northern Ireland, it would seriously damage relationships across the whole of Ireland north and south and the UK, it would erode relationships between Europe and the UK, it would damage relationships between Washington and London,"" he said. He said the UK was negotiating over the protocol ""with all the subtlety of a brick"". Brexit minister Lord Frost has said triggering Article 16 was ""very much on the table and has been since July"" He added that triggering Article 16 would be a ""difficult and dangerous road to go down"" and the government would ""come to regret it"". ""It is not just a question of trade difficulties, it could, we have seen what has happened in Northern Ireland before, it could become much worse, they should be very, very careful about this."" In a statement, the UK government said that it had been ""consistently clear"" that it would prefer to ""settle the issues arising from the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol consensually and reach a positive outcome through negotiations"". However, it said it was its responsibility ""to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, and we will use Article 16 if necessary"". ""The fundamental aim of the Protocol is to support the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement,"" it added. ""The Article 16 safeguards within it are provided to deal with the situation if the protocol ceases to support the BGFA (Belfast/Good Friday Agreement).  The UK Government will always act with that in mind."" Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem What is Article 16 and what exactly does it say? Most NI checks on British goods to be scrapped Sir John said he suspected Article 16 would be triggered after the United Nations Cop26 climate summit being hosted by the UK in Glasgow has concluded. He said critics might brand him a ""bitter old Remoaner"", but although he was a Remainer, he was not bitter, but ""disappointed and angry at the way the government has behaved"". Separately, Sir Johncriticised the government's handling of former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson's case as shameful and wrong. He said the actions of Boris Johnson's government had trashed Parliament's reputation at home and abroad, and were ""un-Conservative"". This week, the government tried to block the suspension of Mr Paterson, who had broken lobbying rules - but then reversed its decision. The government has apologised. Mr Major's comments about the protocol follow a meeting on Friday between European Commission (EC) Vice-President Maros Sefcovic and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost in Brussels overthe protocol dispute. Mr Sefcovic has warnedthere will be ""serious consequences"" if the UK triggers Article 16. Before the meeting, Lord Frost had warned time was running out on the talks. He had said the UK was not going to trigger Article 16 on Friday, although this was ""very much on the table and has been since July"". Lord Frost added that if the gap narrowed, the commission listened to what was said in the UK command paper and looked at the situation in Northern Ireland, that could help move things forward. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he expected to see decisive action on the protocol before the end of November. Sir Jeffrey, whose party opposes the protocol, has said he would meet Lord Frost next week to discuss the issue.

Biden: Infrastructure bill is monumental step,"This video can not be played Biden: 'We did something that was long overdue' President Joe Biden has hailed the passage of his landmark $1tn (Â£741bn) infrastructure spending package as a ""monumental step forward"". Negotiations over the sweeping public works bill - which passed the House of Representatives with 228-206 vote - created a bitter split among Democrats. ""Finally, infrastructure week,"" Mr Biden told reporters. ""I'm so happy to say that: infrastructure week."" A more ambitious social spending bill favoured by liberals was put on hold. The infrastructure package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law. Billed as a ""once-in-a-generation"" spending measure, the infrastructure legislation proposes $550bn in new federal expenditure, over the next eight years, to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, and to modernise city transit systems and passenger rail networks. The agreement also sets aside funding for clean drinking water, high speed internet, and a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging points. It is the largest federal investment in the country's infrastructure for decades and is seen as a major domestic win for the US president. ""We took a monumental step forward as a nation"", Mr Biden told reporters. ""We did something that's long overdue... a once-in-a-generation investment that's going to create millions of jobs modernising infrastructure, our roads, our bridges, our broadband, all range of things"". An infrastructure bill to fix more than US bridges Biden sees rebuilt roads as route to rout racism Five huge challenges for Joe Biden It will be financed in several ways, including unspent emergency relief funds from the Covid pandemic. Its passage marks a huge achievement for the Biden administration amid low approval ratings and a defeat for the Democrats in Virginia's gubernatorial election this week. Three months ago, 19 Republicans joined with Democrats to approve the legislation in the evenly split Senate, a rare bipartisan feat in an increasingly divided Congress. On Friday the bill passed the House with support from 13 Republicans, too. But more liberal lawmakers balked at its final version, complaining that key liberal policies had been dropped in exchange for the bipartisan win. The bill provides funding to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, among other key projects Six Democrats voted against it, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The group of six - dubbed The Squad - are among the most left-wing and progressive members of the House. Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus pledged they would not support the infrastructure bill until they had voted on a separate social welfare bill that allocates $1.75tn for healthcare, education and climate change initiatives. If passed, it would usher in the biggest expansion of the US safety net in more than 50 years. Democrats control both chambers of Congress by very slim majorities, so near-universal support would be required for the bill's passage. Centrist Democrats continue to object to the size and scope of the sprawling bill. They are insisting on seeing full accounting of its economic impacts. On Friday House leaders brokered a compromise, insisting on a vote on the infrastructure bill, accompanied by a procedural vote to start debate on the social spending bill. The chamber passed the procedural vote early on Saturday by 221 votes to 213. Compiling an independent assessment of the social spending bill's full cost is expected to take at least two weeks, although Democratic leaders have said they remain confident the bill will be passed before the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November. After months of haggling, brinksmanship and trips back to square one, Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill is on the verge of becoming infrastructure law. Final passage in Congress was secured by a deal forged between liberals and centrists in the Democratic Party to approve the infrastructure bill now and hold a vote in the House of Representatives on a larger social spending package by 15 November. That represents a leap of faith - and a tactical retreat - by the liberals who had been insisting that the infrastructure and spending bills be approved simultaneously. It was a leap too far for the handful of liberals who still voted no. But with a few Republicans on board, and Joe Biden publicly pushing for a vote and promising progressives the spending bill would get its day soon, a path to passage emerged. Of course, promises can be broken - and there's still the possibility centrists could derail the spending package, either in the House or after it reaches the Senate. In the meantime, however, the infrastructure bill, with hundreds of billions of dollars for roads, bridges, pipes and green energy, has reached the finish line, giving Mr Biden a signature bipartisan legislative victory.

Scores dead in Sierra Leone tanker explosion,"People at the site of the blast on Saturday At least 98 people have died after a massive explosion when a fuel tanker collided with a lorry in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. Fuel spilled before igniting and the resulting inferno engulfed bystanders and vehicles at a busy junction. Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed badly charred bodies in the streets surrounding the tanker. After visiting the scene, Vice-President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh said it was a ""national disaster"". He said that the injured would receive free medical treatment. Freetown Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr described seeing ""harrowing"" photos. In pictures: Devastation after Freetown collision Some 92 people are being treated in hospitals and health centres around Freetown, some of which are said to be overwhelmed. The explosion is believed to have happened at a junction outside the busy Choithram Supermarket in the densely populated Wellington suburb in the east of the city at around 22:00 GMT on Friday. Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) said the vehicles collided when the tanker was entering a nearby filling station to discharge its fuel. The drivers, noticing a leak, exited their the vehicles and warned people to stay away. The explosion occurred when people tried to collect the fuel, the NDMA said. Many of those killed were trapped in their vehicles One report said a bus was completely burnt, while nearby shops and market stalls were caught up in the flames. Brima Bureh Sesay, the head of Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency, said there were many ""burnt corpses"". ""It's a terrible, terrible accident,"" he told local media in a video shared from the scene. Umaru Fofana, freelance journalist, Freetown At the scene of the accident, there are body parts still lying in burnt-out vehicles. Also here are what's left of the petrol tanker and the truck that rammed into it. Motorbike-taxi riders nearby started collecting the leaking fuel, causing a traffic jam. Shortly after, there was an explosion. The fireballs spread into the surrounding area and onto the vehicles caught in the traffic. The authorities say most of the dead have now been received at the central morgue in Freetown, with the critically injured admitted to hospitals across the city. The army, police and fire force are all at the scene. The port city of Freetown, which is home to just over a million people, has faced several serious disasters in recent years. In March, more than 80 people were injured after a major fire in one of the city's slums left more than 5,000 people displaced. And in 2017 over 1,000 people were killed after heavy rains led to a mudslide that swept through the city, leaving around 3,000 people homeless.

What does 'sleaze' mean?,"Tony Blair made the most of ""Tory sleaze"" at the 1997 general election Sleaze is one of those marvellously elastic political terms that can be stretched to cover pretty well anything. Sexual shenanigans, financial fiddles or ethics violations by an MP or peer can all be roped into the category of ""sleaze"", often leaving them fighting for political survival. The word itself came into use in British politics in the mid-1990s as a series of scandals ate into the credibility of John Major's government - and were gleefully exploited by Tony Blair in the run-up to the 1997 New Labour landslide. But the phenomenon is as old as politics. Paterson U-turn right thing to do, says minister The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government Take the sinister cocktail of aristocratic vice, espionage, race and class that was the1960s Profumo scandal, which involved the Minister for War sharing a girlfriend with a Soviet naval attache  - not only did it terminate his career, but it created a kind of domino effect, allowing commentators to link it to separate, lesser happeningsâ¦.""this latest scandal to engulf the governmentâ¦"" And most deadly of all, it made a prime minister and his government look ridiculous. The2009 expenses scandal, where a data leak exposed what MPs had been claiming from the taxpayer was a devastating example. The ugly details of claims for duck islands and gardeners, wide screen televisions and plastering of artex ceilings infuriated an electorate facing an economic downturn. Careers were terminated in ignominy. Some went to prison. And all, even the innocent were tarred. I can recall one MP, blameless in his expenses claims, telling me how he decided to leave Parliament at the next election, because someone, recognising his partner in a constituency supermarket, spat at her. Another who ran a marathon for charity, recalled a derisive shout from a spectator, ""I bet you're claiming expenses for this, aren't you."" Beyond the details of the Owen Paterson case, the worry for all parliamentarians is that a feeding frenzy of investigations of other individuals will follow, tainting the innocent as well as the guilty. Maybe Sir Keir Starmer and Labour will hope history repeats itself, and they can run against a discredited government. The stakes are high.

LiveLiveDemonstrators march in Glasgow as protests go global3 minutes ago,"Demonstrations calling for urgent action on climate change have taken place in cities around the world In Glasgow, organisers claim up to 100,000 people have braved rain and wind to march through the city, which is hosting COP26 Vanessa Nakate is among activists who have given speeches at Glasgow Green Inside the summit, 45 nations have pledged Â£3bn to help protect nature and shift to better ways of farming - but critics say more cash is needed The UK has pledged Â£500m to protect five million hectares of tropical rainforests and create of green jobs across Africa, Asia and Latin America The climate summit runs for another week - its key goal is for action to be agreed that will help us avoid the worst impacts of global warming Edited by Claudia Allen That wraps up the first week of COP26. There's a ""rest day"" for all those taking part in the Glasgow conference tomorrow, before talks on how to avoid the worst impacts of global warming resume on Monday. We'll be back with our live coverage then. Today's updates were brought to you by Jen Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Paul McLaren, Hamish Mackay and Claudia Allen in Glasgow and London. Tens of thousands of people took part in a march in Glasgow As we have been reporting, it has been an eventful day as the call for climate action was taken around the UK and the world. Hundreds of marches were staged to mark the so-called Global Day Of Action For Climate Justice. Organisers say more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Glasgow in the largest protest of COP26 so far. There were also demonstrations in London, Cardiff, Belfast and other UK cities. Meanwhile, today's theme at the COP26 summit has been nature. Around the negotiating tables, 45 nations pledged Â£3bn to help protect nature and shift to better ways of farming. The UK is also chipping in Â£6m ($8m) to a UN fund to help developing nations protect their seas. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow At this
crazily energetic COP, tens of thousands
of people and their differing world views have come crashing into each other. Here, the apostles
of the green new age have come to vanquish once and for all, the oily disciples
of the old world. Climate change,
once a far away problem for the poor, is now often seen in desperate escapes
from fire or flood, filmed on a jerky mobile phone. This year it came
closer and closer to people - one day soon it could be your phone doing the
filming. Here in Glasgow, that sense of urgency permeates every conversation. As host, the UK has undoubtedly made a powerful start, but there is a rising sense of anger
and frustration about announcements designed to steal headlines. Many developing
country delegates feel isolated with their key priorities ignored. The challenge now
for the UK is to steer the ship through the really difficult waters of the week
ahead, where the long-running sore that is the divide between rich and poor
will once again play out. As well as money
and technicalities, the UK will have to address very basic issues of fairness,
justice and trust. Ultimately, for the summit to get a strong agreement that will temper rising
temperatures, there is one key question: are we really all
in this together? As we come to the end of the first week of COP26, here's a look at some photographs from the biggest climate change protest to take place in Glasgow so far. Members of indigenous groups, some of whom had no formal representation at the summit, joined the march Marchers display colourful placards with their calls on governments - though the cardboard was quite damp by the end of the day Some activists sought to draw attention to the impact of climate change on wildlife You can see more pictureshere. This video can not be played COP 26: What Alaskaâs shrinking island means for all of us A short while ago the protest rally at Glasgow Green heard speeches from representatives of indigenous people around the world about how climate change is impacting them. Residents of Shishmaref, in northern Alaska, may be relocated due to rising temperatures, thawing permafrost, and rapid coastal erosion, BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt reports. Denis, who has lived on Shishmaref for 20 years, worries about residents' access to urgent medical care, food, mail and transport on and off the island if its airport runway is overcome by the sea. He reckons that Shishmaref - which has a population of less than 600 - will be ""covered"" within the next five to 10 years due to the effects of climate change, adding: ""Just that one or two degrees makes a big difference."" Denis warns that what is happening in his community will ultimately happen in other US coastal areas if action is not taken. Laura FosterBBC correspondent in Glasgow In
2019, the music group Massive Attack teamed up with scientists at the Tyndall Centre
for climate change research to try to work out a way to decarbonise the live
music industry. This
summer they published their guide so that live music and gigs could still continue
in a net-zero world. Vegan
food, carefully planned tour routes involving travel by train, better bike
facilities at venues and ditching private jets were just some of the many
switches recommended. Here at COP26, Rob de Naja is talking to Professor Carly McLachlan From the Tyndall centre and Dale Vince from Ecotricity. Every seat is full but no doubt this blue zone would be far busier if it werenât for the climate March happening in central Glasgow this afternoon. Read morehereon Massive Attack's efforts to help the music industry reduce its carbon footprint. This week, we've heard speeches from politicians and activists - and now Idris Elba has joined their ranks. The actor says people may wonder why he's there but that he wants to use his ""big mouth"" to amplify the conversation around food security. You can watch a clip of him - speaking alongside Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate - below. This video can not be played COP26: Idris Elba joins activist Vanessa Nakate in call for food security Greta Thunberg joined the Glasgow march but did not speak on stage Organisers have confirmed Greta Thunberg will
not be speaking at Glasgow Green. The Swedish activist was marching today and it was hoped she would take to the stage, as she did yesterday. The last speech is about to wrap up and
security are preparing to disperse the crowds. Mary McCoolBBC Scotland News Speeches and live music are well under way at
Glasgow Green - with thousands of activists still surging through the entrance
archway. Over frequent cries of ""climate
justice"", you can hear the music that activists have brought from all over the
world - be it the call and response of samba drums or Aretha Franklin blaring
from a portable speaker. Earlier, a stage had to be dismantled due to
strong winds. But guest speakers have instead delivered
their messages from a makeshift platform inside a lorry. It's cramped and people are cold - but they are
determined to have their voices heard. Climate activist Vanessa Nakate makes her appearance on the Glasgow stage. Two years ago, inspired by Greta Thunberg's Friday school
protests, Nakate started her own strike outside the Ugandan parliament
demanding government action on climate change. She tells the Glasgow crowd how overnight storms have seriously
damaged a school which she and fellow campaigners helped to build in her home
country. ""The strong winds and
heavy rainfall will not stop, because the words and promises of leaders do not
match their actions. ""And this is just one example. I need someone to tell me
how to explain to farmers who are losing their crops and farms because of
droughts and floods, while leaders continue to open up new
coal power stations.â An update from inside the summit Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Reef fish swim above recovering coral colonies on the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Cairns, Australia. Some 45 governments
have vowed to protect nature and shift to better ways of farming. Many
forests and grasslands, which previously soaked up our carbon emissions, are
actually giving out carbon as soils are damaged and trees are felled. The
expansion of cattle ranching is a big problem. Governments
are now channelling Â£3bn ($4bn) to help farmers protect nature, emit less CO2
and methane from livestock, and cope with a heating climate. The
UK is promoting the initiative but the Wildlife Trusts say it also must
urgently reform subsidies for British farming. The oceans are vital too, absorbing about a third of our carbon emissions. But
over-fishing, pollution and global heating are harming the seas, and the
acidification of sea water caused by CO2 is deadly to coral reefs. The UK is chipping in Â£6m ($8m) to a UN fund to help developing nations protect their
seas. Critics say the cash and related policies are welcome but not nearly
enough. Away from Glasgow now, here's a quick look at protests taking place elsewhere in Europe. In France, climate action activists display portraits of world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron in front of the Paris city hall Protesters march with striking placards in Istanbul, Turkey. The country's president, Recep Erdogan, was due to attend COP26, but cancelled the trip for what his office said were security reasons Extinction Rebellion activists block Rue de la Loi during a protest in Brussels, Belgium In Amsterdam, the Netherlands, one activist spoofs a Shell oil executive as they turn the crank to heat up the planet One of the hosts of the Glasgow event is Mitzi Jonelle Tan, from the youth activists' group Fridays for Future and MAPA. She tells the crowd that it is ""very important that we listen to the people of colour, the black people who have barely contributed to the climate crisis yet are experiencing the worst impacts of it"". ""We have to tackle every system of injustice in order to achieve climate justice,"" she adds. Gregorio Diaz Mirabal calls for support for indigenous people The opening speeches in at the protest rally at Glasgow Green are coming from representatives of indigenous people around the globe. Gregorio Diaz Mirabal, the leader of the Congress of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, tells the crowds he gives them ""a hug the size of the planet"". To large cheers, he adds: ""We just want to ask you, from our hearts, for your support and solidarity to build governance of indigenous peoples around the world."" More on trees now, as today's theme at the summit in Glasgow is nature - and its role as a solution for tackling climate change. Trees have an important role in removing carbon emissions from the atmosphere, and the UK government has an ambitious target to plant 30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. A hectare is a bit bigger than a football pitch. Annual tree planting was close to this figure back in the late 1980s (most of it in Scotland) but it has not risen above 15,000 hectares UK-wide since 2001. Tree-planting is a devolved issue, and Scotland has nearly twice as much coverage as England. The government wants to treble planting in England during this Parliament, but overall it has a lot of ground to make up by 2025. A sharp acceleration will be needed to meet this target, and there are questions about how the trees will be cared for after they are planted. Steve MellenBBC News reporter in Bristol Much of today's focus is on Glasgow but there have been demonstrations taking place all around the UK. Here in Bristol there are an estimated 5,000
people on the climate march, which began at College Green and is currently on a loop
through the city centre. At the start of the march, the Baltic Wharf Brides
paraded in front of the crowd. They are all women whoâmarriedâ threatened trees on Bristol Harbourside in September. Vanessa Nakate speaks at a 'Fridays for Future' march during COP26 Climate activist Vanessa Nakate - who has been speaking on a COP26 panel about sustainable food production alongside the actor Idris Elba this afternoon - will be addressing the crowds at Glasgow Green soon. But who is the 24-year-old and what does she stand for? Nakate's home country of Uganda is a landlocked nation in east Africa, with the Equator Line running through it, making it one of the hottest places on Earth. This heat brings extreme weather conditions that can lead to drought or heavy rainfall. She says she has witnessed the consequences throughout her life, as farming became harder and heavy rain devastated communities, and decided she needed to take action. Two years ago, inspired by Greta Thunberg's Friday school protests, Nakate started her own strike outside the Ugandan parliament demanding government action on climate change. She later spoke at COP25 and the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she called on companies, banks and governments to immediately stop putting money into the use of fossil fuels for energy.

Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News Ruby Hembrom, left, and Sophie Grig Today, we've been speaking to people marching through Glasgow about why they felt it was important to attend. Ruby
Hembrom is on the march to raise awareness of the plight of people
in her native India. She
says: âWhen you look at climate change, the most vulnerable people will be
the most impacted. âIndigenous
people are forced from the forests due to coal and mining projects. The
consequences are devastating.â The
London-based student has been joined by Sophie Grig, senior campaigner with Survival
International. The
group works to support native groups across the world, especially those who
face persecution and displacement. Sophie says: âWe have to stop burning and extracting fossil fuels. And
we have to end the suffering of indigenous communities.â Back in Glasgow, the main march of the day has now reached Glasgow Green - with organisers estimating that 100,000 people are taking part. The police are not giving an estimate of crowd numbers. As we have been reporting, Greta Thunberg will speak at the rally, with other speakers including Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean, 23, who addressed world leaders at the opening of the COP26 talks. She will be joined by others such as Mitzi Jonelle Tan, who has previously toldthe BBC of her trauma at the typhoons engulfing her home in the Philippines. Tom GrundyBBC News in Trafalgar Square Londonâs climate march has reached its final destination
in Trafalgar Square. A large crowd has filled the square to hear various
speeches delivered underneath Nelsonâs Column. The speakers so far have called for âclimate justiceâ.
The march started outside the Bank of England, with protestors claiming
Londonâs financial district is âthe engine room of the climate crisisâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

The explosion is believed to have happened at a junction outside the busy Choithram Supermarket in the densely populated Wellington suburb in the east of the city at around 22:00 GMT on Friday. Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) said the vehicles collided when the tanker was entering a nearby filling station to discharge its fuel. The drivers, noticing a leak, exited their the vehicles and warned people to stay away. The explosion occurred when people tried to collect the fuel, the NDMA said. Many of those killed were trapped in their vehicles One report said a bus was completely burnt, while nearby shops and market stalls were caught up in the flames. Brima Bureh Sesay, the head of Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency, said there were many ""burnt corpses"". ""It's a terrible, terrible accident,"" he told local media in a video shared from the scene. Umaru Fofana, freelance journalist, Freetown At the scene of the accident, there are body parts still lying in burnt-out vehicles. Also here are what's left of the petrol tanker and the truck that rammed into it. Motorbike-taxi riders nearby started collecting the leaking fuel, causing a traffic jam. Shortly after, there was an explosion. The fireballs spread into the surrounding area and onto the vehicles caught in the traffic. The authorities say most of the dead have now been received at the central morgue in Freetown, with the critically injured admitted to hospitals across the city. The army, police and fire force are all at the scene. The port city of Freetown, which is home to just over a million people, has faced several serious disasters in recent years. In March, more than 80 people were injured after a major fire in one of the city's slums left more than 5,000 people displaced. And in 2017 over 1,000 people were killed after heavy rains led to a mudslide that swept through the city, leaving around 3,000 people homeless.

LiveLiveDemonstrators march in Glasgow as protests go global2 minutes ago,"Demonstrations calling for urgent action on climate change have taken place in cities around the world In Glasgow, organisers claim up to 100,000 people have braved rain and wind to march through the city, which is hosting COP26 Vanessa Nakate is among activists who have given speeches at Glasgow Green Inside the summit, 45 nations have pledged Â£3bn to help protect nature and shift to better ways of farming - but critics say more cash is needed The UK has pledged Â£500m to protect five million hectares of tropical rainforests and create of green jobs across Africa, Asia and Latin America The climate summit runs for another week - its key goal is for action to be agreed that will help us avoid the worst impacts of global warming Edited by Claudia Allen That wraps up the first week of COP26. There's a ""rest day"" for all those taking part in the Glasgow conference tomorrow, before talks on how to avoid the worst impacts of global warming resume on Monday. We'll be back with our live coverage then. Today's updates were brought to you by Jen Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Paul McLaren, Hamish Mackay and Claudia Allen in Glasgow and London. Tens of thousands of people took part in a march in Glasgow As we have been reporting, it has been an eventful day as the call for climate action was taken around the UK and the world. Hundreds of marches were staged to mark the so-called Global Day Of Action For Climate Justice. Organisers say more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Glasgow in the largest protest of COP26 so far. There were also demonstrations in London, Cardiff, Belfast and other UK cities. Meanwhile, today's theme at the COP26 summit has been nature. Around the negotiating tables, 45 nations pledged Â£3bn to help protect nature and shift to better ways of farming. The UK is also chipping in Â£6m ($8m) to a UN fund to help developing nations protect their seas. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow At this
crazily energetic COP, tens of thousands
of people and their differing world views have come crashing into each other. Here, the apostles
of the green new age have come to vanquish once and for all, the oily disciples
of the old world. Climate change,
once a far away problem for the poor, is now often seen in desperate escapes
from fire or flood, filmed on a jerky mobile phone. This year it came
closer and closer to people - one day soon it could be your phone doing the
filming. Here in Glasgow, that sense of urgency permeates every conversation. As host, the UK has undoubtedly made a powerful start, but there is a rising sense of anger
and frustration about announcements designed to steal headlines. Many developing
country delegates feel isolated with their key priorities ignored. The challenge now
for the UK is to steer the ship through the really difficult waters of the week
ahead, where the long-running sore that is the divide between rich and poor
will once again play out. As well as money
and technicalities, the UK will have to address very basic issues of fairness,
justice and trust. Ultimately, for the summit to get a strong agreement that will temper rising
temperatures, there is one key question: are we really all
in this together? As we come to the end of the first week of COP26, here's a look at some photographs from the biggest climate change protest to take place in Glasgow so far. Members of indigenous groups, some of whom had no formal representation at the summit, joined the march Marchers display colourful placards with their calls on governments - though the cardboard was quite damp by the end of the day Some activists sought to draw attention to the impact of climate change on wildlife You can see more pictureshere. This video can not be played COP 26: What Alaskaâs shrinking island means for all of us A short while ago the protest rally at Glasgow Green heard speeches from representatives of indigenous people around the world about how climate change is impacting them. Residents of Shishmaref, in northern Alaska, may be relocated due to rising temperatures, thawing permafrost, and rapid coastal erosion, BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt reports. Denis, who has lived on Shishmaref for 20 years, worries about residents' access to urgent medical care, food, mail and transport on and off the island if its airport runway is overcome by the sea. He reckons that Shishmaref - which has a population of less than 600 - will be ""covered"" within the next five to 10 years due to the effects of climate change, adding: ""Just that one or two degrees makes a big difference."" Denis warns that what is happening in his community will ultimately happen in other US coastal areas if action is not taken. Laura FosterBBC correspondent in Glasgow In
2019, the music group Massive Attack teamed up with scientists at the Tyndall Centre
for climate change research to try to work out a way to decarbonise the live
music industry. This
summer they published their guide so that live music and gigs could still continue
in a net-zero world. Vegan
food, carefully planned tour routes involving travel by train, better bike
facilities at venues and ditching private jets were just some of the many
switches recommended. Here at COP26, Rob de Naja is talking to Professor Carly McLachlan From the Tyndall centre and Dale Vince from Ecotricity. Every seat is full but no doubt this blue zone would be far busier if it werenât for the climate March happening in central Glasgow this afternoon. Read morehereon Massive Attack's efforts to help the music industry reduce its carbon footprint. This week, we've heard speeches from politicians and activists - and now Idris Elba has joined their ranks. The actor says people may wonder why he's there but that he wants to use his ""big mouth"" to amplify the conversation around food security. You can watch a clip of him - speaking alongside Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate - below. This video can not be played COP26: Idris Elba joins activist Vanessa Nakate in call for food security Greta Thunberg joined the Glasgow march but did not speak on stage Organisers have confirmed Greta Thunberg will
not be speaking at Glasgow Green. The Swedish activist was marching today and it was hoped she would take to the stage, as she did yesterday. The last speech is about to wrap up and
security are preparing to disperse the crowds. Mary McCoolBBC Scotland News Speeches and live music are well under way at
Glasgow Green - with thousands of activists still surging through the entrance
archway. Over frequent cries of ""climate
justice"", you can hear the music that activists have brought from all over the
world - be it the call and response of samba drums or Aretha Franklin blaring
from a portable speaker. Earlier, a stage had to be dismantled due to
strong winds. But guest speakers have instead delivered
their messages from a makeshift platform inside a lorry. It's cramped and people are cold - but they are
determined to have their voices heard. Climate activist Vanessa Nakate makes her appearance on the Glasgow stage. Two years ago, inspired by Greta Thunberg's Friday school
protests, Nakate started her own strike outside the Ugandan parliament
demanding government action on climate change. She tells the Glasgow crowd how overnight storms have seriously
damaged a school which she and fellow campaigners helped to build in her home
country. ""The strong winds and
heavy rainfall will not stop, because the words and promises of leaders do not
match their actions. ""And this is just one example. I need someone to tell me
how to explain to farmers who are losing their crops and farms because of
droughts and floods, while leaders continue to open up new
coal power stations.â An update from inside the summit Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Reef fish swim above recovering coral colonies on the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Cairns, Australia. Some 45 governments
have vowed to protect nature and shift to better ways of farming. Many
forests and grasslands, which previously soaked up our carbon emissions, are
actually giving out carbon as soils are damaged and trees are felled. The
expansion of cattle ranching is a big problem. Governments
are now channelling Â£3bn ($4bn) to help farmers protect nature, emit less CO2
and methane from livestock, and cope with a heating climate. The
UK is promoting the initiative but the Wildlife Trusts say it also must
urgently reform subsidies for British farming. The oceans are vital too, absorbing about a third of our carbon emissions. But
over-fishing, pollution and global heating are harming the seas, and the
acidification of sea water caused by CO2 is deadly to coral reefs. The UK is chipping in Â£6m ($8m) to a UN fund to help developing nations protect their
seas. Critics say the cash and related policies are welcome but not nearly
enough. Away from Glasgow now, here's a quick look at protests taking place elsewhere in Europe. In France, climate action activists display portraits of world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron in front of the Paris city hall Protesters march with striking placards in Istanbul, Turkey. The country's president, Recep Erdogan, was due to attend COP26, but cancelled the trip for what his office said were security reasons Extinction Rebellion activists block Rue de la Loi during a protest in Brussels, Belgium In Amsterdam, the Netherlands, one activist spoofs a Shell oil executive as they turn the crank to heat up the planet One of the hosts of the Glasgow event is Mitzi Jonelle Tan, from the youth activists' group Fridays for Future and MAPA. She tells the crowd that it is ""very important that we listen to the people of colour, the black people who have barely contributed to the climate crisis yet are experiencing the worst impacts of it"". ""We have to tackle every system of injustice in order to achieve climate justice,"" she adds. Gregorio Diaz Mirabal calls for support for indigenous people The opening speeches in at the protest rally at Glasgow Green are coming from representatives of indigenous people around the globe. Gregorio Diaz Mirabal, the leader of the Congress of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, tells the crowds he gives them ""a hug the size of the planet"". To large cheers, he adds: ""We just want to ask you, from our hearts, for your support and solidarity to build governance of indigenous peoples around the world."" More on trees now, as today's theme at the summit in Glasgow is nature - and its role as a solution for tackling climate change. Trees have an important role in removing carbon emissions from the atmosphere, and the UK government has an ambitious target to plant 30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. A hectare is a bit bigger than a football pitch. Annual tree planting was close to this figure back in the late 1980s (most of it in Scotland) but it has not risen above 15,000 hectares UK-wide since 2001. Tree-planting is a devolved issue, and Scotland has nearly twice as much coverage as England. The government wants to treble planting in England during this Parliament, but overall it has a lot of ground to make up by 2025. A sharp acceleration will be needed to meet this target, and there are questions about how the trees will be cared for after they are planted. Steve MellenBBC News reporter in Bristol Much of today's focus is on Glasgow but there have been demonstrations taking place all around the UK. Here in Bristol there are an estimated 5,000
people on the climate march, which began at College Green and is currently on a loop
through the city centre. At the start of the march, the Baltic Wharf Brides
paraded in front of the crowd. They are all women whoâmarriedâ threatened trees on Bristol Harbourside in September. Vanessa Nakate speaks at a 'Fridays for Future' march during COP26 Climate activist Vanessa Nakate - who has been speaking on a COP26 panel about sustainable food production alongside the actor Idris Elba this afternoon - will be addressing the crowds at Glasgow Green soon. But who is the 24-year-old and what does she stand for? Nakate's home country of Uganda is a landlocked nation in east Africa, with the Equator Line running through it, making it one of the hottest places on Earth. This heat brings extreme weather conditions that can lead to drought or heavy rainfall. She says she has witnessed the consequences throughout her life, as farming became harder and heavy rain devastated communities, and decided she needed to take action. Two years ago, inspired by Greta Thunberg's Friday school protests, Nakate started her own strike outside the Ugandan parliament demanding government action on climate change. She later spoke at COP25 and the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she called on companies, banks and governments to immediately stop putting money into the use of fossil fuels for energy. You can read more about Vanessahere. Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News Ruby Hembrom, left, and Sophie Grig Today, we've been speaking to people marching through Glasgow about why they felt it was important to attend. Ruby
Hembrom is on the march to raise awareness of the plight of people
in her native India. She
says: âWhen you look at climate change, the most vulnerable people will be
the most impacted. âIndigenous
people are forced from the forests due to coal and mining projects. The
consequences are devastating.â The
London-based student has been joined by Sophie Grig, senior campaigner with Survival
International. The
group works to support native groups across the world, especially those who
face persecution and displacement. Sophie says: âWe have to stop burning and extracting fossil fuels. And
we have to end the suffering of indigenous communities.â Back in Glasgow, the main march of the day has now reached Glasgow Green - with organisers estimating that 100,000 people are taking part. The police are not giving an estimate of crowd numbers. As we have been reporting, Greta Thunberg will speak at the rally, with other speakers including Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean, 23, who addressed world leaders at the opening of the COP26 talks. She will be joined by others such as Mitzi Jonelle Tan, who has previously toldthe BBC of her trauma at the typhoons engulfing her home in the Philippines. Tom GrundyBBC News in Trafalgar Square Londonâs climate march has reached its final destination
in Trafalgar Square. A large crowd has filled the square to hear various
speeches delivered underneath Nelsonâs Column. The speakers so far have called for âclimate justiceâ.
The march started outside the Bank of England, with protestors claiming
Londonâs financial district is âthe engine room of the climate crisisâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

"Scores dead in Sierra Leone tanker explosionThe accident happened after the tanker collided with another vehicle in the nation's capital, Freetown.Africa","People at the site of the blast on Saturday At least 98 people have died after a massive explosion when a fuel tanker collided with a lorry in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. Fuel spilled before igniting and the resulting inferno engulfed bystanders and vehicles at a busy junction. Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed badly charred bodies in the streets surrounding the tanker. After visiting the scene, Vice-President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh said it was a ""national disaster"". He said that the injured would receive free medical treatment. Freetown Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr described seeing ""harrowing"" photos. In pictures: Devastation after Freetown collision Some 92 people are being treated in hospitals and health centres around Freetown, some of which are said to be overwhelmed. The explosion is believed to have happened at a junction outside the busy Choithram Supermarket in the densely populated Wellington suburb in the east of the city at around 22:00 GMT on Friday. Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) said the vehicles collided when the tanker was entering a nearby filling station to discharge its fuel. The drivers, noticing a leak, exited their the vehicles and warned people to stay away. The explosion occurred when people tried to collect the fuel, the NDMA said. Many of those killed were trapped in their vehicles One report said a bus was completely burnt, while nearby shops and market stalls were caught up in the flames. Brima Bureh Sesay, the head of Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency, said there were many ""burnt corpses"". ""It's a terrible, terrible accident,"" he told local media in a video shared from the scene. Umaru Fofana, freelance journalist, Freetown At the scene of the accident, there are body parts still lying in burnt-out vehicles. Also here are what's left of the petrol tanker and the truck that rammed into it. Motorbike-taxi riders nearby started collecting the leaking fuel, causing a traffic jam. Shortly after, there was an explosion. The fireballs spread into the surrounding area and onto the vehicles caught in the traffic. The authorities say most of the dead have now been received at the central morgue in Freetown, with the critically injured admitted to hospitals across the city. The army, police and fire force are all at the scene. The port city of Freetown, which is home to just over a million people, has faced several serious disasters in recent years. In March, more than 80 people were injured after a major fire in one of the city's slums left more than 5,000 people displaced. And in 2017 over 1,000 people were killed after heavy rains led to a mudslide that swept through the city, leaving around 3,000 people homeless.

The Owen Paterson row,"Former minister Owen Paterson has resigned as an MP after a backlash at the government's decision to block his suspension from parliament. Mr Paterson is the Conservative MP for North Shropshire. He served as Northern Ireland secretary and environment secretary under David Cameron. Since leaving government he has been a paid consultant for Randox Laboratories and Lynn's Country Foods. He is paid Â£8,333 a month by Randox for 16 hours work and Â£2,000 every other month from Lynn's Country Foods for four hours work. This is not against the rules, and he declared his positions in the public register of interests. Paterson quits as MP over lobbying row 'nightmare' In full: Owen Paterson resignation statement He was investigated by the Commissioner for Parliamentary Standards after being accused of breaking lobbying rules for MPs. The commissioner found that, on behalf of the companies, he approached and met officials at the Food Standards Agency and ministers at the Department for International Development a number of times. He also used his parliamentary office and stationery for his consultancy work and failed to declare his interests in some meetings, the report said. The commissioner decided that the contact with officials and ministers were ""serious breaches"" of the rules. MPs are forbidden from taking money to raise issues in the House of Commons or with the government. The code of conduct politicians have to follow says there must be not conflicts of interest between their personal interests and public interest. Mr Paterson works for Randox Laboratories as a consultant MPs who are found to have broken the rules may be asked to apologise to the House of Commons or be suspended as an MP. The Standards Committee called Mr Paterson's actions""an egregious case of paid advocacy"",externaland recommended at 30-day suspension. Made three approaches to Food Standards Agency for Randox about antibiotics in milk in 2016 and 2017 The committee found his first approach had been acceptable but subsequent contact sought a benefit for Randox and promoted its products and technology Made seven approaches to Food Standards Agency for Lynn's Country Foods in 2017 and 2018. Mr Paterson says the contact was acceptable because he was raising ""serious wrongs"" with officials. The commissioner rejected his position Made four approaches to ministers at the Department for International Development about Randox and blood testing technology in 2016 and 2017 The committee says that while the company did not gain government contracts from these meetings, it could have done Mr Paterson has criticised the decision and the way the investigation was carried out. He said his approaches to officials and ministers amounted to whistle-blowing. For instance, Randox's contact with the FSA was to warn them of illegal antibiotics that had been found in milk that was available in supermarkets. There is an exemption in lobbying rules for MPs who are alerting the government to ""a serious wrong or substantial injustice"", even if doing so would lead to ""incidental"" financial or material benefit for the MP. Mr Paterson has said he ""would not hesitate to act in the same way again if confronted with new information about serious harms or wrongs requiring urgent remedy"". This video can not be played MPs vote created ""a certain amount of controversy"", says Jacob Rees-Mogg The commissioner said only one of his approaches to officials qualified for the whistle-blowing exemption. He has argued that the investigation constituted an ""absolute denial of justice"" for a number of reasons, including his claim that several witnesses who had come forward in support of his case had been ignored. Mr Paterson accepted that he had broken the rules regarding stationary and apologised. Lobbying is when an individual or a group tries to persuade a public figure such as an MP, a minister or a government official to support a policy or campaign. It's a normal part of the democratic process and anybody can do it by signing a petition or writing to their MP, for example. MPs are expected to lobby on behalf of their constituents - they might try to persuade the government to build a new hospital in their constituency, for example. But because lobbying by MPs is likely to be more effective than lobbying by the general public there are rules to make sure they do not take advantage of their position for reasons other than the best interests of the people who elected them. They must declare any jobs they have or that a member of their family has that could influence their opinions. Boris Johnson questioned whether Mr Paterson had been given a ""fair opportunity"" to make his case And they are not allowed to take money for raising issues in the House of Commons or with ministers. Apart from Mr Paterson, more than 20 MPs get paid for consultancy work, including former international development secretary Andrew Mitchell, who is paid Â£182,600 per year for 32.5 days work. Sir Ed Davey works as a consultant alongside his job as leader of the Liberal Democrats. He provides political and policy expertise to Herbert Smith Freehills, for six hours a month at Â£5,000. Other MPs have second jobs as doctors, nurses, barristers and even a football referee. Douglas Ross worked as a linesman and referee but gave it up when he became leader of the Scottish Conservative Party On Thursday afternoon Mr Paterson announced that he would be resigning as an MP, saying the last few days had been ""intolerable"". He criticised the investigative process, which doesn't allow MPs to bring appeals against judgements. Leader of the House of Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg said there was a ""very strong feeling on both sides of the House that there is a need for an appeals process"" and that he would work with other parties to make ""improvements"" to the system. There will be a by-election in Mr Paterson's constituency of Shropshire North, which the Conservative Party has held since its creation.

Supermarkets pledge to halve environmental impact,"Five of the UK's biggest supermarkets have promised to halve the environmental impact of a weekly food shop by the end of the decade. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Co-op and M&S said they would reduce carbon emissions, deforestation and the food waste and packaging they produce. Their efforts will be monitored by the WWF conservation group. ""Food production is one of the biggest threats to our planet,"" said WWF chief executive Tanya Steele said. The chief executives of the supermarkets, which together serve more than half of UK food shoppers, said in a joint statement: ""We recognise that a future without nature is a future without food. By 2030 we need to halt the loss of nature."" Before the end of next year, they also promised to set science-based targets for how they would help to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Global food prices hit fresh 10-year high, UN says Tesco zero-waste trial launches at 10 stores This is a key target for world leaders at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, with scientists saying it must be met to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Currently, the world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. Unless more is done, the planet is already on track to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. The food industry is responsible for more than a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions and almost 60% of the global damage to biodiversity, so minimising its impact could make a significant contribution to reducing climate change. Each year, the industry emits 17.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide - about 19 times more than commercial planes. About a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, forestry and other land use - and experts say the way food is grown and consumed needs reforming. Ms Steele from the WWF said the world could only tackle the ""climate and nature emergency"" if food retailers played their part. ""The promises these CEOs have made are game-changing and we hope other food retailers will follow in their footsteps, so that every shopper can be confident that the products they buy aren't fuelling the climate crisis and pushing precious wildlife closer to the brink,"" she said. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? What are top polluters doing to cut emissions? Later, as the COP26 summit continues, it is expected that 45 governments, including the UK, will pledge urgent action and investment to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming. And, in a separate development, another 20 countries joined a global forum aimed at reducing deforestation from the production of commodities such as palm oil, cocoa and soya - the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) dialogue forum. Matt Williams, an expert from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, said ""food and farming have largely been missing from this summit so far"" but this ""plants the seeds"" for it to make a serious contribution to reaching net-zero emissions. Another 27 countries also signed up to a sustainable agriculture pledge to help them meet their climate goals, and will use funding earmarked for agriculture subsidies to reduce emissions. And the UK government has announced a Â£500m programme which it said would help to protect over five million hectares of rainforests from deforestation - an area almost 20% of the size of the UK itself. But Anna Jones at Greenpeace UK said the attempts to address the supply chains of the food industry were ""little more than a talking shop"". She said ""there's nothing on the need to reduce demand for products like meat and dairy that are driving deforestation"". Large-scale demonstrations are taking place in Glasgow, where the summit is being held, as well as in London and other cities in the UK and around the world. The marches come after thousands of young activists, including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate marched through Glasgow on Friday protesting against investment in fossil fuels and the failure to tackle the climate crisis.

"Anxiety link to IBS may be genetically hardwiredScientists have been studying more than 50,000 people with IBS to better understand the condition.","Genes may go some way towards explaining why a common but poorly understood gut disorder - irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - is often linked to anxiety, say researchers. They hope their discovery will stop IBS being wrongly labelled as an emotional state or ""all in the mind"". The team studied more than 50,000 individuals with IBS, comparing their DNA with that of healthy people. The results are published in the journal Nature Genetics. IBS is thought to affect about one in 10 people and can cause distressing abdominal pain, bloating and bouts of constipation, diarrhoea or both. With no defining test, diagnosis comes after ruling out other causes. Women are slightly more affected than men, and the usual age for patients to seek advice is between 20 and 40. Prof Miles Parkes, a consultant gastroenterologist at Cambridge's Addenbrookes Hospital who led the gene research, says IBS is still poorly understood, even by some doctors, and may be incorrectly categorised as psychosomatic because of the overlap with anxiety and stress. He and his team say they have identified at least six distinct genetic differences that might, at least partly, explain this link between the gut and the mind. The results showed: Overall, heritability of IBS (how much your genes influence the likelihood of developing a particular condition) is quite low Six genetic differences were more common in people with IBS than in controls Most of these have roles in the brain, and possibly the nerves which supply the gut, rather than the gut itself The same genetic make-up that puts people at increased risk of IBS also increases the risk for common mood and anxiety disorders such as anxiety, depression, and neuroticism, as well as insomnia That doesn't mean anxiety causes IBS symptoms or vice versa, says Prof Parkes. ""Our study shows these conditions have shared genetic origins, with the affected genes possibly leading to physical changes in brain or nerve cells that in turn cause symptoms in the brain and symptoms in the gut."" The discovery might ultimately help with developing better tests and treatments for IBS. This video can not be played 'There's definitely a stigma around having IBS' Laura Tebbs, who is 34 and from Cambridge, has experience living with IBS symptoms and anxiety and depression. ""I've had bouts of depression and anxiety for a decade so I know what it is like to live with that, but my IBS began after I caught Covid this January. ""It's hard for some people to understand, but IBS really is quite a challenging thing to live with. ""I was in constant pain every time I ate. And I'd get really bloated. It was so bad that I couldn't wear any of my normal trousers or jeans. I just lived in leggings instead. ""I was tired and moody and couldn't do things that I would normally enjoy, like going out for a meal with mates."" Laura says she was ""fobbed off"" by some healthcare professionals who, she says, dismissed her condition and recommended laxatives for one of her symptoms - constipation. She is now under Prof Parkes's care and has found ways to better manage her condition. ""It's much better now, and if I do have a flare-up there I things I can do to change it."" Medication may be needed, but there are some other things that can help too. To ease bloating, cramps and wind, consider: Eat oats, such as porridge Fresh ingredients, rather than lots of processed, fatty or spicy foods, is good but don't overdo it with the fruit and beans because they can cause diarrhoea and bloating Cauliflower, cabbage, sprouts and onions can be tricky for some people to digest too You could try probiotics or low lactose or lactose-free dairy products for a month and see if they help Don't delay or skip meals Avoid lots of alcohol, caffeine or fizzy drinks, but do drink plenty of water to keep your poo nicely soft (rather than too runny or hard) Take time over meals - don't eat too quickly For constipation: Drink plenty of water to make poo softer Eat fibre - linseeds, for example, helped Laura For diarrhoea: Consider cutting back a bit on fibre if you are eating lots of it Chewing lots of sugar-free gum containing sorbitol is another ""no-no"" - it can have a laxative effect Make sure you are drinking enough fluid to replace what you are losing and avoid dehydration Source:NHS,external British Dietetic Association (BDA) The IBS Network British Nutrition Foundation Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

"Suspending parts of NI Protocol would be 'stupid'Former PM Sir John Major says suspending parts of the NI Protocol would be ""stupid"" and ""absurd"".Northern Ireland","Sir John Major said triggering Article 16 would be a ""difficult and dangerous road to go down"" Former Prime Minister Sir John Major has said that triggering Article 16 and suspending parts of the Northern Ireland Protocol would be ""colossally stupid"". He added that to suspend parts of the protocol ""would be absurd"". The protocol is the special Brexit deal agreed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. It keeps Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods and allows free-flowing trade with the EU. But it also creates a trade border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain. The EU hasproposed measuresto ease the checks and controls for goods crossing the Irish Sea. What's the Northern Ireland Protocol? But the UK is demanding fundamental reform and there is growing speculation it will trigger Article 16 - which allows parts of the protocol to beunilaterally suspended if they are causing serious difficulties- in the coming weeks. Sir John told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that if the government did this, ""it would be seen as very bad faith indeed, it would be seen as irresponsible"". ""It would add to destabilisation in Northern Ireland, it would seriously damage relationships across the whole of Ireland north and south and the UK, it would erode relationships between Europe and the UK, it would damage relationships between Washington and London,"" he said. He said the UK was negotiating over the protocol ""with all the subtlety of a brick"". Brexit minister Lord Frost has said triggering Article 16 was ""very much on the table and has been since July"" He added that triggering Article 16 would be a ""difficult and dangerous road to go down"" and the government would ""come to regret it"". ""It is not just a question of trade difficulties, it could, we have seen what has happened in Northern Ireland before, it could become much worse, they should be very, very careful about this."" In a statement, the UK government said that it had been ""consistently clear"" that it would prefer to ""settle the issues arising from the operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol consensually and reach a positive outcome through negotiations"". However, it said it was its responsibility ""to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland, and we will use Article 16 if necessary"". ""The fundamental aim of the Protocol is to support the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement,"" it added. ""The Article 16 safeguards within it are provided to deal with the situation if the protocol ceases to support the BGFA (Belfast/Good Friday Agreement).  The UK Government will always act with that in mind."" Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem What is Article 16 and what exactly does it say? Most NI checks on British goods to be scrapped Sir John said he suspected Article 16 would be triggered after the United Nations Cop26 climate summit being hosted by the UK in Glasgow has concluded. He said critics might brand him a ""bitter old Remoaner"", but although he was a Remainer, he was not bitter, but ""disappointed and angry at the way the government has behaved"". Separately, Sir Johncriticised the government's handling of former Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson's case as shameful and wrong. He said the actions of Boris Johnson's government had trashed Parliament's reputation at home and abroad, and were ""un-Conservative"". This week, the government tried to block the suspension of Mr Paterson, who had broken lobbying rules - but then reversed its decision. The government has apologised. Mr Major's comments about the protocol follow a meeting on Friday between European Commission (EC) Vice-President Maros Sefcovic and UK Brexit minister Lord Frost in Brussels overthe protocol dispute. Mr Sefcovic has warnedthere will be ""serious consequences"" if the UK triggers Article 16. Before the meeting, Lord Frost had warned time was running out on the talks. He had said the UK was not going to trigger Article 16 on Friday, although this was ""very much on the table and has been since July"". Lord Frost added that if the gap narrowed, the commission listened to what was said in the UK command paper and looked at the situation in Northern Ireland, that could help move things forward. Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said he expected to see decisive action on the protocol before the end of November. Sir Jeffrey, whose party opposes the protocol, has said he would meet Lord Frost next week to discuss the issue.

What does 'sleaze' mean when politicians use it?,"Tony Blair made the most of ""Tory sleaze"" at the 1997 general election Sleaze is one of those marvellously elastic political terms that can be stretched to cover pretty well anything. Sexual shenanigans, financial fiddles or ethics violations by an MP or peer can all be roped into the category of ""sleaze"", often leaving them fighting for political survival. The word itself came into use in British politics in the mid-1990s as a series of scandals ate into the credibility of John Major's government - and were gleefully exploited by Tony Blair in the run-up to the 1997 New Labour landslide. But the phenomenon is as old as politics. Paterson U-turn right thing to do, says minister The investigations into Boris Johnson and the government Take the sinister cocktail of aristocratic vice, espionage, race and class that was the1960s Profumo scandal, which involved the Minister for War sharing a girlfriend with a Soviet naval attache  - not only did it terminate his career, but it created a kind of domino effect, allowing commentators to link it to separate, lesser happeningsâ¦.""this latest scandal to engulf the governmentâ¦"" And most deadly of all, it made a prime minister and his government look ridiculous. The2009 expenses scandal, where a data leak exposed what MPs had been claiming from the taxpayer was a devastating example. The ugly details of claims for duck islands and gardeners, wide screen televisions and plastering of artex ceilings infuriated an electorate facing an economic downturn. Careers were terminated in ignominy. Some went to prison. And all, even the innocent were tarred. I can recall one MP, blameless in his expenses claims, telling me how he decided to leave Parliament at the next election, because someone, recognising his partner in a constituency supermarket, spat at her. Another who ran a marathon for charity, recalled a derisive shout from a spectator, ""I bet you're claiming expenses for this, aren't you."" Beyond the details of the Owen Paterson case, the worry for all parliamentarians is that a feeding frenzy of investigations of other individuals will follow, tainting the innocent as well as the guilty. Maybe Sir Keir Starmer and Labour will hope history repeats itself, and they can run against a discredited government. The stakes are high.

Scores dead in Sierra Leone tanker explosionA huge explosion happened after an oil truck collided with another vehicle in the nation's capital.Africa,"People at the site of the blast on Saturday At least 98 people have died after a massive explosion when a fuel tanker collided with a lorry in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. Fuel spilled before igniting and the resulting inferno engulfed bystanders and vehicles at a busy junction. Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed badly charred bodies in the streets surrounding the tanker. After visiting the scene, Vice-President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh said it was a ""national disaster"". He said that the injured would receive free medical treatment. Freetown Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr described seeing ""harrowing"" photos. In pictures: Devastation after Freetown collision Some 92 people are being treated in hospitals and health centres around Freetown, some of which are said to be overwhelmed. The explosion is believed to have happened at a junction outside the busy Choithram Supermarket in the densely populated Wellington suburb in the east of the city at around 22:00 GMT on Friday. Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) said the vehicles collided when the tanker was entering a nearby filling station to discharge its fuel. The drivers, noticing a leak, exited their the vehicles and warned people to stay away. The explosion occurred when people tried to collect the fuel, the NDMA said. Many of those killed were trapped in their vehicles One report said a bus was completely burnt, while nearby shops and market stalls were caught up in the flames. Brima Bureh Sesay, the head of Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency, said there were many ""burnt corpses"". ""It's a terrible, terrible accident,"" he told local media in a video shared from the scene. Umaru Fofana, freelance journalist, Freetown At the scene of the accident, there are body parts still lying in burnt-out vehicles. Also here are what's left of the petrol tanker and the truck that rammed into it. Motorbike-taxi riders nearby started collecting the leaking fuel, causing a traffic jam. Shortly after, there was an explosion. The fireballs spread into the surrounding area and onto the vehicles caught in the traffic. The authorities say most of the dead have now been received at the central morgue in Freetown, with the critically injured admitted to hospitals across the city. The army, police and fire force are all at the scene. The port city of Freetown, which is home to just over a million people, has faced several serious disasters in recent years. In March, more than 80 people were injured after a major fire in one of the city's slums left more than 5,000 people displaced. And in 2017 over 1,000 people were killed after heavy rains led to a mudslide that swept through the city, leaving around 3,000 people homeless.

There's a ""rest day"" for all those taking part in the Glasgow conference tomorrow, before talks on how to avoid the worst impacts of global warming resume on Monday. We'll be back with our live coverage then. Today's updates were brought to you by Jen Meierhans, Mary O'Connor, Paul McLaren, Hamish Mackay and Claudia Allen in Glasgow and London. Tens of thousands of people took part in a march in Glasgow As we have been reporting, it has been an eventful day as the call for climate action was taken around the UK and the world. Hundreds of marches were staged to mark the so-called Global Day Of Action For Climate Justice. Organisers say more than 100,000 people took to the streets of Glasgow in the largest protest of COP26 so far. There were also demonstrations in London, Cardiff, Belfast and other UK cities. Meanwhile, today's theme at the COP26 summit has been nature. Around the negotiating tables, 45 nations pledged Â£3bn to help protect nature and shift to better ways of farming. The UK is also chipping in Â£6m ($8m) to a UN fund to help developing nations protect their seas. Matt McGrathEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow At this
crazily energetic COP, tens of thousands
of people and their differing world views have come crashing into each other. Here, the apostles
of the green new age have come to vanquish once and for all, the oily disciples
of the old world. Climate change,
once a far away problem for the poor, is now often seen in desperate escapes
from fire or flood, filmed on a jerky mobile phone. This year it came
closer and closer to people - one day soon it could be your phone doing the
filming. Here in Glasgow, that sense of urgency permeates every conversation. As host, the UK has undoubtedly made a powerful start, but there is a rising sense of anger
and frustration about announcements designed to steal headlines. Many developing
country delegates feel isolated with their key priorities ignored. The challenge now
for the UK is to steer the ship through the really difficult waters of the week
ahead, where the long-running sore that is the divide between rich and poor
will once again play out. As well as money
and technicalities, the UK will have to address very basic issues of fairness,
justice and trust. Ultimately, for the summit to get a strong agreement that will temper rising
temperatures, there is one key question: are we really all
in this together? As we come to the end of the first week of COP26, here's a look at some photographs from the biggest climate change protest to take place in Glasgow so far. Members of indigenous groups, some of whom had no formal representation at the summit, joined the march Marchers display colourful placards with their calls on governments - though the cardboard was quite damp by the end of the day Some activists sought to draw attention to the impact of climate change on wildlife You can see more pictureshere. This video can not be played COP 26: What Alaskaâs shrinking island means for all of us A short while ago the protest rally at Glasgow Green heard speeches from representatives of indigenous people around the world about how climate change is impacting them. Residents of Shishmaref, in northern Alaska, may be relocated due to rising temperatures, thawing permafrost, and rapid coastal erosion, BBC climate editor Justin Rowlatt reports. Denis, who has lived on Shishmaref for 20 years, worries about residents' access to urgent medical care, food, mail and transport on and off the island if its airport runway is overcome by the sea. He reckons that Shishmaref - which has a population of less than 600 - will be ""covered"" within the next five to 10 years due to the effects of climate change, adding: ""Just that one or two degrees makes a big difference."" Denis warns that what is happening in his community will ultimately happen in other US coastal areas if action is not taken. Laura FosterBBC correspondent in Glasgow In
2019, the music group Massive Attack teamed up with scientists at the Tyndall Centre
for climate change research to try to work out a way to decarbonise the live
music industry. This
summer they published their guide so that live music and gigs could still continue
in a net-zero world. Vegan
food, carefully planned tour routes involving travel by train, better bike
facilities at venues and ditching private jets were just some of the many
switches recommended. Here at COP26, Rob de Naja is talking to Professor Carly McLachlan From the Tyndall centre and Dale Vince from Ecotricity. Every seat is full but no doubt this blue zone would be far busier if it werenât for the climate March happening in central Glasgow this afternoon. Read morehereon Massive Attack's efforts to help the music industry reduce its carbon footprint. This week, we've heard speeches from politicians and activists - and now Idris Elba has joined their ranks. The actor says people may wonder why he's there but that he wants to use his ""big mouth"" to amplify the conversation around food security. You can watch a clip of him - speaking alongside Ugandan activist Vanessa Nakate - below. This video can not be played COP26: Idris Elba joins activist Vanessa Nakate in call for food security Greta Thunberg joined the Glasgow march but did not speak on stage Organisers have confirmed Greta Thunberg will
not be speaking at Glasgow Green. The Swedish activist was marching today and it was hoped she would take to the stage, as she did yesterday. The last speech is about to wrap up and
security are preparing to disperse the crowds. Mary McCoolBBC Scotland News Speeches and live music are well under way at
Glasgow Green - with thousands of activists still surging through the entrance
archway. Over frequent cries of ""climate
justice"", you can hear the music that activists have brought from all over the
world - be it the call and response of samba drums or Aretha Franklin blaring
from a portable speaker. Earlier, a stage had to be dismantled due to
strong winds. But guest speakers have instead delivered
their messages from a makeshift platform inside a lorry. It's cramped and people are cold - but they are
determined to have their voices heard. Climate activist Vanessa Nakate makes her appearance on the Glasgow stage. Two years ago, inspired by Greta Thunberg's Friday school
protests, Nakate started her own strike outside the Ugandan parliament
demanding government action on climate change. She tells the Glasgow crowd how overnight storms have seriously
damaged a school which she and fellow campaigners helped to build in her home
country. ""The strong winds and
heavy rainfall will not stop, because the words and promises of leaders do not
match their actions. ""And this is just one example. I need someone to tell me
how to explain to farmers who are losing their crops and farms because of
droughts and floods, while leaders continue to open up new
coal power stations.â An update from inside the summit Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst Reef fish swim above recovering coral colonies on the Great Barrier Reef off the coast of Cairns, Australia. Some 45 governments
have vowed to protect nature and shift to better ways of farming. Many
forests and grasslands, which previously soaked up our carbon emissions, are
actually giving out carbon as soils are damaged and trees are felled. The
expansion of cattle ranching is a big problem. Governments
are now channelling Â£3bn ($4bn) to help farmers protect nature, emit less CO2
and methane from livestock, and cope with a heating climate. The
UK is promoting the initiative but the Wildlife Trusts say it also must
urgently reform subsidies for British farming. The oceans are vital too, absorbing about a third of our carbon emissions. But
over-fishing, pollution and global heating are harming the seas, and the
acidification of sea water caused by CO2 is deadly to coral reefs. The UK is chipping in Â£6m ($8m) to a UN fund to help developing nations protect their
seas. Critics say the cash and related policies are welcome but not nearly
enough. Away from Glasgow now, here's a quick look at protests taking place elsewhere in Europe. In France, climate action activists display portraits of world leaders, including US President Joe Biden, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Russian President Vladimir Putin, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and the French President Emmanuel Macron in front of the Paris city hall Protesters march with striking placards in Istanbul, Turkey. The country's president, Recep Erdogan, was due to attend COP26, but cancelled the trip for what his office said were security reasons Extinction Rebellion activists block Rue de la Loi during a protest in Brussels, Belgium In Amsterdam, the Netherlands, one activist spoofs a Shell oil executive as they turn the crank to heat up the planet One of the hosts of the Glasgow event is Mitzi Jonelle Tan, from the youth activists' group Fridays for Future and MAPA. She tells the crowd that it is ""very important that we listen to the people of colour, the black people who have barely contributed to the climate crisis yet are experiencing the worst impacts of it"". ""We have to tackle every system of injustice in order to achieve climate justice,"" she adds. Gregorio Diaz Mirabal calls for support for indigenous people The opening speeches in at the protest rally at Glasgow Green are coming from representatives of indigenous people around the globe. Gregorio Diaz Mirabal, the leader of the Congress of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin, tells the crowds he gives them ""a hug the size of the planet"". To large cheers, he adds: ""We just want to ask you, from our hearts, for your support and solidarity to build governance of indigenous peoples around the world."" More on trees now, as today's theme at the summit in Glasgow is nature - and its role as a solution for tackling climate change. Trees have an important role in removing carbon emissions from the atmosphere, and the UK government has an ambitious target to plant 30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. A hectare is a bit bigger than a football pitch. Annual tree planting was close to this figure back in the late 1980s (most of it in Scotland) but it has not risen above 15,000 hectares UK-wide since 2001. Tree-planting is a devolved issue, and Scotland has nearly twice as much coverage as England. The government wants to treble planting in England during this Parliament, but overall it has a lot of ground to make up by 2025. A sharp acceleration will be needed to meet this target, and there are questions about how the trees will be cared for after they are planted. Steve MellenBBC News reporter in Bristol Much of today's focus is on Glasgow but there have been demonstrations taking place all around the UK. Here in Bristol there are an estimated 5,000
people on the climate march, which began at College Green and is currently on a loop
through the city centre. At the start of the march, the Baltic Wharf Brides
paraded in front of the crowd. They are all women whoâmarriedâ threatened trees on Bristol Harbourside in September. Vanessa Nakate speaks at a 'Fridays for Future' march during COP26 Climate activist Vanessa Nakate - who has been speaking on a COP26 panel about sustainable food production alongside the actor Idris Elba this afternoon - will be addressing the crowds at Glasgow Green soon. But who is the 24-year-old and what does she stand for? Nakate's home country of Uganda is a landlocked nation in east Africa, with the Equator Line running through it, making it one of the hottest places on Earth. This heat brings extreme weather conditions that can lead to drought or heavy rainfall. She says she has witnessed the consequences throughout her life, as farming became harder and heavy rain devastated communities, and decided she needed to take action. Two years ago, inspired by Greta Thunberg's Friday school protests, Nakate started her own strike outside the Ugandan parliament demanding government action on climate change. She later spoke at COP25 and the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where she called on companies, banks and governments to immediately stop putting money into the use of fossil fuels for energy.

Paul O'HareBBC Scotland News Ruby Hembrom, left, and Sophie Grig Today, we've been speaking to people marching through Glasgow about why they felt it was important to attend. Ruby
Hembrom is on the march to raise awareness of the plight of people
in her native India. She
says: âWhen you look at climate change, the most vulnerable people will be
the most impacted. âIndigenous
people are forced from the forests due to coal and mining projects. The
consequences are devastating.â The
London-based student has been joined by Sophie Grig, senior campaigner with Survival
International. The
group works to support native groups across the world, especially those who
face persecution and displacement. Sophie says: âWe have to stop burning and extracting fossil fuels. And
we have to end the suffering of indigenous communities.â Back in Glasgow, the main march of the day has now reached Glasgow Green - with organisers estimating that 100,000 people are taking part. The police are not giving an estimate of crowd numbers. As we have been reporting, Greta Thunberg will speak at the rally, with other speakers including Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean, 23, who addressed world leaders at the opening of the COP26 talks. She will be joined by others such as Mitzi Jonelle Tan, who has previously toldthe BBC of her trauma at the typhoons engulfing her home in the Philippines. Tom GrundyBBC News in Trafalgar Square Londonâs climate march has reached its final destination
in Trafalgar Square. A large crowd has filled the square to hear various
speeches delivered underneath Nelsonâs Column. The speakers so far have called for âclimate justiceâ.

Londonâs financial district is âthe engine room of the climate crisisâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Scores dead in Sierra Leone tanker explosionA huge explosion happened after an oil truck collided with another vehicle in the nation's capital.,"People at the site of the blast on Saturday At least 98 people have died after a massive explosion when a fuel tanker collided with a lorry in Sierra Leone's capital, Freetown. Fuel spilled before igniting and the resulting inferno engulfed bystanders and vehicles at a busy junction. Footage broadcast by local media outlets showed badly charred bodies in the streets surrounding the tanker. After visiting the scene, Vice-President Mohamed Juldeh Jalloh said it was a ""national disaster"". He said that the injured would receive free medical treatment. Freetown Mayor Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr described seeing ""harrowing"" photos. In pictures: Devastation after Freetown collision Some 92 people are being treated in hospitals and health centres around Freetown, some of which are said to be overwhelmed. The explosion is believed to have happened at a junction outside the busy Choithram Supermarket in the densely populated Wellington suburb in the east of the city at around 22:00 GMT on Friday. Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency (NDMA) said the vehicles collided when the tanker was entering a nearby filling station to discharge its fuel. The drivers, noticing a leak, exited their the vehicles and warned people to stay away. The explosion occurred when people tried to collect the fuel, the NDMA said. Many of those killed were trapped in their vehicles One report said a bus was completely burnt, while nearby shops and market stalls were caught up in the flames. Brima Bureh Sesay, the head of Sierra Leone's National Disaster Management Agency, said there were many ""burnt corpses"". ""It's a terrible, terrible accident,"" he told local media in a video shared from the scene. Umaru Fofana, freelance journalist, Freetown At the scene of the accident, there are body parts still lying in burnt-out vehicles. Also here are what's left of the petrol tanker and the truck that rammed into it. Motorbike-taxi riders nearby started collecting the leaking fuel, causing a traffic jam. Shortly after, there was an explosion. The fireballs spread into the surrounding area and onto the vehicles caught in the traffic. The authorities say most of the dead have now been received at the central morgue in Freetown, with the critically injured admitted to hospitals across the city. The army, police and fire force are all at the scene. The port city of Freetown, which is home to just over a million people, has faced several serious disasters in recent years. In March, more than 80 people were injured after a major fire in one of the city's slums left more than 5,000 people displaced. And in 2017 over 1,000 people were killed after heavy rains led to a mudslide that swept through the city, leaving around 3,000 people homeless.

Anxiety link to IBS may be genetically hardwired,"Genes may go some way towards explaining why a common but poorly understood gut disorder - irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) - is often linked to anxiety, say researchers. They hope their discovery will stop IBS being wrongly labelled as an emotional state or ""all in the mind"". The team studied more than 50,000 individuals with IBS, comparing their DNA with that of healthy people. The results are published in the journal Nature Genetics. IBS is thought to affect about one in 10 people and can cause distressing abdominal pain, bloating and bouts of constipation, diarrhoea or both. With no defining test, diagnosis comes after ruling out other causes. Women are slightly more affected than men, and the usual age for patients to seek advice is between 20 and 40. Prof Miles Parkes, a consultant gastroenterologist at Cambridge's Addenbrookes Hospital who led the gene research, says IBS is still poorly understood, even by some doctors, and may be incorrectly categorised as psychosomatic because of the overlap with anxiety and stress. He and his team say they have identified at least six distinct genetic differences that might, at least partly, explain this link between the gut and the mind. The results showed: Overall, heritability of IBS (how much your genes influence the likelihood of developing a particular condition) is quite low Six genetic differences were more common in people with IBS than in controls Most of these have roles in the brain, and possibly the nerves which supply the gut, rather than the gut itself The same genetic make-up that puts people at increased risk of IBS also increases the risk for common mood and anxiety disorders such as anxiety, depression, and neuroticism, as well as insomnia That doesn't mean anxiety causes IBS symptoms or vice versa, says Prof Parkes. ""Our study shows these conditions have shared genetic origins, with the affected genes possibly leading to physical changes in brain or nerve cells that in turn cause symptoms in the brain and symptoms in the gut."" The discovery might ultimately help with developing better tests and treatments for IBS. This video can not be played 'There's definitely a stigma around having IBS' Laura Tebbs, who is 34 and from Cambridge, has experience living with IBS symptoms and anxiety and depression. ""I've had bouts of depression and anxiety for a decade so I know what it is like to live with that, but my IBS began after I caught Covid this January. ""It's hard for some people to understand, but IBS really is quite a challenging thing to live with. ""I was in constant pain every time I ate. And I'd get really bloated. It was so bad that I couldn't wear any of my normal trousers or jeans. I just lived in leggings instead. ""I was tired and moody and couldn't do things that I would normally enjoy, like going out for a meal with mates."" Laura says she was ""fobbed off"" by some healthcare professionals who, she says, dismissed her condition and recommended laxatives for one of her symptoms - constipation. She is now under Prof Parkes's care and has found ways to better manage her condition. ""It's much better now, and if I do have a flare-up there I things I can do to change it."" Medication may be needed, but there are some other things that can help too. To ease bloating, cramps and wind, consider: Eat oats, such as porridge Fresh ingredients, rather than lots of processed, fatty or spicy foods, is good but don't overdo it with the fruit and beans because they can cause diarrhoea and bloating Cauliflower, cabbage, sprouts and onions can be tricky for some people to digest too You could try probiotics or low lactose or lactose-free dairy products for a month and see if they help Don't delay or skip meals Avoid lots of alcohol, caffeine or fizzy drinks, but do drink plenty of water to keep your poo nicely soft (rather than too runny or hard) Take time over meals - don't eat too quickly For constipation: Drink plenty of water to make poo softer Eat fibre - linseeds, for example, helped Laura For diarrhoea: Consider cutting back a bit on fibre if you are eating lots of it Chewing lots of sugar-free gum containing sorbitol is another ""no-no"" - it can have a laxative effect Make sure you are drinking enough fluid to replace what you are losing and avoid dehydration Source:NHS,external British Dietetic Association (BDA) The IBS Network British Nutrition Foundation Night-time curfew imposed in fire-hit areas of LA as police warn against 'despicable' looting 'I have nothing to go back to' - BBC reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Trump avoids prison or fine in hush-money case sentencing LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

Metal detectorist finds miniature gold bible,"The miniature book was found near property once owned by King Richard III A small gold Bible, once perhaps owned by a medieval aristocrat or royal, has been found by a metal detectorist. NHS nurse Buffy Bailey, from Lancaster, found the book while searching farmland near York with her husband Ian. The 600-year-old object, which is just 0.5in (1.5cm) long, could be worth more than Â£100,000, Mrs Bailey said. An expert described it as an ""exceptionally unique"" artefact which would have originally been owned by someone ""incredibly wealthy"". Mrs Bailey, 48, said she and her husband chose York for detecting because they ""knew it had a lot of history"". With permission from the landowner, Mrs Bailey said she got a signal straight away. ""I dug down five inches and it was just there - I still didn't believe it was anything special."" Buffy Bailey initially thought the find was a charm from a gift shop It was only when she cleaned the item she realised she had found something special and not a charm from a gift shop. ""It was so heavy and shiny - just absolutely beautiful,"" she said. The object weighs just 0.2oz (5g) and is either 22 or 24ct gold, and is thought to date back to the 15th Century. It is engraved with images of St Leonard and St Margaret, patron saints of childbirth, and could have been an object  used for protection during pregnancy and childbirth. The images are of St Leonard and St Margaret - who were both patron saints of childbirth Mrs Bailey said she found the object almost as soon as she arrived at the location It was found on land near property once owned by Richard III (1483 to 1485) and it is speculated that it could have been owned by a female relative of his or of his wife Anne Neville. It has been compared to the Middleham Jewel, a gold pendant set with a blue sapphire, found at Middleham Castle, about 40 miles (64km) away, also once owned by Richard III and the Neville family. Julian Evan-Hart, editor of Treasure Hunting magazine, said the book was an ""exceptionally unique"" historical artefact. ""The artwork is clearly iconographic and bears a close resemblance to the Middleham Jewel - there is every possibility that it was made by the same artist."" ""Whoever had it commissioned must have been incredibly wealthy,"" Mrs Bailey said. ""There's nothing else like it in the world. It could be worth Â£100,000 or more."" The Yorkshire Museum, in York, is assessing the item before a valuation is set. At that point the museum may decide to buy the item. The museum paid Â£2.5m to acquire the Middleham Jewel in 1992.

US lawmakers approve $1tn infrastructure bill,"The bill provides funding to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, among other key projects The US Congress has passed a landmark $1tn (Â£741bn) infrastructure spending package, delivering a major domestic win to President Joe Biden. Negotiations over the sweeping public works bill - which passed the House of Representatives with 228-206 vote - created a bitter split among Democrats. Meanwhile the House is moving forward with a more ambitious social spending bill favoured by liberal lawmakers. The infrastructure package now heads to Mr Biden's desk to be signed into law. Billed as a ""once-in-a-generation"" spending measure, the infrastructure legislation proposes $550bn in new federal expenditure, over the next eight years, to upgrade highways, roads and bridges, and to modernise city transit systems and passenger rail networks. The agreement also sets aside funding for clean drinking water, high speed internet, and a nationwide network of electric vehicle charging points. It is the largest federal investment in the country's infrastructure for decades. ""Tonight, we took a monumental step forward as a nation,""Mr Biden said in a statement.,external""Generations from now, people will look back and know this is when America won the economic competition for the 21st Century."" An infrastructure bill to fix more than US bridges Biden sees rebuilt roads as route to rout racism Five huge challenges for Joe Biden It will be financed in several ways, including unspent emergency relief funds from the Covid pandemic. Its passage marks a huge achievement for the Biden administration amid low approval ratings and a defeat for the Democrats in Virginia's gubernatorial election this week. Three months ago, 19 Republicans joined with Democrats to approve the legislation in the evenly split Senate, a rare bipartisan feat in an increasingly divided Congress. On Friday the bill passed the House with support from 13 Republicans, too. But more liberal lawmakers balked at its final version, complaining that key liberal policies had been dropped in exchange for the bipartisan win. Six Democrats voted against it, including Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Ilhan Omar of Minnesota. The group of six - dubbed The Squad - are among the most left-wing and progressive members of the House. Mr Biden (left) has said the infrastructure bill will create new jobs and boost US competitiveness Members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus pledged they would not support the infrastructure bill until they had voted on a separate social welfare bill that allocates $1.75tn for healthcare, education and climate change initiatives. If passed, it would usher in the biggest expansion of the US safety net in more than 50 years. Democrats control both chambers of Congress by very slim majorities, so near-universal support would be required for the bill's passage. Centrist Democrats continue to object to the size and scope of the sprawling bill. They are insisting on seeing full accounting of its economic impacts. On Friday House leaders brokered a compromise, insisting on a vote on the infrastructure bill, accompanied by a procedural vote to start debate on the social spending bill. The chamber passed the procedural vote early on Saturday by 221 votes to 213. Compiling an independent assessment of the social spending bill's full cost is expected to take at least two weeks, although Democratic leaders have said they remain confident the bill will be passed before the Thanksgiving holiday at the end of November. After months of haggling, brinksmanship and trips back to square one, Joe Biden's bipartisan infrastructure bill is on the verge of becoming infrastructure law. Final passage in Congress was secured by a deal forged between liberals and centrists in the Democratic Party to approve the infrastructure bill now and hold a vote in the House of Representatives on a larger social spending package by 15 November. That represents a leap of faith - and a tactical retreat - by the liberals who had been insisting that the infrastructure and spending bills be approved simultaneously. It was a leap too far for the handful of liberals who still voted no. But with a few Republicans on board, and Joe Biden publicly pushing for a vote and promising progressives the spending bill would get its day soon, a path to passage emerged. Of course, promises can be broken - and there's still the possibility centrists could derail the spending package, either in the House or after it reaches the Senate. In the meantime, however, the infrastructure bill, with hundreds of billions of dollars for roads, bridges, pipes and green energy, has reached the finish line, giving Mr Biden a signature bipartisan legislative victory.

"Supermarkets pledge to halve environmental impactFive food retailers say they will cut carbon emissions, deforestation, food waste and packaging by 2030.UK","Five of the UK's biggest supermarkets have promised to halve the environmental impact of a weekly food shop by the end of the decade. Tesco, Sainsbury's, Waitrose, Co-op and M&S said they would reduce carbon emissions, deforestation and the food waste and packaging they produce. Their efforts will be monitored by the WWF conservation group. ""Food production is one of the biggest threats to our planet,"" said WWF chief executive Tanya Steele said. The chief executives of the supermarkets, which together serve more than half of UK food shoppers, said in a joint statement: ""We recognise that a future without nature is a future without food. By 2030 we need to halt the loss of nature."" Before the end of next year, they also promised to set science-based targets for how they would help to limit global warming to 1.5C above pre-industrial temperatures. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Global food prices hit fresh 10-year high, UN says Tesco zero-waste trial launches at 10 stores This is a key target for world leaders at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow, with scientists saying it must be met to avoid the worst effects of climate change. Currently, the world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. Unless more is done, the planet is already on track to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. The food industry is responsible for more than a quarter of total greenhouse gas emissions and almost 60% of the global damage to biodiversity, so minimising its impact could make a significant contribution to reducing climate change. Each year, the industry emits 17.3bn tonnes of carbon dioxide - about 19 times more than commercial planes. About a quarter of the world's greenhouse gas emissions come from agriculture, forestry and other land use - and experts say the way food is grown and consumed needs reforming. Ms Steele from the WWF said the world could only tackle the ""climate and nature emergency"" if food retailers played their part. ""The promises these CEOs have made are game-changing and we hope other food retailers will follow in their footsteps, so that every shopper can be confident that the products they buy aren't fuelling the climate crisis and pushing precious wildlife closer to the brink,"" she said. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? What are top polluters doing to cut emissions? Later, as the COP26 summit continues, it is expected that 45 governments, including the UK, will pledge urgent action and investment to protect nature and shift to more sustainable ways of farming. And, in a separate development, another 20 countries joined a global forum aimed at reducing deforestation from the production of commodities such as palm oil, cocoa and soya - the Forest, Agriculture and Commodity Trade (FACT) dialogue forum. Matt Williams, an expert from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit think tank, said ""food and farming have largely been missing from this summit so far"" but this ""plants the seeds"" for it to make a serious contribution to reaching net-zero emissions. Another 27 countries also signed up to a sustainable agriculture pledge to help them meet their climate goals, and will use funding earmarked for agriculture subsidies to reduce emissions. And the UK government has announced a Â£500m programme which it said would help to protect over five million hectares of rainforests from deforestation - an area almost 20% of the size of the UK itself. But Anna Jones at Greenpeace UK said the attempts to address the supply chains of the food industry were ""little more than a talking shop"". She said ""there's nothing on the need to reduce demand for products like meat and dairy that are driving deforestation"". Large-scale demonstrations are taking place in Glasgow, where the summit is being held, as well as in London and other cities in the UK and around the world. The marches come after thousands of young activists, including Greta Thunberg and Vanessa Nakate marched through Glasgow on Friday protesting against investment in fossil fuels and the failure to tackle the climate crisis.

Can I get a free flu jab?,"Health officials are urging people to get a flu vaccination this autumn, as flu starts to spread at a higher level than in a normal year. Many southern hemisphere nations had their worst flu season for years, after the ending of Covid restrictions meant people mixed much more, andexperts predict the same is likely to happen in the UK. Having a vaccine will stop many people from becoming seriously ill,including children, and ease pressure on the health service. In England,the flu vaccine,externalis free for frontline health or social care workers, and those who: are 50 and over have certain health conditions are pregnant are in long-stay residential care are the main carer for an older or disabled person Adults aged 65 and over should be offered a vaccine with an extra ingredient that triggers a stronger response from the immune system. Anasal spray form of the vaccine,external, which is more suitable for children, is being offered to: 2- and 3-year-olds all primary school children secondary school children in years 7, 8 and 9 children aged six months to 17 years with long-term health conditions The oldest, youngest and the most vulnerable are being offered a jab first before other groups because they are at higher risk of complications. If there's enough supply, pupils in years 10 and 11 will also be offered a dose. For most people, the flu vaccine can be accessed via GPs, midwives and schools. Eligible patients can also book an appointment at a pharmacy. About26 million people in the UK are also being offered a booster jab against Covid. They may be offered flu and Covid jabs at the same time. UK must brace for big, early wave of flu - experts Health officials inScotland,external,Northern Ireland,externalandWalesare offering jabs to broadly similar groups of people - with some variations. Scottish parents urged to take up child flu vaccine offer Children are given the flu vaccine as a nasal spray Anyone can pay to have a private flu vaccine at pharmacies or some supermarkets, at a cost of about Â£15. However, officials say vaccine supplies will be prioritised for those at greatest risk who are entitled to a free jab via the NHS. The best time to get vaccinated is between late September and end of November because the flu season peaks in January or February, but it's still worth having it later. For many,flu typically lasts about two weeks,external, and clears up on its own. However, it can be very serious - particularly for older adults, very young children and people with underlying health conditions. Pregnant women are advised to have the flu vaccine as soon as it becomes available, regardless of their stage of pregnancy. Annual flu deaths vary each year, depending on the strain and other factors. More than 24,000 people died in England from flu and pneumonia in 2019 It can be hard to tell if you have flu or Covid as the symptoms can be similar, including: fever cough tiredness Some people also experience muscle-aches, a headache, sore throat or diarrhoea and vomiting with flu. But these symptoms can be caused by other common winter viruses too. Both flu and Covid can be spread before people have symptoms. Covid symptoms: Is it a cold, flu or coronavirus? Social distancing reduced the spread of the flu last winter which has weakened people's immunity Yes, in which case you are more likely to be seriously ill. Research shows those infected with both viruses are more than twice as likely to die as someone with Covid alone. Do I need to isolate if I have Covid? How to look after yourself if you get Covid Most are mild and only last a day or two. They can include a slightly raised temperature, muscle-ache and a sore arm. Allergic reactions are rare, but you should avoid the vaccine if you have previously had a bad response to a flu vaccine. Those with egg allergies should ask their pharmacist or GP for a low-egg or egg-free vaccine. It is best to avoid the vaccine if you are ill with a high temperature, and re-book for when you are fully recovered.

Meghan 'cold-calls senators' over family leave,"She didn't get her royal title from America, but that hasn't stopped the Duchess of Sussex from weighing in on an ongoing US political debate. Meghan this week reportedly cold-called Republican Senators to advocate for paid family leave - now a sticking point in a major spending bill. Republican Senator Susan Collins of Maine was not expecting the call, her spokeswoman told the BBC on Friday. West Virginia's Shelley Moore Capito was also called, according to Politico. Ms Collins may not have appreciated the royal intervention. ""Much to my surprise, she called me on my private line and she introduced herself as the Duchess of Sussex, which is kind of ironic,"" Senator Collins told Politico. ""I was happy to talk with her. But I'm more interested in what the people of Maine are telling me about it."" Senator Capito told Politico she had received the call while in the car. Seeing a blocked number, Ms Capito thought it was Democratic Senator Joe Manchin, a fellow West Virginian. ""I'm in my car. I'm driving. It says caller ID blocked. Honestly... I thought it was Senator Manchin. His calls come in blocked. And she goes 'Senator Capito?' I said, 'Yes.' She said, 'This is Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex,"" Ms Capito recounted. Meghan was reportedly given the senators' phone numbers by a Democratic colleague: New York Senator Kirsten Gillibrand. Ms Gillibrand has been a vocal supporter of adding paid family leave to a massive spending bill now up for debate in Congress. Representatives for Senator Gillibrand, Senator Capito and the duchess did not respond to an immediate request for comment from the BBC. Democrats on Wednesday moved to add paid family leave back into the $1.75tn (Â£1.1tn) social spending and climate policy bill, an addition that is surely to face intense opposition, especially from Republicans and some moderate Democrats. The US is the only wealthy nation with no national paid parental leave programme. Some 21% of US workers have access to paid family leave through their employers. Why doesn't the US have mandated paid maternity leave? It is a cause apparently close to the duchess' heart. Last month, the mother of two and posted a letter to Congress on the website PaidLeaveforAll.org pushing for paid family leave in the US. ""I'm writing to you at this deeply important time - as a mom - to advocate for paid leave,"" she said. ""The working mom or parent is facing the conflict of being present or being paid. The sacrifice of either comes at a great cost."" British royals are traditionally expected to remain politically neutral.
