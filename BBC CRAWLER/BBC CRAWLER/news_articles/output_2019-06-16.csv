Rail strike to hit Royal Ascot racegoers,"The RMT will resume strike action after suspending it in February Rail commuters on some of the country's busiest routes are facing disruption due to a planned five-day strike over the future of train guards. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) plan to walk out on Tuesday over South Western Railway's ""failure"" to rule out it would move to a driver-controlled operation. London commuters and racegoers at Royal Ascot have been advised to check details of trains online. SWR called the strikes ""unnecessary"". It said while services may be disrupted by the strike, there will still be trains running, and advised commuters to plan in advance and check departure times on its website. Planned industrial action wassuspended in Februaryas a resolution seemed in sight, with the RMT claiming SWR had pledged ""each passenger train shall operate with a guard with safety critical competencies"". But RMT said SWR had now ""rowed back"" on its public pledges as it refused to rule out future driver controlled operations - which would see the role of the guard ""carved up completely"". RMT general secretary Mick Cash said members were ""angry and frustrated"" as they had suspended action in ""good faith"" only for SWR to ""fail to bolt down an agreement that matches up to our expectations on the guard guarantee"". He also criticised SWR's ""insistence"" that future schemes would be ""governed"" by the protection of company profits rather than that of ""the travelling public"". A SWR spokesman said it was ""very disappointing"" the union had decided to call the strike despite dates being set for more talks. ""Clearly, they have decided to target popular events such as Royal Ascot with this cynical action which is driven by internal RMT politics,"" the spokesman said. The company said it met with union representatives last week to fix new dates for talks but the unions were ""insistent on going ahead with their unnecessary strike"". It said it had matched RMT's request to keep a guard on each train and wanted to move on to discuss how to make the most of new technology on board. The spokesman said the company ""remains committed to finding a solution"". Passengers heading to Twickenham, Hampton Court and Royal Ascot, have been advised to allow extra time for their travel. The Royal Ascot event runs for five days from Tuesday. How will you be impacted by the strikes? Share your experiences by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Hong Kong protest 'largest in decades',"This video can not be played Protests returned to Hong Kong streets following the suspension of the extradition bill Nearly two million people have taken part in a mass protest in Hong Kong against a controversial extradition bill, organisers say. If confirmed, it would be the largest protest in Hong Kong's history. Police said turnout was 338,000 at its peak. The masses turned out despite the suspension of the bill - which would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China - on Saturday. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Sunday apologised for proposing the bill. Many protesters, who fear increased Chinese influence over Hong Kong, are calling on her to resign over the unrest. They are also demanding that the bill be scrapped, not just suspended. Meanwhile, supporters of Joshua Wong - the student leader who became the face of Hong Kong's  ""Umbrella Movement"" democracy protests five years ago - say he will be released from prison later on Monday. ""Today's march we had almost two million people,"" Jimmy Sham, from the Civil Human Rights Front protest group, told reporters late on Sunday evening. See the scale of the march in photos The protest was mainly peaceful, with police officers reportedly holding back to allow the throngs of people to slowly pass through the city. This contrasted to scenes at the last previous major demonstration on Wednesday, which saw clashes between protesters and police that injured dozens. Protesters have been demanding Carrie Lam's resignation The demonstration began early in the afternoon in Victoria Square, with many wearing black. Many held white flowers to mourn a protester who fell to his death on Saturday from a ledge, where hours earlier he had unfurled an anti-extradition banner. The progress of the march was slow, as the large numbers of people blocked many streets and crowded train stations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As darkness fell, protesters started to take over major roads and crossings and surrounded the legislative council building. They carried placards that read ""The students did not riot"", in response to police labelling last Wednesday's student protests a riot - an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail. This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows the scale of Hong Kong protests on Sunday All you need to know about the protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained There was scepticism among some protesters about Ms Lam's decision to suspend the bill. ""Carrie Lam has ignored the feelings of Hong Kongers,"" Mr Ma, a 67-year-old protester, told the BBC. He said Ms Lam had ""acted like it was no big deal"" after a reported million people marched last week. ""Secondly, we are marching for the students who were brutally treated by the police. We need to get justice for them."" Chloe Yim, 20, who had joined the protests for the first time, said: ""If Carrie sees so many people come out, and still doesn't listen - she's being an autocrat who doesn't listen to people. Hong Kong people can't accept that."" Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong The government had hoped to reduce public anger by announcing a pause in the legislation on Saturday. That has patently failed, as even bigger numbers - close to two million, according to the organisers, took to the streets. For the chief executive, the demonstrations will have taken on a particularly personal bent, as protesters chanted ""Carrie Lam - resign!"" throughout during the day. The government is now trying to strike a conciliatory tone - in a statement, it said it understood the protesters' views ""have been made out of love and care for Hong Kong"". It promised the chief executive would adopt a more ""sincere and humble attitude"" towards public criticism. But this is too little, too late for many protesters, who insist they won't settle for anything less than the bill being completely withdrawn. The new face of the HK protests The scenes are reminiscent of 2003 - when half a million people protested against proposed national security legislation. The unpopular chief executive at the time, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned months later. But even if Ms Lam resigns, there's no guarantee that protesters will be satisfied with whoever replaces her - especially as, under Hong Kong's political system, the leader is elected by a small panel filled with allies of the Beijing government. Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. On Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Chinaâs history of extraordinary rendition Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? There were clashes and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police have been accused by some rights groups of excessive force. Much of the public anger has been directed at Ms Lam, the region's elected chief executive - who is firmly supported by Beijing. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests this week Part of that anger comes from a tearful address after Wednesday's violence in whichshe labelled the protests ""organised riots""â a label rejected by the hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters. Ms Lam remained hidden from public view for days, until her announcement on Saturday the she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". But she stopped short of saying the bill would be permanently shelved. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong On Sunday, she followed this up with a statement apologising for ""her government's work that has led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people"". This video can not be played Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy There has been speculation among analysts about Ms Lam's future amid the continued protests, but China's foreign ministry publicly backed her on Saturday. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War -which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China.It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system.

Boeing and the battle over blame," EthiopianAirlines rejects accusations of pilot error The crash site is empty now condoned off by a row of wooden posts The crash site is empty now condoned off by a row of wooden posts By Theo Leggett  and Simon Browning Standing in a muddy field on the edge of a small farm to the south of the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa, it’s difficult to imagine that 157 men, women and children lost their lives here. The landscape is vast, with rolling plains to the west that appear to go on forever. It’s broken up by small clusters of trees spread across the yellow-and-brown arable land. Against a backdrop of undulating hills, there is a large, circular wooden fence. Slim, single batons reaching about head height, stand up from the ground. Beyond it lies a crater some 27m (90ft) wide and 36.6m (120ft) long. This is where, just over three months ago, Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 nose-dived into the ground at 500mph, just six minutes after leaving Addis Ababa. Mounds of earth are piled up where excavators have sifted through the wreckage. Here in Hama Kuntuschule, where the local population still travels by horse and cart, people from 35 different countries as far away as Canada, China and the UK, lost their lives. A small group of men walk towards us. One of them, Kelele, tells us that he was here on 10 March when the plane crashed. “The time was early morning and we were all in the house, taking our breakfast. No-one saw what happened at the time,” he says. “We just heard a sound. When we got out we just saw something burning and smoking.” Almost immediately, the land was besieged by diggers, air crash investigators, government officials, men and women walking in lines combing through the debris and charred personal belongings. And, of course, the families of the victims who had gathered to grieve. The crash site in March 2019 The crash site in March 2019 It is a different sight today. It’s very quiet and the more obvious pieces of wreckage have been taken away. But debris remains, catching your eye wherever you turn. Scraps and shreds of fabric, a piece of leather - possibly the strap of a bag. A small, square chunk of metal still bears the distinctive black, yellow and green paint of the Ethiopian Airlines livery. The process of being ripped from the fuselage has left it jagged and contorted. Fragments of a honeycomb-like material, flecked with white paint, are scattered widely across the rich dark mud. It’s all that remains of the aircraft’s interior. It’s hard to comprehend the violence of what happened here - that a brand new modern jet could be obliterated in an instant, that this place is a mass grave. The victims’ families have long since left the site. Their memorials and floral tributes have been removed. But the fate of flight ET302 has not been forgotten. It is still the subject of intense debate and concern, particularly in corridors of power in the US. The plane was a new design - a 737 Max, an updated version of Boeing’s long-serving workhorse, the 737 - and the crash was the second accident involving that model in the space of just a few months. Now Boeing is facing serious questions about the way in which the new plane was conceived and brought to market. The US Department of Justice is reportedly carrying out a criminal inquiry. Numerous lawsuits have been launched against the aerospace giant by relatives of the crash victims. Amid all of this, a great deal of attention has been focused on the pilots of the aircraft, the action they took during the fatal flight and whether the training they were given by their employer, Ethiopian Airlines, gave them the skills they needed to avert disaster.   When the preliminary report was published after the crash, Ethiopian transport minister Dagmawit Moges appeared keen to exonerate Capt Yared Getachew and First Officer Ahmednur Mohammed Omar. Yared was a relatively seasoned pilot, with more than 8,000 flying hours on his record, including some 1400 on 737s. His first officer, however, had just 361 hours, including 207 on Boeing 737s. The Ethiopian government had taken charge of the investigation, which was helped by the relatively quick recovery and analysis of the aircraft’s flight recorders. It concluded that the crew had done nothing wrong. “The crew performed all the procedures - repeatedly - provided by the manufacturer, but was not able to control the aircraft,” said Dagmawit . Captain Yared Getachew Captain Yared Getachew However, this conclusion has been challenged by people who believe the pilots committed a series of errors. The trigger for the accident - and the root cause of another crash involving a near-identical 737 Max off Indonesia last year - is thought to have been the failure of a system known as Manoeuvring Characteristics Augmentation System (MCAS). What now seems apparent with the benefit of hindsight is that MCAS had design flaws. Boeing itself has indicated as much. MCAS is a piece of flight control software designed to make the new plane easier and more familiar to fly for pilots who were already used to the previous generation of 737 – reducing the need for potentially costly extra training. It was meant to curb a tendency for the nose of the aircraft to rise too much, when it was already pitched up at a steep angle. It used the stabilisers - the horizontal wings on the tail of the aircraft, which are normally used to keep the aircraft balanced - to produce a nose-down movement. However, the system relied on data from a single sensor on the outside of the aircraft to determine the angle at which the aircraft was flying. The failure of that one sensor could lead to the system deploying at the wrong time - forcing the aircraft into a descent. It appears to have done just that on both the Boeings that crashed, forcing the nose of the aircraft down when the pilots were attempting to gain height. The system was also very powerful, able to produce significant stabiliser movements, and capable of overriding the crews’ own inputs as it activated again and again. After the second crash, authorities around the world grounded the 737 Max. Boeing is working on modifications to the software, and the design will not fly again until regulators are satisfied it is completely safe. But if the aircraft control systems themselves were faulty, why have attempts been made - by Boeing and some US politicians - to cast a share of the blame onto the crew of the stricken aircraft? Among the fiercest critics of the crew’s actions in the US has been Congressman Sam Graves, himself a qualified pilot and Ranking Member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure in the House of Representatives. The Missouri Republican thinks that the crew of ET302 could have saved their plane. Congressman Sam Graves Congressman Sam Graves He has been a vocal presence at hearings in Washington involving both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the National Transportation Safety Board as part of the inquiries and investigations surrounding the 737 Max. In May, Graves insisted that “facts in the preliminary report reveal pilot error as a factor”. He went on to claim that “pilots trained in the US would have successfully been able to control this situation”. That is a controversial view, but one based on the way in which the pilots reacted to the situation confronting them. Nor is he alone in his opinion which is widely reflected in statements made by others online and in the media. Before the Lion Air crash off Indonesia - in which 189 people were killed - the very existence of MCAS was unknown to airlines buying the 737 Max, or to their flight crews. The acronym did not appear in the flight manual. After the accident, however, Boeing published a bulletin in which it described the effects of an MCAS malfunction, and instructed pilots to follow a particular “non-normal checklist” designed to help them cope with uncontrolled stabiliser movements. This checklist - which is meant to be memorised by flight crew - instructed them to flip switches on the centre console, to turn off the stabiliser electronics, then balance the aircraft using manual trim wheels beside the pilots’ knees. The Ethiopian crew tried to follow this procedure. They turned off the electronics and attempted to “trim” the aircraft - to bring it back into level, balanced flight - using the hand controls. But the preliminary report suggests that they were physically unable to do so. It appears the aircraft was simply going too fast, and the aerodynamic forces building up on the stabilisers were too strong for the pilots to overcome with muscle power. They turned the electronics back on and ultimately lost control altogether. This is where Graves’ main criticisms come in. He points out that throughout the flight, the pilots failed to reduce power from the levels used immediately after take-off, allowing the plane to continue accelerating to the point where it was moving too quickly to be trimmed manually. “Once they set those throttles to full power, they never retarded them,” he told the committee. “They accelerated right through the certified maximum speed… and just kept on accelerating.” During the same hearing, under questioning from Graves, the acting head of the FAA, Dan Elwell, appeared to agree with him. “They did turn the [stabiliser trim switches] off, but they never controlled their airspeed,” he said. “And then subsequently… they turned them back on. Both of those things are unfortunate.” Elwell went on to say: “I’ve never looked at an accident where there weren’t three or four or five links of a chain, any one of which, if it hadn’t gone wrong, the plane would have survived.” That seemed to echo the words of Boeing’s Chief Executive Dennis Muilenburg, who told journalists in late April that both the Lion Air and Ethiopian Airlines accidents were the results of a “chain of events” of which MCAS was one link. Such claims have gone down badly at Ethiopian Airlines headquarters in Addis Ababa, where the emotional impact of the crash is still felt very strongly. In the ornate, wood-panelled boardroom, Chief Executive Tewolde Gebremariam remembers the day the plane went down. Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam Ethiopian Airlines CEO Tewolde Gebremariam “I was at church at that time, at about 9am,” he says.  “It was a big shock when they called and told me that ET302 had disappeared from radar. It was a tragic accident, a very, very tragic accident.” It was the beginning, he says, of a very difficult period, particularly for staff at the company’s hub, where the crew of the stricken airliner worked and received their training. “The entire company was grieving, for the loss of passengers, the loss of colleagues,” he says. “But at the same time, we managed to operate all our flights, on that very day and on the subsequent days.” The Ethiopian flag carrier is Africa’s largest airline. It operates more than 100 planes, and has a relatively young fleet, which includes state-of-the-art designs such as the Airbus A350 and Boeing’s 787. Although it has existed in various forms since the 1940s, it likes to project itself as a highly professional, thoroughly modern operation. Far removed from the tired African stereotype of a disorganised outfit operating a handful of ageing airliners, it sees itself as an ambitious new standard-bearer for the continent. It has a relatively strong safety record, although that was marred by the loss of a 737 that crashed off the coast of Lebanon in 2010 - an accident that was blamed in official reports on errors by the crew. So the fact that its training standards have been questioned by influential people such as Congressman Graves, and the idea that its pilots should bear some responsibility for the latest accident, has gone down badly. The Ethiopian Airlines boss says the congressman is “severely misinformed, or doesn’t have the facts in his hands”. When asked if there might be an agenda in the US to divert attention away from alleged failings by Boeing or the FAA, however, Tewolde strikes a more diplomatic note. There have been “very, very few” criticisms, he insists, though he concedes they may come from people with “vested interests”. Nevertheless, he makes it clear where he feels the real blame for the accident lies. “People who’ve made those comments should ask themselves, ‘Why on earth have they grounded 380 aircraft around the world?’ The facts speak for themselves.” Grounded Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8 Grounded Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 737 Max 8   Despite his assurances, the points made by Congressman Graves have prompted widespread debate about the actions of the pilots - particularly their apparent failure to reduce power. They were struggling desperately to recover their aircraft. An “overspeed” warning was blaring in the cockpit. The strength of the aerodynamic forces building up was preventing them from taking the steps they needed to save the plane. Yet they didn’t reduce thrust. It seems like an extraordinary oversight, but some aviation experts believe there may have been a very good reason why they didn’t touch the throttles. They include one UK-based 737 training captain who is also a former accident investigator. Like many other working pilots who have expressed views about the two accidents, he prefers not to be identified. He points to a particular handling characteristic of the  737 family - known as the pitch/power couple. In simple terms, it means that when engine thrust is increased, the nose of the aircraft will push upwards. When it is reduced, the reverse will happen – the nose will pitch down. It is a powerful effect, but one that the crew can normally respond to using their controls almost without thinking. But in the case of ET302, he argues, this effect left the pilots facing “an unsolvable conundrum”. In the early stages of the flight, they were confronted with a rapidly developing situation as they struggled to gain height while trying to work out why the plane seemed to have a mind of its own. By the time they began working through the procedure mandated by Boeing to disable the electronic stabiliser controls, they were already going too fast for the manual system to work. Boeing recognises this can happen. Its flight manual for the 737 Max advises pilots to accelerate or decelerate to a point where the plane reaches a natural aerodynamic balance and the control surfaces can move more easily – a point known as the “in-trim speed”. But doing that also presented a problem. “At this point, the crew are already dealing with an aircraft that wants to pitch nose-down,” the training captain explains. “It is also going too fast. The thought process may have been: ‘The answer to this would be to reduce thrust. But, if I reduce thrust I will immediately fall victim to the pitch/power couple, and the aircraft nose will pitch down even further.’” In other words, the pilots were faced with a situation where they couldn’t control the aircraft unless they tried to slow down - but doing so could push it into a catastrophic dive. It’s possible, then, that the crew didn’t reduce thrust because they simply didn’t dare to do so. Capt Chris Brady, himself a pilot and the author of a technical website devoted to the Boeing 737, endorses this theory. “In these circumstances, you’re really caught between a rock and a hard place,” he says. “They may have wanted to reduce thrust, but when the aircraft is already very low and nose down as well, you’d have to have balls of steel to do so.” There remains the question of why they didn’t adjust the throttles earlier. Brady concedes that “with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight, it would have been better if they’d reduced thrust at an earlier stage.” But early in the flight, the pilots were trying to gain height, and one of the control columns was shaking, usually a warning of an impending stall - a situation where the wings suddenly lose lift. Under those circumstances, Brady says, they would normally maintain a high level of thrust.    Ethiopian Airlines rejects any suggestion that its training standards fall short. Tewolde says the company has invested more than $500,000,000 (£396,000,000) on its Aviation Academy over the past five years Within the academy, rows of flight simulators sit in two vast hangars. Large, unwieldy-looking  boxes on stilts, they sway and swerve as they replicate the movements of giant airliners. These simulators cost millions of dollars each. The company has one for each of the large airliners in its fleet, including the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the Airbus A350 – and the 737 Max. The latter is something of a rarity. There are still relatively few in service, and this is the only one in Africa. It started operating in January. Boeing 737 Max simulator Boeing 737 Max simulator Because the Max was designed to be very similar to the previous generation of 737, pilots have been able to move from one model to the other without needing specific simulator training. Instead, they were allowed to make the transition after a relatively short computer-based course. Many carriers that already use the 737 Max - including American Airlines, for example - have yet to acquire a dedicated simulator. Inside Ethiopian Airlines’ machine Training Pilot Nathan Elias and his trainee first officer simulate an emergency. A warning blares out, and large, heavy control wheels by their knees start spinning rapidly. They adjust the throttles and flick a couple of switches. The wheels by their knees stop moving on their own, and the first officer uses a handle to crank them back to their previous position. The plane returns to an even keel. This is the procedure specified by Boeing for dealing with uncontrolled stabiliser movements - the same procedure it says should be used in the event of an MCAS failure. On this occasion it is carried out with a minimum of fuss. But Capt Elias says that the emergency faced by the pilots of ET302 would have been very different. He believes they may simply have become overwhelmed by the situation. On that plane, the pilots were faced with a shaking control column warning them of a possible stall. Due to the sensor failure, some instruments were giving unreliable readings. Warnings would have been sounding. And all of this began when the aircraft was just a few hundred feet off the ground. Yet one thing the simulator cannot yet do is replicate the circumstances of that accident or the previous crash off Indonesia. In late May,Boeing admittedthat software provided to simulator operators was flawed, and incapable of reproducing some flight conditions, including the failures experienced by ET302.   It’s worth remembering that the Ethiopian Airlines crash was the second of two major accidents involving the new 737 Max. The first occurred when a Lion Air jet fell into the sea off Indonesia on 29 October last year. Although preliminary reports have pointed the finger at MCAS in both cases, there is an important difference. Until the Lion Air plane went down, 737 Max pilots around the world were unaware that the system existed. It was intended to operate behind the scenes - an invisible aid to the crew.  By the time of the ET302 accident, however, Boeing had published details of how the system worked and what pilots should do if it went wrong. They did attempt to follow that procedure - but because of the speed they were going, were unable to complete the process. One question, then, is whether Boeing did enough in the wake of the first crash to ensure its design was actually safe to operate. Another - asked by the likes of Congressman Graves - is whether the crew themselves were sufficiently competent to carry it out. The relatives of those who died are trying to find ways to come to terms with what happened. Among them is Paul Njoroge, a Canadian resident who lost his wife Carolyne Nduta Karanja, three young children and mother-in-law Ann Karanja, when ET302 went down. Paul Njoroge (with microphone) at a memorial service. Nakuru, Kenya Paul Njoroge (with microphone) at a memorial service. Nakuru, Kenya “I see other people moving on with their lives, with their children, and I know I am not like them,” he says. “I think of my wife and children every moment. “At first I could not live, I could not eat, I could not talk to people,” he says, his voice breaking as we speak on the phone. He says that sometimes he wishes that he, too, had died on the aircraft. Boeing is now facing a number of lawsuits from relatives of victims, among them the family of Jonathan Seex, who was the chief executive of restaurant business The Tamarind Group, as well as Jane Nyambura, widow of Anthony Ngare, a journalist working for the UN cultural agency Unesco. These two lawsuits both make a serious accusation against Boeing. They claim “shortly after Flight 610 crashed… Boeing knew that hundreds of Max 8 aircraft were still in use carrying passengers all over the globe, which presented a substantial risk that a similar incident could occur without appropriate and immediate intervention… “Despite this knowledge and the gravity of the risks presented to passengers…Boeing consciously and intentionally failed to act, and/or acted without the urgency commensurate with the risk of harm presented by its defective and dangerous aircraft.” Njoroge is among the relatives taking legal action against Boeing. “I would like to see Boeing and the FAA unequivocally take responsibility for the deaths of 346 people, on the two planes, instead of shifting the blame onto the pilots,” he says. He believes the actions of the FAA and Boeing so far have displayed “a deep level of arrogance, of hubris”. “If they were to take ownership and responsibility for what happened, that to me would be everything.” Boeing will not comment on the specific allegations contained in the lawsuits. In a statement, it says: “Boeing extends our heartfelt condolences and sympathies to the families and loved ones of those onboard Ethiopian Airlines Flight 302 and Lion Air Flight 610.  As the investigations continue, Boeing is cooperating fully with the investigating authorities.” Within the pilot community, meanwhile, there is clearly anger at what some see as attempts to move responsibility away from the manufacturer, and on to the crew of the crashed plane. “With all due respect to the pride in training and experience we have here in the US, it should not be used as a platform to vilify non-US pilots,” says Capt Dennis Tajer, spokesman for the Allied Pilots Association, a union representing 15,000 crew at American Airlines. “Blaming dead pilots, blaming non-US pilots, the suggestion that somehow they’re not of equal skill and training is professionally insulting, and just not the way we do business,” he says. “Clearly the match and the gasoline were the MCAS system.” He claims any attempt to suggest otherwise is “disingenuous at best, and trying to distract from the real cause of the tragedies”. It is important to remember that investigations into the loss of ET302 are still under way, and the final report may well give much fuller details about what the pilots were or were not able to do. It is also worth acknowledging that many aviation accidents in the past have often involved a combination of technical failure and human error - and there is no question that the possibility of human error needs to be looked into thoroughly.   In a far corner at the end of the runway at Addis Ababa Airport is a huge maintenance area. Three enormous hangars are filled with jets from Ethiopian Airlines and other carriers that serve this region. Engineers are carrying out critical safety inspections and maintenance procedures. Parked up in front of the smallest hangar are four Boeing 737 Max 8s. The planes were grounded immediately after the crash and they’ve been stashed away from public view ever since. The cockpit windows are covered with silver reflective film to protect the electronic units inside from the harsh Ethiopian sunlight. On the exit doors, bright pink signs with black print read: “DO NOT OPEN”. Huge red plastic sleeves cover the engines. The sensor instruments just under the cockpit have also been covered over. Four jets that would usually have so much power and speed look strangely forlorn and rigid. Mesfin Tasew, the company’s chief operating officer, explains that the grounded planes are under what’s known as “preservation maintenance”. The engines, he says, have to be run once a week, and covered up the rest of the time, to prevent any foreign objects getting inside. Ethiopian Airlines Chief Operating Officer Mesfin Tasew Ethiopian Airlines Chief Operating Officer Mesfin Tasew Keeping aircraft like these on the ground is a costly process. Tasew explains that under normal circumstances they would be ferrying passengers twice a day on routes to other African countries, as well as operating services to India and the Middle East. Having to do without them means a great deal of lost revenue. The airline is still making repayments on money it borrowed to buy the planes, as well as having to fund the maintenance programme while they are on the ground. All told, it’s costing the airline millions of dollars every week. Other carriers with similar grounded planes have already admitted that costs are mounting up as a result. Airlines are very keen to see the 737 Max cleared to fly as soon as possible, because it was designed to be fuel-efficient, and cheap to operate. As Mesfin puts it, “We need this plane.” Nevertheless, safety has to come first. It’s still not clear when the plane will be allowed back in the air. The solutions put forward by Boeing need to be approved by the FAA first of all, while regulators elsewhere may decide to take a tough line before they give their own approvals. Ultimately, however, the 737 Max will fly again. Tewolde Gebremariam says that Ethiopian Airlines will have to be thoroughly convinced that the aircraft is truly safe before flights can be resumed. It will not be the first airline to put the plane back into the air, he says, but the last.

Pumps used to help flooded town,"High volume pumps are being used to try and reduce water levels High volume pumps are being used to lower water levels in a flooded Lincolnshire town. More than 580 homes in and around Wainfleet were evacuated amid concerns about flood defences. Dozens of people spent the night away from their homes in emergency centres. The town flooded on Wednesday after two months' worth of rain fell in two days and the banks of the River Steeping broke its banks. Steve Hardy and his wife, who stayed at the Coronation Hall in Wainfleet overnight, said he initially refused to leave his house when officials knocked on his door. ""I said 'well we don't really want to'. ""Then when he said 'well look it's going to be hard work for us if we have to come and get you' and I don't want to put anybody's life at risk. So that was it."" Lincolnshire Police has issued a request for people in the town not to use washing machines, toilets or showers. It said public toilets were being set up in Market Place and Brewster Lane and residents could use the showers at nearby Skegness Leisure Centre. RAF helicopters dropped almost 400 tonnes of ballast to plug a gap in the River Steeping RAF Chinook helicopters, aided by troops on the ground, have placed an additional 76 tonnes of sand and ballast on top of the 270 tonnes dropped on Friday in an attempt to reinforce and plug a breach in the River Steeping's banks. Ch Insp Phil Vickers, from Lincolnshire Police, said that it was important to reduce the river's levels. ""The Environment Agency have got some high volume pumps that are in place,"" he said. ""We're hoping they will assist us in clearing the water from the channel and from the area surrounding. ""Until we're satisfied that there isn't a risk to life, that there isn't a further risk to property, our advice will remain to stay out of that area."" Some residents spent the night in evacuation centres Lincolnshire Police tweeted a map of the areas at risk of flooding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Environment Agency described the situation as ""unprecedented"" after 132mm (5.2in) of rain fell between Monday and Wednesday, with the Met Office predicting a further 20mm (0.79in) of rain during Saturday night and Sunday. The agency said about 100 properties in Wainfleet had flooded, and further properties could be affected. River levels were expected to remain very high for the next few days, it added. The town of Wainfleet in Lincolnshire was flooded on Wednesday Earlier, local Conservative MP Matt Warman praised the ""incredible"" multi-agency response to the flooding and offered ""a huge thank you"" to those involved.

Trans charity apologises for data breach,"A charity supporting transgender children and young people has issued an apology after thousands of emails were made public online. Mermaids UK said it was ""deeply sorry"" for what it called a ""historical data breach"" after it was first reported by theSunday Times,external. The paper claims the correspondence included ""intimate details"", names and addresses, but the charity denies this. Mermaids said it had taken immediate action and reported the breach. In an official statement,externalon the Mermaids UK website, the charity claimed that the emails were from 2016 and 2017, and that they were searchable only ""if certain precise search-terms were used"". It maintained there was ""no evidence"" the information had been retrieved by anyone other than the Sunday Times, or those contacted by their journalist. A Mermaids spokesperson told the BBC the emails were shared to a private group on a private messaging platform. They insisted that the 1,100 emails were between executives and trustees of the charity, discussing matters relating to their work. ""To be clear this is absolutely not Mermaids service users emailing each other, and their emails and private correspondence being available to an outside audience,"" the spokesperson said. The Times, however, reported that the emails contained ""intimate details of the vulnerable youngsters it seeks to help"". It said the emails could be found simply by typing in the charity name and its charity number. NSPCC explains Munroe Bergdorf decision Police investigation over 'misgendering' Mermaids UK stated it had notified the Information Commissioner's Office, the data protection watchdog, and contacted those affected. The Charity Commission had also been notified, it said, and an independent investigation into the breach would be launched. ""We're going to be employing a third party to oversee processes and advise on how we can improve internal practice,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. ""I think it's important to note that this dates back some two years when Mermaids was a smaller charity dealing with the first aggressive onslaught from those who are opposed to giving vulnerable transgender children and young people the safe spaces they need."" Mermaids UK was formed in 1995, and is the country's leading charity in services offering support around gender and identity to children and young people up to 20 years old. It recently received Â£500,000 from the National Lottery Community Fund.

Brexit: Where candidates stand,"Boris Johnson is the UK's new prime minister and will now begin the task of trying to deliver Brexit. The former foreign secretary has pledged the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, ""do or die"", accepting that a no-deal Brexit will happen if an agreement cannot be reached by then. He has called the withdrawal agreement ""dead"" but says he will ""take the bits that are serviceable and get them done"" - such as guaranteeing the rights of 3.2 million EU citizens in the UK. The withdrawal agreement (WA) is the deal negotiated by the UK government and the European Union (EU) to settle the basis on which the UK will leave. As part of it, the UK agreed to pay the EU a ""divorce bill"" (estimated to be Â£39bn), guarantee EU citizens' rights and sign up to the Irish backstop - an insurance policy designed to avoid a hard border in Ireland. The deal allowed for a transition period after Brexit, during which things like UK-EU trade would stay the same, while both sides worked out their future relationship. But the withdrawal agreement was rejected three times by MPs - leading to Theresa May's downfall. After Brexit, Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland could be in different customs and regulatory regimes, which might mean products being checked at the border. To avoid border posts (which some believe could threaten the peace process), Mrs May and the EU agreed on the backstop. In the event that no free trade deal was agreed that avoided a hard border, this insurance policy would effectively keep the UK and EU in a customs union. This proved controversial because it would stop the UK doing some of its own trade deals. Mr Johnson is saying the Irish border can be dealt with after the UK leaves the EU, instead of as part of the withdrawal agreement. Obstacle:The EU has said the Irish backstop cannot be removed from the withdrawal agreement - the deal to delay the UK's exit until the end of October specifically prohibited its renegotiation. If the UK leaves with no deal and seeks a free trade agreement, the EU has said it will not begin negotiations until the issue of the Irish border is settled. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) Boris Johnson wants to ditch the Irish backstop - he's called it ""a prison"". He has said there are ""abundant, abundant technical fixes"" to avoid checks at the border. He concedes there is ""no single magic bullet"" but points to a ""wealth of solutions"" instead. Obstacle:The UK and the EU have previously looked fortechnological solutions to the Irish borderwithout success. EU deputy chief negotiator Sabine Weyand said in January: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" There are ""alternative arrangements"" which could help: trusted trader schemes (where businesses are certified to make sure they meet certain standards) and ways of making customs declarations away from the border, but they wouldn't eliminate the need for checks altogether. After Brexit, the EU would still require inspections of things like animal and plant products entering its single market, and the new entry point to that market would be at the Irish border. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to withhold the money the UK has agreed to pay the EU and use it as a negotiating tool to get a better deal. Settling the UK's financial obligations (which include previously agreed contributions to the EU budget and funding things like EU staff pensions) was agreed by Theresa May as part of the withdrawal agreement. The figure for those obligations has been calculated at Â£39bn. Obstacle:The EU has said it will not start future trade talks until the issue of money (along with citizens' rights and the Irish border) is settled. Refusing to pay would almost certainly sour relations between the two,and could lead to a legal challenge from the EU. While accepting that a ""disruptive... badly handled"" no-deal Brexit would be costly, Mr Johnson said it was ""vanishingly inexpensive if you prepare"" and added that ""much of this work has been done"". Obstacle:Mr Johnson's view of the cost of a no-deal Brexit is at odds with the vast majority of economists, a significant number of his own backbenchers, and organisations such as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which calculates the government's forecasts for the economy.The OBR saidno deal would push the UK economy into recession. Mr Johnson has said he would mitigate the effects of no deal on the UK economy (which he admits would cause ""disruption"") by relying on a piece of trade law known as Article 24. He originally said this would allow the UK and the EU to have zero tariffs (taxes on imports) on trade while the two sides negotiated a trade deal. This would, in theory, help keep trade flowing and would stop the EU imposing tariffs on goods being imported from the UK (cars, for example, are subject to a 10% import tax from non-EU countries, and on agricultural produce it's even higher). Obstacle:Boris Johnson was wrong to sayArticle 24 would automatically allow for a standstill in trade relations, and indeed - when challenged in interviews - he later accepted that it would require the agreement of both sides. Also, Article 24 only covers the trade in goods (not services) and it does not cover non-tariff barriers such as regulations. The EU has ruled out signing any Article 24 agreement immediately after a no-deal Brexit.

He will become prime minister on 24 July and Parliament begins its summer recess the following day. A week later there will be a by-election and the rest of August will be pretty quiet, both in Westminster and Brussels. Parliament returns at the start of September but will take another recess later in the month for party conferences. On 17 October there will be a summit of EU leaders. Brexit is scheduled for 31 October, the day before the new European Commission takes office.

Who will choose UK's next PM?,"This video can not be played Who are the Conservative Party members? Conservative MPs may have whittled the contenders in the leadership race down to the final two - but it will not be politicians who will decide who gets to be the next prime minister. Instead it will be the party's grassroots members who will decide which of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson gets to succeed Theresa May. They will do so in a postal ballot, with the winner announced in the week beginning 22 July. In other words, it is members of the public - those who pay Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party - who get the final say on who leads the country. There will not be a general election because the party is already in power. So, who are the Conservative Party's members and what do they think on key issues, not least, of course, Brexit? The Conservative Party membership iscurrently thought to be around 160,000,external- a rise of more than 30,000 in the past 12 months. The last time official figures were released was in March 2018, when they put the figure at 124,000. Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? That is way down on the peak of nearly 3 million that the party boasted in the early 1950s. The Tories have far fewer members than the Labour Party. Even if we assume that Labour's membership has fallen from the late 2017 peak of more than 550,000, it still has a huge advantage over the Conservatives when it comes to campaigning on the ground. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? How much difference does going to a top US university make? The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role. They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before. From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties. On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties. It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file. So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male. Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65. They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west. So much for demography and geography.  What about ideology? Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole. On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. Laura Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmed Premiership in six charts The Theresa May story Certainly, grassroots Tories are socially conservative. Three-quarters of them believe, for instance, that young people today don't have enough respect for traditional values. Nearly six out of 10 support the death penalty. They are also conventionally right-wing on some aspects of economic policy. For example, only 15% of them believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. But on other issues they hold views that may be more unexpected. A third of Tory rank-and-file members believe that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation's wealth and that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. About half believe that big business takes advantage of ordinary people. Interestingly, they have also cooled on austerity. In the summer of 2015, some 55% said government spending cuts hadn't gone far enough, but two years later that had fallen to 28%. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit amid a backlash against Brexit plans What Tory members haven't cooled on, however, is Brexit. Indeed, since we started tracking them in 2015, they've hardened their position. It is clear that they are not supporters of the deal negotiated by Theresa May. In fact, it is now the case that fully two-thirds of them back a no-deal Brexit - an outcome supported by only a quarter of voters as a whole. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Nor are they in the least bit keen on the idea of letting the public have another say on the UK's EU membership. Some 84% of them oppose the idea of a new referendum on the issue. In short, the grassroots aren't simply sceptical on Europe; they can't wait to leave, whatever that might take. Furthermore, a breakdown of YouGov polling data suggests that the 30,000 or so members who have joined in the past year are even more likely to be pro-Brexit. This, then, is the Conservative Party electorate. And those MPs hoping to succeed Mrs May will need to pitch their promises accordingly.

"Teens attempt Cape-to-Cairo in homemade planeIt will take six weeks to cover the 12,000km route in a four-seater they assembled in three weeks.","Megan (R) is one of the pilots and Agnes (L) is flying as part of the support team An aircraft built by South African teenagers is being flown from Cape Town to Cairo - and has successfully made its first stop in Namibia. It will take six weeks to cover the 12,000km (7,455 miles) to Egypt. The four-seater Sling 4 plane was assembled by a group of 20 students from vastly different backgrounds. ""The purpose of the initiative is to show Africa that anything is possible if you set your mind to it,"" said 17-year-old pilot Megan Werner. Student gives birth and sits exams 30 minutes later Human urine bricks created by students Somalia's 13-year-old inventor finds fame The teenagers built the aircraft in three weeks, from a kit manufactured in South Africa by the Airplane Factory. The kit came with thousands of small parts that had to be assembled. ""Looking at the plane, I am so proud of myself, I can't believe what we've done. I feel like this is my baby. I cherish her,"" said Agnes Keamogetswe Seemela, a 15-year-old from Munsiville township in Gauteng province. ""It flies so smoothly and the views were breathtaking,"" she said of its maiden voyage, from Johannesburg to Cape Town, ahead of the official start of the trip. ""I was involved in putting together the centre fuselage as well as the horizontal and vertical stabilisers. And I also helped a bit with the wings."" The 15-year-old said she hoped her efforts would inspire others like her. ""At first, people in my community were shocked - they didn't believe me when I told them I helped build a plane which we will be flying from Cape Town to Cairo,"" she said. ""But now they're actually very proud of me."" It takes 3,000 man hours to assemble a Sling 4 plane It was 17-year-old Megan who started the project, and those who joined her U-Dream Global initiative were whittled down from more than 1,000 applicants. She was one of six in the group to have obtained a pilot's licence, and the six will share flying duties in their silver aircraft, which is emblazoned with maps of Africa on both wings together with sponsor's logos.

Teens attempt Cape-to-Cairo in homemade plane,"Megan (R) is one of the pilots and Agnes (L) is flying as part of the support team An aircraft built by South African teenagers is being flown from Cape Town to Cairo - and has successfully made its first stop in Namibia. It will take six weeks to cover the 12,000km (7,455 miles) to Egypt. The four-seater Sling 4 plane was assembled by a group of 20 students from vastly different backgrounds. ""The purpose of the initiative is to show Africa that anything is possible if you set your mind to it,"" said 17-year-old pilot Megan Werner. Student gives birth and sits exams 30 minutes later Human urine bricks created by students Somalia's 13-year-old inventor finds fame The teenagers built the aircraft in three weeks, from a kit manufactured in South Africa by the Airplane Factory. The kit came with thousands of small parts that had to be assembled. ""Looking at the plane, I am so proud of myself, I can't believe what we've done. I feel like this is my baby. I cherish her,"" said Agnes Keamogetswe Seemela, a 15-year-old from Munsiville township in Gauteng province. ""It flies so smoothly and the views were breathtaking,"" she said of its maiden voyage, from Johannesburg to Cape Town, ahead of the official start of the trip. ""I was involved in putting together the centre fuselage as well as the horizontal and vertical stabilisers. And I also helped a bit with the wings."" The 15-year-old said she hoped her efforts would inspire others like her. ""At first, people in my community were shocked - they didn't believe me when I told them I helped build a plane which we will be flying from Cape Town to Cairo,"" she said. ""But now they're actually very proud of me."" It takes 3,000 man hours to assemble a Sling 4 plane It was 17-year-old Megan who started the project, and those who joined her U-Dream Global initiative were whittled down from more than 1,000 applicants. She was one of six in the group to have obtained a pilot's licence, and the six will share flying duties in their silver aircraft, which is emblazoned with maps of Africa on both wings together with sponsor's logos. ""Getting a pilot's licence is equivalent to completing a degree - doing so when I had to study for my mid-year school exams wasn't easy,"" said Megan, who had her school-leaving exams in October to revise for, alongside her flight preparations.

Tory leader hopefuls clash over Brexit,"Channel 4 set up an empty podium for Boris Johnson, who declined to take part in the debate Contenders to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader have clashed over delivering Brexit during a TV debate. The MPs argued over whether a new deal could be renegotiated with the EU, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson came under fire for not taking part in the Channel 4 debate but defended his stance, suggesting it would ""be slightly cacophonous"". His leadership bid has been backed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who dropped out of the race on Friday. Some of the sharpest exchanges came over whether Parliament should be shut down - prorogued - in order to push through a no-deal Brexit by 31 October - something four of the five candidates argued against. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but EU leaders agreed to delay the date to October after MPs repeatedly rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Brexit: What happens next? What is Theresa May's withdrawal agreement? How to answer: 'What's your biggest weakness?' International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said proroguing Parliament was a ""deeply disturbing"" option and Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned ""you don't deliver democracy by trashing our democracy"". However ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab refused to rule it out, saying ""every time one of these candidates take an option awayâ¦ we weaken our chances of getting the best deal."" Channel 4's debate attracted an audience of 1.3 million and 7.8% of the audience share. The programme was up against Soccer Aid on ITV, Countryfile on BBC One and Top Gear on BBC Two. Analysisby BBC political correspondent Ben Wright No stand-out winner and a debate that won't trouble the absent front-runner Boris Johnson. His team thought there was nothing to be gained from pitching up for this blue-on-blue skirmish which was mostly good natured but repeatedly raised questions the candidates struggled to answer. How can the next prime minister renegotiate a deal with the EU? How can it be done by October? How could the UK leave without a deal if MPs refuse? At one end of the debate, Dominic Raab was rounded on for saying he would be prepared to try and suspend parliament if it was the only way to get the UK out without a deal at the end of October. In the opposite corner, Rory Stewart was the only one who said a renegotiation with the EU in the next four months was a fantasy promise. At some point this week one of the five will break out and become the challenger to Boris Johnson for the ballot of Tory members. The candidates at the debate before a studio audience in east London also argued over whether a no-deal Brexit should be considered. Mr Javid said no deal was the ""last thing"" he wanted, but added: ""You do plan for no deal precisely because you want a deal."" Mr Raab said Britain would be able to ""manage those risks"" associated with leaving the EU without a deal. However, Mr Stewart said ""I think a no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense,"" adding ""it would be deeply damaging for our economy."" The candidates were united in condemnation of the Labour leader with Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt accusing Jeremy Corbyn of being ""against aspiration"". Environment Secretary Michael Gove argued that he was the candidate Mr Corbyn would be most scared of facing at Prime Minister's Questions. Read more about where the candidates stand on Brexit Quick profiles: Who's in the running for the top job? The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister Mr Johnson, the front-runner in the leadership race, was represented at the debate by an empty lectern. And Mr Hunt attacked his failure to appear. ""Where's Boris?"" he asked, adding ""if his team won't allow him out with five fairly friendly colleagues, how is he going to deal with 27 European countries?"" Mr Stewart also made a pointed dig at his absent colleague, saying he hoped ""one of us"" - referring to the MPs who had attended the debate - becomes prime minister. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his time as London mayor add up? Speaking to Radio 4's World at One on Friday, Mr Johnson said he was ""pretty bewildered"" by claims he was dodging scrutiny and said the public had had ""quite a lot of blue-on-blue action, frankly, over the last three years"". He said the best time to take part was on Tuesday after the second ballot and would be at the BBC debate on Tuesday, hosted by Emily Maitlis. This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today says he'll be a ""unifying figure"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who withdrew from the leadership race after the first ballot - has backed Mr Johnson ""as the best candidate to unite the Conservative Party"" as has Esther McVey,who was eliminated in the first round. Writing inthe Times,external, Mr Hancock said Mr Johnson had a ""unique personality"", adding: ""I have confidence Boris will be a One Nation prime minister because that's how he ran London - consistently - for eight years."" Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today he was ""naturally disappointed"" that Mr Hancock had chosen to endorse his rival rather than himself. While Mr Johnson remained the frontrunner, Mr Gove said ""we need to make sure he is tested"" and he believed he could make it to the final two as a ""strong alternative"" who was equipped to ""be prime minister from day one"". The TV debate also saw politicians being asked about their priorities apart from Brexit. Mr Javid chose funding education and further education colleges, saying: ""We have cut back too much in that space."" Mr Raab said he wanted to improve state schools and offer more choices for young apprenticeships, while Mr Gove said children would be his top priority and emphasised the importance of protecting the environment for the future. Mr Hunt told the audience ""every Conservative has two desires: cut taxes and spend more on public services."" He also said he would focus on literacy and the social care system. Mr Stewart said his central priority would be fixing adult social care, describing the issue as ""the great unfinished revolution"". Asked about their weaknesses, Mr Gove said he was impatient, while Mr Raab said he was ""a restless soul"" who ""always wanted to make things better"". Mr Javid admitted to being stubborn while Mr Stewart said there were ""many things he didn't know about the world"". However, he added that ""we need leaders who listen"" and criticised ""macho posturing"". Mr Hunt joked that his biggest weakness was""getting my wife's nationality wrong""- but on a more serious note, said inhis battle with junior doctorsas health secretary, he could have been ""better at communicating"" what he was trying to do. The candidates will now go on to take part in further ballots until only two remain. The final pair will be put to a vote of the 160,000 members of the Conservative Party from 22 June. The winner is expected to be announced about four weeks later. Can Johnson deliver Brexit in 99 days?

No-deal Brexit explained,"The UK and the European Union have agreed to continue talks to try to reach a deal on their future relationship Even though ""major unresolved topics"" remain, both sides said it was important discussions continued. Failure to reach an agreement by 31 December would result in a no-deal Brexit. It would mean significant differences in the way we live and work. Prices could go upfor the goods the UK buys and sells from and to the EU. That's because the UK and EU would trade onWorld Trade Organization (WTO) terms- the basic rules for countries without trade deals. The EU would impose taxes (known as tariffs) on goods coming from the UK. The average is about 2.8% for non-agricultural products, but 10% for cars and more than 35% for dairy products. That would put some industries under pressure. With the UK alsoimposing tariffs on some EU goods,external- they could become more expensive. But the price of some things imported from the rest of the world could fall because their tariffs are being cut. Food standardsfor UK exports could also be a problem. Without agreement that UK rules are acceptable in the EU, produce being sold by the UK could be stopped at the border, causing delays. Long queues for lorriesare possible because there would bemore border checks. The UK is delaying having full checks for goods arriving from the EU until 1 July. But it is feared EU lorry drivers might want to avoid the UK altogether if there are long delays. Less choice of foodis a danger, according to some supermarket chains, who have said fresh food will be particularly affected. They might try to fly replacements in from elsewhere, but that would increase costs. Northern Irelandhas been the subject of separate talks on howan agreement to avoid a hard border would work. An agreement has been reached 'in principle', but a free trade deal would make new arrangements easier. But across the UK it's not just trade that would be affected by no deal, as further details were expected in other areas. Fishinghas beenparticularly importantduring the trade talks. Without a deal, non-UK fishing boats would lose access to UK waters and vice versa. It is feared there could be confrontations if boats try to continue to fish where they have traditionally done so. There are also concerns UK fish exports to the EU would be badly hit by tariffs. Co-operation on security and data-sharingwould become much more difficult, causing problems for cross-border investigations. The UK would immediately lose access to databases of things like fingerprints, criminal records and wanted persons. There arebig questions about services. The UK has been waiting for a decision about whether the EU will recognise UK rules for financial services. Without that it will be more difficult for UK firms to operate in the EU. Some banks have already moved offices and staff to EU countries. The supply of medicines could be vulnerableto disruption at Channel ports, with particular worries about those with a short shelf life. There are plans in placeto ensure coronavirus vaccines reach the UK. Talks separate to the main trade deal were also being worked on. They cover areas including: Healthcare:The government is in talks for a healthcare arrangement thatwould replace EHIC, which helps people in need of treatment in EU countries. Education:It was also in talks about the possibility of continuing to participate inErasmus, which helps students study in other countries. Driving:Talks are still going on about whether UK nationalswill need International Driving Permitsfor short visits to EU countries. And the European Commission is understood to be considering whether green cards to prove people have valid insurance are required. Pensions:There has not yet been an agreement for peopleclaiming their UK state pensions in an EU countrythat would mean their pensions increase every year. If the UK gets to the end of the year without a trade deal with the EU, that does not mean there will never be one. It has been suggested all the problems it would cause would focus minds on reaching a deal as soon as possible. But there are those on both sides who say it could be many months into 2021 before talks were to resume in this scenario. Whether or not there is a trade deal, several things will change on 1 January. Fortrips to Europe, you'll have to make sure there is at least six months left on your passport and wait in a different queue at the border. Duty free shoppingwill return, but there will be limits on the amount of alcohol and tobacco you can bring into the UK from the EU without paying extra duty. The right to live and work in the EUwill no longer be automatic for UK nationals, unless they already live in an EU country by the end of 2020. A new immigration systemwill come into force in the UK, involvinga points-based systemfor people wanting to work. Trade with the EUfor UK companies will involve customs declarations, extra border checks, certificates, licences and special labelling for some types of foods, plants and live animals. Correction 8 December: A previous version of this story said UK nationals would not need International Driving Permits in EU countries from 1 January next year.

The people who will choose the UK's next prime minister,"This video can not be played Who are the Conservative Party members? Conservative MPs may have whittled the contenders in the leadership race down to the final two - but it will not be politicians who will decide who gets to be the next prime minister. Instead it will be the party's grassroots members who will decide which of Jeremy Hunt and Boris Johnson gets to succeed Theresa May. They will do so in a postal ballot, with the winner announced in the week beginning 22 July. In other words, it is members of the public - those who pay Â£25 a year to join the Conservative Party - who get the final say on who leads the country. There will not be a general election because the party is already in power. So, who are the Conservative Party's members and what do they think on key issues, not least, of course, Brexit? The Conservative Party membership iscurrently thought to be around 160,000,external- a rise of more than 30,000 in the past 12 months. The last time official figures were released was in March 2018, when they put the figure at 124,000. Jeremy Hunt: What's his track record? Boris Johnson: What's his track record? That is way down on the peak of nearly 3 million that the party boasted in the early 1950s. The Tories have far fewer members than the Labour Party. Even if we assume that Labour's membership has fallen from the late 2017 peak of more than 550,000, it still has a huge advantage over the Conservatives when it comes to campaigning on the ground. More like this What do voters make of Brexit now? How much difference does going to a top US university make? The main parties have been punished How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Right now, however, none of that matters as much as the fact that those 160,000 or so rank-and-file members of the Conservative Party have a crucial role. They are going to be choosing the next prime minister of a country of over 65 million people - something which has never happened before. From studies of the 124,000 members that the party had in 2018, we know quite a lot about who they are and their beliefs. Most members of most parties in the UK are pretty middle-class. But Conservative Party members are the most middle-class of all: some 86% of them fall into the ABC1 category used by market researchers to describe the top social grade. Around a quarter of them are, or were, self-employed and nearly half of them work, or used to, in the private sector. Nearly four out of 10 put their annual income at over Â£30,000, and one in 20 put it at over Â£100,000. As such, Tory members are considerably better-off than most voters and, indeed, the members of other parties. On the other hand, the fact that 97% of Conservative Party members are white doesn't do much to distinguish them from their counterparts in other parties. It does inevitably mean, however, that ethnic minorities, who make up well over 10% of British people, are heavily under-represented in the Tory rank and file. So, too, are women. Other parties - notably Labour and the Greens, but also the SNP - now come close to gender balance, but seven out of 10 Conservative members are male. Tory members are also older than the members of most other parties. True, their average age may ""only"" be 57, but this disguises the fact that four out of 10 are over 65. They are concentrated in the southern half of England. Nearly 60% of Tory members live in London, the east, south-east and south-west. So much for demography and geography.  What about ideology? Well, not surprisingly, Tory Party members are more right-wing than the population as a whole. On a scale where zero represents very left-wing and 10 very right-wing, the average voter places themselves at the centre point. The average Conservative Party member places themselves at 7.6. Laura Kuenssberg: May was just overwhelmed Premiership in six charts The Theresa May story Certainly, grassroots Tories are socially conservative. Three-quarters of them believe, for instance, that young people today don't have enough respect for traditional values. Nearly six out of 10 support the death penalty. They are also conventionally right-wing on some aspects of economic policy. For example, only 15% of them believe that government should redistribute income from the better-off to those who are less well-off. But on other issues they hold views that may be more unexpected. A third of Tory rank-and-file members believe that ordinary working people do not get their fair share of the nation's wealth and that there is one law for the rich and one for the poor. About half believe that big business takes advantage of ordinary people. Interestingly, they have also cooled on austerity. In the summer of 2015, some 55% said government spending cuts hadn't gone far enough, but two years later that had fallen to 28%. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom quit amid a backlash against Brexit plans What Tory members haven't cooled on, however, is Brexit. Indeed, since we started tracking them in 2015, they've hardened their position. It is clear that they are not supporters of the deal negotiated by Theresa May. In fact, it is now the case that fully two-thirds of them back a no-deal Brexit - an outcome supported by only a quarter of voters as a whole. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Nor are they in the least bit keen on the idea of letting the public have another say on the UK's EU membership. Some 84% of them oppose the idea of a new referendum on the issue. In short, the grassroots aren't simply sceptical on Europe; they can't wait to leave, whatever that might take. Furthermore, a breakdown of YouGov polling data suggests that the 30,000 or so members who have joined in the past year are even more likely to be pro-Brexit. This, then, is the Conservative Party electorate. And those MPs hoping to succeed Mrs May will need to pitch their promises accordingly.

Hong Kong protest 'largest in 30 years',"This video can not be played Protests returned to Hong Kong streets following the suspension of the extradition bill Nearly two million people have taken part in a mass protest in Hong Kong against a controversial extradition bill, organisers say. If confirmed, it would be the largest protest in Hong Kong's history. Police said turnout was 338,000 at its peak. The masses turned out despite the suspension of the bill - which would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China - on Saturday. Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam on Sunday apologised for proposing the bill. Many protesters, who fear increased Chinese influence over Hong Kong, are calling on her to resign over the unrest. They are also demanding that the bill be scrapped, not just suspended. Meanwhile, supporters of Joshua Wong - the student leader who became the face of Hong Kong's  ""Umbrella Movement"" democracy protests five years ago - say he will be released from prison later on Monday. ""Today's march we had almost two million people,"" Jimmy Sham, from the Civil Human Rights Front protest group, told reporters late on Sunday evening. See the scale of the march in photos The protest was mainly peaceful, with police officers reportedly holding back to allow the throngs of people to slowly pass through the city. This contrasted to scenes at the last previous major demonstration on Wednesday, which saw clashes between protesters and police that injured dozens. Protesters have been demanding Carrie Lam's resignation The demonstration began early in the afternoon in Victoria Square, with many wearing black. Many held white flowers to mourn a protester who fell to his death on Saturday from a ledge, where hours earlier he had unfurled an anti-extradition banner. The progress of the march was slow, as the large numbers of people blocked many streets and crowded train stations. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As darkness fell, protesters started to take over major roads and crossings and surrounded the legislative council building. They carried placards that read ""The students did not riot"", in response to police labelling last Wednesday's student protests a riot - an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail. This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows the scale of Hong Kong protests on Sunday All you need to know about the protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained There was scepticism among some protesters about Ms Lam's decision to suspend the bill. ""Carrie Lam has ignored the feelings of Hong Kongers,"" Mr Ma, a 67-year-old protester, told the BBC. He said Ms Lam had ""acted like it was no big deal"" after a reported million people marched last week. ""Secondly, we are marching for the students who were brutally treated by the police. We need to get justice for them."" Chloe Yim, 20, who had joined the protests for the first time, said: ""If Carrie sees so many people come out, and still doesn't listen - she's being an autocrat who doesn't listen to people. Hong Kong people can't accept that."" Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong The government had hoped to reduce public anger by announcing a pause in the legislation on Saturday. That has patently failed, as even bigger numbers - close to two million, according to the organisers, took to the streets. For the chief executive, the demonstrations will have taken on a particularly personal bent, as protesters chanted ""Carrie Lam - resign!"" throughout during the day. The government is now trying to strike a conciliatory tone - in a statement, it said it understood the protesters' views ""have been made out of love and care for Hong Kong"". It promised the chief executive would adopt a more ""sincere and humble attitude"" towards public criticism. But this is too little, too late for many protesters, who insist they won't settle for anything less than the bill being completely withdrawn. The new face of the HK protests The scenes are reminiscent of 2003 - when half a million people protested against proposed national security legislation. The unpopular chief executive at the time, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned months later. But even if Ms Lam resigns, there's no guarantee that protesters will be satisfied with whoever replaces her - especially as, under Hong Kong's political system, the leader is elected by a small panel filled with allies of the Beijing government. Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. On Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Chinaâs history of extraordinary rendition Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? There were clashes and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police have been accused by some rights groups of excessive force. Much of the public anger has been directed at Ms Lam, the region's elected chief executive - who is firmly supported by Beijing. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests this week Part of that anger comes from a tearful address after Wednesday's violence in whichshe labelled the protests ""organised riots""â a label rejected by the hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters. Ms Lam remained hidden from public view for days, until her announcement on Saturday the she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". But she stopped short of saying the bill would be permanently shelved. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong On Sunday, she followed this up with a statement apologising for ""her government's work that has led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people"". This video can not be played Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy There has been speculation among analysts about Ms Lam's future amid the continued protests, but China's foreign ministry publicly backed her on Saturday. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War -which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China.It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs.

Activists try to board oil rig at sea,"The rig is being pursued by the Greenpeace ship Arctic Sunrise Greenpeace activists have made another attempt to board a drilling rig being towed in the North Sea. The rig was heading for an oil field east of Aberdeen after protesters delayed its departure from the Cromarty Firth for six days last week. Greenpeace said a fresh attempt to get on board was thwarted, but its protest ship Arctic Sunrise had now forced the rig to change course. BP accused the group of putting people at risk through its ""reckless"" actions. Greenpeace vows to stop rig reaching field Fourteen people - including three photographers - have been arrested since Greenpeace activists first boarded the Transocean rig in the Cromarty Firth a week ago. The structure was able to resume its journey to BP's Vorlich field, east of Aberdeen, on Friday night, following two police operations to remove the protesters. But Greenpeace vowed to continue efforts to halt its progress, and sent Arctic Sunrise in pursuit. Activists have been pursuing the rig at sea The group said it made a failed attempt to get activists back on board early on Sunday but later managed to overtake the rig which then made a ""U-turn"", heading back on its original track towards the Cromarty Firth. Commenting on the latest developments, Greenpeace UK executive director John Sauven made reference toan appeal by Pope Francis for the oil industry to recognise the threat posed by climate change. He said: ""Pope Francis is absolutely right about the climate emergency. We must take action to save future generations from a 'brutal injustice'. And we are. ""BP told the Pope on Friday that they want to find the answer to the climate problem. Wherever that answer may lie it's certainly not in drilling new wells to access 30 million barrels of oil at the bottom of the North Sea. ""This is why BP will face opposition wherever they plan to drill for more oil, from the North Sea to the Arctic and from the mouth of the Amazon to the Gulf of Mexico. ""We have tried letters, meetings, petitions - none of that worked. Now we're going to stand in BP's way to prevent further harm to people at the sharp end of the climate crisis."" BP has said it shared the group's concerns about climate change, but condemned its actions. A spokesperson said: ""Reckless attempts by Greenpeace protestors to interfere with the rig while under transport risk the safety not only of those individuals but anyone responding. ""There is also a clear and blatant breach of criminal law and the court orders in place against both Greenpeace and their vessel. Greenpeace is choosing to wilfully break the law.""

Tory leader hopefuls take part in TV debate,"Channel 4 set up an empty podium for Boris Johnson, who declined to take part in the debate Contenders to replace Theresa May as Conservative leader have clashed over delivering Brexit during a TV debate. The MPs argued over whether a new deal could be renegotiated with the EU, and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit. Boris Johnson came under fire for not taking part in the Channel 4 debate but defended his stance, suggesting it would ""be slightly cacophonous"". His leadership bid has been backed by Health Secretary Matt Hancock, who dropped out of the race on Friday. Some of the sharpest exchanges came over whether Parliament should be shut down - prorogued - in order to push through a no-deal Brexit by 31 October - something four of the five candidates argued against. The UK had been due to leave the EU on 29 March, but EU leaders agreed to delay the date to October after MPs repeatedly rejected Theresa May's Brexit deal. No-deal Brexit: What you need to know Brexit: What happens next? What is Theresa May's withdrawal agreement? How to answer: 'What's your biggest weakness?' International Development Secretary Rory Stewart said proroguing Parliament was a ""deeply disturbing"" option and Home Secretary Sajid Javid warned ""you don't deliver democracy by trashing our democracy"". However ex-Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab refused to rule it out, saying ""every time one of these candidates take an option awayâ¦ we weaken our chances of getting the best deal."" Channel 4's debate attracted an audience of 1.3 million and 7.8% of the audience share. The programme was up against Soccer Aid on ITV, Countryfile on BBC One and Top Gear on BBC Two. Analysisby BBC political correspondent Ben Wright No stand-out winner and a debate that won't trouble the absent front-runner Boris Johnson. His team thought there was nothing to be gained from pitching up for this blue-on-blue skirmish which was mostly good natured but repeatedly raised questions the candidates struggled to answer. How can the next prime minister renegotiate a deal with the EU? How can it be done by October? How could the UK leave without a deal if MPs refuse? At one end of the debate, Dominic Raab was rounded on for saying he would be prepared to try and suspend parliament if it was the only way to get the UK out without a deal at the end of October. In the opposite corner, Rory Stewart was the only one who said a renegotiation with the EU in the next four months was a fantasy promise. At some point this week one of the five will break out and become the challenger to Boris Johnson for the ballot of Tory members. The candidates at the debate before a studio audience in east London also argued over whether a no-deal Brexit should be considered. Mr Javid said no deal was the ""last thing"" he wanted, but added: ""You do plan for no deal precisely because you want a deal."" Mr Raab said Britain would be able to ""manage those risks"" associated with leaving the EU without a deal. However, Mr Stewart said ""I think a no-deal Brexit is a complete nonsense,"" adding ""it would be deeply damaging for our economy.""

""Where's Boris?"" he asked, adding ""if his team won't allow him out with five fairly friendly colleagues, how is he going to deal with 27 European countries?"" Mr Stewart also made a pointed dig at his absent colleague, saying he hoped ""one of us"" - referring to the MPs who had attended the debate - becomes prime minister. Do Boris Johnson's claims about his time as London mayor add up? Speaking to Radio 4's World at One on Friday, Mr Johnson said he was ""pretty bewildered"" by claims he was dodging scrutiny and said the public had had ""quite a lot of blue-on-blue action, frankly, over the last three years"". He said the best time to take part was on Tuesday after the second ballot and would be at the BBC debate on Tuesday, hosted by Emily Maitlis. This video can not be played Michael Gove tells Today says he'll be a ""unifying figure"" Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who withdrew from the leadership race after the first ballot - has backed Mr Johnson ""as the best candidate to unite the Conservative Party"" as has Esther McVey,who was eliminated in the first round.

Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today he was ""naturally disappointed"" that Mr Hancock had chosen to endorse his rival rather than himself. While Mr Johnson remained the frontrunner, Mr Gove said ""we need to make sure he is tested"" and he believed he could make it to the final two as a ""strong alternative"" who was equipped to ""be prime minister from day one"". The TV debate also saw politicians being asked about their priorities apart from Brexit. Mr Javid chose funding education and further education colleges, saying: ""We have cut back too much in that space."" Mr Raab said he wanted to improve state schools and offer more choices for young apprenticeships, while Mr Gove said children would be his top priority and emphasised the importance of protecting the environment for the future. Mr Hunt told the audience ""every Conservative has two desires: cut taxes and spend more on public services."" He also said he would focus on literacy and the social care system. Mr Stewart said his central priority would be fixing adult social care, describing the issue as ""the great unfinished revolution"". Asked about their weaknesses, Mr Gove said he was impatient, while Mr Raab said he was ""a restless soul"" who ""always wanted to make things better"". Mr Javid admitted to being stubborn while Mr Stewart said there were ""many things he didn't know about the world"". However, he added that ""we need leaders who listen"" and criticised ""macho posturing"". Mr Hunt joked that his biggest weakness was""getting my wife's nationality wrong""- but on a more serious note, said inhis battle with junior doctorsas health secretary, he could have been ""better at communicating"" what he was trying to do. The candidates will now go on to take part in further ballots until only two remain. The final pair will be put to a vote of the 160,000 members of the Conservative Party from 22 June.

Trump hits out again at Khan over London violence,"This video can not be played The US president and London mayor Sadiq Khan have been in a ""political grudge match"" for years US President Donald Trump has once again criticised London Mayor Sadiq Khan, calling him a ""national disgrace"" who is destroying the UK's capital. His comments came after five violent attacks in London in less than 24 hours left three men dead and three injured. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was ""absolutely awful"" Mr Trump was using the ""tragedy of people being murdered to attack the mayor"". Police have increased patrols in the capital following the attacks. President Trump's tweets followa long-running feud with Khan. Retweeting a post by right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins about this weekend's violence in London, the president said Mr Khan was ""a disaster"" and the capital needed a new mayor.

These three deaths take the total number of homicides in London in 2019 to 56. Official data shows that this time last year there had been 82 deaths - and 2018 was ultimately the worst year on record in the city for a decade. How do these figures compare to other places? Donald Trump's home city of New York is often regarded as a comparable city because it has a similar population and shares other characteristics too. Figures from the Metropolitan Police show 136 homicides were recorded in Greater London in 2018. That works out as a rate of approximately 1.5 killings for every 100,000 people who live in the capital. New York Police Department statistics show its per capita murder rate was twice as high. Month-by-month statistics can mislead because crimes don't occur at regular intervals - but this year's rate for New York is, so far, also double London's. New York is by no means the US's most dangerous city - there are many others which have far higher murder rates. Police have made 17 arrests - including several boys and a girl - following the five separate attacks. The first attack was on Friday afternoon in Wandsworth, south London, where an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death. Ten minutes later 19-year-old Eniola Aluko was shot dead in Plumstead, south-east London. Two teenagers have since beencharged with the murderof the man in Wandsworth, while five people have been arrested on suspicion of Mr Aluko's murder. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims A man in his 30s died after he wasstabbed in Tower Hamletson Saturday afternoon. In the early hours of Saturday two men were stabbed in Clapham and another was stabbed in Brixton. Eniola Aluko, from Thamesmead, was the second of three killings in London in the space of 24 hours Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matthew Twist, from the Metropolitan Police, said: ""The circumstances, causes and motives for any homicide or serious violence incident are different and unique, and require different investigative strategies and approaches. ""But we are taking a service-wide response and all officers right across London continue to be relentless in our pursuit of those who bring violence to our communities."" Police at the scene of a fatal stabbing in Tower Hamlets President Trump and Mr Khan have clashed many times in the past. The president called Mr Khan a ""stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London"" shortly before landing in Stansted ahead of his three-day state visit to the UK earlier this month. It followed comments from the mayor of London that the UK should not be ""rolling out the red carpet"" for Mr Trump during his visit.

Hong Kong protesters in major new march,"This video can not be played Hong Kong protests: Thousands march against extradition bill Hundreds of thousands of people are protesting in Hong Kong against a controversial extradition bill, despite the bill having been suspended. The densely-packed crowds are demanding that the bill - which would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China - be completely scrapped. The region's leader, Carrie Lam, on Sunday apologised for causing ""disputes in society"" over the bill. A day earlier she delayed the bill plans after mass protests this week. Many protesters, who fear increased Chinese influence over Hong Kong, are calling on Ms Lam to resign over the unrest. The protests have so far remained peaceful, in contrast to the previous major demonstration on Wednesday which saw clashes between protesters and police that injured dozens. By early Sunday afternoon, large crowds had gathered in the city's Victoria Square, many wearing black or carrying white flowers. Organisers said they hoped more than a million people would attend, though no formal estimates of the crowd have yet been made. Many of the protesters have been demanding Carrie Lam's resignation The progress of the march was slow, as the large numbers of people blocked many streets and crowded train stations. Many held white flowers to mourn a protester who fell to his death on Saturday from a ledge, where hours earlier he had unfurled an anti-extradition banner. Allow Twitter content?

As darkness fell, protesters started to take over major roads and crossings and surrounded the legislative council building. They carried placards that read ""the students did not riot"", in response to police labelling Wednesday's student protests a riot - an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail. All you need to know about the protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained There was scepticism among some protesters about Ms Lam's decision to suspend the bill. ""Carrie Lam has ignored the feelings of Hong Kongers,"" Mr Ma, a 67-year-old protester, told the BBC. He said Ms Lam had ""acted like it was no big deal"" after a reported million people marched last week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Secondly, we are marching for the students who were brutally treated by the police. We need to get justice for them."" Chloe Yim, 20, who had joined the protests for the first time, said: ""If Carrie sees so many people come out, and still doesn't listen - she's being an autocrat who doesn't listen to people. Hong Kong people can't accept that."" Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong The government had hoped to reduce public anger by announcing a pause in the legislation on Saturday. That has patently failed, as at least hundreds of thousands took to the streets again. For the chief executive, the demonstrations will have taken on a particularly personal bent, as protesters chanted ""Carrie Lam - resign!"" throughout during the day. The government is now trying to strike a conciliatory tone - in a statement, it said it understood the protesters views ""have been made out of love and core for Hong Kong"". It promised the chief executive would adopt a more ""sincere and humble attitude"" towards public criticism. But this is too little, too late for many protesters, who insist they won't settle for anything less than the bill being completely withdrawn. The scenes are reminiscent of 2003 - when half a million people protested against proposed national security legislation. The unpopular chief executive at the time, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned months later. But even if Ms Lam resigns, there's no guarantee that protesters will be satisfied with whoever replaces her - especially as, under Hong Kong's political system, the leader is elected by a small panel filled with allies of the Beijing government. Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. On Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Chinaâs history of extraordinary rendition Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? There were clashes and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police have been accused by some rights groups of excessive force. Much of the public anger has been directed at Ms Lam, the region's elected chief executive - who is firmly supported by Beijing. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests this week Part of that anger comes from a tearful address after Wednesday's violence in whichshe labelled the protests ""organised riots""â a label rejected by the hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters. Ms Lam remained hidden from public view for days, until her announcement on Saturday the she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". But she stopped short of saying the bill would be permanently shelved. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong On Sunday, she followed this up with a statement apologising for ""her government's work that has led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people"". This video can not be played Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy There has been speculation among analysts about Ms Lam's future amid the continued protests, but China's foreign ministry publicly backed her on Saturday. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War -which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China.It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs.

Hundreds spend night away from flood town,"High volume pumps are being used to try and reduce water levels High volume pumps are being used to lower water levels in a flooded Lincolnshire town. More than 580 homes in and around Wainfleet were evacuated amid concerns about flood defences. Dozens of people spent the night away from their homes in emergency centres. The town flooded on Wednesday after two months' worth of rain fell in two days and the banks of the River Steeping broke its banks. Steve Hardy and his wife, who stayed at the Coronation Hall in Wainfleet overnight, said he initially refused to leave his house when officials knocked on his door. ""I said 'well we don't really want to'. ""Then when he said 'well look it's going to be hard work for us if we have to come and get you' and I don't want to put anybody's life at risk. So that was it."" Lincolnshire Police has issued a request for people in the town not to use washing machines, toilets or showers. It said public toilets were being set up in Market Place and Brewster Lane and residents could use the showers at nearby Skegness Leisure Centre. RAF helicopters dropped almost 400 tonnes of ballast to plug a gap in the River Steeping RAF Chinook helicopters, aided by troops on the ground, have placed an additional 76 tonnes of sand and ballast on top of the 270 tonnes dropped on Friday in an attempt to reinforce and plug a breach in the River Steeping's banks. Ch Insp Phil Vickers, from Lincolnshire Police, said that it was important to reduce the river's levels. ""The Environment Agency have got some high volume pumps that are in place,"" he said. ""We're hoping they will assist us in clearing the water from the channel and from the area surrounding. ""Until we're satisfied that there isn't a risk to life, that there isn't a further risk to property, our advice will remain to stay out of that area."" Some residents spent the night in evacuation centres Lincolnshire Police tweeted a map of the areas at risk of flooding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The agency said about 100 properties in Wainfleet had flooded, and further properties could be affected. River levels were expected to remain very high for the next few days, it added. The town of Wainfleet in Lincolnshire was flooded on Wednesday Earlier, local Conservative MP Matt Warman praised the ""incredible"" multi-agency response to the flooding and offered ""a huge thank you"" to those involved.

His comments came after five violent attacks in London in less than 24 hours left three men dead and three injured. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said it was ""absolutely awful"" Mr Trump was using the ""tragedy of people being murdered to attack the mayor"". Police have increased patrols in the capital following the attacks. President Trump's tweets followa long-running feud with Khan. Retweeting a post by right-wing commentator Katie Hopkins about this weekend's violence in London, the president said Mr Khan was ""a disaster"" and the capital needed a new mayor.

These three deaths take the total number of homicides in London in 2019 to 56. Official data shows that this time last year there had been 82 deaths - and 2018 was ultimately the worst year on record in the city for a decade. How do these figures compare to other places? Donald Trump's home city of New York is often regarded as a comparable city because it has a similar population and shares other characteristics too. Figures from the Metropolitan Police show 136 homicides were recorded in Greater London in 2018. That works out as a rate of approximately 1.5 killings for every 100,000 people who live in the capital. New York Police Department statistics show its per capita murder rate was twice as high. Month-by-month statistics can mislead because crimes don't occur at regular intervals - but this year's rate for New York is, so far, also double London's. New York is by no means the US's most dangerous city - there are many others which have far higher murder rates. Police have made 17 arrests - including several boys and a girl - following the five separate attacks. The first attack was on Friday afternoon in Wandsworth, south London, where an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death. Ten minutes later 19-year-old Eniola Aluko was shot dead in Plumstead, south-east London. Two teenagers have since beencharged with the murderof the man in Wandsworth, while five people have been arrested on suspicion of Mr Aluko's murder. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims A man in his 30s died after he wasstabbed in Tower Hamletson Saturday afternoon. In the early hours of Saturday two men were stabbed in Clapham and another was stabbed in Brixton. Eniola Aluko, from Thamesmead, was the second of three killings in London in the space of 24 hours Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matthew Twist, from the Metropolitan Police, said: ""The circumstances, causes and motives for any homicide or serious violence incident are different and unique, and require different investigative strategies and approaches. ""But we are taking a service-wide response and all officers right across London continue to be relentless in our pursuit of those who bring violence to our communities."" Police at the scene of a fatal stabbing in Tower Hamlets President Trump and Mr Khan have clashed many times in the past. The president called Mr Khan a ""stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London"" shortly before landing in Stansted ahead of his three-day state visit to the UK earlier this month. It followed comments from the mayor of London that the UK should not be ""rolling out the red carpet"" for Mr Trump during his visit.

"Trans charity apologises for data breachMermaids UK published thousands of emails containing confidential information, reports suggest.UK","A charity supporting transgender children and young people has issued an apology after thousands of emails were made public online. Mermaids UK said it was ""deeply sorry"" for what it called a ""historical data breach"" after it was first reported by theSunday Times,external. The paper claims the correspondence included ""intimate details"", names and addresses, but the charity denies this. Mermaids said it had taken immediate action and reported the breach. In an official statement,externalon the Mermaids UK website, the charity claimed that the emails were from 2016 and 2017, and that they were searchable only ""if certain precise search-terms were used"". It maintained there was ""no evidence"" the information had been retrieved by anyone other than the Sunday Times, or those contacted by their journalist. A Mermaids spokesperson told the BBC the emails were shared to a private group on a private messaging platform. They insisted that the 1,100 emails were between executives and trustees of the charity, discussing matters relating to their work. ""To be clear this is absolutely not Mermaids service users emailing each other, and their emails and private correspondence being available to an outside audience,"" the spokesperson said. The Times, however, reported that the emails contained ""intimate details of the vulnerable youngsters it seeks to help"". It said the emails could be found simply by typing in the charity name and its charity number. NSPCC explains Munroe Bergdorf decision Police investigation over 'misgendering' Mermaids UK stated it had notified the Information Commissioner's Office, the data protection watchdog, and contacted those affected. The Charity Commission had also been notified, it said, and an independent investigation into the breach would be launched. ""We're going to be employing a third party to oversee processes and advise on how we can improve internal practice,"" the spokesperson told the BBC. ""I think it's important to note that this dates back some two years when Mermaids was a smaller charity dealing with the first aggressive onslaught from those who are opposed to giving vulnerable transgender children and young people the safe spaces they need."" Mermaids UK was formed in 1995, and is the country's leading charity in services offering support around gender and identity to children and young people up to 20 years old. It recently received Â£500,000 from the National Lottery Community Fund.

The mayor saidhe would not rise to Donald Trump's ""beastly"" accusation that he had done ""a terrible job"" following the London terror attacks.

This video can not be played The moment Trump lands for UK state visit By BBC Assistant Political Editor Norman Smith I would like to say I am surprised, but I am not because we know Trump has no regard for normal diplomatic niceties. He seems to have got stuck in to Sadiq Khan. I am also not surprised because these two figures loathe each other. This is a political grudge match which has been simmering now for three years, back from when the president introduced that travel ban on some Muslim countries. Protests at Mr Trump's visit, including a ""national demonstration"" in Trafalgar Square, are planned for central London.

McVey backs Johnson as next Tory leader,"Former Conservative leadership contender Esther McVey has thrown her support behind Boris Johnson's bid. Ms McVey - eliminated in the first ballot - toldthe Sunday Telegraph,externalshe was backing him because he had promised to deliver Brexit by 31 October. Mr Johnson is the clear frontrunner to replace Theresa May but his rivals have insisted they will not drop out. He is the only one of the six remaining candidates who will not take part in the first TV debate on Channel 4 later. His team reportedly have reservations about its proposed format, but Mr Johnsonhas agreed to take part in the BBC's debateon Tuesday. 'No coronation' for Tory leader, say candidates Johnson's success leaves him vulnerable The UK's next prime minister: What you need to know BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was ""intense arm-twisting and lobbying under way"" ahead of the second ballot of Tory MPs on Tuesday. He said Health Secretary Matt Hancock,who pulled out of the leadership race on Friday,was understood to be considering whether to back Mr Johnson or Michael Gove. Mr Gove finished third in round one behind Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, but hastold the Sunday Times,externalhe is the ""comeback kid"". The environment secretary also said he would be happy to serve under Mr Johnson, whose leadership bid he scuppered in 2016. ""I would absolutely work with Boris in any way that he wanted to work with me,"" he said. ""No question. It is a different time requiring a different approach."" Mr Hunt insisted he had still not given up hope of winning in the final postal ballot of party members, despite being a distant second to Mr Johnson in the first round. ""I am the insurgent in this race,""he told The Mail on Sunday.,external ""I am in it to win it because we have to give the country better choices given the crisis that we're in now."" This video can not be played Tory leadership: Rivals insist there must be no 'coronation' for Boris Home Secretary Sajid Javid said voters were looking for a ""change"" - something only he and Mr Johnson offered. He told the Sunday Times:,external""We need change. And Boris is change. But I'm change too. And there are only two change candidates in the remaining six - and that's Boris and me."" He also took a swipe at Mr Hunt, who he said was ""an asset to the party"" but didn't represent change. Meanwhile fellow contender, Rory Stewart, responded to a Sunday Times headline saying that the leadership rivals were eyeing cabinet roles under Mr Johnsonby tweeting:,external""This may be true of some contenders but it isn't true of me."" The international development secretary added: ""I want to give members and the public a real choice of two quite different futures for the Conservative party. I don't want to be in a Boris cabinet."" Esther McVey is the latest MP to get behind Boris Johnson's leadership campaign Mr Johnson gained 114 votes in the first ballot- more than double his nearest rival, Mr Hunt. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Ms McVey said she would ""wholeheartedly support"" Mr Johnson after he agreed to incorporate aspects of her ""blue-collar conservatism"" ideas - such as investing money into public services - into his plans for government. She added: ""He has promised to deliver Brexit on 31 October, deal or no deal, and has shown time and time again that he is a dynamic leader, capable of building a strong team around him that will deliver on his promises. ""Our country is crying out for strong, optimistic leadership and Boris is the man best equipped to take us out of the EU.""

Fury impresses with Schwarz stoppage,"This video can not be played Tyson Fury: I'm a chubby guy who comes to have fun Britain's Tyson Fury produced a ruthless display to stop previously undefeated heavyweight Tom Schwarz in the second round in Las Vegas. Fury, wearing shorts with the American stars and stripes, entered the ring to James Brown's Living in America. Fury, 30, backed Schwarz to the ropes in the second, driving a right hand home to drop the German to the floor. Seconds later, with Schwarz bloodied and under attack, his corner threw in the towel as the bout was waved off. ""I got a big man out of there by switching it up. He caught me with a couple but you can't go swimming and not get wet,"" said Fury, who now has 28 wins and a draw on his record. ""I came here to have fun and enjoy myself. I don't take it too seriously. I thought I put on a good show and the fans got what they paid for."" I'll beat Wilder in biggest fight in world boxing - Fury Photos: Fury goes all Apollo Creed on winning Vegas debut 5 Live Boxing podcast: Fury puts on a show Fury walked to the ring in US colours after taking off an all-black robe This was Fury's first outing since his controversial draw with WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in Los Angeles in December. There will be many who feel 25-year-old Schwarz was over-matched, with British heavyweight Dillian Whyte quick to label the German a ""chump"" and the fight ""a joke"". But this was billed as a showcase bout for Fury in what was his first contest of a lucrative deal with ESPN. The marketing of the former world heavyweight champion was there for all to see as he took off a black robe during his MGM Grand ring walk to reveal the US stars and stripes on a second gown. This was all about enhancing his profile to the American market and the five minutes and 54 seconds of boxing that followed did no harm to the undefeated Briton's future earning power or damage his hopes of a rematch with Wilder. In round one he pinged a sharp jab through the underdog's defence and threw smart hooks around the guard, with Schwarz walking forward gamely but landing little against the evasive 6ft 9in Fury frame. Fury had little difficulty in breaking through the Schwarz guard And in the second, Fury showed his abundant ring craft when he willingly retreated to a corner before landing a left hook while swivelling out of the tight space to open up an attack. It was the beginning of the end as seconds later he thrust a right hand into Schwarz's face, forcing a knockdown which was quickly followed by the conclusion as Schwarz stood a static target with shots raining in on him. Fury was handed the microphone and - just as he did after ripping the IBF, WBA and WBO world titles from Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 - opted to sing Aerosmith hit I Don't Want to Miss a Thing. ""Tonight was great, I will enjoy it,"" he added. ""We will get deals done, get another fight in and then we fight Wilder next year."" Warrington beats Galahad to retain world title Briedis elbows way to controversial world title Former world heavyweight champion Joseph Parker said this was ""just the beginning"" for Fury in America Fury's win came two weeks after fellow Briton Anthony Joshua lost the IBF, WBA and WBO titles in a shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr at Madison Square Garden. Despite a late flurry of money being placed on Schwarz, who was previously unbeaten in 24 bouts, the German never looked like he could spring a similar surprise. Instead, ringside celebrities such as singer Robbie Williams, chef Gordon Ramsay and former baseball star Alex Rodriguez witnessed a dismantling by Fury. It has been a whirlwind 12 months since he returned to the sport after battles with drugs, alcohol and depression which saw him give up his WBA and WBO titles, having already been stripped of the IBF belt because of failing to fight the mandatory challenger. It appears a rematch with WBC champion Wilder is his main focus but another fight will come first, either on 21 September or 5 October, with his US promoter Bob Arum stating this week that New York's Madison Square Garden was provisionally booked. A meeting with Wilder should therefore happen early in 2020. ""Wilder's team want to make it happen,"" said Fury's promoter Frank Warren. ""Everybody wants to make it happen and it will happen."" If Fury and Wilder do meet again it will likely follow Joshua's proposed rematch with Ruiz, meaning the heavyweight landscape may well have changed once more. After his win Fury said his Las Vegas bout felt like ""my coming out party"". He now appears to have US backing, momentum and the necessary focus to ensure he is in the mix for what could be a captivating period in the division. Fury sang in the ring afterwards and also at his post-fight news conference Former world heavyweight champion Joseph Parker on BBC Radio 5 Live:""What a statement. I know Schwarz is not of the same class of Fury's last opponents but he was game and did his best. ""Fury has made a big impact in the UK but from this fight he is also going to make a huge impact in the United States. A lot of people are drawn to him because he is so charismatic. ""He is very good at speaking and brings a lot more to fight night than just boxing. This is just the beginning."" BBC Radio 5 Live commentator Mike Costello:""That was a brilliant statement from Tyson Fury. He was so aggressive, pinpoint with his punches and fighting on the front foot. It's another win and he remains on course to win another version of the world heavyweight title."" British heavyweight Dillian Whyte:""Can't believe I stayed to watch that joke of a fight. Tyson Fury should be ashamed of himself running away from me and fighting these chumps. My mother would have knocked out Tom the bum in a round.""

Hundreds spend night away from flood townPeople are warned they may need to stay out of their homes in Lincolnshire for up to 48 hours.Lincolnshire,"High volume pumps are being used to try and reduce water levels High volume pumps are being used to lower water levels in a flooded Lincolnshire town. More than 580 homes in and around Wainfleet were evacuated amid concerns about flood defences. Dozens of people spent the night away from their homes in emergency centres. The town flooded on Wednesday after two months' worth of rain fell in two days and the banks of the River Steeping broke its banks. Steve Hardy and his wife, who stayed at the Coronation Hall in Wainfleet overnight, said he initially refused to leave his house when officials knocked on his door. ""I said 'well we don't really want to'. ""Then when he said 'well look it's going to be hard work for us if we have to come and get you' and I don't want to put anybody's life at risk. So that was it."" Lincolnshire Police has issued a request for people in the town not to use washing machines, toilets or showers. It said public toilets were being set up in Market Place and Brewster Lane and residents could use the showers at nearby Skegness Leisure Centre. RAF helicopters dropped almost 400 tonnes of ballast to plug a gap in the River Steeping RAF Chinook helicopters, aided by troops on the ground, have placed an additional 76 tonnes of sand and ballast on top of the 270 tonnes dropped on Friday in an attempt to reinforce and plug a breach in the River Steeping's banks. Ch Insp Phil Vickers, from Lincolnshire Police, said that it was important to reduce the river's levels. ""The Environment Agency have got some high volume pumps that are in place,"" he said. ""We're hoping they will assist us in clearing the water from the channel and from the area surrounding. ""Until we're satisfied that there isn't a risk to life, that there isn't a further risk to property, our advice will remain to stay out of that area."" Some residents spent the night in evacuation centres Lincolnshire Police tweeted a map of the areas at risk of flooding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Illegal eel export dealers exposedInternational buyers offered high prices for eels caught on the River Severn in Gloucestershire.Gloucestershire,"European eels are one of the UK's most endangered species Dealers looking to illegally export European eels from the UK have been exposed by BBC Countryfile. Posing as a UK fisherman who had legally caught the eels on the River Severn in Gloucestershire, presenter Joe Crowley was approached by Chinese and Russian buyers and a UK exporter. They were prepared to pay up to seven times the normal catch price if the eels could be sent out of the EU. An export ban on the endangered species has been in place since 2010. Organised crime gangs are said to be smuggling about 350 million live baby eels - or 'glass' eels - every year to Asia, where they are farmed and sold as a delicacy. Andrew Kerr, of the Sustainable Eel Group said the illegal trade in glass eels, also known as elvers, was estimated to be worth about Â£3bn a year. Mr Kerr told the BBC: ""It's the most trafficked animal by number and by value. The Sustainable Eel Group's Andrew Kerr said the illegal trade was estimated to be worth about Â£3bn a year ""It leaves here at one Euro each and then one year later, having been grown in the 900 eel farms of inland China, it's worth 10 Euros - and that's pretty tempting. ""This is the greatest wildlife crime on the planet."" The illegal trade has previously been focused on stocks in France and Spain but now smugglers have turned their attention to the UK, where glass eels can only be caught by licensed fishermen. Countryfile's investigations team posted an advert on an online trading website, offering live eels caught in the River Severn for sale. One buyer from China offered more than Â£1,000 per kilo for the eels to be shipped to Malaysia, despite acknowledging that the export would be illegal. The current price for eels bought and sold legitimately within the EU is about Â£150 per kilo. Another buyer from Russia asked for the catch to be sent to Lithuania legally where he would then arrange for the eels to be moved over the border to Russia. The team was also approached by a UK-based commodities trader who said he had a client in Asia who was looking for glass eels to be exported to South Korea. When later confronted, he said he knew that it was illegal to export eels, that he did not have a buyer in South Korea and that he was only ""speculating"". Ian Guildford of the National Wildlife Crime Unit described it as a ""major crime"" He added that he had never exported glass eels and had no intention of doing so. Since the 1970s, the numbers of eels reaching Europe is thought to have declined by about 90%. Today they are protected as an endangered species by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). They are also named on the International Union for Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. But campaigners are concerned that a lack of monitoring is allowing glass eels to be moved between EU member states and beyond, with few traceability checks enforced or records kept. Ian Guildford, of the National Wildlife Crime Unit, said it was often hard to convince other enforcement agencies to take the crime seriously. He said: ""This is major crime and, once we can get people to understand the severity of the problem, then we might get somewhere.""

Hong Kong protesters gather for new mass rally,"This video can not be played Hong Kong protests: Thousands march against extradition bill Hundreds of thousands of people are protesting in Hong Kong against a controversial extradition bill, despite the bill having been suspended. The densely-packed crowds are demanding that the bill - which would allow extradition from Hong Kong to mainland China - be completely scrapped. The region's leader, Carrie Lam, on Sunday apologised for causing ""disputes in society"" over the bill. A day earlier she delayed the bill plans after mass protests this week. Many protesters, who fear increased Chinese influence over Hong Kong, are calling on Ms Lam to resign over the unrest. The protests have so far remained peaceful, in contrast to the previous major demonstration on Wednesday which saw clashes between protesters and police that injured dozens. By early Sunday afternoon, large crowds had gathered in the city's Victoria Square, many wearing black or carrying white flowers. Organisers said they hoped more than a million people would attend, though no formal estimates of the crowd have yet been made. Many of the protesters have been demanding Carrie Lam's resignation The progress of the march was slow, as the large numbers of people blocked many streets and crowded train stations. Many held white flowers to mourn a protester who fell to his death on Saturday from a ledge, where hours earlier he had unfurled an anti-extradition banner. Allow Twitter content?

As darkness fell, protesters started to take over major roads and crossings and surrounded the legislative council building. They carried placards that read ""the students did not riot"", in response to police labelling Wednesday's student protests a riot - an offence punishable by up to 10 years in jail. All you need to know about the protests Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained There was scepticism among some protesters about Ms Lam's decision to suspend the bill. ""Carrie Lam has ignored the feelings of Hong Kongers,"" Mr Ma, a 67-year-old protester, told the BBC. He said Ms Lam had ""acted like it was no big deal"" after a reported million people marched last week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Secondly, we are marching for the students who were brutally treated by the police. We need to get justice for them."" Chloe Yim, 20, who had joined the protests for the first time, said: ""If Carrie sees so many people come out, and still doesn't listen - she's being an autocrat who doesn't listen to people. Hong Kong people can't accept that."" Analysis by Helier Cheung, BBC News, Hong Kong The government had hoped to reduce public anger by announcing a pause in the legislation on Saturday. That has patently failed, as at least hundreds of thousands took to the streets again. For the chief executive, the demonstrations will have taken on a particularly personal bent, as protesters chanted ""Carrie Lam - resign!"" throughout during the day. The government is now trying to strike a conciliatory tone - in a statement, it said it understood the protesters views ""have been made out of love and core for Hong Kong"". It promised the chief executive would adopt a more ""sincere and humble attitude"" towards public criticism. But this is too little, too late for many protesters, who insist they won't settle for anything less than the bill being completely withdrawn. The scenes are reminiscent of 2003 - when half a million people protested against proposed national security legislation. The unpopular chief executive at the time, Tung Chee-hwa, resigned months later. But even if Ms Lam resigns, there's no guarantee that protesters will be satisfied with whoever replaces her - especially as, under Hong Kong's political system, the leader is elected by a small panel filled with allies of the Beijing government. Hong Kong is a former British colony, but was returned to Chinese rule in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" deal that guarantees it a level of autonomy. The government had argued the proposed extradition bill would ""plug the loopholes"" so that the city would not be a safe haven for criminals, following a murder case in Taiwan. This video can not be played The BBC's Helier Cheung on Hong Kong's 2019 protests Critics have said the legislation would expose people in Hong Kong to China's deeply flawed justice system and lead to further erosion of the city's judicial independence. Many fear the law could be used to target political opponents of the Chinese state. A large-scale march, which organisers said drew more than one million people, was held last Sunday. On Wednesday tens of thousands gathered to blockade streets around government headquarters to try to stop the second reading, or debate, of the extradition bill. Chinaâs history of extraordinary rendition Will the bill damage Hong Kong's star status? There were clashes and 22 police and 60 protesters were injured. Authorities say 11 people were arrested. The police have been accused by some rights groups of excessive force. Much of the public anger has been directed at Ms Lam, the region's elected chief executive - who is firmly supported by Beijing. This video can not be played How Hong Kong demonstrators organised protests this week Part of that anger comes from a tearful address after Wednesday's violence in whichshe labelled the protests ""organised riots""â a label rejected by the hundreds of thousands of peaceful protesters. Ms Lam remained hidden from public view for days, until her announcement on Saturday the she had heard the calls for her government to ""pause and think"". But she stopped short of saying the bill would be permanently shelved. Profile: Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong On Sunday, she followed this up with a statement apologising for ""her government's work that has led to substantial controversies and disputes in society, causing disappointment and grief among the people"". This video can not be played Carrie Lam expressed 'deep sorrow' over extradition law controversy There has been speculation among analysts about Ms Lam's future amid the continued protests, but China's foreign ministry publicly backed her on Saturday. Hong Kong was a British colony from 1841, when China ceded the island to the British after the First Opium War -which had erupted over British traders smuggling opium into China.It remained a colony until sovereignty was returned to China in 1997. It is now part of China under a ""one country, two systems"" principle, which ensures that it keeps its own judicial independence, its own legislature and economic system. Beijing's struggle to win Hong Kong's young hearts The Hong Kong handover in a nutshell A timeline of Hong Kong's history It is what China calls a special administrative region - enjoying a great deal of autonomy that has made it a key business and media hub in the region. But it remains subject to pressure from mainland China, and Beijing remains responsible for defence and foreign affairs.

These three deaths take the total number of homicides in London in 2019 to 56. Official data shows that this time last year there had been 82 deaths - and 2018 was ultimately the worst year on record in the city for a decade. How do these figures compare to other places? Donald Trump's home city of New York is often regarded as a comparable city because it has a similar population and shares other characteristics too. Figures from the Metropolitan Police show 136 homicides were recorded in Greater London in 2018. That works out as a rate of approximately 1.5 killings for every 100,000 people who live in the capital. New York Police Department statistics show its per capita murder rate was twice as high. Month-by-month statistics can mislead because crimes don't occur at regular intervals - but this year's rate for New York is, so far, also double London's. New York is by no means the US's most dangerous city - there are many others which have far higher murder rates. Police have made 17 arrests - including several boys and a girl - following the five separate attacks. The first attack was on Friday afternoon in Wandsworth, south London, where an 18-year-old man was stabbed to death. Ten minutes later 19-year-old Eniola Aluko was shot dead in Plumstead, south-east London. Two teenagers have since beencharged with the murderof the man in Wandsworth, while five people have been arrested on suspicion of Mr Aluko's murder. Ten charts on the rise of knife crime Killed in 2019: The UK's first 100 victims A man in his 30s died after he wasstabbed in Tower Hamletson Saturday afternoon. In the early hours of Saturday two men were stabbed in Clapham and another was stabbed in Brixton. Eniola Aluko, from Thamesmead, was the second of three killings in London in the space of 24 hours Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matthew Twist, from the Metropolitan Police, said: ""The circumstances, causes and motives for any homicide or serious violence incident are different and unique, and require different investigative strategies and approaches. ""But we are taking a service-wide response and all officers right across London continue to be relentless in our pursuit of those who bring violence to our communities."" Police at the scene of a fatal stabbing in Tower Hamlets President Trump and Mr Khan have clashed many times in the past. The president called Mr Khan a ""stone cold loser who should focus on crime in London"" shortly before landing in Stansted ahead of his three-day state visit to the UK earlier this month.

McVey backs Johnson as next Tory leaderFormer contender Esther McVey pledges support to Boris Johnson ahead of the first TV debate later.UK Politics,"Former Conservative leadership contender Esther McVey has thrown her support behind Boris Johnson's bid. Ms McVey - eliminated in the first ballot - toldthe Sunday Telegraph,externalshe was backing him because he had promised to deliver Brexit by 31 October. Mr Johnson is the clear frontrunner to replace Theresa May but his rivals have insisted they will not drop out. He is the only one of the six remaining candidates who will not take part in the first TV debate on Channel 4 later. His team reportedly have reservations about its proposed format, but Mr Johnsonhas agreed to take part in the BBC's debateon Tuesday. 'No coronation' for Tory leader, say candidates Johnson's success leaves him vulnerable The UK's next prime minister: What you need to know BBC political correspondent Ben Wright said there was ""intense arm-twisting and lobbying under way"" ahead of the second ballot of Tory MPs on Tuesday. He said Health Secretary Matt Hancock,who pulled out of the leadership race on Friday,was understood to be considering whether to back Mr Johnson or Michael Gove. Mr Gove finished third in round one behind Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, but hastold the Sunday Times,externalhe is the ""comeback kid"". The environment secretary also said he would be happy to serve under Mr Johnson, whose leadership bid he scuppered in 2016. ""I would absolutely work with Boris in any way that he wanted to work with me,"" he said. ""No question. It is a different time requiring a different approach."" Mr Hunt insisted he had still not given up hope of winning in the final postal ballot of party members, despite being a distant second to Mr Johnson in the first round. ""I am the insurgent in this race,""he told The Mail on Sunday.,external ""I am in it to win it because we have to give the country better choices given the crisis that we're in now."" This video can not be played Tory leadership: Rivals insist there must be no 'coronation' for Boris Home Secretary Sajid Javid said voters were looking for a ""change"" - something only he and Mr Johnson offered. He told the Sunday Times:,external""We need change. And Boris is change. But I'm change too. And there are only two change candidates in the remaining six - and that's Boris and me."" He also took a swipe at Mr Hunt, who he said was ""an asset to the party"" but didn't represent change. Meanwhile fellow contender, Rory Stewart, responded to a Sunday Times headline saying that the leadership rivals were eyeing cabinet roles under Mr Johnsonby tweeting:,external""This may be true of some contenders but it isn't true of me."" The international development secretary added: ""I want to give members and the public a real choice of two quite different futures for the Conservative party. I don't want to be in a Boris cabinet."" Esther McVey is the latest MP to get behind Boris Johnson's leadership campaign Mr Johnson gained 114 votes in the first ballot- more than double his nearest rival, Mr Hunt. Writing in the Sunday Telegraph, Ms McVey said she would ""wholeheartedly support"" Mr Johnson after he agreed to incorporate aspects of her ""blue-collar conservatism"" ideas - such as investing money into public services - into his plans for government. She added: ""He has promised to deliver Brexit on 31 October, deal or no deal, and has shown time and time again that he is a dynamic leader, capable of building a strong team around him that will deliver on his promises. ""Our country is crying out for strong, optimistic leadership and Boris is the man best equipped to take us out of the EU.""

Ruthless Fury stops Schwarz in round twoBritain's Tyson Fury stops previously undefeated heavyweight Tom Schwarz in the second round in Las Vegas.,"This video can not be played Tyson Fury: I'm a chubby guy who comes to have fun Britain's Tyson Fury produced a ruthless display to stop previously undefeated heavyweight Tom Schwarz in the second round in Las Vegas. Fury, wearing shorts with the American stars and stripes, entered the ring to James Brown's Living in America. Fury, 30, backed Schwarz to the ropes in the second, driving a right hand home to drop the German to the floor. Seconds later, with Schwarz bloodied and under attack, his corner threw in the towel as the bout was waved off. ""I got a big man out of there by switching it up. He caught me with a couple but you can't go swimming and not get wet,"" said Fury, who now has 28 wins and a draw on his record. ""I came here to have fun and enjoy myself. I don't take it too seriously. I thought I put on a good show and the fans got what they paid for."" I'll beat Wilder in biggest fight in world boxing - Fury Photos: Fury goes all Apollo Creed on winning Vegas debut 5 Live Boxing podcast: Fury puts on a show Fury walked to the ring in US colours after taking off an all-black robe This was Fury's first outing since his controversial draw with WBC heavyweight champion Deontay Wilder in Los Angeles in December. There will be many who feel 25-year-old Schwarz was over-matched, with British heavyweight Dillian Whyte quick to label the German a ""chump"" and the fight ""a joke"". But this was billed as a showcase bout for Fury in what was his first contest of a lucrative deal with ESPN. The marketing of the former world heavyweight champion was there for all to see as he took off a black robe during his MGM Grand ring walk to reveal the US stars and stripes on a second gown. This was all about enhancing his profile to the American market and the five minutes and 54 seconds of boxing that followed did no harm to the undefeated Briton's future earning power or damage his hopes of a rematch with Wilder. In round one he pinged a sharp jab through the underdog's defence and threw smart hooks around the guard, with Schwarz walking forward gamely but landing little against the evasive 6ft 9in Fury frame. Fury had little difficulty in breaking through the Schwarz guard And in the second, Fury showed his abundant ring craft when he willingly retreated to a corner before landing a left hook while swivelling out of the tight space to open up an attack. It was the beginning of the end as seconds later he thrust a right hand into Schwarz's face, forcing a knockdown which was quickly followed by the conclusion as Schwarz stood a static target with shots raining in on him. Fury was handed the microphone and - just as he did after ripping the IBF, WBA and WBO world titles from Wladimir Klitschko in 2015 - opted to sing Aerosmith hit I Don't Want to Miss a Thing. ""Tonight was great, I will enjoy it,"" he added. ""We will get deals done, get another fight in and then we fight Wilder next year."" Warrington beats Galahad to retain world title Briedis elbows way to controversial world title Former world heavyweight champion Joseph Parker said this was ""just the beginning"" for Fury in America Fury's win came two weeks after fellow Briton Anthony Joshua lost the IBF, WBA and WBO titles in a shock defeat by Andy Ruiz Jr at Madison Square Garden. Despite a late flurry of money being placed on Schwarz, who was previously unbeaten in 24 bouts, the German never looked like he could spring a similar surprise. Instead, ringside celebrities such as singer Robbie Williams, chef Gordon Ramsay and former baseball star Alex Rodriguez witnessed a dismantling by Fury. It has been a whirlwind 12 months since he returned to the sport after battles with drugs, alcohol and depression which saw him give up his WBA and WBO titles, having already been stripped of the IBF belt because of failing to fight the mandatory challenger. It appears a rematch with WBC champion Wilder is his main focus but another fight will come first, either on 21 September or 5 October, with his US promoter Bob Arum stating this week that New York's Madison Square Garden was provisionally booked. A meeting with Wilder should therefore happen early in 2020. ""Wilder's team want to make it happen,"" said Fury's promoter Frank Warren. ""Everybody wants to make it happen and it will happen."" If Fury and Wilder do meet again it will likely follow Joshua's proposed rematch with Ruiz, meaning the heavyweight landscape may well have changed once more. After his win Fury said his Las Vegas bout felt like ""my coming out party"". He now appears to have US backing, momentum and the necessary focus to ensure he is in the mix for what could be a captivating period in the division. Fury sang in the ring afterwards and also at his post-fight news conference Former world heavyweight champion Joseph Parker on BBC Radio 5 Live:""What a statement. I know Schwarz is not of the same class of Fury's last opponents but he was game and did his best. ""Fury has made a big impact in the UK but from this fight he is also going to make a huge impact in the United States. A lot of people are drawn to him because he is so charismatic. ""He is very good at speaking and brings a lot more to fight night than just boxing. This is just the beginning."" BBC Radio 5 Live commentator Mike Costello:""That was a brilliant statement from Tyson Fury. He was so aggressive, pinpoint with his punches and fighting on the front foot. It's another win and he remains on course to win another version of the world heavyweight title."" British heavyweight Dillian Whyte:""Can't believe I stayed to watch that joke of a fight. Tyson Fury should be ashamed of himself running away from me and fighting these chumps. My mother would have knocked out Tom the bum in a round.""

India announces retaliatory US tariffsThe new duties come days before countries' leaders are expected to meet at a G20 summit in Japan.India,"India has said that, from Sunday, it will impose tariffs on 28 US products, including almonds and apples. The new duties, some as high as 70%, are in response to Washington's refusal to exempt Delhi from higher taxes on steel and aluminium imports. Earlier this month, US President Trump alsoannounced the US was withdrawing India's preferential trade treatment. Tariffs of up to 120% were announced by India in June last year, but trade talks had delayed their implementation. In an announcement on Friday,India's Ministry of Finance said the decision was in the ""public interest"",external. An earlier list had also listed a 29th item - artemia, a type of shrimp - but this was removed. Is trade spoiling the Trump-Modi bromance? India no longer fastest-growing economy US-India bilateral trade was worth $142bn (Â£111bn) in 2018, a sevenfold increase since 2001, according to US figures. But $5.6n worth of Indian exports - previously duty-free in the US - will be hit now the country has lost preferential treatment under America's Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). This video can not be played Sujitha Rajendrababu tells the BBC how getting a job at a car factory has changed her life The move is the latest push by the Trump administration to redress what it considers to be unfair trading relationships with other countries. Tensions have since been rising between the two countries. Last year, India retaliated against US tariff hikes on aluminium and steel by raising its own import duties on a range of goods. President Trump has also threatened to impose sanctions if India purchases oil from Iran and if it goes ahead with plans to buy Russian S-400 anti-aircraft missiles. The latest tariffs from India come just days before country's Foreign Minister, Subrahmanyam Jaishankar, is due to meet his US counterpart, Mike Pompeo, at a G20 summit in Japan.

No backstop 'is effectively no deal'Leo Varadkar was responding to calls for changes to be made the backstop by some Conservative leadership candidates.Europe,"The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) has said removing the backstop from the Withdrawal Agreement, would be ""effectively the same as no deal"". Leo Varadkar was responding to comments from some candidates seeking to replace Theresa May as prime minister. Many contenders have proposed changes to the backstop, even though the EU says it is not up for renegotiation. Mr Varadkar said: ""If we don't have that (the backstop), there is no deal"". As Tories line up, what now for backstop? New ideas for the Brexit border backstop Could technology solve the Irish border problem? Varadkar warns of Brexit 'miscalculation' The backstop has proven to be one of the most controversial parts of Mrs May's Withdrawal Agreementwith the EU. It is an insurance agreement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland. The Irish border has been one of the most contentious issues surrounding Brexit Many Conservative MPs have concerns that it could ""trap"" the UK, leaving it unable to strike its own trade deals with the rest of the world. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), who prop up the government, also do not want to see Northern Ireland treated differently from the rest of the UK. Speaking onIrish National Broadcaster RTÃ's Marian Finucane programme,external, the taoiseach said it was ""alarming"" some leading Conservatives were suggesting a no-deal Brexit. ""It's a legal guarantee and legally operable guarantee that we will never see a hard border again,"" Mr Varadkar said of the backstop. He also responded to calls for a time limit to be attached to the backstop. This video can not be played BBC News NI's political reporter Jayne McCormack explains why the border is an issue ""The difficulties we have with a time limit, is effectively you are saying there will or could be a hard border once that time limit expires - that isn't a backstop,"" he said. ""What we are open to, and always have been open to, is alternative arrangements that perhaps could avoid a hard border, through procedures and technologies and so on. ""What we expect, and I don't think it's unreasonable - we want to see that fleshed out, we want to see it exist, it demonstrated before we are willing to give up the backstop. This video can not be played Would you notice if you crossed the Irish border? (Video from 2017) ""What people are saying is, 'give up the backstop' which we know will work legally and operationally in return for something that doesn't yet exist but might exist in the future. ""I can't do that to the border communities."" Mr Varadkar also said he was ""concerned at the idea, and there is an idea there in Westminster, in London, that somehow Theresa May was a bad negotiator and got a bad deal. ""That's not true. She was a good negotiator, she had a good team. ""She probably got the best deal that she could get given that a country leaving the EU doesn't have much leverage. ""The fact that the failure of the House Of Commons to ratify the Withdrawal Agreement somehow means they are going to get a better deal, that is just not how the European Union works,"" he said.
