Ex-Wales rugby captain reveals he has HIV,"This video can not be played Gareth Thomas reveals he is HIV positive Former Wales rugby captain Gareth Thomas has revealed he is HIV positive, saying he wants to ""break the stigma"" around the condition. He said he wants to show how people with HIV are misrepresented as ""walking around with walking sticks who are close to dying"". He has also spoken about ""shame"" and ""fear"" of keeping his condition secret. He completed the Ironman triathlon in Pembrokeshire after making the announcement - cheered on by crowds. He finished the gruelling challenge in 12 hours and 18 minutes with high emotion at times. There was a warm embrace for the former Wales rugby captain before he continued his race In  aTwitter video posted,externalon Saturday night, Thomas said he was compelled to make the announcement after threats were made to to him by ""evils"" to reveal his HIV status. Since making the announcement, support for the 45-year-old ex-British and Irish Lions skipper flooded in. It included a message from the Duke of Sussex, Prince Harry, on the social platform Instagram where he said: ""Gareth, you are an absolute legend! In sharing your story of being HIV+, you are saving lives and shattering stigma, by showing you can be strong and resilient while living with HIV. ""We should all be appalled by the way you were forced to speak your truth, it is yours and yours alone to share on your terms and I and millions stand with you. H"" The former Wales captain, who won 100 caps for his country, is due to talk about his diagnosis in a BBC Wales documentary on Wednesday. In it, he says at his lowest point in 2018 he felt like dying.

Other than waking at 06:00 to take a single pill every day and visiting the hospital for blood tests every six months, the condition has little impact on day-to-day life for Thomas. On the contrary, he is taking part in an Ironman challenge on Sunday, which has involved him learning to swim, which to Thomas was a way of demonstrating his physical and mental strength. ""When I first found out that I was going to have to live with HIV, the first thing I thought was straight away: I was going to die,"" he said. ""It's not like I blame people for not knowing this.

""This is a subject that because of the 80s scenarios people don't talk about it because that's the only information they have."" He added: ""The overriding question that everybody said to me - the first question everyone says to me when I tell them I'm living with HIV - is 'Are you going to be OK?'

The drug PrEP is being used as part of HIV prevention HIV stands for Human Immunodeficiency Virus - the immunodeficiency is the weakening of the immune system by the virus. It has been passed on between humans for many decades but was only identified in the early 1980s. If left untreated, infection with HIV progresses through a series of stages, leading to late-stage HIV or Aids HIV can be passed on through blood or semen butnotpassed on by spitting, sneezing, coughing, kissing or general social contact. There is now robust evidence to say, with confidence, that peopleon effective HIV treatment,externalcan't pass on the virus. There are an estimated 94,100 people living with HIV in the UK, around 2,200 of them in Wales; 4,484 people were diagnosed in 2018, a 28% decline since 2015. As a result of combination prevention - condom use, HIV-prevention drug pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), expanded HIV testing and of antiretroviral therapy - there has been a 39% fall in diagnosis among gay and bisexual men since 2015 Sources:Terrence Higgins Trust,externalandPublic Health England,external HIV drug 'should be on the NHS' The HIV-positive man who stopped thousands getting the virus Ian Green, chief executive at Terrence Higgins Trust, said:  'I'm very proud to call Gareth Thomas a friend.

""I hope that by speaking publicly about this, Gareth will transform attitudes towards HIV that are all too often stuck in the 1980s. ""We've made huge medical advances in the fight against HIV that means that people living with HIV like Gareth now live long healthy lives.

Gold toilet stolen in Blenheim Palace burglary,"This video can not be played The 18-carat golden toilet was previously displayed at the Guggenheim Museum in New York An 18-carat solid gold toilet has been stolen in a burglary overnight at Blenheim Palace. A gang broke into the Oxfordshire palace at about 04:50 BST and stole the artwork, Thames Valley Police said. The working toilet - entitled America, which visitors had been invited to use - has not been found but a 66-year-old man has been arrested. The burglary caused ""significant damage and flooding"" because the toilet was plumbed into the building, police said. It was part of anexhibition by Italian conceptual artistMaurizio Cattelan that opened on Thursday. The 18th Century stately home is a World Heritage Site and the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill. It is currently closed while investigations continue. Speaking last month,external, Edward Spencer-Churchill - half-brother of the current Duke of Marlborough - said he was relaxed about security for the artwork. ""It's not going to be the easiest thing to nick,"" he said. Blenheim Palace is currently closed to the public while police investigate Visitors to the exhibition were free to use the palace's throne for its intended purpose, with a three-minute time limit to avoid queues. Det Insp Jess Milne, said: ""The piece of art that has been stolen is a high-value toilet made out of gold that was on display at the palace. ""We believe a group of offenders used at least two vehicles during the offence. ""The artwork has not been recovered at this time but we are conducting a thorough investigation to find it and bring those responsible to justice."" In a tweet,external, Blenheim Palace said it would remain shut for the rest of the day, but would reopen on Sunday. Palace chief executive Dominic Hare said they were ""saddened by this extraordinary event, but also relieved no-one was hurt"". ""We hope that the wonderful work of our dear friend Maurizio Cattelan becomes immortalised by this stupid and pointless act,"" he added.

US baby born on 9/11 at 9:11 weighs 9lb 11oz,"A US mother says her newborn daughter is a ""little miracle"" after she was born on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks at 9:11pm weighing 9lb 11oz. Little Christina Brown came into the world at Methodist LeBonheur Hospital in Germantown, Tennessee. ""She is a new life amongst the devastation and destruction,"" said her mother Cametrione Moore-Brown. Commemorations were held across the US to mark 18 years since the attack, on 11 September 2001. 9/11 attacks: US to reveal key name in Saudi suit Trial date set for 'architect of 9/11' Christina was born by Caesarean section and operating theatre staff were stunned when the baby's time of birth and weight were recorded. ""We heard the doctor announce the time of birth 9/11 and then when they weighed Christina, we heard gasps of astonishment when everyone realized Christina weighed 9/11, was born at 9:11 and on 9/11,"" said father Justin Brown. ""It was really exciting, especially to find some joy during a day of such tragedy."" Christina weighed in at 9lb 11oz (4.4kg) Rachel Laughlin, head of women's services at the hospital said such a coincidence was extremely rare. ""I've worked in women's services for over 35 years, and I've never seen a baby's birthdate, time of birth, and weight all be matching numbers,"" she said. Christina's parents say that when she is older they will share with her the significance of her birth. The 18th anniversary of the attack saw a moment's silence take place at various locations, including the sites of the attack, ""Ground Zero"", in New York, at the Pentagon, Virginia, and at Stonycreek Township in Pennsylvania.

Drone strikes hit Saudi oil production,"This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant Saudi Arabia has cut oil and gas production following drone attacks on two major oil facilities run by state-owned company Aramco. Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman said the strikes had reduced crude oil production by 5.7m barrels a day - about half the kingdom's output. A Yemeni Houthi rebel spokesman said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo blamed the attacks on Iran saying there was no evidence they came from Yemen. The Saudis lead a Western-backed military coalition supporting Yemen's government, while Iran backs the Houthi rebels. In a statement carried by the Saudi Press Agency (SPA), Prince Abdulaziz said the attacks ""resulted in a temporary suspension of production at Abqaiq and Khurais plants"". He said that part of the reduction would be compensated for by drawing on Aramco's oil stocks. The situation was under control at both facilities, Aramco CEO Amin Nasser said, adding that no casualties had been reported in the attacks. In a tweet, Mike Pompeo described the attack as ""an unprecedented attack on the world's energy supply"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""We call on all nations to publicly and unequivocally condemn Iran's attacks,"" Mr Pompeo added. The US would work with its allies to ensure energy markets remain well supplied and ""Iran is held accountable for its aggression"", he added. Tensions between the US and Iran have escalated since Mr Trump abandoned a deal limiting Iran's nuclear activities last year and reinstated sanctions. The Houthi spokesman, Yahya Sarea, told al-Masirah TV, which is owned by the Houthi movement and is based in Beirut, that further attacks could be expected in the future. He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia and was carried out in ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". TV footage showed a huge blaze at Abqaiq, site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, while a second drone attack started fires in the Khurais oilfield. ""At 04:00 (01:00 GMT), the industrial security teams of Aramco started dealing with fires at two of its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais as a result of... drones,"" the official Saudi Press Agency (SPA) reported. ""The two fires have been controlled."" Later, the SPA reported that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had told US President Donald Trump in a telephone conversation that the kingdom was ""willing and able to confront and deal with this terrorist aggression"". The White House said Mr Trump had offered US support to help Saudi Arabia defend itself. United Nations envoy Martin Griffiths described the attacks as ""extremely worrying"" in a statement in which he called on all parties in the Yemen conflict to exercise restraint.+ Abqaiq is about 60km (37 miles) south-west of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, while Khurais, some 200km further south-west, has the country's second largest oilfield. Saudi security forces foiled an attempt by al-Qaeda to attack the Abqaiq facility with suicide bombers in 2006. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott Aramco is not only the world's biggest oil producer, it is also one of the world's most profitable businesses. The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil, and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size. There was a sharp intake of breath as analysts I spoke to today digested the information that reports suggest that half of Saudi Arabia's oil production could have been knocked offline by these attacks. The country produces 10% of the world's crude oil. Cutting this in half could have a significant effect on the oil price come Monday when markets open. The success of the drone strike shows the vulnerability of Aramco's infrastructure, at a time when it is trying to show itself in its best light while gearing up to float on the stock market. And it raises concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk to oil, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz. This latest attack underlines the strategic threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia's oil installations. The growing sophistication of the Houthis' drone operations is bound to renew the debate as to where this capability comes from. Have the Houthis simply weaponised commercial civilian drones or have they had significant assistance from Iran? The Trump administration is likely to point the finger squarely at Tehran, but experts vary in the extent to which they think Iran is facilitating the drone campaign. The Saudi air force has been pummelling targets in Yemen for years. Now the Houthis have a capable, if much more limited, ability to strike back. It shows that the era of armed drone operations being restricted to a handful of major nations is now over. Drone technology, albeit of varying degrees of sophistication, is available to all - from the US to  China, Israel and Iran - and from the Houthis to Hezbollah. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement has been fighting the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Mr Sarea, the Houthi group's military spokesman, told al-Masirah that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Saudi-led coalition air strikes regularly target Houthis in Yemen Houthi fighters were blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month, and on other oil facilities in May. There have been other sources of tension in the region, often stemming from the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia and the US both blamed Iran for attacks in the Gulf on two oil tankers in June and July, allegations Tehran denied. Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Iran-US tensions: What's going on? In May four tankers, two of them Saudi-flagged, were damaged by explosions within the UAE's territorial waters in the Gulf of Oman. Tension in the vital shipping lanes worsened when Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in June, leading a month later to the Pentagon announcingthe deployment of US troops to Saudi Arabia.

Former Conservative MP Sam Gyimah joins Lib Dems,"This video can not be played Sam Gyimah is introduced as a Lib Dem MP at their party conference Former Conservative MP Sam Gyimah has joined the Liberal Democrats. Six MPs have defected to the party in recent weeks, including former Tory MP Philip Lee, and ex-Labour MPs Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna. Mr Gyimah was one of the 21 Tories who had the Conservative whip removed after rebelling against Boris Johnson in a bid to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Last December, the East Surrey MP quit as science and universities minister in a row over Theresa May's Brexit deal. The 43-year-old briefly stood in the race to become Conservative Party leader after Mrs May quit. The Lib Dems currently have 18 MPs, having been boosted by a victory in theBrecon and Radnorshire by-electionand the defections. Five things to look out for at Lib Dem conference Lib Dem members to vote on 'scrap Brexit' policy Mr Gyimah told BBC News that ""the hard Brexiteers have won in the Conservative party - it is a hard Brexit party"". ""There just aren't enough Conservatives like me,"" he said, explaining his decision to join the Liberal Democrats. ""If I want to fight for the values for which I came into politics.. the values of tolerance, the values of being sensible and pragmatic and acting in the interest of the country, then the Liberal Democrats is where I can do that from."" Not long ago at Westminster, if you were on the hunt for a smile, you wouldn't bother with the Lib Dems. There weren't many of them, for a start, and those left were the last survivors of a near apocalypse for the party; shrivelled, ignored and drowned out. Not any more. They are bouncy, tiggerish and expanding. They hope their clarity on Brexit - win an election and scrap it - will win favour with Remain inclined voters who may find Labour's pitch rather more ambiguous. But their newbies face a big challenge: can they, realistically, win the seats they currently hold as Liberal Democrats? Or will they go hunting for more fertile Lib Dem territory elsewhere - potentially dislodging long standing local party stalwarts? Addressing the Liberal Democrats conference in Bournemouth, Mr Gyimah said: ""There is now no orderly way for the UK to leave the EU on October 31. ""If the prime minister got a deal at the European Council on October 17 and 18, it would not be possible for us to leave on October 31 in an orderly way."" He added that the government has been left in a position where ""no-deal"" is the only outcome that can be delivered. He said he had been ""disheartened"" by the way the whipping process ""had been framed... for us MPs to choose our careers, in other words our own salaries, over putting the country first."" Mr Gyimah, who has been sitting as an Independent after losing the Conservative whip, has been a prominent advocate for a second referendum. He previously signalled his intention to stand as an independent candidate in East Surrey in the event of a snap general election. Mr Gyimah was born in Beaconsfield, in Buckinghamshire. When he was six years old, his parents split up and he moved with his mother to her native Ghana, while his father remained in the UK. He attended Achimota school, a state school in the capital of Accra, before returning to the UK to complete his GCSEs and A-levels at Freman College, a comprehensive in Hertfordshire. Mr Gyimah went on to win a place at Somerville College, Oxford, to read philosophy, politics and economics (PPE), and served as president of the Oxford Union in 1997. An Arsenal fan, he worked for Goldman Sachs for five years as an investment banker before moving into politics, standing unsuccessfully for Camden council elections in 2006. In 2010 he became the MP for East Surrey and had been in Westminster for two years when he was made parliamentary private secretary to the then PM David Cameron. He went on to become a government whip in 2013 and childcare and education minister a year later, before becoming prisons minister in 2016 and universities minister after that. The married father-of-two quit as universities minister in December last year over Theresa May's Brexit deal. He was introduced to delegates at the conference by the party's leader Jo Swinson as the ""newest Liberal Democrat MP"". Speaking to the conference, Mr Gyimah said he did not take the decision to join the Lib Dems lightly and had started reconsidering his position in the Tories while Mrs May negotiated her deal with the EU. But he said his concerns with the Conservative party now ""go beyond Brexit"". ""The values we have taken for granted for so long in our country... are under threat,"" Mr Gyimah said. ""What Jo and I discussed are the Liberal Democrats have a unique opportunity to fight to defend those values and create a new force in British politics. That is why I find myself here today."" He said ""the problem is not just on the Conservative side. When I look across the aisle, I also see on the Labour benches the same issue I have seen on the Conservative side, a doctrinaire, intolerant approach which means centrists are being squeezed out"". Mr Gyimah's move was welcomed by Lib Dem MPs. Mr Umunna tweeted he was ""absolutely delighted"" and Layla Moran said: ""Welcome... So delighted to have you on the team"". Allow Twitter content?

Chris White, a former government adviser, told the BBC it was ""extremely disappointing"" to see Mr Gyimah join the Lib Dems because he ""stood on a manifesto pledge to deliver the referendum and here he is switching to a party which is manifestly not going to do that"". A bid by Mr Johnson for an autumn general election has so far been rejected by MPs who wanted to first make sure a bill designed to avoid a no-deal Brexit became law. But since the bill, which seeks to force Mr Johnson to ask for a extension to the deadline, has been given Royal Assent, opposition MPs are preparing to start their general election campaigns. As the Lib Dem conference opened, Ms Swinson said the party's anti-Brexit message should be ""unequivocal"" in a general election campaign.

"Corbyn says wind farm contract plan 'not credible'Jeremy Corbyn says plans to manufacture parts for a wind farm off the Fife coast thousands of miles away are not credible.Edinburgh, Fife & East ScotlandLoyalist protest over Glasgow marches banFive parades were banned this weekend after sectarian disturbances over the past two weeks.Scotland","Jeremy Corbyn called for a Green industrial revolution at the event in Kirkcaldy Jeremy Corbyn says plans to manufacture parts for a Â£2bn wind farm off the Fife coast at a site thousands of miles away are not credible. It comes after energy giant EDF said no Scottish company had the capability to manufacture and supply the steel required for the Neart na Gaoithe site. Mothballed manufacturer BiFab had hoped to secure the work to build wind turbine jackets for the project. There is growing speculation the work will be done in Indonesia. TheGMB and Unite unions have been campaigning for the workto come to the Bifab yards in Methil and Burntisland, a few miles from where the new wind farm will be created. EDF said it was currently in a structured procurement process, which started with tier one contractors who would deliver large sub packages of the NnG project. The French-owned energy giant said it was working closely with its tier one preferred suppliers to encourage them to use Scottish suppliers for tier two work packages, such as the manufacturing of some of the jackets for the turbine foundations and the manufacturing of towers. A spokesman for EDF said: ""It is essential whichever supplier is chosen that they are competitive so UK energy consumers are not overpaying for their energy."" The issue was raised at an event in Kirkcaldy on Saturday, where the UK Labour leader addressed workers and trade unionists at a rally following the Fighting For Our Future march. Mr Corbyn, who called for a ""Green industrial revolution"", said it was not credible to ""drag"" manufactured parts 8,000 miles to the wind farm site. He said: ""Allocation of work is a very important issue indeed. ""It really is not credible to say that it's the right thing to do to build facilities that will be used for the generation of electricity on wind farms in the vicinity, almost in sight of the coast, and you're dragging the manufactured parts to make those wind turbines 8,000 miles by sea with steel that's probably come from 10,000 miles away. ""Where is the sustainability in that? The sustainability is in using the local skills, using the local knowledge, using your own manufacturing capability and developing the infrastructure that goes with it, and so we as a party are working very hard on the principles of what I call a green industrial revolution."" Scottish Greens Fife MSP Mark Ruskell also addressed the STUC rally. He said there should be no offshore wind farm leases issued from the Crown Estate without the guarantee of local jobs, and that government subsidies should be conditional on local input. He added: ""We can't rely on the dead hand of the free market to grow jobs. Oil and gas companies will extract every last drop until production goes over the cliff and takes communities dependent on the jobs with it.""

The ill-fated Scotland-England rail routeThe line across the Solway Firth was opened 150 years ago but weather and economics took their toll.,"The viaduct opened 150 years ago but was not a trouble-free scheme Staring out across the Solway Firth it is easy to see how the temptation arose. Instead of taking a detour via Carlisle, why not cut the corner and make a more direct link between the iron ore mines of Cumberland and the furnaces of Lanarkshire? That was the idea behind the Solway Junction Railway which opened 150 years ago on 13 September 1869. The only obstacle - the stretch of water between Scotland and England - would be overcome by a viaduct about 2,000 yards (1.8km) long. The railway linked Scotland and England across the Solway Firth The first sod was cut at Annan in March 1865 and work began on building the iron structure, averaging about 34ft (10m) from rails to the bed of the Solway Firth. A ballad was even written for the occasion. Its chorus went: ""Come, come! stout men of Annandale/Bear yourselves nobly; keep in good order./Cheer, cheer! loud let your welcome be/Welcome the strangers from over the Border."" The route helped to ""cut the corner"" from north west England to south west Scotland It would take more than four years - and an accident which claimed one man's life - before the line was complete. It opened for goods and mineral traffic on Monday 13 September 1869 ""without any ceremony"" and to passengers nearly a year later. The northern section joined the Caledonian Railway line at Kirtlebridge while the southern section joined up with the North British Silloth to Carlisle line. The iron structure carried the rails about 10m above the sea bed Initially it proved a success - for both freight and the public - but the tide turned pretty quickly. ""At first the line was profitable with the ore trains for Lanarkshire passing over the line,"" wrote Stuart Edgar and John M Sinton in their book The Solway Junction Railway. ""But in the mid-1870s the ore traffic began to decline due to the cheaper imports of Spanish ore and the Solway Junction Railway increasingly experienced financial difficulties as its capital was swallowed up."" Within six years of opening the first weather troubles struck too with some pillars cracked by frost. A severe winter forced the closure of the viaduct a little over a decade after it opened It would be damaged by frost and gales on dozens of occasions - one of the worst in January 1881. Large blocks of ice hit the viaduct with the sound described as like ""artillery fire"" and making the whole structure vibrate. Money was raised to repair and strengthen the viaduct but it would not fully reopen until 1884. It was the beginning of a slow decline which was only temporary reversed during World War One with demand for munitions - but complete closure was not far away. In August 1921 - facing a repairs bill estimated at Â£70,000 at the time - the last train crossed the viaduct. Different licensing laws saw some people risk walking along the viaduct for a drink after it shut ""The closure of the viaduct to rail traffic in 1921, however, did not mean the end of its use as many a Scottish Border Romeo slipped secretly across the Solway viaduct to keep a rendezvous with his fair English Juliet,"" said the book about the railway. ""Furthermore many Scots denied licensed hospitality in those days on the Sabbath would daringly get around the laws by walking across the viaduct, their aim being to enjoy the jovial thirst-quenching atmosphere of an English Inn. ""Even after the viaduct was declared dangerous, these 'excursions' continued along the line on which no trains ran."" Dismantling began in 1934 with three young men losing their lives during the demolition works the following year. Usage of the remaining line which had linked the viaduct to the main network also dwindled and it too was closed. Nowadays, only a few hints remain of where the ill-fated line once was - it had flourished briefly before the hard rules of business and the British weather took their toll.

Drone strikes set Saudi oil facilities ablaze,"This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant Drone attacks have set alight two major oil facilities run by the state-owned company Aramco in Saudi Arabia, state media say. Footage showed a huge blaze at Abqaiq, site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, while a second drone attack started fires in the Khurais oilfield. The fires are now under control at both facilities, state media said. A spokesman for the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. The military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, told al-Masirah TV, which is owned by the Houthi movement and is based in Beirut, that further attacks could be expected in the future. He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia and was carried out in ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". Saudi Arabia is said to be shutting down around half of its oil output,the Wall Street Journal reports,external. Officials have not yet commented on who they think is behind the attacks. ""At 04:00 (01:00 GMT), the industrial security teams of Aramco started dealing with fires at two of its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais as a result of... drones,"" the official Saudi Press Agency reported. ""The two fires have been controlled."" There have been no details on the damage but Agence France-Presse quoted interior ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki as saying there were no casualties. Abqaiq is about 60km (37 miles) south-west of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, while Khurais, some 200km further south-west, has the country's second largest oilfield. Saudi security forces foiled an attempt by al-Qaeda to attack the Abqaiq facility with suicide bombers in 2006. Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent This latest attack underlines the strategic threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia's oil installations. The growing sophistication of the Houthis' drone operations is bound to renew the debate as to where this capability comes from. Have the Houthis simply weaponised commercial civilian drones or have they had significant assistance from Iran? The Trump administration is likely to point the finger squarely at Tehran, but experts vary in the extent to which they think Iran is facilitating the drone campaign. The Saudi Air Force has been pummelling targets in Yemen for years. Now the Houthis have a capable, if much more limited, ability to strike back. It shows that the era of armed drone operations being restricted to a handful of major nations is now over. Drone technology - albeit of varying degrees of sophistication - is available to all; from the US to  China, Israel and Iran... and from the Houthis to Hezbolllah. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott Aramco ranks as the world's largest oil business and these facilities are significant. The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size. But whether this will have an impact on the oil price come Monday will depend on just how extensive the damage is. Markets now have the weekend to digest information from Aramco and assess the long-term impact. According to Richard Mallinson, geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, any reaction on Monday morning is likely to be muted, as markets are less worried about supply than demand at the moment, due to slower global economic growth and the ongoing trade war between the US and China. However, there are concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's oil supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement has been fighting the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Mr Sarea, the Houthi group's military spokesman, told al-Masirah that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Saudi-led coalition air strikes regularly target Houthis in Yemen Houthi fighters were blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month and on other oil facilities in May. There have been other sources of tension in the region, often stemming from the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia and the US both blamed Iran for attacks in the Gulf on two oil tankers in June and July, allegations Tehran denied. Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Iran-US tensions: What's going on? In May, four tankers, two of them Saudi-flagged, were damaged by explosions within the UAE's territorial waters in the Gulf of Oman. Saudi Arabia and then US National Security Adviser John Bolton blamed Iran. Tehran said the accusations were ""ridiculous"". Tension in the vital shipping lanes worsened when Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in June, leading a month later tothe Pentagon announcing the deployment of US troops to Saudi Arabia.

"Gold toilet stolen in Blenheim Palace burglaryA 66-year-old man has been arrested over the theft of the toilet, which was part of an exhibition.Oxford","This video can not be played The 18-carat golden toilet was previously displayed at the Guggenheim Museum in New York An 18-carat solid gold toilet has been stolen in a burglary overnight at Blenheim Palace. A gang broke into the Oxfordshire palace at about 04:50 BST and stole the artwork, Thames Valley Police said. The working toilet - entitled America, which visitors had been invited to use - has not been found but a 66-year-old man has been arrested. The burglary caused ""significant damage and flooding"" because the toilet was plumbed into the building, police said. It was part of anexhibition by Italian conceptual artistMaurizio Cattelan that opened on Thursday. The 18th Century stately home is a World Heritage Site and the birthplace of Sir Winston Churchill. It is currently closed while investigations continue. Speaking last month,external, Edward Spencer-Churchill - half-brother of the current Duke of Marlborough - said he was relaxed about security for the artwork. ""It's not going to be the easiest thing to nick,"" he said. Blenheim Palace is currently closed to the public while police investigate Visitors to the exhibition were free to use the palace's throne for its intended purpose, with a three-minute time limit to avoid queues. Det Insp Jess Milne, said: ""The piece of art that has been stolen is a high-value toilet made out of gold that was on display at the palace. ""We believe a group of offenders used at least two vehicles during the offence.

William Blake gets the TK Maxx treatment âââââ,"The strangest thing happened to me at Tate Britain's William Blake exhibition; something I'd not encountered before, nor even considered possible. Nothing dramatic, like falling into a trippy hallucinogenic state brought on by seeing Blake's fearful painting The Ghost of a Flea (1819), a gothic, slithery depiction of a vile character who appeared before the artist as a vision. My experience was much more prosaic. Most un-Blakeian, in fact. I entered the exhibition as a lifelong fan, a fully signed-up Blake-head, but left some time later faintly irritated by the fellow. That's not his fault, nor mine, I think. It is down to the way his work has been displayed. There are some artists who can withstand the mega-blockbuster expo show with its department store aesthetics of huge interconnecting rooms for folks to wander through and browse. A David Hockney or a Bridget Riley can survive the TK Maxx treatment - their paintings are big and bold and colourful and can be enjoyed when seen from a distance. It is the largest exhibition of Blake's work for almost 20 years But there are other artists, and William Blake (1757-1827) is certainly one, whose detailed, intense images and poetry are not suited to being shown in warehouse-sized spaces. His work is all about atmosphere and otherness, delivered with a psychologically-charged flourish. There's an intimacy to Blake that is compromised when shown on the massive scale of the Tate show. It kills the mood. To the curators' credit they have attempted to create a Georgian aura in the vast modern rooms by dimming the lights and painting the walls in rich, dark colours. But covering the entrance foyer leading to the exhibition in a hideous bright red was a mistake: a block of vulgar, shouty colour setting completely the wrong tone for this most sensitive and ethereal of artists. William Blake's Albion Rose, circa 1793 The great beauty of Blake's paintings, prints, and coloured engravings are their exquisite intricacies and tonal subtlety. That is immediately obvious when you see the first image in the show, Albion Rose (1793). A naked young man stands atop a mottled rock, his arms outstretched in front of a glorious spectrum of colours heralding a new dawn. It is an optimistic, joyful picture: a jolly ""welcome to the show!"". Thereafter, the exhibition is laid out broadly chronologically, with abundant biographical detail. His family ran a hosiery shop and haberdashery in Soho selling ""all kinds of baizes, Flannels, etc etc"". They indulged young William's interest in art. He was apprenticed to an engraver before enrolling as a student at the Royal Academy of Arts. There's a lovely, delicate drawing of his wife, Catherine, who is given a Best Supporting Spouse role by the curators. She shared his artistic burden by colouring some of his work, helping with the printing and finishing off some drawings. Somebody had to. As she once said of her husband: ""I have very little of Mr Blake's company; he is always in Paradise."" The Ghost of a Flea c 1819, graphite on paper And that's where we want him. Away with the fairies, free to see his visions; letting his extraordinary mind and spirit roam at will. That is the essence of Blake, it's what makes reading his poetry alongside his fabulous illustrations so exciting. The good news is you'll see plenty of his illuminated books in this show, including his famous Songs of Innocence and of Experience (1794). They are all terrific. But the curators' desire to contextualise every last part of Blake's output by introducing his patrons, his business practices, the work of his contemporaries - because there's plenty of space in those big rooms to fill - means the mystical, magical nature of the work is usurped. A visitor to Tate Britain in front of a William Blake projection Blake is all about the possibilities of the human imagination. He offers us an escape from the dull realities of everyday life. He challenges us to think beyond the rational and the assumed with fantastical creations such as The First Book of Urizen (1794). We don't need to know what his bank account looked like at the time, or where he happened to be living. The work can speak for itself without a nagging commentary dragging into the mundane. BBC Culture - William Blake: The greatest visionary in 200 years There are moments when Blake is allowed to breathe. Most notably in the room in which 12 large colour prints hang, which the artist described as ""frescos"". They include some of his finest images, including the mesmerising God Judging Adam (1795), and grotesquely brilliant Nebuchadnezzar (1795). After that, things take a turn for the worse, with an unconvincing mock-up of his disastrous 1809 exhibition, to which almost nobody came, and those who did largely kept their hands firmly in their pockets. This is followed by a dreadful room in which massive digital images of Blake's paintings are projected onto the walls because, we are told, that is what he always wanted. Not like that, he didn't. He'd be appalled. Jerusalem, plate 28, proof impression, 1820, relief etching with pen and black ink and watercolour There is something of a recovery after the curatorial theatrics, with an excellent display of his illustrated book Jerusalem (1820). Nearby are his late watercolour illustrations of Dante's Divine Comedy (1824-27), which is a marriage made in heaven, not hell. By this time, you have seen and read so much Blake, and seen and read so much about Blake, that your head is spinning. It's too much, really. He is a very fine artist, like a very fine wine; not one to overdo. There's a danger of the palette becoming dulled, any sensational radiance diminished. Nevertheless, and notwithstanding my gripes, I would still urge you to go to this imperfect show. To have so much of William Blake's psychedelic imaginary world laid out before you is a once-in-a-generation occasion and not to be missed.

"US baby born on 9/11 at 9:11 weighs 9lb 11oz""Christina is a little miracle during such a sad time,"" her mother said.US & Canada","A US mother says her newborn daughter is a ""little miracle"" after she was born on the anniversary of the 9/11 attacks at 9:11pm weighing 9lb 11oz. Little Christina Brown came into the world at Methodist LeBonheur Hospital in Germantown, Tennessee. ""She is a new life amongst the devastation and destruction,"" said her mother Cametrione Moore-Brown. Commemorations were held across the US to mark 18 years since the attack, on 11 September 2001. 9/11 attacks: US to reveal key name in Saudi suit Trial date set for 'architect of 9/11' Christina was born by Caesarean section and operating theatre staff were stunned when the baby's time of birth and weight were recorded. ""We heard the doctor announce the time of birth 9/11 and then when they weighed Christina, we heard gasps of astonishment when everyone realized Christina weighed 9/11, was born at 9:11 and on 9/11,"" said father Justin Brown. ""It was really exciting, especially to find some joy during a day of such tragedy."" Christina weighed in at 9lb 11oz (4.4kg) Rachel Laughlin, head of women's services at the hospital said such a coincidence was extremely rare. ""I've worked in women's services for over 35 years, and I've never seen a baby's birthdate, time of birth, and weight all be matching numbers,"" she said. Christina's parents say that when she is older they will share with her the significance of her birth. The 18th anniversary of the attack saw a moment's silence take place at various locations, including the sites of the attack, ""Ground Zero"", in New York, at the Pentagon, Virginia, and at Stonycreek Township in Pennsylvania.

Historic towns to benefit from Â£95m boost namedThe government lists 69 English towns and cities that will benefit from regeneration money.Business,"Coventry will get Â£2m to restore buildings that survived World War Two Historic English shopping centres will benefit from a Â£95m regeneration fund, the government has said. In all, 69 towns and cities will receive money, with projects aimed at turning disused buildings into shops, houses and community centres. The largest share of money, Â£21.1m, will go to the Midlands, with Â£2m going to restore buildings in Coventry that survived World War Two bombing. The government said the move would ""breathe new life"" into High Streets. The government's Future High Street Fund is providing Â£52m of the money, while Â£40m will come from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS). A further Â£3m is being provided by the National Lottery Heritage Fund. Towns and cities had to bid for the Â£95m funding, which was first announced in May. The announcement comes afterfigures showed that about 16 shops a dayclosed in the first half of the year as retailers restructure their businesses and more shopping moves online. Lisa Hooker, consumer markets leader at PwC which was behind the research, said retailers had to invest more in making stores ""relevant to today's consumers"", but added that ""new and different types of operators"" needed encouragement to fill vacant space. The government said the money would ""support wider regeneration"" in the 69 successful areas by attracting future commercial investment. ""Our nation's heritage is one of our great calling cards to the world, attracting millions of visitors to beautiful historic buildings that sit at the heart of our communities,"" said Culture Secretary Nicky Morgan. ""It is right that we ensure these buildings are preserved for future generations but it is important that we make them work for the modern world."" Other major projects include a Â£2m drive to restore historic shop-fronts in London's Tottenham area, which suffered extensive damage in the 2011 riots. By region, the funding breaks down as follows: London and the South East: Â£14.3m South West: Â£13.7m East of England: Â£7m Midlands: Â£21.1m North East and Yorkshire: Â£17.2m North West: Â£18.7m You can reada full list of the towns and cities that will benefit here. ""Increasing competition from online outlets is putting High Streets across the country under growing pressure,"" said the DCMS. ""As part of the government's drive to help High Streets adapt to changing consumer habits, the Â£95m funding will provide a welcome boost."" Responding to the move, shadow culture secretary Tom Watson said High Streets had been ""decimated"" by ""a decade of Tory austerity"". He added: ""This funding pales in comparison to the Â£1bn Cultural Capital fund that Labour is committed to, which will boost investment in culture, arts and heritage right across the country, not just a few lucky areas.""

The ill-fated Scotland-England rail route,"The viaduct opened 150 years ago but was not a trouble-free scheme Staring out across the Solway Firth it is easy to see how the temptation arose. Instead of taking a detour via Carlisle, why not cut the corner and make a more direct link between the iron ore mines of Cumberland and the furnaces of Lanarkshire? That was the idea behind the Solway Junction Railway which opened 150 years ago on 13 September 1869. The only obstacle - the stretch of water between Scotland and England - would be overcome by a viaduct about 2,000 yards (1.8km) long. The railway linked Scotland and England across the Solway Firth The first sod was cut at Annan in March 1865 and work began on building the iron structure, averaging about 34ft (10m) from rails to the bed of the Solway Firth. A ballad was even written for the occasion. Its chorus went: ""Come, come! stout men of Annandale/Bear yourselves nobly; keep in good order./Cheer, cheer! loud let your welcome be/Welcome the strangers from over the Border."" The route helped to ""cut the corner"" from north west England to south west Scotland It would take more than four years - and an accident which claimed one man's life - before the line was complete. It opened for goods and mineral traffic on Monday 13 September 1869 ""without any ceremony"" and to passengers nearly a year later. The northern section joined the Caledonian Railway line at Kirtlebridge while the southern section joined up with the North British Silloth to Carlisle line. The iron structure carried the rails about 10m above the sea bed Initially it proved a success - for both freight and the public - but the tide turned pretty quickly. ""At first the line was profitable with the ore trains for Lanarkshire passing over the line,"" wrote Stuart Edgar and John M Sinton in their book The Solway Junction Railway. ""But in the mid-1870s the ore traffic began to decline due to the cheaper imports of Spanish ore and the Solway Junction Railway increasingly experienced financial difficulties as its capital was swallowed up."" Within six years of opening the first weather troubles struck too with some pillars cracked by frost. A severe winter forced the closure of the viaduct a little over a decade after it opened It would be damaged by frost and gales on dozens of occasions - one of the worst in January 1881. Large blocks of ice hit the viaduct with the sound described as like ""artillery fire"" and making the whole structure vibrate. Money was raised to repair and strengthen the viaduct but it would not fully reopen until 1884. It was the beginning of a slow decline which was only temporary reversed during World War One with demand for munitions - but complete closure was not far away. In August 1921 - facing a repairs bill estimated at Â£70,000 at the time - the last train crossed the viaduct. Different licensing laws saw some people risk walking along the viaduct for a drink after it shut ""The closure of the viaduct to rail traffic in 1921, however, did not mean the end of its use as many a Scottish Border Romeo slipped secretly across the Solway viaduct to keep a rendezvous with his fair English Juliet,"" said the book about the railway. ""Furthermore many Scots denied licensed hospitality in those days on the Sabbath would daringly get around the laws by walking across the viaduct, their aim being to enjoy the jovial thirst-quenching atmosphere of an English Inn. ""Even after the viaduct was declared dangerous, these 'excursions' continued along the line on which no trains ran."" Dismantling began in 1934 with three young men losing their lives during the demolition works the following year. Usage of the remaining line which had linked the viaduct to the main network also dwindled and it too was closed. Nowadays, only a few hints remain of where the ill-fated line once was - it had flourished briefly before the hard rules of business and the British weather took their toll.

'The vast majority do not want this thuggery',"Creggan is largely a republican community not far from the centre of Londonderry Creggan in Derry is seen as a dissident republican stronghold. It's wherejournalist Lyra McKee was murdered earlier this year, a bomb was found in a car last week and police officers have been attacked. What do local people think about their neighbourhood being in the headlines? James is working in his garden. Across the street is graffiti on the wall that reads: ""New IRA here to stay"". He says he had to leave his home on Monday night as streets were cordoned off. Young people threw petrol bombs at PSNI Land Rovers on Monday ""Young people then started to throw petrol bombs at police Land Rovers,"" he says. Police officers found a bomb on Monday during a security searchtargeting the New IRA. Police said a crowd of between 60 and 100 young people also gathered in Creggan that evening. Some of them attacked the police with petrol bombs and stones. Others stood by watching. At least two of the young people suffered burn injuries. ""At midday I was planting flowers in my garden. At midnight, I was running away to a community centre from a bomb,"" says James, who did not want his full name being used. ""I am sick to the back teeth with this carry on. I'm elderly now and I've seen a lot through the Troubles. The vast majority of people in Creggan do not want this thuggery. ""A friend from England called me to ask how I was. All I could say was: 'Planting flowers and avoiding bombs'."" The Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) has said, on a number of occasions, that it believes most of the violence in Creggan is orchestrated and that some of the young people are being exploited by paramilitaries. A bomb, containing commercial explosives, was found in a car on Monday At the heart of Creggan there's a school. Not too far from the school gates is a sign saying ""informants will be shot"". Some community workers act as mediators with dissident republicans on a regular basis in order to prevent further violence. The anti-British and anti-police messages are clearly visible when you arrive in the area. Many families were also directly affected during Northern Ireland's conflict -known as The Troubles. One community worker told BBC News NI that dissident republicans - who are prepared to use violence to achieve their aim of a united Ireland - ""like to think they are recruiting young people to push their message forward"". Timeline of Irish dissident activity PSNI numbers at 'dangerous' level says former chief PSNI chief Simon Byrne calls for more officers The New IRA admitted carrying out themurder of journalist Lyra McKeein April in Creggan. One 24-year-old woman says she was standing ""a couple of hundred yards"" from where Ms McKee was shot. The woman, who wanted to remain anonymous, told BBC News NI she was by no means happy with the fact that Ms McKee was killed, but that she did support the PSNI being attacked with petrol bombs. ""A lot of people don't realise what we go through here. I have no job. My family went through a lot during the Troubles. I feel strongly about them leaving us alone in Creggan."" Lyra McKee wanted to write about the affects of violence on young people in Derry The woman was able to show BBC News NI footage on her phone of the police being targeted in recent months and years. ""We share it in group chats. We don't appreciate their attendance here during the day or at night. I know I don't speak for every young person."" A PSNI spokesperson said: ""We are there for the safety of all communities."" A 25-year-old man walks past Creggan shops listening to music. He is on his way to a body combat class in the local community centre. ""I struggle to understand why some of the young people want to cause bother,"" he says. ""I've lived here all my life, too. I went into the town on Monday night to get away from it all. All I can say to them is: 'Move on'. There are better things to be doing in Creggan and across the city."" Graffiti features on a number of walls throughout Creggan and across the city Outside the community centre, known locally as the corn beef tin, are five women having a cigarette. They are waiting for one of their weekly classes to start. ""I've lived here since I was born and there are many, many positive people here in Creggan,"" Karen Doherty says. ""Negative headlines are broadcast about us around the world and it makes me feel sick to the stomach. The good things never get discussed. There are many wonderful people here and things to do. ""Yes, there are big issues, but it involves a small minority. We are a close community. ""During the Troubles there were soldiers here, bombs and tanks, but we were almost safer then than we are now. I'm not sure if it's because we were immune to it back then, but the young people now are uncontrollable."" Kathleen Dalzell (left) and Karen Doherty have lived in Creggan all of their lives Kathleen Dalzell says some of the young people in Creggan are being exploited. ""There's a bigger picture here,"" she adds. ""Those dissidents need to back off. No one in Derry wants to see this. I had a great upbringing here. ""We all help each other out in the hour of need. That's the real Creggan."" Fr Joseph Gormley is based at St Mary's in Creggan Fr Joseph Gormley, who was called to the scene of Lyra McKee's shooting, says had the bomb on Monday not been found and diffused, ""we could have had another loss of life"". ""This community has been through a lot,"" Fr Gormley adds. ""Many people are knackered and fed up with the constant negative headlines but we can't shy away from the fact these things are happening. ""Those responsible should be able to see that Creggan does not want to go backwards. Let Creggan flourish the way it deserves to.""

"Saudi oil facilities ablaze after drone strikesThe fires are now under control at Abqaiq and Khurais, state media say.Middle East","This video can not be played Abqaiq is the site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant Drone attacks have set alight two major oil facilities run by the state-owned company Aramco in Saudi Arabia, state media say. Footage showed a huge blaze at Abqaiq, site of Aramco's largest oil processing plant, while a second drone attack started fires in the Khurais oilfield. The fires are now under control at both facilities, state media said. A spokesman for the Iran-aligned Houthi group in Yemen said it had deployed 10 drones in the attacks. The military spokesman, Yahya Sarea, told al-Masirah TV, which is owned by the Houthi movement and is based in Beirut, that further attacks could be expected in the future. He said Saturday's attack was one of the biggest operations the Houthi forces had undertaken inside Saudi Arabia and was carried out in ""co-operation with the honourable people inside the kingdom"". Saudi Arabia is said to be shutting down around half of its oil output,the Wall Street Journal reports,external. Officials have not yet commented on who they think is behind the attacks. ""At 04:00 (01:00 GMT), the industrial security teams of Aramco started dealing with fires at two of its facilities in Abqaiq and Khurais as a result of... drones,"" the official Saudi Press Agency reported. ""The two fires have been controlled."" There have been no details on the damage but Agence France-Presse quoted interior ministry spokesman Mansour al-Turki as saying there were no casualties. Abqaiq is about 60km (37 miles) south-west of Dhahran in Saudi Arabia's Eastern Province, while Khurais, some 200km further south-west, has the country's second largest oilfield. Saudi security forces foiled an attempt by al-Qaeda to attack the Abqaiq facility with suicide bombers in 2006. Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent This latest attack underlines the strategic threat posed by the Houthis to Saudi Arabia's oil installations. The growing sophistication of the Houthis' drone operations is bound to renew the debate as to where this capability comes from. Have the Houthis simply weaponised commercial civilian drones or have they had significant assistance from Iran? The Trump administration is likely to point the finger squarely at Tehran, but experts vary in the extent to which they think Iran is facilitating the drone campaign. The Saudi Air Force has been pummelling targets in Yemen for years. Now the Houthis have a capable, if much more limited, ability to strike back. It shows that the era of armed drone operations being restricted to a handful of major nations is now over. Drone technology - albeit of varying degrees of sophistication - is available to all; from the US to  China, Israel and Iran... and from the Houthis to Hezbolllah. Analysis by BBC business correspondent Katie Prescott Aramco ranks as the world's largest oil business and these facilities are significant. The Khurais oilfield produces about 1% of the world's oil and Abqaiq is the company's largest facility - with the capacity to process 7% of the global supply. Even a brief or partial disruption could affect the company, and the oil supply, given their size. But whether this will have an impact on the oil price come Monday will depend on just how extensive the damage is. Markets now have the weekend to digest information from Aramco and assess the long-term impact. According to Richard Mallinson, geopolitical analyst at Energy Aspects, any reaction on Monday morning is likely to be muted, as markets are less worried about supply than demand at the moment, due to slower global economic growth and the ongoing trade war between the US and China. However, there are concerns that escalating tensions in the region could pose a broader risk, potentially threatening the fifth of the world's oil supply that goes through the critical Strait of Hormuz. The Iran-aligned Houthi rebel movement has been fighting the Yemeni government and a Saudi-led coalition. Yemen has been at war since 2015, when President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee the capital Sanaa by the Houthis. Saudi Arabia backs President Hadi, and has led a coalition of regional countries against the rebels. Yemen conflict explained in 400 words Why is there a war in Yemen? Yemen war: Has anything been achieved? The coalition launches air strikes almost every day, while the Houthis often fire missiles into Saudi Arabia. Mr Sarea, the Houthi group's military spokesman, told al-Masirah that operations against Saudi targets would ""only grow wider and will be more painful than before, so long as their aggression and blockade continues"". Saudi-led coalition air strikes regularly target Houthis in Yemen Houthi fighters were blamed for drone attacks on the Shaybah natural gas liquefaction facility last month and on other oil facilities in May. There have been other sources of tension in the region, often stemming from the rivalry between Saudi Arabia and Iran. Saudi Arabia and the US both blamed Iran for attacks in the Gulf on two oil tankers in June and July, allegations Tehran denied. Gulf of Oman tanker attacks: What we know Iran-US tensions: What's going on? In May, four tankers, two of them Saudi-flagged, were damaged by explosions within the UAE's territorial waters in the Gulf of Oman. Saudi Arabia and then US National Security Adviser John Bolton blamed Iran. Tehran said the accusations were ""ridiculous"". Tension in the vital shipping lanes worsened when Iran shot down a US surveillance drone over the Strait of Hormuz in June, leading a month later tothe Pentagon announcing the deployment of US troops to Saudi Arabia.

Celebrity parents and the bizarre 'cheating' scandal Exams whizz at centre of US cheat scandal The parents charged in the college scam investigation allegedly paid bribes, had exams altered, and even had their children edited into stock photos to fake sporting talents on applications.

Huffman pleaded guilty to mail and honest services fraud in May. She is the first parent sentenced in the scandal. This video can not be played Five things to know about the college admissions scandal Her legal team had asked for a year of probation in lieu of jail time, 250 hours of community service and a $20,000 fine. But prosecutors wrote in a memo last week that ""neither probation nor home confinement (in a large home in the Hollywood Hills with an infinity pool) would constitute meaningful punishment or deter others from committing similar crimes"". Huffman worked with the scam's confessed mastermind, William Singer, to falsify a college entrance exam score for her oldest daughter, Sophia Macy. Singer arranged for Sophia to take her SAT test in a special location, an exam widely used for college admissions in the US. Her result was a major improvement on her previous score. In a letter to Judge Talwani, Huffman wrote: ""In my desperation to be a good mother I talked myself into believing that all I was doing was giving my daughter a fair shot."" ""I see the irony in that statement now because what I have done is the opposite of fair. I have broken the law, deceived the educational community, betrayed my daughter and failed my family."" Huffman said in her letter to the judge that her daughter had been unaware of the fraud, and was devastated to learn of it.

Why didn't you think I could do it on my own?' I had no adequate answer for her. ""I could only say, 'I am sorry. I was frightened and I was stupid.' In my blind panic, I have done the exact thing that I was desperate to avoid. ""I have compromised my daughter's future, the wholeness of my family and my own integrity."" Prosecutors said Huffman made arrangements to have Singer cheat for her younger daughter as well before deciding against it. Huffman's husband - actor William H Macy - also had contact with Singer, though Mr Macy was spared charges. Though Huffman was among the most high-profile figures indicted, she paid among the smallest sums allegedly doled out by the parents charged in the scandal, according to court documents. Lori Loughlin, another Hollywood actress ensnared in the scandal along with her husband, has pleaded not guilty to paying $500,000 in bribes to have their daughters accepted to the University of Southern California as members of the rowing team. Ms Loughlin is next due in court on 2 October. How US university admissions are broken.
