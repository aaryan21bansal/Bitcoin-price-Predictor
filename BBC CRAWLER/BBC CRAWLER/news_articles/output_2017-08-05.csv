Can the UK afford the state pension?,"On New Year's Day 1909, more than half a million people aged 70 and more, who had worked all their lives, had passed a means test and were of good character queued up at their Post Offices for an old age pension of five shillings a week (25p) - around Â£20 in today's money. The pension paid more than a century later is very different. Today nearly 13 million people - men over the age of 65 and women currently over the age of 64 - receive the state pension. A full one is around Â£160 a week (Â£8,300 a year) and one in seven pensioners - close on two million people - survive on nothing else. It costs more than Â£100bn a year but those costs will rise in the coming decades. The Office for National Statistics projects that the cost will double to Â£200bn by the mid-2030s and and double again to Â£400bn in the 2050s. The reason is simple, according to Michael Johnson, a research fellow at the think tank the Centre for Policy Studies (CPS). ""From 1940 to 2010 the state pension age didn't move at all. In 1940 it was 60 for women, 65 for men, as it was in 2010,"" he says. ""But life expectancy over that 70-year period had increased by around 17 years, so we are faced with a fundamental problem that this is something we should have addressed a very long time ago and didn't and therefore to address it now makes it much, much more challenging."" State pension age rise brought forward Reality Check: How much does pensions triple lock cost? Although the state pension is hard to live on alone, to buy an equivalent index-linked income from an insurance company would cost more than Â£250,000. Investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown estimates that to save that much would require Â£300 a month for 40 years. Can we afford to give all workers a pension that generous? The European Union collates the data on pension spending. On that measure, in 2020, the UK will spend 7.4% of its national income, or GDP, on state pensions. That puts us 25th out of 28 members, well below the average 11.2% of their GDP. France, in the middle of the table, has compulsory pensions that replace 56.8% of earnings for someone on average pay. It will spend 14.6% of GDP on them, double what the UK spends. Internationally, we are misers not spendthrifts. Things look a bit better for the UK in another OECD table which counts all pensions, including occupational and personal ones too. Then we come 22nd out of 34 for those lucky enough to have a pension through their job. Auto-enrolment is now extending pensions at work to millions more. It counts as a compulsory pension so that will push us a few rungs up the first OECD table but not many. Ms Queisser says: ""We've looked at what would happen if the UK had the auto-enrolment scheme as a mandatory scheme, and then indeed the UK would move up to 22nd or 23rd."" State pension calculator - check your age and entitlement,external Michael Johnson of the CPS - a centre-right think tank co-founded by Margaret Thatcher - is unimpressed by the international comparisons. He believes we cannot afford the state pension. GDP estimates, he says, are uncertain and countries that spend more than the UK may not be able to do so for long. He points out that the National Insurance contributions paid into the National Insurance fund are not always sufficient to cover the cost of paying out pensions. As a result, in 2014-15, a Treasury grant of Â£4.6bn was required to plug the gap, so what was going out was larger than what was coming in. The following year, 2015-16, that grant had risen to Â£9.6bn. He also believes a fixed pension age is an unfair lottery. Some would draw a pension for 10 years, others for 30, but all pay the same National Insurance contributions. As an example, he says, imagine two 65-year-old men, one living in Chelsea in west London and the other living in Tottenham Green in north London. ""The life expectancy of the 65-year-old Chelsea man is around about 88. For Tottenham Green man it is about 71. ""So Chelsea man will enjoy the state pension for about 22 years and Tottenham Green man will enjoy it for approximately five. That seems extremely unjust to me."" The growing cost of the state pension - albeit low by international standards - has led some to suggest that it should be means-tested once more. This could be done either by limiting it to those with an income below the current limit to get means-tested help under the present system, or by taking it away from those who are better off - perhaps aligning it with Child Benefit which is progressively taken away from parents with an income above Â£50,000 a year.

The changing nature of typefaces,"This week the BBC and Twitter have both launched new typefaces to mixed reviews. So what is the thinking that goes into changing a typeface? On Tuesday, many Twitter users were surprised to see the unannounced change in its typeface. It was considered dramatic by some, with many complaining that the new style was too small. User Mark Johnson tweeted: ""Twitter, you've made a huge tiny mistake."" On Thursday the BBC Sport website revealed the broadcaster's new typeface called Reith, named after the corporation's first director general. Eventually it will replace the use of Gill Sans, Arial and Neue Helvetica across the corporation. The new typeface is thought to be more readable on smaller screens and mobile devices. Watch - Two Types: The Faces of Britain Through tablets and mobile devices, people are using more apps and websites with their own distinct styles. Typographer Tom Foley helped produce the BBC's new in-house typeface. The creative director of typography foundry Dalton Maag said: ""[Typefaces] are very fundamental aspects of visual communication. ""When you are familiar with a typeface, a change in textures on the screen creates a different reading rhythm,"" Mr Foley said. Different typefaces perform slightly different tasks. Times New Roman was commissioned by the Times of London in 1931 after designer Stanley Morison criticised the legibility of the newspaper. It was first used in the paper in 1932. Gill Sans was made by designer Eric Gill in 1928, and is a British example of a sans serif typeface. The typographer drew inspiration from his tutor Edward Johnston, who designed the London Underground alphabet. Comic Sans was created for Microsoft by Vincent Connare in 1994. The designer was inspired by comic book lettering. Helvetica was originally named Neue Haas Grotesk and was created by two Swiss designers in 1957. A variation of it is currently used on the BBC website. Helvetica - one of the world's most used typefaces - is often used in airports and on the New York subway as it is clear, bold, and easy to read. But that does not mean it is universally popular. Previously, Dalton Maag founder Bruno Maag has compared the font to a ""cheap, nasty"" ice cream. Mr Maag and Mr Foley both worked on the development of BBC Reith. The broadcaster's chief design officer, Colin Burns, said: ""The existing fonts that the BBC uses were developed last century and work well in print - but they're not always clear enough when they appear in small, digital, spaces, and we're all reading and watching far more on screens and mobiles these days."" The BBC's new Reith typeface is already being used on the broadcaster's sport website The new look Reith typeface has debuted on the BBC Sport website, and views are mixed. One reader commented: ""It appears infantile and it uses TOO MUCH BOLD?"" Another commented: ""The new font is terrible, it looks amateurish. I thought I was on a spoof site when I opened BBC Sport, that's exactly what it looks like now."" But one person said: ""Don't usually like change... But I make an exception in this case: this change works for me."" Another wrote: ""Love it."" Although the BBC is adopting a new typeface, its iconic sign will continue to use Gill Sans The changes made to the BBC Sport website will eventually be rolled out to all programmes and the whole of the website. But the iconic BBC blocks - which use Gill Sans - will remain the same. The BBC is not the only media organisation to design its own typeface. Times New Roman, a staple of any users of Microsoft Word, was created in 1932 for the Times of London. When the Guardian was resized and redesigned in 2005 it gave birth to its own typeface, called Guardian Egyptian. Transport for London also has its own dedicated typeface called Johnston, which has been used since 1916. Transport for London commissioned its own typeface called Johnston, created by Edward Johnston. It is not licensed for public use As well as the new font being easier to read on smaller screens, the BBC intends to save money through having its own font. Currently the organisation has to pay a licence to use Gill Sans, Arial, and Neue Helvetica. The designer of a font, or foundries, gets a commission from companies, publishers and organisations that use it. Mr Foley said: ""Even when you use typefaces in Microsoft Word, part of the cost of that computer will go to licensing the typeface. ""It might be a small amount but it all adds up."" Graphic designer David Airey said: ""Generally costs of licensing depend on how many unique website hits you get a month. Depending on the number of hits the costs for the BBC could be enormous. ""An organisation could pay a one-off fee for longer periods, but that's going to be a massive fee."" The BBC would not say how much money it currently spends on licensing typefaces but said it would be making ""substantial savings"" as a result of its in-house style. Do typefaces really matter?

'Tourists go home': Leftists resist Spain's influx,"Many Barcelona residents want better regulation of tourism as visitor numbers have soared Youths in Catalonia and the Basque Country have daubed the slogan ""tourists go home"" on some buildings - just as foreigners flock to Spain on holiday, spending millions of euros. A spokesperson for leftist Catalans behind the protests said today's model of mass tourism was impoverishing working-class people. Leftist Basques plan to stage an anti-tourism march on 17 August in San Sebastian, during a major festival. Semana Grande (Big Week) is a week-long celebration of Basque culture. Regional officials say the protests are isolated - and insist that tourists are welcome. They deplore the acts of vandalism, and stress that tourism is a vital industry for Spain. A record 75.6 million tourists visited Spain in 2016 - and Catalonia hosted 18 million of them, making it the most popular region. There has been some anti-tourist vandalism in Barcelona and Majorca - both Catalan-speaking - and most recently in San Sebastian, a tourist magnet in the Basque Country. In one dramatic incident, several masked assailants attacked a tourist bus in Barcelona, near the football stadium. The slogan ""tourism is killing neighbourhoods"" was daubed on the bus and one of its tyres was punctured. None of the passengers were injured. The attack was claimed by Arran Jovent, a leftist youth movement linked to Popular Unity Candidacy (CUP), an anti-capitalist party campaigning for Catalan independence. CUP tweeted a photo of the vandalised bus, with the message: ""We show support for the youth organisation @Arran_jovent, we must combat the murder of barrios [neighbourhoods] with all means.""

On its Facebook site, Arran has postedanti-tourism videos,external. One shows activists in Majorca holding a big banner next to yachts in a marina, letting off smoke bombs and throwing confetti inside a restaurant where customers are eating. Elsewhere, the tyres of some tourists' rental bikes have been slashed. Arran says it opposes a model of mass tourism that ""wants us as slaves"" and that ""turns the country into an amusement park that only benefits the bourgeoisie and capital!"" The anti-tourism campaign has also sparked a heated debate on Twitter, under the hashtag#touristgohome,external. An Arran spokesperson told the BBC that ""we are anti-capitalist, we want to destroy the system - and the tourist industry is part of that system"". ""Today's model of tourism expels people from their neighbourhoods and harms the environment - we've seen that all along the coast, with buildings everywhere. He said Arran's protests were ""not vandalism, but self-defence"". ""Having to sign poor work contracts - that's violence - as is having to leave your neighbourhood and your support networks, because of tourism."" Tapas bar in San Sebastian: The city's cuisine helps to make it a top tourist destination In the Basque Country, Ernai is a leftist youth movement acting in solidarity with Arran. Ernai emerged in 2013 from Basque nationalist groups who have campaigned for years on behalf of Eta prisoners. Eta is disarming, after decades spent fighting the Spanish state, but Madrid refuses to negotiate with what it calls a ""terrorist"" group. The Arran spokesperson said his group and Ernai were both ""revolutionary movements"" acting against ""an oppressor Spanish state"". Arran has about 500 activists throughout Catalonia, and its campaign is attracting new members, he said. In both regions the anti-tourism campaign is certainly coloured by nationalism. There is resentment over tourism pushing up prices - especially apartment rents - for locals. But it is also about asserting national identity and fighting globalisation. Catalans and Basques have a long history of struggle against Spanish political domination, going back to the Franco dictatorship and civil war. A tweet from Katu Arkonada in San Sebastian showed the slogan ""tourist go home"" daubed on a restaurant. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Basque tourism has grown since Eta violence subsided. San Sebastian is now a gastronomic capital, with a winning combination of beaches, Basque cuisine and local colour. Neighbouring Catalonia is in the tense run-up to a controversial referendum on independence in October. The region's ruling coalition has vowed to declare independence immediately if a majority of voters back it. Opinion polls suggest a narrow majority wants to remain part of Spain. Catalan leaders seek abrupt Spain split Cruise tourists overwhelm Europe's ancient resorts Taking back Barcelona's apartments Tourism is the number one problem for Barcelona residents, according to an opinion poll published by the municipality in June. Despite Spain's stubbornly high unemployment, tourism was the top concern of residents (19%), ahead of unemployment (12.4%) and transport (7%). It is the first time tourism has come top in the regular poll. Temporary mayor Gerardo Pisarello dismissed talk of ""touristophobia"". ""I don't believe that Barcelona's residents reject tourism - rather they want it regulated,"" he said. Loose regulation is blamed for the proliferation of cheap holiday accommodation in the city, such as Airbnb apartments. Many jobs in Barcelona depend on the annual influx of tourists Carol Olona, a BBC journalist from Barcelona, says the drive to cash in on tourism has pushed up prices in the city centre. Many young Spaniards earn no more than â¬1,000 (Â£902; $1,176) a month, yet an ordinary apartment in central Barcelona can cost â¬800 or more in monthly rent. Spain'sEl Periodico newspaper reports,externalthat many apartment rents in central Barcelona rose more than 10% in 2014-2016. Ms Olona says many residents ""have been struggling to find affordable rents, and moving to small places on the outskirts"". ""But Barcelona doesn't have much space to grow - there is sea on one side, mountains on the other and the city is surrounded by urban areas."" In summer the daily influx of tourists from cruise ships has also fuelled resentment, she said. San Sebastian beach: Some Basques fear that tourism threatens the charm of their region Yes, some. But it is tempered by exhortations to keep welcoming tourists, because of their economic value. Arran wants a freeze on new hotel construction, more regulation of tourism and a model that ""really respects the dignity of working people"". In Majorca, Balearics Deputy Prime Minister Biel BarcelÃ³ said he shared the concerns about today's mass tourism and the ""unbalanced"" model. But he condemned Arran's methods. A leading Basque tourism official, Denis Itxaso, said ""concentrations of tourists"" were inevitable in some places, but stressed that tourism was a vital source of income. ""Mind you don't play around with the hen that lays the golden eggs,"" he warned. Ernai then mocked him in a tweet, showing him as a hen, with the message ""Your golden eggs are the misery of young people!"" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Simon Jack: The great crash 10 years on,"On 9 August 2007 the French investment bank BNP Paribas announced it was shutting down three investment funds - meaning people who had invested in them couldn't get their money out. Its press release read as follows: ""The complete evaporation of liquidity in certain market segments of the US securitization market has made it impossible to value certain assets fairly, regardless of their quality or credit rating."" In English what that means is ""we couldn't sell this stuff if we tried because no-one knows what it's worth, if anything"". It is seen by most as the beginning of the worst financial crisis since the 1930s. The stuff they couldn't value was bundles of US mortgages. On the front line was Mervyn, now Lord, King - governor of the Bank of England at the time. He told the BBC that it wasn't so much the announcement that rattled him but the sudden and dramatic response from the European Central Bank. ""What they did was to lend, for one day, 100bn euros (Â£90bn) to the financial system. That's rather a lot of money and what that did was to make people wonder what it was they knew that others didn't - we wondered that too. ""That was the first day of my holiday. It was also the last day of my holiday. In fact the last holiday for four years."" That first tremor developed into a full-blown financial earthquake that shook the mightiest institutions around the globe, destroying many in the process, including Northern Rock and US investment bank Lehman Brothers. It proved beyond the powers of central banks alone to save the financial system, with governments forced to nationalise some lenders and provide tens of billions of taxpayers' money to prop up banks like RBS that otherwise would have collapsed. Lord King says a banking system we thought of as safe turned out to be the weak link in the global economy. He recalled a meeting with the Financial Services Authority (FSA) when he and the then-Chancellor Alistair Darling were told that ""Jaguar is in trouble"". They expressed their bafflement at why a carmaker should be in trouble until realising that the financial regulator was using a codeword for yet another bank on the brink of collapse. ""In these private meetings code-names were used in a way that seemed to us completely pointless"". Surprisingly perhaps, he said those days were not filled with stress and anxiety. ""We spent 20 hours a day on this for many years. So it wasn't nail-biting, it was more of a long slog trying to do the right thing."" Lord King insists that the financial crisis was not, in itself, the cause of the economic meltdown - but a symptom of growing global economic imbalances. The introduction of China into the world economy had the effect of pushing down prices and pushing down wages, which pushed down interest rates. That lead to a huge increase in demand for loans, which saw banks ramp up their lending. ""The reason the banking system got into trouble was that as they expanded, they did so with borrowed money rather than raising new capital."" He says these forces of globalisation meant there had been many losers and those who lost out were not dealt with honestly. ""We've allowed them to lose and then after the event said 'well that's just tough, the country as a whole is better off. You better retrain or reskill yourself'."" That dissatisfaction has been felt in the votes for Donald Trump and the vote to leave the EU. ""In both those cases we saw people voting against something,"" says Lord King. He describes the coverage of the Brexit debate both before the vote and since as ""hysterical"". When asked his own view of the economic impact of leaving the EU, he says: ""I don't know - that's the only honest answer."" One thing he is sure about is that as the UK approaches the Brexit negotiations, we must be prepared to walk away otherwise our position lacks credibility. By walking away he means falling back on a trade relationship governed by the rules of the World Trade Organisation. ""If you are going to have any success in this negotiation you need to have a fall back position that the other side understands and thinks is credible. ""It is not first choice but we have to have an option otherwise the other side won't listen. This ought to be something people can agree on irrespective of whether they voted for Brexit or not."" Ten years on from the crisis he is unwilling (perhaps conveniently) to apportion responsibility for what happened. ""I don't think it helps to start trying to blame people - otherwise you get into a situation where you think that punishing the people you blame will protect you from the next crisis which of course it won't."" He does, however, think valuable lessons were learnt and the financial system is a lot safer now than it was 10 years ago. ""We have a procedure for dealing with a failing bank which we didn't back then."" So did he enjoy his time on the front line of the crisis? ""I don't think enjoyed is the right word,"" says Lord King. ""But when you do an interesting job you want to live through interesting times and we certainly did that.""

British model 'kidnapped to be auctioned',"Italian police released an image of Lukasz Herba who has been arrested on kidnapping charges A British model was drugged and kidnapped in Milan to be sold in an online auction, say Italian police. The woman, 20, had arrived in the city to take part in a photo shoot arranged through her agent, but was abducted and held captive for six days. Polish national Lukasz Herba, 30, who lives in the UK, has been arrested on kidnapping charges, police said. The Foreign Office said it was providing consular support to a British woman. The model, who has not been named, arrived in Milan on 10 July. The woman was loaded into a bag and put into the boot of a car The woman went to an apartment in Milan under the belief she was to take part in a photo shoot She arrived at an apartment the following day for the shoot, where she was attacked by two men,said police,external. Police said the woman was drugged, handcuffed and loaded into a bag and put into the boot of car which was driven to an isolated house in Borgial, northwest of Turin. Italian prosecutor Paolo Storari said: ""The victim was doped with ketamine - then she was locked in a bag and carried for hours in a car. ""Think what could would have happened if she suffered from asthma."" The woman was kept handcuffed to a wooden chest of drawers in the bedroom for six days until she was released and taken to the British consulate in Milan, according to police. Investigators said they discovered the kidnapper had organised several online auctions for the sale of abducted girls, which included a description and an opening price. The model was held captive in an isolated house in Borgial for six days The woman was handcuffed to a chest of drawers in a bedroom Police said it was unclear whether he had really abducted the victims or invented them for the auction. The kidnapper used an encrypted account to ask the model's agent for Â£230,000 ($300,000) to stop her from being sold in auction. He claimed he was working on behalf of the ""Black Death Group"", an organisation which operates in the deep web for illegal traffics, police said. The victim told police the kidnapper said he would free her because the group had not realised she had a small child and they did not deal with mothers, prosecutors added. Investigations into the case are being carried out by authorities in Italy, Poland and the UK. A spokeswoman for West Midlands Police said an address in Sampson Close, Oldbury, had been raided on 18 July in connection with the inquiry. It is understood that the raid was led by Derbyshire Police, assisted by West Midlands officers. The kidnapper was captured by police as he was accompanying the model to the British Consulate in Milan,according to the Daily Telegraph.,external Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

'Curvy' wife tribute sparks backlash,"A husband's Instagram post about loving his wife's ""curvy"" size has sparked a backlash online about body image and feminism. American entrepreneur Robbie Tripp, who describes himself as ""husband to a curvy goddess"", posted a photograph of him and his wife, explaining in a popular post that becoming a feminist taught him that ""curvy"" women could be sexy. ""I love this woman and her curvy body. As a teenager, I was often teased by my friends for my attraction to girls on the thicker side,"" he wrote. ""As I became a man and started to educate myself on issues such as feminism and how the media marginalizes women by portraying a very narrow and very specific standard of beauty (thin, tall, lean), I realised how many men have bought into that lie."" ""For me, there is nothing sexier than this woman here: thick thighs, big booty, cute little side roll etc."" Mr Tripp frequently posts on Instagram about his wife's appearance The post quickly attracted criticism online for suggesting that men be applauded if they prefer body types that do not fit the ""tall and thin"" look portrayed as conventionally attractive by popular culture.

German escapes WW2 weapon injury,"The woman found the munition on a beach on the Elbe river A German woman narrowly escaped injury after picking up an object she believed to be amber but which then spontaneously combusted. She had plucked the small object from wet sand by the Elbe river near Hamburg and put it in a pocket of her jacket, which she laid on a bench. Bystanders soon alerted the 41-year-old to the fact her jacket was ablaze. The stone was actually white phosphorus, which had reacted with the air as it dried. Police say the two are easily confused. They are warning local beachcombers to collect amber in tins, saying pieces of phosphorus dropped in incendiary bombs by the Allies in World War Two still wash up. Maps reveal extent of German destruction Divers recover WW2 bouncing bomb White phosphorus burns at 1,300 C (2,370 F) and its flames cannot be put out using water. It can cause horrific burns that often require skin grafts. Fortunately, this time, only the jacket was damaged.

Defending Tor - gateway to the dark web,"The Tor Project is a non-profit group that oversees the Tor network When Roger Dingledine talks about the dark web, he waves his hands in the air - as if not quite convinced of its existence. I give him the benefit of the doubt - his arguably blasÃ© attitude, I think, is a symptom of being consistently called upon to defend his creation. He is the co-creator of Tor, the most popular software available for gaining access to the part of the internet unreachable using a conventional browser - including what is often referred to as the dark or underground web. To some, Tor is a menace: a (largely) impenetrable system that enables some of the most depraved crimes to take place on the internet. To others, it is a lifeline, the only way to safely access the online services that most of us take for granted. Dingledine would rather we talked about the latter. The scale of the dark web - with its drug deals, weapons sales and child abuse imagery - is insignificant when considered in the bigger picture, he argues. But we must talk about the former. I meet Dingledine at this year's Def Con, the large underground hacking convention held in Las Vegas. The timing was ideal - the event came just over a week after the closure of two huge dark web marketplaces. The biggest, Alphabay, was said to boast more than 200,000 users and $1bn (Â£0.7bn) a year in revenue. Roger Dingledine is an MIT-trained computer scientist Dingledine's talk was the day prior to our meeting, and in it he criticised misinformed journalists for sensationalising the size and scale of the dark web. ""I think a lot of it comes down to incentive mismatches,"" he tells me, ""where journalists have to create more controversy and get something so that everybody will want to read their article. ""The story is privacy is under threat around the world, and that's been the story for a while - so they need a new story."" The Tor Project's website has a section called ""Abuse FAQ,external"". It is here the group attempts to address the most controversial side of Tor use: that it is an enabler of criminals intent on carrying out the most shocking and sickening crimes. When talking about this, Dingledine invokes the ""guns don't kill people"" defence. Tor does not commit crime, he says, criminals do. ""I would say that there are bad people on the internet and they're doing bad things, but Tor does not enable them to do the bad things. This video can not be played This animation shows you the layers of the internet - and the dark web. ""It's not like there's a new set of bad people in the world who exist because Tor exists."" I guess not. But I suggest that Tor indisputably provides a way in which a novice can make themselves essentially untraceable online. ""I still think that most of the bad stuff on the internet has nothing to do with Tor,"" Dingledine insists. ""Most of the bad stuff on the internet is due to huge criminal organisations. There's a lot of crime out there."" In layman's terms, Tor hides your identity by pinging your connection around many different servers across the world, making your actual location extremely hard to track. There have been rumours that law enforcement has ""cracked"" Tor but, aside from isolated vulnerabilities, Dingledine says the concept remains solid. ""As far as I know, no, they haven't [cracked Tor]. ""Tor is the best option there is out there, but that doesn't mean Tor is perfect. No software is perfect."" Any major busts and arrests have been traced back to human error - good old, old-fashioned policing. ""Which is frustrating,"" Dingledine interjects, ""Because the modern police world wants to just click a button and have the bad guy show up. Old-fashioned police work is hard, takes energy."" This video can not be played Jeff Sessions highlighted the significant quantities of illegal drugs traded via the dark web Tor was mentioned in the documents leaked as part of Edward Snowden's whistleblowing in 2014. Under the delicate heading ""Tor Stinksâ¦ but it could be worse"", the National Security Agency (NSA) noted: ""We will never be able to de-anonymise all Tor users all the time."" Given this, you would think the US (and others) would be taking every step to weaken Tor. Ban it, even. But in fact, the US government has done more than any other to keep it alive - donating several million dollars to Dingledine and team since the project's inception in the nineties. He is confident that funding will continue. ""A lot of the US government funding for internet freedom tools comes from Republicans. The current congress is quite supportive of giving people tools to keep people safer on the internet."" The reason? The FBI, CIA, military and others all value anonymity too. In their ideal world, Tor would exist, but they would hold a secret key to break in. In 2014, Facebook's London team announced it had set up a way for users to access Facebook through Tor. More than a million people use the site in this way every month. ""About 97% of Tor traffic has to do with people going to Facebook, and Wikipedia, and BBC, and ordinary websites on the internet, and they want to go there more safely,"" Dingledine says. ""Whereas 3% of the traffic has to do with this 'dark web' thingâ¦. I have to wave my hands when I say the phrase."" The ability to access social networks anonymously is invaluable to people living in oppressive regimes or countries with high levels of surveillance around what citizens do online. But given the majority of users can be found in the US and Europe - in places not typically considered to be oppressive - I argued that Tor's justification hinging on the needs of activists perhaps seems less than convincing. ""I think the line is getting a lot more blurry between the free countries, and the un-free countries,"" he says. ___________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external You can reach Dave securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +1 (628) 400-7370 Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

UN backs 'toughest' North Korea sanctions,"This video can not be played Nikki Haley: Resolution ""put the North Korean dictator on notice"" The United Nations Security Council has agreed on fresh sanctions against North Korea over its missile programme. A resolution banning North Korean exports and limiting investments in the country was passed unanimously. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said it was ""the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation"". Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit the US. However, experts doubt the capability of the missiles to hit their targets. The tests were condemned by South Korea, Japan and the US, and prompted the drafting of the new UN sanctions. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is attending a regional forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Manila, in the Philippines, with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho also present. North Korea's nuclear programme is expected to be a major issue but there are no plans for a bilateral meeting, US officials say. Speaking as he sat down for talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Mr Tillerson said the sanctions were a ""good outcome"". North Korea: 'All US within missile range' North Korea's missile programme US President Donald Trumptweeted,externalto say the sanctions would cost the North more than $1bn (Â£0.7bn). The export of coal, ore and other raw materials to China is one of North Korea's few sources of cash. Estimates say that North Korea exports about $3bn worth of goods each year - and the sanctions could eliminate $1bn of that trade. Earlier this year,China suspended imports of coalto increase pressure on Pyongyang. However, repeated sanctions have so far failed to deter North Korea from continuing with its missile development. This video can not be played North Korea missile ""seen from Japan"" The US ambassador said the Security Council had increased the penalty for North Korea's ballistic missile activity ""to a whole new level"". ""Today the Security Council has come together to put the North Korean dictator on notice,"" Ms Haley told the council after the vote on Saturday. ""North Korea's irresponsible and careless acts have just proved to be costly for the regime."" UK ambassador Matthew Rycroft said: ""North Korea bears full responsibility for the measures we have enacted today. ""It does not have to be this way. North Korea should forgo the path of provocation, forgo the path of further escalation."" Meanwhile, North Korea's ruling-party newspaper Rodong Sinmun said nuclear action or sanctions taken by Washington would lead to an ""unimaginable sea of fire"" engulfing the US. The article, printed before the new UN sanctions were approved, added that if the US did not move away from its ""hostile policy towards Pyongyang,  the only choice for the US is self-destruction"". China, North Korea's only international ally and a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, voted in favour of the resolution this time. It has often protected Pyongyang from harmful resolutions in the past. In Manila, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the sanctions were ""necessary"" but were ""not the ultimate purpose"". North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, will take part in the forum in Manila ""Our purpose is to bring all parties involved in the nuclear issues back to negotiation table, finding the resolutions through talks to realise the denuclearization of Korean peninsula,"" he told journalists. The isolated state's repeated missile and nuclear weapon tests have been condemned by neighbours in the region. What can the outside world do? But South Korea says it may hold direct talks with the North during the Asean summit. Its foreign minister said she was willing to talk to her counterpart from Pyongyang, if the chance ""naturally occurs"". ""I would like to deliver our desire for the North to stop its provocations and positively respond to our recent special offers [for talks] aimed at establishing a peace regime,"" she toldSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency,external. Altogether, 27 nations are sending representatives to the Asean forum. Asean's 10 member statesissued a joint statement,externalsaying they had ""grave concerns"" over North Korea's actions, which ""seriously threaten peace"".

'Stop children bingeing on social media',"The Observer carries a plea to parents from the children's commissioner about the amount of time young people are spending on social media and the internet. Anne Longfield says as web use reaches record highs among children,external, parents should be proactive in stopping them from bingeing on the internet ""like junk food"" during the school holidays. She also condemns the new methods social media companies are using to draw them into spending more time ""staring at tablets and smartphones"". The UK is prepared to pay up to Â£36bn to the EU to settle the so-called Brexit divorce bill,according to the Sunday Telegraph,external. The paper says this is the first time such a precise figure has been proposed, and goes on to report that senior officials in Whitehall now believe the offer is the only way to break the deadlock in negotiations. It says the UK will only agree to pay the bill if the EU negotiates the financial settlement as part of an agreement on future relations, including a trade deal. In an editorial,external, the paper urges politicians to focus on what we are ""bringing to the table"" rather than endless ""negativity and misplaced bravado"". The Sunday Times leads with an investigation,externalwhich it says has revealed that British A-level students are being ""discriminated"" against by many of the UK's top universities. The paper says it has uncovered evidence that institutions are recruiting what it describes as ""more lucrative overseas applicants"" who often have poorer qualifications. Former education minister Lord Adonis tells the paper that the findings are ""seriously alarming"". He accuses universities of ""betraying their mission"" to widen access to higher education. The paper says,externalBritish parents have a right to expect a level playing field and universities have a duty to provide one. The Mail on Sunday warns of a prescriptions fraud epidemic,externalas it reports that a million NHS patients have been fined for wrongly claiming free medicines. It says that health services bosses clawed back Â£23m in the past year in fines and unpaid bills as a result of a major crackdown targeting fraud. Most of the papers carry pictures on their front pages of Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt after he finished third in his last individual 100m race before retirement at the World Athletics Championships in London ""Bolt from the blue - Usain bows out with bronze,""declares the Sunday Times,external. ""Final Insult,""says the Mail on Sunday,externalwhich focuses on the chequered past of the race winner. ""Boos ring out as Bolt is beaten into third in his farewell race by twice-banned drugs cheat Gatlin."" Above a picture of Bolt giving a ""V for victory sign"", theSunday Telegraph declares simply,external: ""Goodbye from the greatest."" And who won't be eating all the pies? Well, it could be us,according to the Sunday Mirror,external. It reports that dozens of iconic British food names could be put at risk by a 'hard' Brexit. The paper says favourites including Melton Mowbray pork pies, Cornish pasties, Cumberland sausages and Wensleydale cheese could be undercut by cheap foreign imitations.

National Trust U-turn over LGBTQ badges,"The National Trust's rainbow-coloured badges and lanyards were designed to support an LGBTQ campaign The National Trust has reversed a decision to make some volunteers work away from the public after they refused to wear sexual equality symbols. Staff and volunteers at Felbrigg Hall, a stately home in Norfolk, were asked to wear badges and lanyards in support of an LGBTQ campaign. But 30 of the 350 volunteers wereoffered duties away from the publicafter choosing not to wear them. In a statement, the trust said it would now be an ""optional"" decision. A spokesman also confirmed all volunteers could resume their public-facing roles and it was ""business as usual"". The row was sparked following the National Trust's Prejudice and Pride campaign to mark the 50th anniversary of homosexuality being decriminalised. Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer left his ancestral home to the nation when he died in 1969 As part of the campaign the conservation charity is holding an exhibition at the estate, including a film, which reveals Felbrigg's last lord, Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, was gay, which was known by close friends. However, inan article in the Telegraph last week,external, the lord's godchildren criticised the move, saying it was unfair of the organisation to ""out"" someone who chose to keep his sexuality secret. Several volunteers on the estate were reported to have agreed with them. A new film said Felbrigg's last lord, Robert Wyndham Ketton-Cremer, was gay The National Trust had initially said it was committed to promoting equality and inclusion and in a letter to Saturday's Telegraph its director general Dame Helen Ghosh said anyone who did not agree with the campaign was ""free to step back from the volunteer role or take a different role for the duration"". However, the organisation later released a statement saying it was now ""making it clear to volunteers that the wearing of the badge is optional and a personal decision"". The statement added: ""We are aware some volunteers had conflicting, personal opinions about wearing the rainbow lanyards and badges. ""That was never our intention."" Dame Helen said the National Trust was marking the anniversary of the law change at ""a dozen or so of our properties of the people who lived there and whose personal lives were outside the social norms of their time"". She said the film and exhibition about Lord Ketton-Cremer were ""sensitive, respectful and celebratory"".

US military aircraft in Australia crash,"Photographed in June off the Sydney coast, MV-22 craft land on an amphibious assault ship A search and rescue operation is being conducted after a US military aircraft was lost off the Australian coast. The incident involved an MV-22 Osprey belonging to the US Marines based in Okinawa, Japan. The third Marine Expeditionary Force said the aircraft had launched for ""regularly scheduled operations""  before it entered the water. Rescue teams recovered 23 people, but three service members are still missing. Australian media reported the incident happened during an attempt to land on an aircraft carrier. Allow Twitter content?

The MV-22 Osprey is a tilt-rotor aircraft, capable of carrying 24 people at a time in addition to four crew members. It is similar to a conventional plane, but has helicopter-like rotor blades which allow it to take off vertically, without a runway. Australia's Daily Telegraph newspaper quoted military sources as saying that the accident happened as the aircraft was trying to land on the USS Ronald Reagan aircraft carrier. This video can not be played MV-22 Osprey ""designed to behave like a bird"" Australia's Defence Minister, Marise Payne, said she had spoken to her US counterpart, James Mattis, and confirmed the incident happened near Shoalwater Bay, off the coast of Queensland. ""I can confirm no Australian Defence Force personnel were on board the aircraft,"" she said in a statement. US military forces have been operating in the area as part of a joint training exercise called Talisman Sabre. It involved some 30,000 personnel from both countries. An MV-22 Osprey was destroyed earlier this yearduring a controversial raid by US forces in Yemen, after three crew members were injured in a ""hard landing"". It was so badly damaged that US forces deliberately destroyed the craft in an air strike. In July, 16 people died aftera US Marine Corps plane crashed in Mississippi.

August train delays and how to avoid them,"Passengers across the UK have faced disruption throughout August Major disruption on the railways will peak this weekend, with key stations in London, and services to and from Wales and the north of England due to be heavily affected by engineering work. So how do you avoid a bank holiday headache? There have been a number of closures throughout August, with Londoners, tourists and commuters all affected. However, there are likely to be increased headaches over the bank holiday weekend. There will be no trains to London on theWest Coast Mainlineon Saturday 26 and Sunday 27 August, andEuston Stationwill close entirely. As part of the HS2 high-speed rail project, engineers will install a new power supply at the station. ""Significant maintenance work"" will also be carried out betweenWatford JunctionandEustonat the same time. London Waterloohas already seen some of the worst problems in August, with fewer trains running from Saturday 5. Work will continue until Monday 28, as part of a Â£800m project to increase capacity at the station. Work includes the extension of station platforms, with platforms one to nine closed for entire period. Platforms 10 to 19 will be open as usual, but are likely to be very busy, while platforms 20 to 24 have been temporarily opened to provide extra room. Train users have been urged to avoid morning and evening rush hours, or to either work from home or ""take a holiday"". Work on the Crossrail project will also affect services betweenLiverpool StreetandShenfield, IngatestoneandBillericayfrom Saturday 26 to Monday 28. From Saturday 27 August to Saturday 2 September, work on the Thameslink Programme will take place atLondon Bridge,Charing CrossandCannon Streetstations. It will affect services to and from the stations, with passengers urged to use alternative routes. Unfortunately not. Works are also being carried out in the North-West, South Wales and the Midlands. Those travelling on Great Western services betweenLondon PaddingtonandWalesfrom Saturday 19 August to Friday 15 September have been told to plan ahead due to electrification work betweenSwindonandBristol Parkway. Services betweenNewportandCardiffwill be reduced between 19 August and 3 September 2017, while ""essential electrification work"" is carried out, with no trains at all over the August Bank Holiday weekend. Several platforms have closed at London's Waterloo station Services betweenManchesterandPrestonwill also be affected due to work to upgradeBoltonstation between Saturday 12 and Sunday 27 August. Most train services will not run in or out ofBoltonuntil the first service on Monday 28, but trains will still run fromBoltontoBlackburnandClitheroeon weekdays. A rail replacement service will also run betweenTamworthandDerbyon the Cross Country route on Sunday 27, as well as betweenRugeley Trent ValleyandWalsallon Sunday 27 and Monday 28. There are also some minor works taking place inScotland,externalduring the evenings and weekends this month. Rugby Leaguefans are set to be among those worst affected by the works. The game's showpiece cup final, theChallenge Cup, will be played between Hull and Wigan Warriors at Wembley Stadium on 26 August. But Wigan fans hoping to travel to the capital on the train will have to avoidEustonstation, withthe club saying,externalit is ""unable to run official train packages this year"" due to the closure. All official travel will instead be by coach. Closures could also affect somePremier Leaguefootball matches in London across the bank holiday weekend, including Crystal Palace v Swansea City on Saturday, and both Chelsea v Everton and Tottenham Hotspur v Burnley on Sunday. Other major events in the capital over the bank holiday weekend include theNotting Hill Carnival. Crossrail will link Reading and Heathrow, to the west of London, with Shenfield and Abbey Wood August's delays and closures are being caused by some of the biggest rail projects under way in the UK, including HS2 and Crossrail. Network Railsays the work is part of the Railway Upgrade Plan, to cut overcrowding and congestion on key lines. It says passenger numbers have doubled in the past 20 years - more than the current rail network was designed to serve - with that number set to double again in the next 25. Benefits of its summer programme of work will include longer, faster and more frequent trains, a better, more reliable service, and improved facilities, it added. What do we know about HS2? Network Rail says the timing of work will affect fewer customers For many, the sight of a rail replacement bus service trundling over the horizon during the summer will come as little surprise. Along with the Christmas and Easter breaks, the bank holiday weekend in August is one of the most popular times to carry out rail works. Network Railsays carrying out essential works over bank holidays, at weekends and overnight causes the least amount of disruption for train users. ""Even though it might seem strange to carry out work at Christmas - when people are travelling to see friends and family - on average, around half the usual five million people travel by train each day during the Christmas period,"" it says. So we might have to get used to it. Network Rail,externalis probably the best place for advice and also toplan journeys,external, although individual rail firms and operators have also published a raft of advice on how to dodge the delays. Of the main closures,South West Trains,externalsays timetables for the period of works are available at London Waterloo.

Do we know the whole truth about three child deaths?,"Liam Fee was one of three children killed in Fife within a four-month period in 2014 It was by chance that I was assigned to report on the Liam Fee murder trial. The court case had been put back a week and the reporter initially expected to cover it was on holiday. I had no idea how much of an impact it would have on my journalistic life since then. For seven weeks in spring last year, I sat at Livingston High Court listening to the most unimaginable horror as the evidence unfolded about the cruelty of Liam's mother Rachel and her partner Nyomi Fee. Rightly they are serving life sentences for Liam's murder; they are responsible for the toddler's death. The couple, from Tyne and Wear, were convicted of Liam's murder and abusing two other boys But like almost everyone else, the outstanding question that I couldn't shake was could more have been done to protect Liam? And Liam wasn't the only child to die despite some level of previous social work involvement in 2014. In fact three children died in the first four months of that year. A coincidence or a sign of a wider problem in Fife's child protection system? In January 2014, three-year-old Mikaeel Kular was killed by his mother. Rosdeep Adekoya had initially reported him missing. She was convicted of culpable homicide. 'Fife's Child Killings: The Untold Story' is available for 30 days on the BBC iPlayer. Liam Fee social worker makes 'scapegoat' claim The vulnerable toddler who 'fell off the radar' The shocking abuse of toddler Liam Fee Call for investigation over BBC child murder revelations Liam Fee died in Thornton near Glenrothes in March 2014 and just a month later, only 10 miles away, a little girl called Madison Horn was the victim of a horrific attack. The two-year-old was killed by her mother's new boyfriend, Kevin Park. In each case Fife's Child Protection Committee commissioned an investigation, known as a Significant Case Review. Mikaeel's family said they felt excluded by social work from decisions about the children's future The language is interesting. They say the deaths could not have been ""predicted"" or ""anticipated"". That is true, but our investigation suggests there is much missing in these official versions of events. Our TV documentary - Fife's Child Killing: the Untold Story - spent months putting the pieces together but the key has been talking to the children's families, or those closely involved in their care. Many whom have agreed to talk publicly for the first time. In Madison's case her grandparents and her mother are left in despair that the Significant Case Review says neither she nor her mum were known to social services but doesn't mention that her murderer was. Madison's mother said she wouldn't have been in a relationship with Park if she knew of his past Kevin Park's social worker was later to face disciplinary action and was found to have put Madison and her mother ""at risk"" by failing to warn her about her new boyfriend's violent past. Mikaeel's grandfather told me his family are still not happy with the answers they have been given about social work involvement in the child's life. He says the family felt excluded from decisions about their grandchildren's care, despite contacting social work about concerns they had. Dr Bangarpet Krishnaswamy said the family contacted Fife Council social services two or three times with concerns about the welfare of Rosdeep's children but they felt excluded from any decision making process about their future. Despite their close involvement in the children's lives they said they felt ""eliminated from the scene"". The family also have concerns about the Significant Case Review into Mikaeel's death. Dr Krishnaswamy said he had to initiate involvement with the SCR and that the family were not happy with the findings because it did not answer their key questions. He said: ""When the review body was set up, I wrote to them and said I'd like to explain some of my concerns. Until then they didn't contact me. I made the contact."" He also believes these types of investigations do not promote a culture of learning and should be more public and independent. ""We're all capable of making mistakes and in a big structure it will happen more often, but there seemed to be a lack of accepting that the council need to be upgraded in their knowledge,"" he said.""I think we should develop a culture happy to disclose details."" But perhaps the most compelling has been hearing from Heather Farmer, Liam Fee's childminder. She agreed to share her experience with us because she wishes ""someone had helped him"". She tried to. Time and time again she tried to raise the alarm, spotting the ""manipulative"" and ""devious"" behaviour of Rachel and Nyomi as they covered up their abuse with lies. Heather Farmer contacted social work on three occasions with concerns about injuries on Liam Long before Liam died, Heather Farmer had witnessed the behaviour that the Significant Case Review points to professionals missing over and over again. One social worker has admitted she made mistakes. That is Lesley Bate, who was struck off last year for putting vulnerable children, including Liam, at risk. She is, as far as we can tell, the only person to have been disciplined for Liam's case. Yet, as she told me, she stopped working on it in April 2013, almost a year before he died. Yes, she says, she should have done more, but who else failed to pick up his case? Is it as simple as casting blame on one frontline member of staff who claims she was struggling in a dysfunctional department? Lesley Bate admitted mistakes with Liam's case but said others should be held accountable too Fife council issued statements to our investigation on each of the deaths but refused to do an on-camera interview. It has been frustrating that nobody involved in Child Protection in Fife would agree to do an on-camera interview to directly address the questions we have about each of these cases. They say things have improved, that child protection is a priority and that they have learned from these tragic deaths. But is that good enough for the people who loved and cherished these children? Or the people who tried to help them? They are still grieving, still feeling guilt, wondering 'what if'? Have they had the open, honest and transparent answers they deserve?

Reward reissued in Corrie Mckeague search,"Corrie Mckeague's mother has said a Â£50,000 reward has been reissued to try to help find him A Â£50,000 reward for information to find missing airman Corrie Mckeague has been offered again. The 23-year-old vanished during a night out in Bury St Edmunds, Suffolk, last September. His mother Nicola Urquhart said she still believed someone knew what had happened to him. The reward, offered again by Suffolk businessman Colin Davey,was withdrawn in Februarybecause it had not led to any new information. On the Find Corrie Facebook page, Mrs Urquhart wrote she hoped the ""life-changing"" sum would help to find her son. ""From the first time I spoke publicly about Corrie disappearing I have said someone knows -  I still truly believe that,"" she said. ""Suffolk police have carried out an enormous amount of work to try to find Corrie. ""However, they can only continue to do this if they have lines of enquiry and information coming into them."" Police said they believed Mr Mckeague had been ""transported"" to the Milton landfill site Suffolk police said this week they still believed it waslikely Mr Mckeague's remains were in a landfill site in Milton, Cambridgeshire,where they ended a20-week search last month. The gunner, originally from Fife, had been serving at RAF Honington in Suffolk when he was last seen entering a bin loading bay - known as ""the Horseshoe"" - in Bury St Edmunds on 24 September. In the Facebook post, Mrs Urquhart said the landfill search had been ""paused"" while an independent review was carried out, which could recommend that Suffolk police still examine specific parts of the site. She urged anyone with information that it was ""not too late to do the right thing"" and call the force - even if they had done so before. ""For your own soul and conscience please come forward - help us to find Corrie, I need my boy home,"" she wrote.

UN backs fresh North Korea sanctions,"This video can not be played Nikki Haley: Resolution ""put the North Korean dictator on notice"" The United Nations Security Council has agreed on fresh sanctions against North Korea over its missile programme. A resolution banning North Korean exports and limiting investments in the country was passed unanimously. The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said it was ""the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation"". Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit the US. However, experts doubt the capability of the missiles to hit their targets. The tests were condemned by South Korea, Japan and the US, and prompted the drafting of the new UN sanctions. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson is attending a regional forum of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) in Manila, in the Philippines, with North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho also present. North Korea's nuclear programme is expected to be a major issue but there are no plans for a bilateral meeting, US officials say. Speaking as he sat down for talks with South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha, Mr Tillerson said the sanctions were a ""good outcome"". North Korea: 'All US within missile range' North Korea's missile programme US President Donald Trumptweeted,externalto say the sanctions would cost the North more than $1bn (Â£0.7bn). The export of coal, ore and other raw materials to China is one of North Korea's few sources of cash. Estimates say that North Korea exports about $3bn worth of goods each year - and the sanctions could eliminate $1bn of that trade. Earlier this year,China suspended imports of coalto increase pressure on Pyongyang. However, repeated sanctions have so far failed to deter North Korea from continuing with its missile development. This video can not be played North Korea missile ""seen from Japan"" The US ambassador said the Security Council had increased the penalty for North Korea's ballistic missile activity ""to a whole new level"". ""Today the Security Council has come together to put the North Korean dictator on notice,"" Ms Haley told the council after the vote on Saturday. ""North Korea's irresponsible and careless acts have just proved to be costly for the regime."" UK ambassador Matthew Rycroft said: ""North Korea bears full responsibility for the measures we have enacted today. ""It does not have to be this way. North Korea should forgo the path of provocation, forgo the path of further escalation."" Meanwhile, North Korea's ruling-party newspaper Rodong Sinmun said nuclear action or sanctions taken by Washington would lead to an ""unimaginable sea of fire"" engulfing the US. The article, printed before the new UN sanctions were approved, added that if the US did not move away from its ""hostile policy towards Pyongyang,  the only choice for the US is self-destruction"". China, North Korea's only international ally and a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, voted in favour of the resolution this time. It has often protected Pyongyang from harmful resolutions in the past. In Manila, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said the sanctions were ""necessary"" but were ""not the ultimate purpose"". North Korea's Foreign Minister, Ri Yong-ho, will take part in the forum in Manila ""Our purpose is to bring all parties involved in the nuclear issues back to negotiation table, finding the resolutions through talks to realise the denuclearization of Korean peninsula,"" he told journalists. The isolated state's repeated missile and nuclear weapon tests have been condemned by neighbours in the region. What can the outside world do? But South Korea says it may hold direct talks with the North during the Asean summit. Its foreign minister said she was willing to talk to her counterpart from Pyongyang, if the chance ""naturally occurs"". ""I would like to deliver our desire for the North to stop its provocations and positively respond to our recent special offers [for talks] aimed at establishing a peace regime,"" she toldSouth Korea's Yonhap news agency,external. Altogether, 27 nations are sending representatives to the Asean forum. Asean's 10 member statesissued a joint statement,externalsaying they had ""grave concerns"" over North Korea's actions, which ""seriously threaten peace"".

Waterloo disruption work begins,"This video can not be played Passengers react to Waterloo disruption on Saturday Major engineering works that will cause severe disruption at the UK's busiest rail station have begun, as passengers were also delayed by a signal failure. The Â£800m project started on Saturday and will close 10 platforms at London Waterloo until 28 August. South West Trains said it isoperating a significantly reduced service,externalfrom popular commuter locations such as Woking, Guildford and Surbiton. The points failure had caused delays between Clapham Junction and Waterloo. August train delays and how to avoid them Nearly half of all the platforms at London Waterloo will be closed for the engineering works This video can not be played How will the disruption affect your journey? The work, which will get Waterloo ready for longer trains and provide space for 30% extra passengers during the busiest times of the day,will mean there will be no services to and from some stations,external, including Earlsfield, Chessington South and Tolworth. To ease some of the impact of the work the old Eurostar platforms are being used at Waterloo for the first time since the cross-Channel train service relocated to London St Pancras in 2007. Rail chiefs urged passengers to consider taking a holiday, working from home or travelling earlier or later than normal while the project is under way. Network Rail chief executive Mark Carne has previously admitted he is ""worried there will be challenging days"" and accepted that ""there are going to be days when the service is very difficult for people"". The signal failure is causing delays between Clapham Junction and Waterloo Passengers were stuck in the delays London Waterloo It has 19 platforms An average of 270,000 journeys are normally made to or from Waterloo every day More than 99 million passenger journeys were made from Waterloo in 2016 South West Trains operates 1,600 trains a day, carrying 651,000 passengers, making it the busiest commuter operator in Europe First Group and Hong Kong-based MTR will take over the South West Trains franchise from Stagecoach on 20 August. The Waterloo work will culminate over the August bank holiday weekend, when it will be one of a number of large projects being carried out. The weekend will see major disruption on trains out of London Bridge, London Euston, London Liverpool Street and London Paddington, as well as Waterloo. Network Rail will hand out free ice cream at London Victoria, London Bridge and Euston next week as part of a promotional campaign to remind people to plan their journeys in advance. It said it carries out major engineering work on bank holidays as up to 50% fewer passengers use the railway during those periods.

Bride's ring stolen on wedding day,"The white gold ring had been specially designed by Mrs Warner Gale A newly-wed is appealing for the return of her engagement ring which was stolen from a church car park in Dorset on her wedding day. Lusea Warner married James Gale at Symondsbury on Wednesday but discovered her ring had been taken when her maid of honour's car was broken into. It had been specially designed by Mrs Warner Gale to match her wedding ring. She has appealed on social media for its return, describing herself as a ""heartbroken bride"". Mrs Warner Gale discovered the ring had been stolen after her wedding service Mrs Warner Gale, who lives in East Lulworth, said a handbag containing the white gold and simulated diamond ring had been put in the maid of honour's car parked outside the 14th Century church. Two cars were thought to have been broken into sometime after 15:30 BST. The break-ins were reported to police. Mrs Warner Gale said she ""broke down in tears"" later in the evening at her wedding breakfast when she realised the bag had been taken. ""Symondsbury is such an idyllic English country village, which is why we are all so shocked and confused."" She said the engagement ring had been ""designed to go together"" with her wedding ring as ""they sit into one another and together they represent all that I love - the sea and James"".

Rouhani warns Trump over nuclear deal,"This video can not be played Mr Rouhani said Iran would ""respond to violations"" Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has warned US President Donald Trump he risks political suicide if he scraps the nuclear deal with Tehran. At his swearing-in ceremony, Mr Rouhani said Iran would continue to abide by the terms of the deal as long as the other signatories do the same. The White House says Iran is complying with the deal but Mr Trump says Iran is violating its spirit. Last month the US state department announced new sanctions on the country. The US says the sanctions relate to Iran's missile programme and alleged support for terror groups but Tehran says they violate the nuclear deal. Tense but unclear Trump-Iran relations Will Rouhani deliver? Mr Rouhani - being sworn in for a second term after winning presidential elections in May - said he had nothing to do with ""newcomers to the world of politics"" and urged ""old-timers"" to see the nuclear deal as an example of how to manage international relations. ""Those who want to tear apart the JCPOA [nuclear deal] should know that they would also be tearing apart their political life,"" he said in a ceremony broadcast live on state TV. He accused the US of a ""lack of commitment"" to the deal and said it was an ""unreliable partner"". EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini (C) was among guests at the inauguration Meanwhile Iranian officials have been urging Europe not to side with the Trump administration. Foreign Minister Javad Zarif said Mr Trump was ""trying to destroy the nuclear accord at Iran's expense"" and said ""Europe should be conscious of this"", private Tasnim news agency said. Ali Akbar Velayati, a senior adviser to Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, asked Europe to ""take a more independent policy towards Iran"", state media reported. Mr Rouhaniwon 57% of the vote in May's electionafter promising to create jobs and build bridges with the outside world. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (L) is not elected, unlike Mr Rouhani (R) In Iran the ultimate power lies with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. He has been ruling the country for nearly three decades, increasingly like an absolute monarch. Constitutionally he has power to lay down the general guidelines. He is commander-in-chief with the power to declare war or peace and appoint all the top generals, as well as the head of the judiciary. Informally he has been demanding to approve ministers in several key ministries. All this leaves little to the president. But the supreme leader is not elected - he is chosen by a group of clergymen. In May, nearly 24m people voted for Mr Rouhani - a source of power that the hardliners, even the supreme leader, cannot ignore. Dozens of world dignitaries attended Mr Rouhani's inauguration at Iran's parliament, reflecting an easing in Iran's isolation since the nuclear deal. Guests included EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini and the chairman of the North Korean parliament, Kim Yong-nam, signalling a growing closeness between Tehran and Pyongyang particularly over defence matters. Hassan Rouhani: A reformist and moderate Iranians urge Rouhani not to disappoint Last month, the US state department accused Iran of undermining stability, security and prosperity in the Middle East. It criticised Iran's support for the Syrian government and groups such as Hezbollah and Hamas and accused it of prolonging the conflict in Yemen by providing support for Houthi rebels. The state department announcement came a day after the Trump administration certified that Tehran was complying with its nuclear deal obligations.

UK 'must prepare a Brexit fallback',"The UK needs a ""credible fallback"" in case no EU trade deal is reached during Brexit negotiations, former Bank of England governor Mervyn King has said. Lord King said British negotiators needed to show Brussels the country has an alternative over a bad trade deal post-Brexit. The former governor, who served between 2003 and 2013, said no deal was ""not the first preference of anybody"". He said the government ""probably wasted a year"" on its contingency plans. The first round of Brexit negotiations at theEuropean Commission ended in July. Brexit Secretary David Davis said Brussels might delay trade talks due to a lack of progress on the cost  of the UK's ""divorce"" settlement. Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? The people who will negotiate Brexit Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Lord King said: ""We are where we are, and we are in a negotiation and it's important that the negotiation succeeds. ""But it cannot succeed without a credible fallback position and that is something which I think is a practical thing that the civil service ought to be taking a lead on."" Previously Prime Minister Theresa May has said: ""No deal is better than a bad deal."" By Simon Jack, business editor Mervyn King described the coverage of the Brexit debate both before the vote and since as ""hysterical"". When asked his own view of the economic impact of leaving the EU, he said: ""I don't know - that's the only honest answer."" One thing he is sure about is that as the UK approaches the Brexit negotiations, we must be prepared to walk away otherwise our position lacks credibility. By walking away he means falling back on a trade relationship governed by the rules of the World Trade Organisation. ""If you are going to have any success in this negotiation you need to have a fallback position that the other side understands and thinks is credible,"" he said. ""It is not first choice but we have to have an option otherwise the other side won't listen. This ought to be something people can agree on irrespective of whether they voted for Brexit or not."" If the UK left the EU without a trade deal with the 27 other nations it would rely on World Trade Organisation rules, and trade agreements between Europe and other countries may not be available to Britain. On Thursday current governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney announced that uncertainty over Brexit was reducing growth in the British economy. As a result the bank lowered this year's growth forecast from 1.9% to 1.7%. This video can not be played Households have cut spending since Brexit, says Bank of England's Mark Carney Mr Carney said: ""Uncertainties about the [UK's] eventual relationship [with Europe] are weighing on the decisions of some businesses."" Lord King said: ""I don't know what the economic consequences of Brexit will be, that's the only honest answer."" Previously, Brexit minister Steve Baker said the government was preparing for all possible outcomes over Brexit talks, but added a no-deal with Brussels was unlikely.

S Korea open to talks with North,"Kang Kyung-wha said she was willing to speak to her counterpart from North Korea South Korea says it may hold direct talks with the North during a regional meeting this weekend. Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said she was willing to talk to her counterpart from Pyongyang, if the chance ""naturally occurs"". North Korea's repeated missile and nuclear weapon tests have been condemned by neighbours in the region. The United Nations security council is set to vote on fresh sanctions against the isolated state later on Saturday. Foreign ministers from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) are meeting in Manila in the Philippines. South Korea'sYonhap news agency reports,external""cautious expectations"" that Kang Kyung-wha would meet North Korea's Ri Yong-ho on the sidelines of the forum. ""If there is an opportunity that naturally occurs, we should talk,"" Ms Kang told the agency. ""I would like to deliver our desire for the North to stop its provocations and positively respond to our recent special offers (for talks) aimed at establishing a peace regime."" US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will also be attending the weekend's talks, where North Korea's nuclear programme is expected to be a main topic. As the meeting began, Asean membersissued a joint statement,externalsaying they had ""grave concerns"" over North Korea's actions, which ""seriously threaten peace"". Is Tillerson getting ready for a Rexit? N Korea: 'All US within missile range' North Korea's missile programme Pyongyang tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July, claiming it now had the ability to launch a strike against the entire US. However, experts doubt the capability of the missiles to hit their targets. The tests were condemned by South Korea, Japan, and the US, and prompted the drafting of new UN sanctions. This video can not be played North Korea missile ""seen from Japan"" China, North Korea's only international ally, has also criticised the tests. As a veto-wielding member of the UN Security Council, it has often protected Pyongyang from harmful resolutions. Reports say, however, that it is likely to support Saturday's resolution banning North Korean exports and limiting investments. The export of coal, ore and other raw materials to China is one of North Korea's few sources of cash. Estimates say that North Korea exports about $3bn worth of good each year - and the proposed sanctions could eliminate $1bn of that trade. Earlier this year,China suspended imports of coalto increase pressure on Pyongyang. Repeated sanctions have so far failed to deter North Korea from continuing with its missile development.

Grim weather warning for Europe's future,"Heat waves will cause most weather-related deaths if measures are not taken, the study says Extreme weather could kill up to 152,000 people yearly in Europe by 2100 if nothing is done to curb the effects of climate change, scientists say. The number is 50 times more deaths than reported now, the study in The Lancet Planetary Health journal said. Heat waves would cause 99% of all weather-related deaths, it added, with southern Europe being worst affected. Experts said the findings were worrying but some warned the projections could be overestimated. If nothing is done to cut greenhouse gas emissions and to improve policies to reduce the impact against extreme weather events, thestudy,externalby the European Commission's Joint Research Centre says: Deaths caused by extreme weather could rise from 3,000 a year between 1981 and 2010 to 152,000 between 2071 and 2100 Two in three people in Europe will be affected by disasters by 2100, against a rate of one in 20 at the start of the century There will be a substantial rise in deaths from coastal flooding, from six victims a year at the start of the century to 233 a year by the end of it The research analysed the effects of the seven most dangerous types of weather-related events - heat waves, cold snaps, wildfires, droughts, river and coastal floods and windstorms - in the 28 EU countries as well as Switzerland, Norway and Iceland. Warnings as Europe sizzles in 44C heat What is climate change? The team looked at disaster records from 1981 to 2010 to estimate population vulnerability, and combined this information with predictions of how climate change might progress and how populations might increase and migrate. They assumed a rate of greenhouse gas emissions that would lead to average global warming of 3C (5.4F) by the end of the century from levels in 1990, a pessimistic forecast well above targets set by the Paris Agreement on tackling climate change. Low levels of the Po River near Pavia in northern Italy ""Climate change is one of the biggest global threats to human health of the 21st century, and its peril to society will be increasingly connected to weather-driven hazards,"" said Giovanni Forzieri, one of the authors of the study. ""Unless global warming is curbed as a matter of urgency and appropriate measures are taken, about 350 million Europeans could be exposed to harmful climate extremes on an annual basis by the end of the century."" Flooding near the Bavarian village of Deggendorf in southern Germany in 2013 Fire rages through an area of woodland in Artigues in south-eastern France On Friday, the United States issuedits first written notificationto the UN of its intention to withdraw from the 2015 Paris climate agreement. US President Donald Trump drew international condemnation in June when he first announced his decision, saying the deal would cost millions of American jobs. The Paris Agreementsaw nearly 200 countries agree to keep warming ""well below"" the level of 2C (3.6F) above pre-industrial times and ""endeavour to limit"" them even more, to 1.5C Experts from South Korea's Seoul National University warned that the study's results ""could be overestimated"". ""People are known to adapt and become less vulnerable than previously to extreme weather conditions because of advances in medical technology, air conditioning, and thermal insulation in houses,"" they wrote in a comment piece published in the same journal. Paul Wilkinson, a professor at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, who was not involved in the study, said the findings were ""yet another reminder of the exposures to extreme weather and possible human impacts that might occur if emissions of greenhouse gases continue unabated. ""It adds further weight to the powerful argument for accelerating mitigation actions to protect population health.""

Why you could soon be missing your cup of Darjeeling tea,"Darjeeling is the world's most expensive tea If you are a tea connoisseur, here's some bad news: your morning cuppa of steaming Darjeeling tea may soon be difficult to get. Famously called the ""champagne of teas"", it is grown in 87 gardens in the foothills of the Himalayas in Darjeeling in West Bengal state. Some of the bushes are as old as 150 years and were introduced to the region by a Scottish surgeon. Half of the more than 8 million kg - 60% of it is certified organic - of this sought-after tea produced every year is exported, mainly to the UK, Europe and Japan. The tea tots up nearly $80m (Â£60m) in annual sales. Darjeeling tea is also one of the world's most expensive - some of it has fetched prices of up to $850 (Â£647) per kg. The tea is also India's first Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) product. Since June, Darjeeling has been hit by violent protests and prolonged strikes in support of a campaign by a local party demanding a separate state for the area's majority Nepali-speaking Gorkha community. How a strike has paralysed life in India's Darjeeling The bitter story behind the UK's national drink In pictures: Why is Darjeeling tea the fine wine of teas The upshot: some 100,000 workers - permanent and temporary - working in the gardens have halted work. Production has been severely hit. Only a third of last year's crop of 8.32 million kg had been harvested when work stopped in June. If the trouble continues, garden owners say they are staring at losses amounting to nearly $40m. ""This is the worst crisis we have ever faced. Future orders are being cancelled, and there is no fresh supply. Connoisseurs of Darjeeling may have to soon switch to other teas until the situation improves,"" Darjeeling Tea Association's principal advisor Sandeep Mukherjee told me. The gardens have been shut since June amid political agitation Weeds have been growing in the tea bushes since work stopped The shutdown in the gardens couldn't have come at a worse time. The harvesting season in Darjeeling extends to roughly a little over seven months - from March to October. It is also divided into four distinct seasons called ""flushes"". The ongoing impasse came in the middle of the second - or summer flush - season which gives the tea an unique ""muscatel"" scent and accounts for half of the yearly crop and and 40% of annual sales. The separatist agitation in Darjeeling has disrupted life in the region since 1980s, but in the past the strikes usually happened during the lull between seasons. Tea buyers are already feeling the crunch. In India, the tea is fast going off the shelves. Some supermarkets in Japan have said their stocks will run out by November if supplies don't resume. An importer in Germany says the tea runs the risk of becoming a ""limited edition"" beverage. Even if the agitation is called off tomorrow and the workers return to the gardens, it will take more than a month to begin harvesting. The gardens have been idle for more than two months, and are full of weeds. Tea bushes have become ""free growth plants"", say owners. Workers have to clean and slash the bushes before they can begin plucking the leaves again. More than 100,000 workers are employed in the 87 gardens Clearly, if the political impasse is resolved this month, the gardens of Darjeeling will be humming only next year - India is heading into a season of yearly festivals, marked by long holidays. ""For the moment, Darjeeling looks like becoming a limited edition tea all right,"" says Ashok Lohia, who owns 13 gardens in the region. ""But I'd just request the connoisseurs to bear with us, and we promise to be back with the our very best quality soon"". For the moment, tea drinkers may have to learn to live without their favourite brew.

US judge sets bail for UK cyber expert,"Marcus Hutchins wanted to remain anonymous after the WannaCry outbreak, but his identity was revealed US prosecutors say a British computer expert has admitted to creating software that harvests bank details. But Marcus Hutchins' own lawyer says he denies six charges of creating and distributing the Kronos malware. The 23-year-old from Ilfracombe, Devon, who helped stall the WannaCry cyber-attack which hit the NHS, was arrested on Wednesday in Las Vegas. He was granted $30,000 (Â£23,000) bail, but will spend the weekend in prison after not being able to pay on Friday. As he left the courtroom Mr Hutchins was ordered to walk with his hands behind his back but he was not shackled. No members of his family were present, but defence lawyer Adrian Lobo presented the judge with a bundle of letters. She said they were from friends and relatives showing support for a client who had never been in trouble with the law in the US or the UK. Mr Hutchins' mother, Janet Hutchins, has said her son's involvement is ""hugely unlikely"" because he has spent ""enormous amounts of time and even his free time"" combating malware. NHS cyber-defender Marcus Hutchins arrested in US NHS ransomware attack's bitcoins moved Blogger halts ransomware 'by accident' Cyber-attack: Is my computer at risk? Defence lawyer Ms Lobo told the BBC: ""He's pled not guilty. He is standing by that and he fights the charges and we intend to fight the case in Wisconsin."" She described the federal indictment against him as ""pretty flimsy, it's pretty slim compared to what we normally see in a United States indictment."" Prosecutors told a Las Vegas court on Friday that Mr Hutchins had been caught in a sting operation when undercover officers bought the code. They claimed the software was sold for $2,000 in digital currency in June 2015. Dan Cowhig, prosecuting, also told the court that Mr Hutchins had made a confession during a police interview. ""He admitted he was the author of the code of Kronos malware and indicated he sold it,"" said Mr Cowhig. The lawyer claimed there was evidence of chat logs between Mr Hutchins and an unnamed co-defendant - who has yet to be arrested - where the security researcher complained of not receiving a fair share of the money. There was no missing Marcus Hutchins as he was brought into courtroom 3C of the US District Court in Las Vegas. The ""surfer who saved the world"" was wearing a bright yellow custody-issue T-shirt and trousers along with luminous orange socks and sandals. Judge Nancy Kobbe was sympathetic to the defendant's plea to be released on bail, waving away a claim from a government lawyer that the cyber-security expert posed a risk to the public because he had gone shooting on a gun range popular with tourists. Mr Hutchins was so softly spoken that several times Ms Kobbe had to ask him to raise his voice. Ms Lobo said Mr Hutchins denied he was the author of the malware and said he would plead not guilty to all of the charges, which date between July 2014 and July 2015. ""He has dedicated his life to researching malware, not trying to harm people,"" she said. ""Use the internet for good is what he has done. ""He was completely shocked, this isn't' something he anticipated. He came here for a work-related conference and he was fully anticipating to go back home and had no reason to be fearful of coming or going from the United States."" Mr Hutchins came to prominence in May this year after finding a ""kill switch"" to stop theWannaCry ransomeware attackthat hit the NHS, as well as other organisations in 150 countries. Also known as ""MalwareTech"" online,Mr Hutchins was hailed as an ""accidental hero""after registering a domain name to track the spread of the virus, which actually ended up halting it. Mr Hutchins, who works for Los Angeles-based computer security firm Kryptos Logi, had been in Las Vegas to attend the Black Hat and Def Con cyber-security conferences. He was arrested at Las Vegas airport minutes before he was due to fly home. This video can not be played Technology explained: what is ransomware? District judge Nancy Koppe, who was presented letters of support from Mr Hutchins' cyber-security colleagues, ordered his release on bail as he had no criminal history and because the allegations dated back two years. However, friends and family were unable to raise the bond money before the court closed on Friday, so he will not be released until Monday. The conditions of his bail include him not being allowed to access the internet and to stay in Clark County, Nevada, and within the Eastern District of Wisconsin, where he will appear in court on Tuesday. He must also be monitored by GPS and surrender his passport. Kronos is a type of malware known as a Trojan, meaning it disguises itself as legitimate software. It is thought to be named after a mythological creature. Kronos first came tolight in July 2014,external, when it was advertised on a Russian underground forum for $7,000 (Â£5,330) - a relatively high figure at the time. It was marketed as way to steal logins for banking websites and other financial data. Its vendor boasted it could evade existing anti-virus software and said it worked with the latest versions of Internet Explorer, Firefox and Chrome web browsers. In an unusual step, the developer promised free upgrades and bug fixes and the option of a $1,000 one week trial. After much publicity it faded from view until October 2015, whenIBM researchers reported,externalthat Kronos had been spotted in attacks on UK and Indian bank websites. Kronos then struck again in Canada in May 2016, and in November reports surfaced that it hadbeen spotted,externalbeing distributed via emails. IT security consultant Robin Edgar said Mr Hutchins' own code had been incorporated into the malware, but he had not done anything wrong. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Mr Hutchins posted a tweet saying, 'look, this Kronos thing has taken my code, stolen my code and used it in it'. ""He was very unhappy his code had been stolen and used within Kronos. He didn't write Kronos, it looks like, but he wrote a little piece of code which was used in the malware."" This video can not be played IT professor: Proving code ownership a 'fundamental challenge' Mr Hutchins' local MP in North Devon, Peter Heaton-Jones, said he shared the ""shock"" of the local community over the charges. The Conservative politician has written to Foreign Office minister Sir Alan Duncan to seek assurance that Mr Hutchins is receiving adequate consular assistance. Whilst Mr Heaton-Jones acknowledged the UK cannot interfere with court proceedings in the US and said he has made no judgement about his constituent, adding: ""People who know him in Ilfracombe, and in the wider cyber-community, are astounded at the allegations against him. ""This is particularly so given his role in helping to protect the NHS and many other institutions from what could have been a devastating cyber-attack just a few months ago. ""I will continue to monitor his case carefully and to seek the necessary assurances from the government that the UK is doing everything in its power to assist Marcus and his family at this very difficult time."" Digital rights group the Electronic Frontier Foundation said it was ""deeply concerned"" with his arrest, whilst Naomi Colvin, from civil liberties campaign group Courage, said Mr Hutchins ""did the world an enormous service"" when he stopped the WannaCry attack.

Eight missing in flooded diamond mine,"This video can not be played The 36-year-old man has been taken to hospital Eight miners are missing after a flood at Russia's largest diamond mine. Water leaked into an underground shaft on Friday morning when more than 100 workers were inside. Most have been rescued from Mir mine in eastern Siberia, according to diamond company Alrosa, which runs it. However, the company said reports that those still missing had been located were not true and the search continues. Divers have reportedly arrived at the scene. The town of Mirny in Yakutia has declared a state of emergency. The adjacent open-pit mine is no longer active as operations have moved underground One man was rescued on Saturday morning. He is in intensive care at a nearby hospital with a bruised lung, but his life is not in danger, Alrosa said. Chief Executive Sergey Ivanov said every effort was being made to find the other workers. The company said 142 people had been brought safely back to the surface so far. Alrosa released this image of workers being counted as they resurfaced The adjacent open-pit mine, one of the world's largest excavated holes, is no longer operational, as mining has moved underground. However, flooding of the exhausted quarry may have caused the problem, according to local emergency services, as water leaked into one of the active mine's pumping stations. The crater contained some 300,000 cubic meters of water, the equivalent of 120 Olympic-size swimming pools, the emergencies ministry said.

Somerville College senior treasury assistant Andrew Warren, 56, handed himself in nearly 2,000 miles away in San Francisco while Prof Wyndham Lathem, 42, gave himself up in Oakland. The pair have been accused of fatally stabbing Trenton Cornell-Duranleau, 26, in Mr Lathem's Chicago flat on 27 July. The killing triggered a US-wide manhunt for the suspects.

'May's top aide breaks silence',"Theresa May's former chief of staff, Nick Timothy, has been speaking to the Daily Telegraph to explain where he thinks the general election campaign went wrong for the Conservatives. In what the paper bills as his first interview since resigning,external- although he did write one magazine article a few days later - he says the Tories lost their majority because they abandoned Mrs May's promise of ""change"" in favour of a ""continuity"" message. Mr Timothy suggests that other advisers chose the style of the campaign - with its close focus on the prime minister's initial popularity -  but says he takes responsibility for what he did. The Telegraph says Mr Timothy insisted he would not point the finger of blame but it says his answers leave no doubt of the tensions that existed between Downing Street staff and the election strategists who were brought in, including Sir Lynton Crosby. ""Mutiny at the National Trust""is the headline on the Daily Mail,external, as it takes up the story about a row involving volunteers at a Norfolk stately home. It says dozens of unpaid guides have quit or refused to work at Felbrigg Hall after being told to wear gay pride badges as part of a campaign. The Telegraph, which reported this on Friday,external, says the Trust is now facing an exodus of members, with scores cancelling or refusing to renew their membership. The head of the organisation, Dame Helen Ghosh, has written to the Telegraph defending both the badges and a film about Robert Ketton-Cremer, who gifted them the hall, which critics say has outed him as gay. But theDaily Express,externalaccuses her of being a ""politically correct commissar"" and accuses the trust of bullying Janet Street-Porter,writing in the i newspaper,external, calls rainbow badges ""crass"", and says: ""I'd like to think that were Mr Ketton-Cremer alive, he would feel his contribution to our rich cultural and social mix was worth more than a silly badge."" The Times says comments about Brexit,externalby the Republic of Ireland's Prime Minister Leo Varadkar showed a ""marked shift of tone"" for Dublin. It says he attacked Brexiteers in the UK government and urged Theresa May to rip up her plans for leaving the single market and customs union. The Mail sees his remarks as a threat to veto,externalBritish trade talks with the EU unless the issue of the Irish border is settled. The Sun says Mr Varadkar appears to be in denial,externalabout Brexit, saying he should accept that the UK will leave the EU. Its editorial urges him to stop trying to stall negotiations. The Telegraph reports that tiny human brains are being grown,externalin the laboratory and could, one day, be used to repair damage caused by Alzheimer's disease. It says Aston University in Birmingham is using human skin cells, transformed into neurons, and then 3D-printed in clusters to resemble the structure of the brain - although they are just 2mm across.

Tories 'should have focused on change',"Theresa May is still prepared to walk away from Brexit talks without a deal, says her former joint chief of staff The Conservative Party should have campaigned for ""change not continuity"" in the general election, one of Theresa May's former leading advisers has said. Nick Timothy told the Daily Telegraph that Downing Street was also guilty of a breakdown in communication with both the public and Whitehall departments. The party clearly underestimated Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, he added. Mr Timothy resigned as the prime minister's joint chief of staff after the Tories lost their majority. He said: ""If the party retreats into a comfort zone that we don't find very challenging, I worry that we will not only fail to address the challenges the country faces but we will also increase the chances of a hard-left government in five years' time."" Mr Timothy was joint chief of staff alongside Fiona Hill, and co-wrote the Conservatives' manifesto going into the general election. Theresa May's top aides quit Who are Nick Timothy and Fiona Hill? Election Results 2017 summary Full UK results breakdown He rejected reports that Mrs May had intended to sack Chancellor Philip Hammond if she increased her Commons majority. Mrs May is still prepared to walk away from Brexit talks without a deal, he added, but her hopes of reversing the ban on new grammar schools are over. Nick Timothy was Theresa May's joint chief of staff Mr Timothy said plans for ministers to play a bigger part in the election campaign were overruled by party strategists. He conceded it ""probably is true that there should have been more on the economy during the campaign"". ""Overall the lesson of the election for the party and for the government cannot be: 'Oh well, we tried that and we didn't win the election we were hoping for so let's not try it any more',"" he said. ""If the party retreats to a much more orthodox Conservative proposition then I worry that won't be sufficient to tackle the big problems that the country has and in five years' time we do risk the election of a dangerous left-wing alternative.""

The Australian weddings in waiting,"Chelle and Kell cried ""happy tears"" at their wedding During his late teens, Richard Steer was well aware it was illegal to be intimate with another man. ""When I was an 18-year-old boy, exploring what it was to be a gay man, you could be arrested for having sex with another man in Queensland,"" he said. The 47-year-old, who still lives in Brisbane, says although that law is now gone and the Australian state recognises his relationship with his long term partner, it won't let them marry. It has been a long engagement for Australian same-sex couples as it remains unclear if they will ever have the chance to legally wed. Here are some of the weddings in waiting as themarriage equality debate returns again to the political agenda. Richard Steer and Michael Batt met 14 years ago ""My partner has a very serious neurological disease and I am always very conscious that I need to explain my relationship with him,"" said Mr Steer. ""I have a real legitimate fear that one day he will be very sick and somebody will stop me from going into his room to be with him."" The economics consultant met his partner, Michael Batt, 44, in a pub on a Sunday afternoon. About 10 years later they had a commitment ceremony to celebrate their relationship. ""Our friends and family call it our wedding, but it wasn't legal,"" he said. The Brisbane pair, who have been together for 14 years, will marry again if it becomes legal in Australia. ""There are extended legal rights that you get through marriage,"" he said. ""If [Michael] was on life support and I was not recognised as his partner that really concerns me. If I was married, I'd have a piece of paper to prove it."" Annette Cairnduf and Kylie Gwynne had a garden wedding on a warm December day in Canberra Annette Cairnduf, 48, and Kylie Gwynne, 50, were married legally in Australia's capital, but a day later it was annulled. ""This marriage, of two people who had been together for 13 years, was declared invalid - so we're not married anymore. But we were for 24 hours,"" Annette Cairnduff said. A High Court ruling that fell a day after their wedding also quashed the hopes of 31 other newlywed couples who had made vows during a brief window in 2013 when same-sex marriages were legal in the Australian Capital Territory. ""We joke about when we have our second marriage, I will marry my second wife,"" she said. The Sydneysider, who had never before considered getting married, said it was a ""huge blow"" to have her garden wedding ruled unlawful only hours later. ""It was hurtful, our relationship was legally invalid and that's a terrible feeling.  It was a terrible feeling a year later when we got to our first anniversary."" A national non-binding ballot known as a plebiscite was blocked last October - some supporters of same-sex marriage were concerned the vote could be costly and fuel hate campaigns. The issue has recently returned to the political agenda with a postal ballot emerging as an option to resolve the deadlock. Successive polls have found Australians have considerablyincreased their support for same-sex marriage. British High Commission helps gay couples marry in Australia Kylie makes awards plea for gay marriage Gay Muslim's journey to same-sex marriage Ms Cairnduff, who has two sons - aged 18 and 10 - says she will marry her partner again if the laws change, but is adamant the legality would not change the nature of her relationship. ""It's not like I am waiting to get married. I've been committed to Kylie for a long time now and that commitment is unwavering,"" she said. ""It's not about my commitment, it's about the perception and the understanding and the valuing of my relationship differently to other relationships."" Chelle and Kell - 'We deserve the same rights' ""Kell is my best friend, we hate being apart."" Michelle Norris, 50, and Kelly Norris, 35, stepped out of stretch limousines to be given away by their mothers at their wedding in the Botanic Gardens on the outskirts of Sydney. ""We just wanted to get married and to us it was the real deal. It's not legal but it meant as much as,"" said Michelle Norris. During the ceremony, the combined families - including five children and eight grandchildren - released multi-coloured balloons to celebrate the union. Their marriage celebrant has promised to marry the pair again if the legislation changes and to hold the ceremony on the same date, 20 February. The grandmothers, who have both been married to men before, have been together for four years. ""I hope it becomes legal, not just for us but for other couples as well. Heterosexual marriages don't have it perfect either,"" said Michelle. The 50-year-old says she just wants the same rights ""as everyone else"". ""I'll introduce people to Kell as my wife and people look at you and say: 'How can she be your wife' - and they frown upon it,"" she said. ""So many people say it and we're just the same as them. We deserve the same rights as they do.""
