'Opportunity lost' as longest climate talks end,"Some of the difficult issues proved impossible to resolve in Madrid The longest United Nations climate talks on record have finally ended in Madrid with a compromise deal. Exhausted delegates reached agreement on the key question of increasing the global response to curbing carbon. All countries will need to put new climate pledges on the table by the time of the next major conference in Glasgow next year. Divisions over other questions - including carbon markets - were delayed until the next gathering. After two extra days and nights of negotiations, delegates finally agreed a deal that will see new, improved carbon cutting plans on the table by the time of the Glasgow conference next year. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands Reaction to the deal All parties will need to address the gap between what the science says is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change, and the current state of play which would see the world go past this threshold in the 2030s. Supported by the European Union and small island states, the push for higher ambition was opposed by a range of countries including the US, Brazil, India and China. However a compromise was agreed with the richer nations having to show that they have kept their promises on climate change in the years before 2020. Next year's big climate conference will be held in Glasgow, Scotland - and that heaps enormous pressure on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He's already been warned by environmentalists that he will be ""humiliated"" if he tries to lead other nations whilst the UK is still failing to meet its own medium-term climate targets. The UK's climate advisers warn that tens of millions of homes must be insulated. Other experts say Mr Johnson's Â£28.8bn road-building plans are not compatible with eliminating CO2 emissions. They say even fully electric cars won't solve the problem completely - and urge the government to help people walk and cycle to benefit their health and the environment. They also say expanding aviation will increase emissions. Mr Johnson's Brexit decisions will play a part too. The US won't discuss climate change in any trade deal. Meanwhile the EU is putting a border tax on countries that don't cut greenhouse gases. It will be impossible to please both. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was disappointed by the result. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said, quoted by AFP. 'Another year of failure' Meanwhile, Laurence Tubiana from the European Climate Foundation, and an architect of the Paris agreement, described the result as ""really a mixed bag, and a far cry from what science tells us is needed."" ""Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations, but thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters."" Decisions on other issues including the thorny question of carbon markets have been delayed until Glasgow. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA This aspect of the deal was welcomed by campaigners. ""Thankfully the weak rules on a market based mechanism, promoted by Brazil and Australia, that would have undermined efforts to reduce emissions has been shelved and the fight on that can continue next year at COP26 in Glasgow,"" said Mohamed Adow, with the group Power Shift Africa. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Many of those in attendance were unhappy with the overall package, feeling it did not reflect the urgency of the science. Spain's acting Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the mandate was clear. ""Countries have to present more ambitious NDCs [nationally determined contributions] in 2020 than what we have today because it is important to address science and the demands of people, as well as commit ourselves to do more and faster."" However, negotiators will be satisfied to have kept the process alive after these difficult and complex talks in Madrid. The world is now nearly one degree Celsius warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The 20 warmest years on record have all occurred in the past 22 years,external, with the years from 2015-2018 making up the top four. The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise by 3-5C by the end of this century. A threshold of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policy makers have argued thatkeeping temperature rise to within 1.5C is a safer limit for the world. But an IPCC report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target wouldrequire ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". There are varying degrees of uncertainty about the scale of potential impacts. But the changes could drive freshwater shortages, bring sweeping changes to our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms, heat waves and droughts. Even if we cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically now, scientists say the effects will continue because parts of the climate system, particularly large bodies of water and ice, can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. It also takes greenhouse gases decades to be removed from the atmosphere.

Licence fee decriminalisation being considered,"The government is to consider whether failure to pay the TV licence fee should cease to be a criminal offence, a Treasury minister has said. Rishi Sunak confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a review of the sanction for non-payment of the Â£154.50 charge, which funds the BBC. Prosecution for non-payment of the fee can currently end in a court appearance and potential fine of up to Â£1,000. But the BBC warned decriminalisation could cost it Â£200m a year. TheSunday Telegraph reported,externalthe consultation had been ordered by the PM after the Conservatives won a majority of 80 at last week's election. Asked whether non-payment of the fee should be decriminalised, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""That is something the prime minister has said we will look at, and has instructed people to look at that"". ""I think it's fair to say people find the criminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee to be something that has provoked questions in the past,"" he said. Johnson 'could look at' abolishing BBC licence fee PM: BBC must 'cough up' for over-75s TV licences Government defeated over licence fee Mr Sunak did not elaborate on an alternative method that could be used to enforce payment of the TV licence. However a previousgovernment review,externalin 2015 looked into whether a fine for non-payment could be issued under civil law instead, similar to the fees for breaking parking, bus lane and congestion charge rules. The review also examined whether unpaid TV licence fees should be considered a civil debt in the same way as unpaid utility bills or council tax. However, it recommended against changing the criminal sanctions regime, saying decriminalisation could bring with it an increased risk of evasion. It added that penalties brought under civil law could still be enforced using the criminal law as a last resort. Income from the licence fee was worth Â£3.6bn to the BBC in the last financial year, accounting for approximately 75% of the broadcaster's revenues. During the election campaign, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he thought replacing the licence fee entirely needs ""looking at"". ""You have to ask yourself whether that approach to funding a media company still makes sense in the long term given the way that other organisations manage to fund themselves,"" he said. ""The system of funding out of what is a general tax bears reflection"". Mr Sunak said he would not ""speculate"" on the long-term future of the licence fee itself, adding that it had been ""secured"" through to 2027, when the current Royal Charter governing the corporation ends. But he added: ""How people consume media is changing, and it is of course right we continue to look at those things over time."" A BBC spokesman said the previous government review recommended the existing criminal sanctions regime should be maintained. ""The government has already commissioned a QC to take an in-depth look at this matter and he found that 'the current system of criminal deterrence and prosecution should be maintained' and that it is fair and value for money to licence fee payers,"" the spokesman said. ""The review also found that non-payment cases accounted for 'a minute fraction' - only 0.3% - of court time.""

Thousands without water due to faulty valve,"Residents had to queue up to 45 minutes for bottled water being handed out at a local supermarket Residents have been queuing for bottled water after thousands of homes were left without supplies on Friday evening due to a faulty valve. At its peak about 12,000 properties in Leighton Buzzard, Toddington, Hockliffe and surrounding areas were affected. Up to 2,000 homes in Bedfordshire are still without water and residents have been queuing for up to 45 minutes at a nearby supermarket for bottles. Anglian Water handed out the bottles and was working to restore supplies. Local resident Maria Power said: ""The situation is disgraceful it should have been resolved by now."" ""I'm angry at the water company that they are going to leave people without water for nearly 48 hours,"" she told the PA news agency. The valve was fixed on Saturday evening but properties in Leighton Linslade are still without water because of air in the system, Anglian Water said. The firm apologised and warned that water was unlikely to return to the areas until Monday afternoon. One resident said shops in the area had run out of bottled water. Anglian Water said 12,000 properties in Bedfordshire were without water at one point Anglian Water said customers who were in its ""priority list"", such as elderly people or families with young children, had been delivered bottled water. It said engineers were installing an overland pipe to bypass the airlocked water main. Regan Harris, from the company, said: ""Most of our customers will be coming back to water soon. ""There is an area on the northern part of Leighton Buzzard where people may be without water for a little while longer due to an air pocket."" Conservative MP for Leighton Buzzard Andrew Selous said queues have ""dropped down and everyone got their allocation"". Mr Selous tweeted that ""many customers supportive given what a complex issue Anglian Water dealing with.""

China's state TV pulls live Arsenal game,"Ozil, a former Germany international, has been at Arsenal since 2013 China's state broadcaster CCTV has removed Sunday's Arsenal-Manchester City game from its schedule after comments made by Gunners midfielder Mesut Ozil, state media has reported. Ozil posted on social media about the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China. Arsenaldistanced the clubfrom the German's views, saying it was ""always apolitical as an organisation"". The Global Times described,externalOzil's comments as ""false"" and claimed he had ""disappointed"" football authorities. In addition, the Chinese Football Association said Ozil's comments were ""unacceptable"" and had ""hurt the feelings"" of Chinese fans. CCTV will now show Sunday's game between Tottenham and Wolves, instead of a live broadcast of Arsenal's home match with the reigning Premier League champions. In his social media post Ozil, who is a Muslim, called Uighurs ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticised both China and the silence of Muslims in response. China has consistently denied mistreating Uighur Muslims in the country. Rights groups say about a million people - mostly from the Muslim Uighur community - are thought to have been detained without trial in high-security prison camps. China says they are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" to combat violent religious extremism. In October, the US National Basketball Association suffered financial losses after an online comment from a team executive prompted a crisis in its relations with China. Houston Rockets' manager Daryl Morey had tweeted support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. As a result, Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals. Robin Brant, BBC China correspondent in Beijing A few weeks ago I asked someone who is an expert on China-UK relations if the Premier League could face an 'NBA moment' if or when a player criticised China in public. English football's top flight is such a global phenomenon, so diverse in its range of players, so vast in its audience spread. The answer to my question was clearly yes. The NBA's crisis in China showed how serious and how immediate the impact on commercial interests could be. So important is football to the UK and its soft power that very senior British diplomats have pondered the impact on UK China relations of something like this. The reaction to Ozil's comments appears more muted compared to Daryl Morey's Hong Kong support. China's state machinery went after the NBA, not just the man and club. On this occasion it's targeting Ozil and to a limited extent Arsenal. Any lasting damage here is likely to be sustained by him personally. Although there will also be some praise and support. You just won't hear about that in China's state-run media.

Harry Clarke 'sorry' for bin lorry 'accident',"Harry Clarke was unconscious at the wheel when the bin lorry went out of control, killing six people The driver ofa bin lorry which crashed and killed six peoplein Glasgow five years ago says he is sorry for the part he played. Describing it as ""an accident"", Harry Clarke told theMail on Sunday,externalnot a day went by when he did not think about it. Fifteen people were also injured when the bin truck mounted the kerb at George Square just before Christmas. The 62-year-old blacked out while behind the wheel on 22 December 2014.

Law chief defends bin lorry decision Glasgow bin lorry crash: The victims The official inquiry into the tragedy blamed him for not revealing his medical history, including an episode where he was believed to faint while working in a previous job as a bus driver. However, prosecutors previously ruled Mr Clarke would not face criminal charges due to insufficient evidence. They said because he had been unconscious at the wheel of the bin lorry, he did not have the required ""criminal intention"". Mr Clarke told the newspaper: ""I am devastated at what happened. There's all these poor people that are not here and those who were injured. The lorry mounted the kerb before coming to a stop at the Millennium Hotel ""It has been made out that I don't care about what happened. There's not a day goes by I don't think about it.

'Mixed-bag' compromise ends longest climate talks,"Some of the difficult issues proved impossible to resolve in Madrid The longest United Nations climate talks on record have finally ended in Madrid with a compromise deal. Exhausted delegates reached agreement on the key question of increasing the global response to curbing carbon. All countries will need to put new climate pledges on the table by the time of the next major conference in Glasgow next year. Divisions over other questions - including carbon markets - were delayed until the next gathering. After two extra days and nights of negotiations, delegates finally agreed a deal that will see new, improved carbon cutting plans on the table by the time of the Glasgow conference next year. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands Reaction to the deal All parties will need to address the gap between what the science says is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change, and the current state of play which would see the world go past this threshold in the 2030s. Supported by the European Union and small island states, the push for higher ambition was opposed by a range of countries including the US, Brazil, India and China. However a compromise was agreed with the richer nations having to show that they have kept their promises on climate change in the years before 2020. Next year's big climate conference will be held in Glasgow, Scotland - and that heaps enormous pressure on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He's already been warned by environmentalists that he will be ""humiliated"" if he tries to lead other nations whilst the UK is still failing to meet its own medium-term climate targets. The UK's climate advisers warn that tens of millions of homes must be insulated. Other experts say Mr Johnson's Â£28.8bn road-building plans are not compatible with eliminating CO2 emissions. They say even fully electric cars won't solve the problem completely - and urge the government to help people walk and cycle to benefit their health and the environment. They also say expanding aviation will increase emissions. Mr Johnson's Brexit decisions will play a part too. The US won't discuss climate change in any trade deal. Meanwhile the EU is putting a border tax on countries that don't cut greenhouse gases. It will be impossible to please both. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was disappointed by the result. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said, quoted by AFP. 'Another year of failure' Meanwhile, Laurence Tubiana from the European Climate Foundation, and an architect of the Paris agreement, described the result as ""really a mixed bag, and a far cry from what science tells us is needed."" ""Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations, but thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters."" Decisions on other issues including the thorny question of carbon markets have been delayed until Glasgow. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA This aspect of the deal was welcomed by campaigners. ""Thankfully the weak rules on a market based mechanism, promoted by Brazil and Australia, that would have undermined efforts to reduce emissions has been shelved and the fight on that can continue next year at COP26 in Glasgow,"" said Mohamed Adow, with the group Power Shift Africa. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Many of those in attendance were unhappy with the overall package, feeling it did not reflect the urgency of the science. Spain's acting Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the mandate was clear. ""Countries have to present more ambitious NDCs [nationally determined contributions] in 2020 than what we have today because it is important to address science and the demands of people, as well as commit ourselves to do more and faster."" However, negotiators will be satisfied to have kept the process alive after these difficult and complex talks in Madrid. The world is now nearly one degree Celsius warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The 20 warmest years on record have all occurred in the past 22 years,external, with the years from 2015-2018 making up the top four. The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise by 3-5C by the end of this century. A threshold of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policy makers have argued thatkeeping temperature rise to within 1.5C is a safer limit for the world. But an IPCC report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target wouldrequire ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". There are varying degrees of uncertainty about the scale of potential impacts. But the changes could drive freshwater shortages, bring sweeping changes to our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms, heat waves and droughts. Even if we cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically now, scientists say the effects will continue because parts of the climate system, particularly large bodies of water and ice, can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature.

"Me, my camera, my brother... our cancer","When Carly Clarke was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, she set out to photograph how she changed during what could have been the last days of her life. Seven years on, by cruel coincidence, she is at her brother's side, photographing him going through the same ordeal. ""I have my own hair on my hands, on my clothes and down in the bath below me. As I wash, then brush, more continues to fall out. ""In the mirror I can see my appearance change, strand-by-strand."" Carly Clarke is reliving her experience as a cancer patient, showing me one of the many self-portraits she took during six painful months of treatment. Eventually, she would ask her dad to shave the last hairs from her head. She was just 26. ""I used to have a lot of hair. Now I look like a cancer patient,"" she notes. Six months before these photographs were taken, Carly had been living out a dream in Canada - shooting a final-year university photography project in Vancouver's poverty-stricken downtown eastside. She had been sick for months, with a violent cough, appetite loss and pain in her chest and back. Doctors had diagnosed her with illnesses ranging from pneumonia to asthma and warned her she could suffer a collapsed lung on the flight. But she had ignored them. ""I wasn't going to let this illness - whatever it was - get in the way of living my life,"" she says. ""In Vancouver, I could empathise with those with illnesses and addiction. My concern for my own life made me compassionate during the shoot."" Many of those she spoke to on the near-freezing streets had become hooked after taking strong opiates in hospital, as they were treated for serious conditions, such as cancer. Three months later, Carly would need morphine herself to alleviate the pain in her chest and back, so she could sleep. Persuaded by Canadian doctors to go home for specialist attention, she was finally diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma - a rare and quite aggressive form of cancer - in March 2012. A tumour the size of a grapefruit had already grown in her right lung and chest wall. ""I burst into tears at Guy's Hospital in London,"" she says. ""I didn't know if I would survive the chemotherapy treatment, being diagnosed at such a late stage. I was terrified."" It was hard for her family to take. ""My parents felt like their stomachs fell out. There hadn't been a lot of cancer in the family,"" she says. ""My boyfriend was also devastated and he flew out from California to England to be with me."" Back at home in Eastbourne, Carly scrawled hospital appointments and medication timetables on to a calendar that not long before had been packed with coursework deadlines and photoshoots. ""My life slowed down to concentrating on getting through each moment, drug to drug, endless examinations, giant needles, biopsies drilling deep into bone, tubes down my throat, and hoping for some day, the pain to end,"" she says. Pain from her chest was now radiating down her arm, fluid on her lungs made breathing difficult, and she could not shake an ""awful, non-stop cough"". ""A plastic line through my arm fed sickening but healing medicine into my heart, trying to kill the cancer but taking my strength with it,"" she says. ""My skeleton became more visible by the day, a reminder of each precious pound lost. Out of nowhere my life was on the line."" Her view of the world - and herself - was changing. So she decided to photograph it. ""I thought that having a creative outlet would allow me to step out of some of that reality for a moment or two and think about my current trauma from another perspective,"" Carly says. Reality Trauma was to be a series of self-portraits documenting her changing appearance, her life in and out of hospital, and her resilience. During day visits, or short stays, the hospital gave her the freedom to use a tripod and cable release as often as she could. Doctors and nurses sometimes pushed the shutter for her. ""I thought about how others might view these images further down the line and whether or not I would even be around to tell my story,"" she says. Carly wanted her work to inspire others to ""have the courage to stare cancer in the face"" and not let it take over their identity entirely. Image-by-image, Carly noticed her skin was becoming paler and tighter around her bones, giving her an ""unfamiliar, almost alien"" appearance. She lost around 12kg (26lb) in the space of two months and needed regular blood transfusions to make up for circulatory problems that were starving her body of oxygen and turning her blue. ""People were afraid to look at me. Especially, I think, parents with children also going through cancer - because they saw me and probably feared the worst for their own,"" she says. ""Seeing myself that way made me feel uneasy and frightened."" Soon afterwards, she found herself attending hospital so frequently she was admitted full-time. At her lowest, constantly nauseous or asleep, she would reject all food from the hospital trolley. She was unable to study and, some days, too tired to photograph herself or phone her boyfriend. By now she was also coughing so hard she would bring up blood. And sometimes she would wake after a night of cold sweats, itching and drenched as if she had showered in her hospital bed. But then one day, after about three months of chemotherapy, the coughing stopped. Her other symptoms also began to ease. The treatment was working, she thought. Biopsies confirmed it: the cancer was losing. Her perception of life changed again. ""Helplessness turned into hopefulness - and then euphoria. When you come so close to death, suddenly you want to live your life to the fullest."" The hospital ward went from being a place of pain to home. Staff became friends, and some patients even closer. Now Carly would venture outside her room. The fish tank in the communal area of the ward attracted patients of all ages. An elderly couple, being treated for different types of terminal leukaemia, would often undergo chemotherapy on the same day as Carly. One day, the husband said his wife had been told she would not make it to Christmas. ""I remember hugging her and wishing her well - that couple would never leave my mind."" As Carly began to feel better, she also started to connect more with the world outside. Her boyfriend and friends would take her for lunch, sometimes driving to Beachy Head - where white cliffs meet the sea - and Carly would talk about the future while watching boats move slowly across the horizon. From course mates and tutors, she began to realise that her photographs were affecting other people. Not only were they capturing the physical and emotional effects of cancer treatment but demonstrating that it didn't always have to be scary - it could be positive, Carly says. ""Looking back at the images I had taken, it made me feel stronger because in those photos I was faced with an end-of-life situation but a part of me still believed I could get through it."" Carly began showing her work to other cancer patients and took portraits of some of them in the ward. It became a way of starting a conversation or putting a smile on their faces. Carly's photographs captured the mood of those who had undergone successful treatment ""If it's true that a simple smile, small gesture of help or kind word can change how a person feels and brighten their day, and have a positive effect on every cell in one's body, then a positive photographic story can help change someone's life,"" says Carly. ""It can be the defining factor in someone's mental strength and affect their willpower enough to keep them going through the suffering in hope that it will soon end and that, in my opinion, is what helps to keep you alive against all odds."" As Carly's treatment came to an end, in September 2012, she could look back through each phase of her journey, in 15 rolls of film and 150 photographs, and say she survived cancer. Her image titled Last Day of Chemotherapy was shortlisted in the Portrait of Britain Awards 2018 It was a moment for celebration, but returning to the family home - to ""piece her life back together"" - was not easy. When she took back her boxes of unused medicine, she felt sad she was no longer in hospital. ""The hospital staff and some of the patients felt like family to me because we had built a very close relationship over many months."" A few months later, Carly flew to California and stayed with her boyfriend for most of the following year. 'Why me? I had ovarian cancer at 14' The year my cancer changed everything Crystal has face cancer and wants to work in theatre She returned home several times, and visited the hospital ward for the first of her twice-yearly check-ups. Every time she went back, she looked around for old faces: nurses who had treated her, patients she had shared moments with. On one occasion, a few years after finishing treatment, she arrived early for a consultation and sat alongside a woman in the waiting area. ""We casually glanced at each other and suddenly tears came to my eyes."" It was the woman whose husband had told Carly she would not live to see Christmas back in 2012. ""I couldn't believe it was her,"" Carly recalls. ""Moments like this are beautiful."" Carly quickly rediscovered her hunger to document the lives of people around the world. In 2014, she spent four months in India. Her work on that trip would garner honourable mentions in the International Photo Awards in 2018. That same year her ""Last Day of Chemotherapy"" photograph from Reality Trauma was shortlisted in the Portrait of Britain Awards. She got work assisting photographer Michael Wharley, producing promotional images for Summerland, a forthcoming film starring Gemma Arterton. As her inbox filled with awards invitations and her calendar with shoot schedules, she began drawing up a project concept with her local hospice, St Wilfred's, to take portraits of cancer patients in their last stages of life. She wanted to document how terminal illnesses affect people's psychological state, and the ways patients spend their remaining moments, trying new hobbies or saying last goodbyes. But that plan was halted abruptly in September last year by a phone call from her older brother, Lee. He told her their younger brother, Joe, had been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma - the very same cancer Carly had beaten six years earlier. ""We both shed tears on the phone,"" says Carly. Joe was just 16 and starting college. His cancer was less advanced than Carly's had been but - just like his sister - he had also been ill for months before being diagnosed. Doctors had initially put his severe itching down to ""dry skin"", or imagination. ""He wasn't prepared for his diagnosis. None us of were,"" says Carly. The NHS says Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in a network of vessels and glands called the lymphatic system. It can quickly spread throughout the body but is also one of the most easily treated types of cancer. NHS: Hodgkin lymphoma,external What is Hodgkin lymphoma?,external(Macmillan Cancer Support) Lymphoma Action,external Joe tried to live as normally as he could, spending time with his girlfriend, learning to drive and making career plans. But as he spent more and more time travelling to hospital and back, his grades took a hit and he began to lose touch with some of his friends. Wanting to spend more time with him, earlier this year Carly asked if she could photograph his cancer journey. He agreed. Sixteen years older than Joe, Carly had left home when he was still young. But, as his only sister, she had always felt a responsibility towards him, teaching him how to draw and paint when he was a toddler. Later, when Carly moved to London for university, they saw each other only occasionally. With each visit, she noticed him stand a little taller, his voice slightly deepen. But now she stood behind the camera in his hospital ward, she captured a rapid change with every photograph. The hair he'd dyed blonde and then coloured flamboyantly, knowing it would fall out, came out in chunks until he shaved it off, as Carly had done, to stop it getting all over his clothes and bedroom floor. He began covering his head in the photos, and talked about wearing a wig. The steroids he took in preparation for the next stage of chemotherapy aged him, and had another dramatic effect. ""Joe put on weight to the point where he was unrecognisable. The pictures also showed his stretch marks from the severe weight gain,"" Carly says. More and more, Joe reached out to Carly for support and advice. As a young boy he'd seen her go through cancer; he knew what the illness had done to his sister, but he also saw her defeat it. ""Even when he had doubts and misgivings, the fact that I recovered meant I could provide him with the hope and positivity to continue his treatment,"" she says. Because Joe's cancer was less advanced, she thought his treatment would be quicker and her photographic series shorter. The collection would represent the journey of a young man overcoming cancer. But Joe's first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful. ""The news shook everybody up a lot. Our relationship changed, it became a little more unstable,"" Carly says. Having suffered a relapse, Joe would have to endure four more months of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplants. His hair, which had begun to grow back, fell out again. Joe said he no longer wanted to be photographed - a decision Carly says she understood and respected - but with time came greater determination and fresh positivity. A month or so later, he changed his mind again. ""The image I liked most was him turning away in a contemplative manner. There, he knew what was to come, and his eyes glared into the distance,"" Carly says. ""It showed how he had changed and how he had adapted to this role of being a young cancer patient."" Against his consultant's advice Joe stopped stem-cell treatment. He feared the side-effects - the breathing trouble, skin problems, jaundice and diarrhoea that can occur if donor cells attack the host - would blight his life. And shortly after taking that decision, in May, his scans came back clear. It meant that he was put into remission and able to join his family on holiday in Menorca, and then at Lee's wedding. He will have regular appointments over the next few months to monitor his condition, but he has lost the weight he gained and his hair is finally growing back again.

"Me, my camera, my brother... our cancerHow a photographer captured a traumatic journey through chemotherapy. Then had to do it all again.","When Carly Clarke was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, she set out to photograph how she changed during what could have been the last days of her life. Seven years on, by cruel coincidence, she is at her brother's side, photographing him going through the same ordeal. ""I have my own hair on my hands, on my clothes and down in the bath below me. As I wash, then brush, more continues to fall out. ""In the mirror I can see my appearance change, strand-by-strand."" Carly Clarke is reliving her experience as a cancer patient, showing me one of the many self-portraits she took during six painful months of treatment. Eventually, she would ask her dad to shave the last hairs from her head. She was just 26. ""I used to have a lot of hair. Now I look like a cancer patient,"" she notes. Six months before these photographs were taken, Carly had been living out a dream in Canada - shooting a final-year university photography project in Vancouver's poverty-stricken downtown eastside. She had been sick for months, with a violent cough, appetite loss and pain in her chest and back. Doctors had diagnosed her with illnesses ranging from pneumonia to asthma and warned her she could suffer a collapsed lung on the flight. But she had ignored them. ""I wasn't going to let this illness - whatever it was - get in the way of living my life,"" she says. ""In Vancouver, I could empathise with those with illnesses and addiction. My concern for my own life made me compassionate during the shoot."" Many of those she spoke to on the near-freezing streets had become hooked after taking strong opiates in hospital, as they were treated for serious conditions, such as cancer. Three months later, Carly would need morphine herself to alleviate the pain in her chest and back, so she could sleep. Persuaded by Canadian doctors to go home for specialist attention, she was finally diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma - a rare and quite aggressive form of cancer - in March 2012. A tumour the size of a grapefruit had already grown in her right lung and chest wall. ""I burst into tears at Guy's Hospital in London,"" she says. ""I didn't know if I would survive the chemotherapy treatment, being diagnosed at such a late stage. I was terrified."" It was hard for her family to take. ""My parents felt like their stomachs fell out. There hadn't been a lot of cancer in the family,"" she says. ""My boyfriend was also devastated and he flew out from California to England to be with me."" Back at home in Eastbourne, Carly scrawled hospital appointments and medication timetables on to a calendar that not long before had been packed with coursework deadlines and photoshoots. ""My life slowed down to concentrating on getting through each moment, drug to drug, endless examinations, giant needles, biopsies drilling deep into bone, tubes down my throat, and hoping for some day, the pain to end,"" she says. Pain from her chest was now radiating down her arm, fluid on her lungs made breathing difficult, and she could not shake an ""awful, non-stop cough"". ""A plastic line through my arm fed sickening but healing medicine into my heart, trying to kill the cancer but taking my strength with it,"" she says. ""My skeleton became more visible by the day, a reminder of each precious pound lost. Out of nowhere my life was on the line."" Her view of the world - and herself - was changing. So she decided to photograph it. ""I thought that having a creative outlet would allow me to step out of some of that reality for a moment or two and think about my current trauma from another perspective,"" Carly says. Reality Trauma was to be a series of self-portraits documenting her changing appearance, her life in and out of hospital, and her resilience. During day visits, or short stays, the hospital gave her the freedom to use a tripod and cable release as often as she could. Doctors and nurses sometimes pushed the shutter for her. ""I thought about how others might view these images further down the line and whether or not I would even be around to tell my story,"" she says. Carly wanted her work to inspire others to ""have the courage to stare cancer in the face"" and not let it take over their identity entirely. Image-by-image, Carly noticed her skin was becoming paler and tighter around her bones, giving her an ""unfamiliar, almost alien"" appearance. She lost around 12kg (26lb) in the space of two months and needed regular blood transfusions to make up for circulatory problems that were starving her body of oxygen and turning her blue. ""People were afraid to look at me. Especially, I think, parents with children also going through cancer - because they saw me and probably feared the worst for their own,"" she says. ""Seeing myself that way made me feel uneasy and frightened."" Soon afterwards, she found herself attending hospital so frequently she was admitted full-time. At her lowest, constantly nauseous or asleep, she would reject all food from the hospital trolley. She was unable to study and, some days, too tired to photograph herself or phone her boyfriend. By now she was also coughing so hard she would bring up blood. And sometimes she would wake after a night of cold sweats, itching and drenched as if she had showered in her hospital bed. But then one day, after about three months of chemotherapy, the coughing stopped. Her other symptoms also began to ease. The treatment was working, she thought. Biopsies confirmed it: the cancer was losing. Her perception of life changed again. ""Helplessness turned into hopefulness - and then euphoria. When you come so close to death, suddenly you want to live your life to the fullest."" The hospital ward went from being a place of pain to home. Staff became friends, and some patients even closer. Now Carly would venture outside her room. The fish tank in the communal area of the ward attracted patients of all ages. An elderly couple, being treated for different types of terminal leukaemia, would often undergo chemotherapy on the same day as Carly. One day, the husband said his wife had been told she would not make it to Christmas. ""I remember hugging her and wishing her well - that couple would never leave my mind."" As Carly began to feel better, she also started to connect more with the world outside. Her boyfriend and friends would take her for lunch, sometimes driving to Beachy Head - where white cliffs meet the sea - and Carly would talk about the future while watching boats move slowly across the horizon. From course mates and tutors, she began to realise that her photographs were affecting other people. Not only were they capturing the physical and emotional effects of cancer treatment but demonstrating that it didn't always have to be scary - it could be positive, Carly says. ""Looking back at the images I had taken, it made me feel stronger because in those photos I was faced with an end-of-life situation but a part of me still believed I could get through it."" Carly began showing her work to other cancer patients and took portraits of some of them in the ward. It became a way of starting a conversation or putting a smile on their faces. Carly's photographs captured the mood of those who had undergone successful treatment ""If it's true that a simple smile, small gesture of help or kind word can change how a person feels and brighten their day, and have a positive effect on every cell in one's body, then a positive photographic story can help change someone's life,"" says Carly. ""It can be the defining factor in someone's mental strength and affect their willpower enough to keep them going through the suffering in hope that it will soon end and that, in my opinion, is what helps to keep you alive against all odds."" As Carly's treatment came to an end, in September 2012, she could look back through each phase of her journey, in 15 rolls of film and 150 photographs, and say she survived cancer. Her image titled Last Day of Chemotherapy was shortlisted in the Portrait of Britain Awards 2018 It was a moment for celebration, but returning to the family home - to ""piece her life back together"" - was not easy. When she took back her boxes of unused medicine, she felt sad she was no longer in hospital. ""The hospital staff and some of the patients felt like family to me because we had built a very close relationship over many months."" A few months later, Carly flew to California and stayed with her boyfriend for most of the following year. 'Why me? I had ovarian cancer at 14' The year my cancer changed everything Crystal has face cancer and wants to work in theatre She returned home several times, and visited the hospital ward for the first of her twice-yearly check-ups. Every time she went back, she looked around for old faces: nurses who had treated her, patients she had shared moments with. On one occasion, a few years after finishing treatment, she arrived early for a consultation and sat alongside a woman in the waiting area. ""We casually glanced at each other and suddenly tears came to my eyes."" It was the woman whose husband had told Carly she would not live to see Christmas back in 2012. ""I couldn't believe it was her,"" Carly recalls. ""Moments like this are beautiful."" Carly quickly rediscovered her hunger to document the lives of people around the world. In 2014, she spent four months in India. Her work on that trip would garner honourable mentions in the International Photo Awards in 2018. That same year her ""Last Day of Chemotherapy"" photograph from Reality Trauma was shortlisted in the Portrait of Britain Awards. She got work assisting photographer Michael Wharley, producing promotional images for Summerland, a forthcoming film starring Gemma Arterton. As her inbox filled with awards invitations and her calendar with shoot schedules, she began drawing up a project concept with her local hospice, St Wilfred's, to take portraits of cancer patients in their last stages of life. She wanted to document how terminal illnesses affect people's psychological state, and the ways patients spend their remaining moments, trying new hobbies or saying last goodbyes. But that plan was halted abruptly in September last year by a phone call from her older brother, Lee. He told her their younger brother, Joe, had been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma - the very same cancer Carly had beaten six years earlier. ""We both shed tears on the phone,"" says Carly. Joe was just 16 and starting college. His cancer was less advanced than Carly's had been but - just like his sister - he had also been ill for months before being diagnosed. Doctors had initially put his severe itching down to ""dry skin"", or imagination. ""He wasn't prepared for his diagnosis. None us of were,"" says Carly. The NHS says Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in a network of vessels and glands called the lymphatic system. It can quickly spread throughout the body but is also one of the most easily treated types of cancer. NHS: Hodgkin lymphoma,external What is Hodgkin lymphoma?,external(Macmillan Cancer Support) Lymphoma Action,external Joe tried to live as normally as he could, spending time with his girlfriend, learning to drive and making career plans. But as he spent more and more time travelling to hospital and back, his grades took a hit and he began to lose touch with some of his friends. Wanting to spend more time with him, earlier this year Carly asked if she could photograph his cancer journey. He agreed. Sixteen years older than Joe, Carly had left home when he was still young. But, as his only sister, she had always felt a responsibility towards him, teaching him how to draw and paint when he was a toddler. Later, when Carly moved to London for university, they saw each other only occasionally. With each visit, she noticed him stand a little taller, his voice slightly deepen. But now she stood behind the camera in his hospital ward, she captured a rapid change with every photograph. The hair he'd dyed blonde and then coloured flamboyantly, knowing it would fall out, came out in chunks until he shaved it off, as Carly had done, to stop it getting all over his clothes and bedroom floor. He began covering his head in the photos, and talked about wearing a wig. The steroids he took in preparation for the next stage of chemotherapy aged him, and had another dramatic effect. ""Joe put on weight to the point where he was unrecognisable. The pictures also showed his stretch marks from the severe weight gain,"" Carly says. More and more, Joe reached out to Carly for support and advice. As a young boy he'd seen her go through cancer; he knew what the illness had done to his sister, but he also saw her defeat it. ""Even when he had doubts and misgivings, the fact that I recovered meant I could provide him with the hope and positivity to continue his treatment,"" she says. Because Joe's cancer was less advanced, she thought his treatment would be quicker and her photographic series shorter. The collection would represent the journey of a young man overcoming cancer. But Joe's first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful. ""The news shook everybody up a lot. Our relationship changed, it became a little more unstable,"" Carly says. Having suffered a relapse, Joe would have to endure four more months of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplants. His hair, which had begun to grow back, fell out again. Joe said he no longer wanted to be photographed - a decision Carly says she understood and respected - but with time came greater determination and fresh positivity. A month or so later, he changed his mind again. ""The image I liked most was him turning away in a contemplative manner. There, he knew what was to come, and his eyes glared into the distance,"" Carly says. ""It showed how he had changed and how he had adapted to this role of being a young cancer patient."" Against his consultant's advice Joe stopped stem-cell treatment. He feared the side-effects - the breathing trouble, skin problems, jaundice and diarrhoea that can occur if donor cells attack the host - would blight his life. And shortly after taking that decision, in May, his scans came back clear. It meant that he was put into remission and able to join his family on holiday in Menorca, and then at Lee's wedding. He will have regular appointments over the next few months to monitor his condition, but he has lost the weight he gained and his hair is finally growing back again. Carly says her images offer stark evidence of how reality changed for the family during a time in which both her and Joe's ""body, mind and soul were tested to the ultimate ends"". ""These photographs I have captured, of both Joe and I, evoke some painful memories for me; however, they also remind me of the huge capacity of the human body to endure through such hellish times. ""This collection of images may give only a glimpse into those times but my hope is that an audience can see not just the horrifying aspects, but also the promise that being a survivor of cancer gives and the tremendous hope for others facing a similar condition.""

Ministers 'reviewing licence fee evasion sanction',"The government is to consider whether failure to pay the TV licence fee should cease to be a criminal offence, a Treasury minister has said. Rishi Sunak confirmed Prime Minister Boris Johnson has ordered a review of the sanction for non-payment of the Â£154.50 charge, which funds the BBC. Prosecution for non-payment of the fee can currently end in a court appearance and potential fine of up to Â£1,000. But the BBC warned decriminalisation could cost it Â£200m a year. TheSunday Telegraph reported,externalthe consultation had been ordered by the PM after the Conservatives won a majority of 80 at last week's election. Asked whether non-payment of the fee should be decriminalised, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show: ""That is something the prime minister has said we will look at, and has instructed people to look at that"". ""I think it's fair to say people find the criminalisation of non-payment of the licence fee to be something that has provoked questions in the past,"" he said. Johnson 'could look at' abolishing BBC licence fee PM: BBC must 'cough up' for over-75s TV licences Government defeated over licence fee Mr Sunak did not elaborate on an alternative method that could be used to enforce payment of the TV licence. However a previousgovernment review,externalin 2015 looked into whether a fine for non-payment could be issued under civil law instead, similar to the fees for breaking parking, bus lane and congestion charge rules. The review also examined whether unpaid TV licence fees should be considered a civil debt in the same way as unpaid utility bills or council tax. However, it recommended against changing the criminal sanctions regime, saying decriminalisation could bring with it an increased risk of evasion. It added that penalties brought under civil law could still be enforced using the criminal law as a last resort. Income from the licence fee was worth Â£3.6bn to the BBC in the last financial year, accounting for approximately 75% of the broadcaster's revenues. During the election campaign, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he thought replacing the licence fee entirely needs ""looking at"". ""You have to ask yourself whether that approach to funding a media company still makes sense in the long term given the way that other organisations manage to fund themselves,"" he said. ""The system of funding out of what is a general tax bears reflection"". Mr Sunak said he would not ""speculate"" on the long-term future of the licence fee itself, adding that it had been ""secured"" through to 2027, when the current Royal Charter governing the corporation ends. But he added: ""How people consume media is changing, and it is of course right we continue to look at those things over time."" A BBC spokesman said the previous government review recommended the existing criminal sanctions regime should be maintained. ""The government has already commissioned a QC to take an in-depth look at this matter and he found that 'the current system of criminal deterrence and prosecution should be maintained' and that it is fair and value for money to licence fee payers,"" the spokesman said.

"China's state TV pulls live Arsenal gameChina's state broadcaster CCTV has removed Sunday's Arsenal-Manchester City game from its schedule after comments made by Gunners midfielder Mesut Ozil, state media has reported.","Ozil, a former Germany international, has been at Arsenal since 2013 China's state broadcaster CCTV has removed Sunday's Arsenal-Manchester City game from its schedule after comments made by Gunners midfielder Mesut Ozil, state media has reported. Ozil posted on social media about the treatment of Uighur Muslims in China. Arsenaldistanced the clubfrom the German's views, saying it was ""always apolitical as an organisation"". The Global Times described,externalOzil's comments as ""false"" and claimed he had ""disappointed"" football authorities. In addition, the Chinese Football Association said Ozil's comments were ""unacceptable"" and had ""hurt the feelings"" of Chinese fans. CCTV will now show Sunday's game between Tottenham and Wolves, instead of a live broadcast of Arsenal's home match with the reigning Premier League champions. In his social media post Ozil, who is a Muslim, called Uighurs ""warriors who resist persecution"" and criticised both China and the silence of Muslims in response. China has consistently denied mistreating Uighur Muslims in the country. Rights groups say about a million people - mostly from the Muslim Uighur community - are thought to have been detained without trial in high-security prison camps. China says they are being educated in ""vocational training centres"" to combat violent religious extremism. In October, the US National Basketball Association suffered financial losses after an online comment from a team executive prompted a crisis in its relations with China. Houston Rockets' manager Daryl Morey had tweeted support for pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong. As a result, Chinese firms suspended sponsorship and telecast deals. Robin Brant, BBC China correspondent in Beijing A few weeks ago I asked someone who is an expert on China-UK relations if the Premier League could face an 'NBA moment' if or when a player criticised China in public. English football's top flight is such a global phenomenon, so diverse in its range of players, so vast in its audience spread. The answer to my question was clearly yes. The NBA's crisis in China showed how serious and how immediate the impact on commercial interests could be. So important is football to the UK and its soft power that very senior British diplomats have pondered the impact on UK China relations of something like this. The reaction to Ozil's comments appears more muted compared to Daryl Morey's Hong Kong support. China's state machinery went after the NBA, not just the man and club. On this occasion it's targeting Ozil and to a limited extent Arsenal. Any lasting damage here is likely to be sustained by him personally. Although there will also be some praise and support. You just won't hear about that in China's state-run media.

The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme The MP Stephen Kinnock, who held his Aberavon seat comfortably for Labour, endorses Lisa Nandy to be the new Labour leader, saying she understands how to lead the party forward. Earlier, Wigan MP Ms Nandy told Andrew Marr she was ""seriously thinking"" of standing for the leadership, as she urged her party to concentrate on winning support in smaller towns. Mr Kinnock says Ms Nandy talks ""very convincingly"" about Labour needing to be rooted in the communities that voted against Labour in this election. ""I think she understands that there are millions of voters in the so-called red wall seats who lent their votes to the Tories this time,"" he says. ""We can win that vote back."" Labour's ""red wall"" across the Midlands and the north of England - the bedrock of the party's support for generations - crumbled in this election as the Conservatives claimed key marginal seats.

Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Correspondent The leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, Jackson Carlaw, has effectively rejected a membership application from UKIP's former leader in Scotland, David Coburn. Mr Coburn contacted the BBC on Saturday to say that he had joined the Tories to help Boris Johnson âsave the Unionâ in any future independence referendum campaign. He also confirmed that he would be backing the Scottish Tories in the 2021 Holyrood elections. But Mr Coburn, who served as an MEP for Scotland from 2014 to 2019 and as leader of UKIP in Scotland, is a highly controversial figure. The Scottish justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, said Mr Coburn had used an Islamophobic slur against him when he called him ""Abu Hamza"". At the time, Mr Coburnapologised for the comment,which he made during a newspaper interview, and said it was an ""inappropriate joke"". Mr Yousaf said that if Mr Coburn was allowed to join the Tories, it would confirm that Islamophobia was âsystemicâ in the party. But the Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, has moved to block Mr Coburnâs membership. On social media, Mr Carlaw said Mr Coburnâs past comments were âincompatibleâ with Tory membership and that he âcannot and will notâ support his application. Allow Twitter content?

John Pienaar Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more).

Lord Ricketts, who is also the UK's former national security adviser, adds: ""I'm cautious about a big upheaval especially when we face a year with the EU where we're going to have to have some enormously complex negotiations about our future relationship. ""No doubt there will be some change but I would not go for a large shake-up."" He says the civil service ""has not been the problem over these last chaotic three-and-a-half years"". ""Indeed I could make the case that the civil service has kept the country on the road while the politicians have squabbled about Brexit.

Wera Hobhouse was reelected in Bath, which she has represented since 2017 Bath's Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse has questioned whether the British people are ready to have a first-generation immigrant lead a major political party. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics West this morning, she said she was regularly referred to as ""German-born"" Wera Hobhouse, implying that she could not represent the British people. Even so, she has refused to rule herself out of the contest to succeed Jo Swinson as her party's leader, saying it was a ""discussion"" she is ready to have. Wera Hobhouse was born in Hanover, Germany, and moved to the UK in 1990. She said:
""I'm a first generation immigrant and we have just voted for a party that has stoked up anti-immigrant feeling. ""I need to have that discussion of whether being a first-generation immigrant is standing in the way of the Liberal Democrats fighting prejudice and anti-foreigner sentiment. ""Or is it the first thing that will always colour what is going to be said by the Liberal Democrats? That is, 'She is not British, she is German-born.' ""The right-wing press always talks about me as 'German-born Wera Hobhouse.' It's a big issue. I've had it in the Daily Mail and over the years. The underlying thing is that she doesn't speak for the British people."" Political guests appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr show and Pienaar's Politics as well as Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday Sky News More on Sky's interview with Caroline Flint this morning, where she blamed both Labour's Brexit stance and leadership under Jeremy Corbyn as reasons for the party's defeat. Ms Flint also blamed shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and other Remain figures in the party for the loss of the seats. And she claimed Ms Thornberry, MP for Islington South and Finsbury, told one of her colleagues that âIâm glad my
constituents arenât as stupid as yoursâ. The BBC has approached Ms Thornberry for a comment. Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Ms Flint said: ""Iâm sorry - itâs not acceptable. ""I do believe that in the
pursuit of Remain, a number of people who've been ardent Remainers in our
party, on our front bench - people like Keir Starmer, people like Emily
Thornberry - but many others - Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper - they have
contributed to sacrificing 59 seats. ""I donât believe anybody
who have been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is
credible to be leader. I donât think they can win back these seats."" She also said the only people
âworth looking atâ to be the next leader were Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy says she is ""seriously thinking"" about running as a candidate to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader.

Wera Hobhouse was reelected in Bath, which she has represented since 2017 Bath's Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse has questioned whether the British people are ready to have a first-generation immigrant lead a major political party. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics West this morning, she said she was regularly referred to as ""German-born"" Wera Hobhouse, implying that she could not represent the British people. Even so, she has refused to rule herself out of the contest to succeed Jo Swinson as her party's leader, saying it was a ""discussion"" she is ready to have. Wera Hobhouse was born in Hanover, Germany, and moved to the UK in 1990. She said:
""I'm a first generation immigrant and we have just voted for a party that has stoked up anti-immigrant feeling. ""I need to have that discussion of whether being a first-generation immigrant is standing in the way of the Liberal Democrats fighting prejudice and anti-foreigner sentiment. ""Or is it the first thing that will always colour what is going to be said by the Liberal Democrats? That is, 'She is not British, she is German-born.' ""The right-wing press always talks about me as 'German-born Wera Hobhouse.' It's a big issue. I've had it in the Daily Mail and over the years. The underlying thing is that she doesn't speak for the British people."" Political guests appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr show and Pienaar's Politics as well as Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday Sky News More on Sky's interview with Caroline Flint this morning, where she blamed both Labour's Brexit stance and leadership under Jeremy Corbyn as reasons for the party's defeat. Ms Flint also blamed shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and other Remain figures in the party for the loss of the seats. And she claimed Ms Thornberry, MP for Islington South and Finsbury, told one of her colleagues that âIâm glad my
constituents arenât as stupid as yoursâ. The BBC has approached Ms Thornberry for a comment. Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Ms Flint said: ""Iâm sorry - itâs not acceptable. ""I do believe that in the
pursuit of Remain, a number of people who've been ardent Remainers in our
party, on our front bench - people like Keir Starmer, people like Emily
Thornberry - but many others - Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper - they have
contributed to sacrificing 59 seats. ""I donât believe anybody
who have been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is
credible to be leader. I donât think they can win back these seats."" She also said the only people
âworth looking atâ to be the next leader were Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey.

The World This WeekendRadio 4 programme The MP Stephen Kinnock, who held his Aberavon seat comfortably for Labour, endorses Lisa Nandy to be the new Labour leader, saying she understands how to lead the party forward. Earlier, Wigan MP Ms Nandy told Andrew Marr she was ""seriously thinking"" of standing for the leadership, as she urged her party to concentrate on winning support in smaller towns. Mr Kinnock says Ms Nandy talks ""very convincingly"" about Labour needing to be rooted in the communities that voted against Labour in this election. ""I think she understands that there are millions of voters in the so-called red wall seats who lent their votes to the Tories this time,"" he says. ""We can win that vote back."" Labour's ""red wall"" across the Midlands and the north of England - the bedrock of the party's support for generations - crumbled in this election as the Conservatives claimed key marginal seats.

Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Correspondent The leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, Jackson Carlaw, has effectively rejected a membership application from UKIP's former leader in Scotland, David Coburn. Mr Coburn contacted the BBC on Saturday to say that he had joined the Tories to help Boris Johnson âsave the Unionâ in any future independence referendum campaign. He also confirmed that he would be backing the Scottish Tories in the 2021 Holyrood elections. But Mr Coburn, who served as an MEP for Scotland from 2014 to 2019 and as leader of UKIP in Scotland, is a highly controversial figure. The Scottish justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, said Mr Coburn had used an Islamophobic slur against him when he called him ""Abu Hamza"". At the time, Mr Coburnapologised for the comment,which he made during a newspaper interview, and said it was an ""inappropriate joke"". Mr Yousaf said that if Mr Coburn was allowed to join the Tories, it would confirm that Islamophobia was âsystemicâ in the party. But the Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, has moved to block Mr Coburnâs membership. On social media, Mr Carlaw said Mr Coburnâs past comments were âincompatibleâ with Tory membership and that he âcannot and will notâ support his application. Allow Twitter content?

Former Scottish Labour MP Ged Killen says democracy means Scotland must be allowed to hold another independence referendum - ""even if we don't like it"". Mr Killen campaigned against the proposal but lost his Rutherglen and Hamilton West seat to the SNP's Margaret Ferrier at this election. He says the SNP's success in Scotland, which saw them win 48 out of 59 seats, was built on a promise to hold a second referendum. Allow Twitter content?

John Pienaar Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more). Read more from John about who might run in the party's leadership contest. BBC News Channel Lord Ricketts held various top diplomatic posts before his retirement The PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings is reportedly preparingan overhaul of the civil service, the Sunday Telegraph reports today,external- in order to ensure it delivers on Boris Johnson's agenda. It's not the first time a PM decides after an election they are going to put their stamp on Whitehall with a big shake-up, says former head of the Foreign Office Lord Ricketts. ""In my experience it never achieves the outcome people want. It absorbs the civil service in friction of redoing the plumbing while they should be out there making new policies."" Lord Ricketts, who is also the UK's former national security adviser, adds: ""I'm cautious about a big upheaval especially when we face a year with the EU where we're going to have to have some enormously complex negotiations about our future relationship. ""No doubt there will be some change but I would not go for a large shake-up."" He says the civil service ""has not been the problem over these last chaotic three-and-a-half years"". ""Indeed I could make the case that the civil service has kept the country on the road while the politicians have squabbled about Brexit. ""They planned for no-deal, they turned themselves inside out to find a way of getting Theresa May's contradictory red lines to work, then they turned their attention to Boris Johnson's [revised deal]. ""Each time they delivered."" If you thought things might quieten down after the election, you'd be wrong Tony BonsignoreBBC Westminster This next week is going to be a huge one in Westminster and in Parliament. You've got all these new MPs trooping in tomorrow and Tuesday, going to be sworn in. Thursday is the first really big day for this government now because it's the Queen's Speech. It's the chance for them to set out what their priorities are beyond Brexit. We're going to have a very busy few weeks with the government trying to get Brexit legislation through Parliament in time for that key date, 31 January -  the latest and, what the government hopes, will be the final Brexit day. And beyond that, there's all sorts of talk about a major rethink of the way that government works. And we know that, for example, is a big pet project of Boris Johnson's special adviser Dominic Cummings. Former Tory MP Sam Gyimah, who joined the Lib Dems in September, says his party has ""much to be proud of"". He was one of21 Tories who had the whip removed,externalafter rebelling over Brexit. He went on to stand for election as a Lib Dem in Kensington but lost. Mr Gyimah says ""campaigns are not about one person"", adding that ""the wheel of history will turn again"". The Lib Dems now have 11 seats, one fewer than at the 2017 election after leader Jo Swinson lost her seat. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News Channel Labour is a ""disaster area"", says political commentator Steve Richards, speaking on the Dateline London programme on the BBC News Channel. ""They lost four elections after 1979 in a row, they've just lost another four in a row. ""This is a party that's so dysfunctional that it cannot win elections when it should be able to do so."" Mr Richards says although on most levels ""it's much harder"" than when they last lost four elections in a row in 1992, when the Tories had a small majority, he thinks it is ""doable"". He says the alliance of voters that Boris Johnson has won is ""a fragile one"". ""Those voters in the north of England who are disillusioned now can become disillusioned again with him in a different way,"" says Mr Richards. ""There is a route back but it needs a giant figure. And I don't know who that giant figure is and it needs the Labour Party to be wholly overhauled because it too often loses elections."" Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith, the MP for Skipton and Ripon, says he had ""good calls"" with the leaders of Northern Ireland's parties this morning and is looking forward to getting Stormont ""back up and running"".

Pienaar: Let the leadership battle begin,"Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more). Labour leadership takes blame over election result Corbyn 'sorry' over Labour's heavy election defeat The Labour leader's closest allies are now busy making the case that Corbynism must survive Corbyn. When I spoke to his former chief cheerleader Len McCluskey, the general secretary of the giant trade union Unite, he told me the fudged message on Brexit - which he attributed, by the way, to Remainers not Leavers, and to the way Mr Corbyn had allowed himself to be pushed into promising a second referendum - had cost votes. The party leadership had been tainted by it. But the radical left-wing policies had been ""popular"" and need not change. Mr Corbyn himself arguedin an article in the Observer newspaper,externalthat he was ""proud we won the arguments"", which begs the obvious question: if this election showed Labour had won the arguments, what would losing the arguments have looked like? Mr McCluskey told me on my BBC Radio 5 Live programme Pienaar's Politics: ""All of Labour's policies were extremely popular. The problem is that, yes, when they were put together, there was a question of credulity - could Labour really deliver all of this. ""As regards Jeremy, yes, there's no doubt that it became an issue on the doorstep because of course, for the last four years, every single day, he has been attacked massively in a way that no politicians have by the media. ""The media, especially the right-wing media, wanted the election to be about Brexit. If I have to say this a thousand timesâ¦ Brexit was the reason for this defeat."" Meanwhile, Labour comrades, including freshly defeated former MPs, say Labour pushed policies on tax, spending and public ownership that some found implausible. Caroline Flint, ejected by the voters of Don Valley, told Sky News the answer could not be ""Corbyn without a beard"". For good measure, Ms Flint landed her Labour Remainer colleague and likely leadership contender, Emily Thornberry, in it knee-deep. She said the shadow foreign secretary had told a fellow MP she was ""glad my constituents aren't as stupid as yours."" Ms Thornberry has since dismissed the anecdote as a ""complete and utter lie"", and has instructed solicitors over the comments. Just as well. Otherwise her prospects in the leadership race might easily have grown as dim as she now denies characterising Leave voters. Caroline Flint took on Jeremy Corbyn and Emily Thornberry on Sunday morning So who will run? Rebecca Long-Bailey was the first name Mr McCluskey mentioned when I asked him to state his preference. The Corbynista shadow justice secretary, Richard Burgon, has said he'd like to be elected her deputy. It's not clear though that she's keen to run, let alone, one imagines, play the role of Labour's bridge-across-the-barbed-wire. Lisa Nandy hasn't, at the time of writing, declared her candidacy, but she surely will - having told the BBC's Andrew Marr ""seriously thinking about it"". So will Sir Keir Starmer, the great hope of many pro-European centrists. It was telling that John McDonnell told Marr it was time for a ""non-London MP"" to become leader, which appeared to rule out Sir Keir and Ms Thornberry, at least in his view. The shadow chancellor also told Marr: ""If anyone's to blame, it's me. Full stop."" That sounded big of him. Except, of course, that he gave up on his own hopes of becoming leader some time ago, and still means to have some influence in installing the next one. As for Jess Phillips, the combative, charismatic wild card in the race when she joins it, Mr McDonnell volunteered that he would ""prefer someone elseâ¦ someone who actually has been really solidly involved in the development of our existing policy"". He wasn't, of course, sticking around with the aim of helping to install a suitable successor. ""We're not into that sort of conniving politics of the past,"" he said, which will reassure those who want a change of political direction. Unless it doesn't.

Remembering lost babies in Christmas cards,"Laura Jones says including her stillborn son's name brings comfort to her other children A mother who lost her baby has backed a charity's plea to friends of grieving parents not to forget their children in Christmas cards. Laura Jones, 36, from Llanelli, gave birth to her ""treasured"" stillborn son Hudson in November at 19 weeks. Seeing his name in cards helped her other children and ""acknowledges the little life that was"", she said. Essex charity Aching Arms said the gesture could be ""heartwarming"" at a difficult time of year. The organisation, based in Brentwood, sends thousands of teddy bears to grieving families across the UK, both as comforters and to signpost help. ""Not many of my family and friends mention James at Christmas,"" said founder Leanne Turner, who lost her son at 23 weeks in 2009. ""Including their names is an acknowledgement that these babies aren't a secret that shouldn't be spoken about."" Aching Arms founder Leanne Turner says acknowledgement is key to helping parents grieve Some parents said they preferred a symbol or an extra kiss as a reminder of their baby, instead of their name. Ms Turner said while many families loved to hear their babies mentioned, the charity realised some parents would want their loss to remain very private. ""We each have to find our own way to cope, and that is exactly as it should be,"" she said. Jade Merifield says she always signs her son's name on cards and gifts Jade Merifield, 28, of Hillingdon, west London, was heading to hospital to be induced in September 2018 when complications cut off oxygen to her baby. Her son Arlo was stillborn 15 hours later. ""Personally I feel that Arlo was alive for nine months, so he should be included as he would be if he was here,"" she said. ""I get quite insulted when he isn't."" Kirsty Schwegmann says seeing her stillborn daughter's name on a card would fill her with joy In January, Kirsty Schwegmann, who was 22 weeks pregnant with her fourth child, went for a routine scan. Instead, the 42-year-old from Farnborough in Hampshire found out her daughter Naya had died. ""She will always be in our Christmas cards and everything we do,"" said Mrs Schwegmann, now a volunteer for Aching Arms. ""It's helped my children. They find it really comforting knowing she's part of everything."" Kirsty Schwegmann said receiving a card with her daughter's name on it made her ""happy"" She said seeing a card with her daughter's name on it could change her day. ""People think that when you mention their name you're going to get upset but it's the opposite. ""It makes me happy."" A stocking for Naya will be alongside those for her three other children Miss Jones, who is preparing for her first Christmas since losing her sixth child, said she would be donating to charity instead of sending cards. ""It's still raw. I don't ever want to stop talking about him,"" she said. ""Even though he never got to grow up, he existed. He's as much a part of my family as my other children.""

Longest climate talks end with 'mixed bag' compromise,"Some of the difficult issues proved impossible to resolve in Madrid The longest United Nations climate talks on record have finally ended in Madrid with a compromise deal. Exhausted delegates reached agreement on the key question of increasing the global response to curbing carbon. All countries will need to put new climate pledges on the table by the time of the next major conference in Glasgow next year. Divisions over other questions - including carbon markets - were delayed until the next gathering. After two extra days and nights of negotiations, delegates finally agreed a deal that will see new, improved carbon cutting plans on the table by the time of the Glasgow conference next year. Download the BBC Energy Briefing, from October 2019 (10.7MB),external Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Methane pulse detected from South Sudan wetlands Reaction to the deal All parties will need to address the gap between what the science says is necessary to avoid dangerous climate change, and the current state of play which would see the world go past this threshold in the 2030s. Supported by the European Union and small island states, the push for higher ambition was opposed by a range of countries including the US, Brazil, India and China. However a compromise was agreed with the richer nations having to show that they have kept their promises on climate change in the years before 2020. Next year's big climate conference will be held in Glasgow, Scotland - and that heaps enormous pressure on UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson. He's already been warned by environmentalists that he will be ""humiliated"" if he tries to lead other nations whilst the UK is still failing to meet its own medium-term climate targets. The UK's climate advisers warn that tens of millions of homes must be insulated. Other experts say Mr Johnson's Â£28.8bn road-building plans are not compatible with eliminating CO2 emissions. They say even fully electric cars won't solve the problem completely - and urge the government to help people walk and cycle to benefit their health and the environment. They also say expanding aviation will increase emissions. Mr Johnson's Brexit decisions will play a part too. The US won't discuss climate change in any trade deal. Meanwhile the EU is putting a border tax on countries that don't cut greenhouse gases. It will be impossible to please both. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was disappointed by the result. ""The international community lost an important opportunity to show increased ambition on mitigation, adaptation and finance to tackle the climate crisis,"" he said, quoted by AFP. 'Another year of failure' Meanwhile, Laurence Tubiana from the European Climate Foundation, and an architect of the Paris agreement, described the result as ""really a mixed bag, and a far cry from what science tells us is needed."" ""Major players who needed to deliver in Madrid did not live up to expectations, but thanks to a progressive alliance of small island states, European, African and Latin American countries, we obtained the best possible outcome, against the will of big polluters."" Decisions on other issues including the thorny question of carbon markets have been delayed until Glasgow. 2019 10 warmest years 10 coldest years 20th Century average Hotter Colder Source: NOAA This aspect of the deal was welcomed by campaigners. ""Thankfully the weak rules on a market based mechanism, promoted by Brazil and Australia, that would have undermined efforts to reduce emissions has been shelved and the fight on that can continue next year at COP26 in Glasgow,"" said Mohamed Adow, with the group Power Shift Africa. This video can not be played Climate change: How 1.5C could change the world Many of those in attendance were unhappy with the overall package, feeling it did not reflect the urgency of the science. Spain's acting Minister for the Ecological Transition Teresa Ribera said the mandate was clear. ""Countries have to present more ambitious NDCs [nationally determined contributions] in 2020 than what we have today because it is important to address science and the demands of people, as well as commit ourselves to do more and faster."" However, negotiators will be satisfied to have kept the process alive after these difficult and complex talks in Madrid. The world is now nearly one degree Celsius warmer than it was before widespread industrialisation, according to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO). The 20 warmest years on record have all occurred in the past 22 years,external, with the years from 2015-2018 making up the top four. The WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise by 3-5C by the end of this century. A threshold of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policy makers have argued thatkeeping temperature rise to within 1.5C is a safer limit for the world. But an IPCC report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target wouldrequire ""rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society"". There are varying degrees of uncertainty about the scale of potential impacts. But the changes could drive freshwater shortages, bring sweeping changes to our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms, heat waves and droughts. Even if we cut greenhouse gas emissions dramatically now, scientists say the effects will continue because parts of the climate system, particularly large bodies of water and ice, can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. It also takes greenhouse gases decades to be removed from the atmosphere.

Corbyn 'sorry' over Labour's heavy election defeat,"Jeremy Corbyn has apologised to Labour supporters over his party's heavy defeat in the general election. Writing in the Sunday Mirror and the Observer, he acknowledged the party's failings in the poll and said he accepted his responsibility for it. It comes as two likely leadership candidates - Lisa Nandy and Jess Phillips - have set out their stalls ahead of the race to succeed Mr Corbyn. Boris Johnson will unveil his Queen's Speech on Thursday. It will include a commitment to enshrine increases in spending on the NHS in England in legislation. But cabinet minister Michael Gove would not say when the government'sWithdrawal Agreement Billwould return to Parliament, telling Sky's Sophie Ridge it would be a ""top priority"". Mr Johnson won a Commons majority of 80 in Thursday's general election, his party's biggest election win for 30 years, sweeping aside Labour in its traditional heartlands. In contrast, Labour suffered its worst election result since 1935 and saw its vote share fall by 8 points. Who will be Labour's next leader? Election analysis in maps and charts What it's like to lose your seat as an MP Corbyn: 'I did everything I could' In his open letter to the Mirror on Sunday,external, Mr Corbyn said: ""I will make no bones about it. The result was a body blow for everyone who so desperately needs real change in our country. ""I'm sorry that we came up short and I take my responsibility for it."" But Mr Corbyn insisted he remained ""proud"" of the party's campaign, and that it had offered a message of ""hope"" in the election. The Labour leader - who is expected to stand down early next year - added that the party is determined to regain the trust of lifelong Labour voters who had abandoned it. Labour's ""red wall"" across the Midlands and the north of England- the bedrock of the party's support for generations - crumbled as the Conservatives claimed key marginal seats on Thursday night and into Friday. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We are not the masters, we are the servants now"" Mr Johnson went to former prime minister Tony Blair's old seat of Sedgefield on Saturday to thank voters in the north of England for ""breaking the voting habits of generations"" to back the Conservatives. In a speech, he acknowledged  ""how difficult"" that decision could be and said the Conservatives would repay people's trust. Writing in the Observer, Mr Corbyn said his own election campaign had successfully re-set the terms of debate and his manifesto would be seen as""historically important"",external. ""I am proud that on austerity, on corporate power, on inequality and on the climate emergency we have won the arguments and rewritten the terms of political debate,"" he said. However, he said there was ""no quick fix to overcome the distrust of many voters"". Labour MP Margaret Hodge - a longstanding critic of Mr Corbyn's -tweeted,externalthe word ""denial"" in response to the article. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""There is no such thing as Corbynism"" Among the potential candidates to take over the Labour Party leadership are Birmingham Yardley MP Ms Phillips and Wigan MP Ms Nandy. In the Observer, Ms Phillips appeals to people tojoin Labour to change it,external, and argues that too many working-class people do not believe Labour is better than the Tories. While Ms Nandy has said the party haslost touch with the day-to-day lives,externalof the people it wishes to represent. There will be initial discussions next week on drawing up a timetable for electing a new Labour leader. The party's ruling national executive is likely to take the final decision at a special meeting in early January.

The Tories have said that NHS spending will reach Â£33.9bn each year by 2023-4.

The Sunday Telegraph says the PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings is preparingan overhaul of the civil service,externalto ensure it delivers on Mr Johnson's agenda. But Mr Gove said the government would not grant Scotland another referendum on independence, despite the success of the SNP in Thursday's election. The party, which campaigns for an independent Scotland, won 48 seats - up from 35 - and its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, said she had ""earned the right to pursue the plan"" for another vote. Ms Sturgeon, who is also First Minister of Scotland, said: ""They will rage against reality for as long as they can but Scotland has chosen a very different kind of future than most of the rest of the UK, and they cant stand in the way of the will of the Scottish people. ""Fundamentally democracy has to be offered and respected.""

Technically, MPs can hold a vote on this motion but this has never happened in practice. Later in the day, the Speaker will begin the process of swearing in MPs, who are required to take an oath of allegiance to the Crown, or, if they object to this, a solemn affirmation. Those who speak or vote without having done so are deprived of their seat ""as if they were dead"" under the Parliamentary Oaths Act of 1866. Two to three days are usually set aside for this process. Thursday This is the earliest possible day for Parliament's State Opening. The Queen's Speech is the centrepiece of this, when she will read a speech written by ministers setting out the government's programme of legislation for the parliamentary session. A couple of hours after the speech is delivered, MPs will begin debating its contents - a process which takes days. Depending on how rapidly Boris Johnson wants to move, the debate on the Queen's Speech could continue into Friday. This may be interrupted for a second reading debate on the Withdrawal Agreement Bill. MPs previously backed Boris Johnson's bill at its first stage butrejected his plan to fast-track the legislation through Parliament in three daysin order to leave the EU by the previous 31 October Brexit deadline. After the debate on the Queen's Speech is concluded, MPs will vote on whether to approve it. Not since 1924 has a government's Queen Speech been defeated.

McDonnell sorry for 'catastrophic' election result,"This video can not be played John McDonnell: ""This is on me. I own this disaster"" Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell have apologised over Labour's ""catastrophic"" defeat in Thursday's election, which saw them lose 59 seats. Mr Corbynsaid he was ""sorry that we came up short"",,externalwhile Mr McDonnell told the BBC he ""owns this disaster"". The leader and shadow chancellor said they would step down in the new year. The race for their replacements has already begun, with Wigan MP Lisa Nandy saying for the first time she was ""seriously thinking about"" running. Labour Party officials have suggested that Jeremy Corbyn's successor will be in place by the end of March. Jennie Formby, the party's general secretary, has written to the National Executive Committee recommending the contest starts on January 7. Labour suffered its worst election result since 1935 on Thursday and saw its vote share fall by eight points. The Conservatives won a Commons majority of 80 - the party's biggest election win for 30 years - sweeping aside Labour in its traditional heartlands. LIVE: Latest reaction to Tory election win Let the Labour leadership battle commence Does Labour need a new direction after Corbyn? Who will be Labour's next leader? Mr Corbyn apologised to Labour supporters in two articles in the Sunday papers, calling it a ""body blow for everyone who so desperately needs real change in our country"". Writing an open letter in the Sunday Mirror, he said he took his ""responsibility"" for the result, but insisted he remained ""proud"" of the party's campaign. Hedoubled down in the Observer,,externalsaying his own election campaign had successfully re-set the terms of debate and his manifesto would be seen as ""historically important"". Mr Corbyn penned two articles in the Sunday papers But Mr McDonnell has argued ""it's on me"" as he apologised for the performance, on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. The shadow chancellor said he was sorry for ""not being able to articulate"" the party's campaign message ahead of the poll. However, he also blamed the ""media portrayal"" of Mr Corbyn, saying ""of course the system will throw the kitchen sink at you"" if you challenge it. SCROLL AND SEE:The results that sealed it,external ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW:The night's key points MAPS AND CHARTS:The election in graphics,external BREXIT:What happens now? WHO WON IN MY CONSTITUENCY?Check your result,external Former Labour MP Caroline Flint - who lost her seat on Thursday - placed much of the blame at the leadership's door. She also criticised the party's position on Brexit for leaving some voters behind, telling Sky's Sophy Ridge that ""ardent Remainers"", such as shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, ""contributed to sacrificing"" seats. Caroline Flint is a longstanding critic of Jeremy Corbyn She accused Ms Thornberry of telling one of her colleagues from a Brexit-backing area: ""I'm glad my constituents aren't as stupid as yours."" Ms Thornberry said the accusation was ""a total and utter lie"".  She added: I have never said this to anyone, nor anything like it, and I hope needless to say, it is not something I would ever think."" She has now instructed solicitors over Ms Flint's comments. Ms Flint added: ""I don't believe anybody who have been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is credible to be leader. I don't think they can win back these seats."" Instead, she said Ms Nandy and shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey were ""worth looking at"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy ""seriously thinking"" about Labour leadership bid Ms Nandy told the BBC's Andrew Marr she was considering a leadership bid after the ""most shattering"" defeat for Labour. ""In towns like mine, the earth was quaking as the entire Labour base crumble beneath our feet,"" she added. Ms Nandy made a number of proposals - including moving the party's headquarters out of London - to help ""rebuild that coalition"" between ""the Lewishams and the Leighs"", and to regain a Labour Party that ""speaks for both"". A number of other candidates are expected to join the race, including Salford and Eccles MP Ms Long-Bailey and Birmingham Yardley MP Jess Phillips. Ms Phillipswrote in the Observer an appeal to people,externalto join Labour to change it, arguing too many working-class people do not believe the party is better than the Tories. Jess Phillips (l) and Rebecca Long-Bailey (r) could throw their hats in the ring to be the next Labour leader Asked about the contenders, Mr McDonnell said he would ""prefer others"" to Ms Phillips, naming Ms Long-Bailey, shadow education secretary Angela Rayner and shadow women's and equalities minister Dawn Butler as possibilities. He said Ms Phillips was ""really talented"", but added: ""I want someone who actually has been really solidly involved in the development of existing policy - that's why Becky and Angie and Dawn and others have been so good."" Mr McDonnell said it ""should be a woman leader next"" and was ""most probably time for a non-metropolitan"" leader, adding: ""I think it is time for a non-London MP, we need a northern voice as much as possible."" Shadow justice secretary Richard Burgon also backed Ms Long-Bailey and said he was considering running to be her deputy. ""Colleagues have approached me about that,"" he told Sky. Analysis by John Pienaar, BBC deputy political editor Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more). Read more from John here. Meanwhile, the Conservatives are preparing for the first week of their new government. Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Rishi Sunak, told Andrew Marr it was their ""intention"" to bring back Boris Johnson's Brexit bill to Parliament ""before Christmas"" - although he would not confirm the date. ""As soon as possible would be perfect,"" he said. ""But obviously those conversations are happening between the relevant parties and the House authorities as we speak."" MPs will return to Westminster on Tuesday and begin the process of swearing in, before the Queen formally opens Parliament on Thursday.

What's behind the Tory victory?,"Boris Johnson has won a decisive majority, on the back of a big swing from Labour to the Conservatives in Leave-voting Britain. Yet north of the border the SNP dramatically almost swept the board. With all results now declared, the prime minister has won a majority of 80 seats - the biggest Tory majority since 1987. Meanwhile, at 44%, the party's share of the vote is set to be at its highest since 1979, when Margaret Thatcher became prime minister. Labour, in contrast, finds itself with little more than 200 seats, even fewer than the party won in its previous worst post-war result in 1983. However, the swing in the Tories' favour varied dramatically across the country. In those seats where more than 60% of voters backed Leave inthe 2016 EU referendum, the increase in Conservative support on average was 6%. However, in those seats where more than 60% voted Remain, the party's vote actually fell by three points. In contrast, Labour's vote fell on average by more than 10 points in the most pro-Leave areas. Its vote fell by more than six points in the most pro-Remain ones. This pattern had a clear impact on the geography of the election. Support for the Conservatives rose by four points in the Midlands, the North East and Yorkshire - the regions of England that voted most heavily in favour of Leave. In contrast, the party's vote fell back by a point in London and the South East. And in Scotland, the party's vote fell by as much as four points. Conversely, Labour saw its vote fall by 12 to 13 points in the North East and Yorkshire, while it fell by only six or seven points in London and the South of England. The result also saw Labour lose ground heavily in its traditional working-class heartlands. Support for the party fell by 11 points in those constituencies with most voters in working-class jobs. Its share of the vote fell by only seven points in those with most middle-class voters. The bond between Labour and its traditional working-class base is now badly strained. In the EU referendum working-class voters voted heavily to leave the EU. These voters had already swung quite strongly to the Conservatives in 2017. Labour tried to retain their support - remaining ambiguous about whether it was a pro-Remain or a pro-Leave party. But this election simply saw the pro-Conservative trend continue yet further. As a result, Labour dramatically lost many a seat in the North of England and the Midlands - places such as Ashfield, Bishop Auckland, and Workington - that had never previously elected a Conservative MP in a general election. The success of the Conservatives in England and Wales was matched by that of the SNP in Scotland. The party has won 48 of the 59 seats north of the border, and 45% of the vote across Scotland as a whole. It is a result almost as good as the party's historic performance in the 2015 election. After 59 of 59 seats After 59 of 59 seats And, in a country that voted in favour of Remain, it is likely to embolden the SNP in its pursuit of a second independence referendum. That is a ballot to which the Conservatives are strongly opposed. So, a constitutional clash between the Scottish and UK governments seems likely. One of the SNP's biggest scalps was theDunbartonshire East seat of Liberal Democrat leader Jo Swinson- a defeat that capped a miserable night for the Liberal Democrats. Despite advancing more strongly in pro-Remain areas, the party seems likely to end up with only 11 or 12 seats. This will be no more than the number they won in 2017, even though their share of the vote is up by four points. None of the many MPs who defected to the party during the last Parliament have been able to retain their seats. More from Sir John Curtice Five things to watch for in the election Is Brexit the most important issue for voters? Do people still vote according to class? The issues voters care about most The announcement of the election was greeted with concern about the level of turnout, for a ballot held just a fortnight before Christmas. In the event, about 67% of voters made it to the polls - just two points down on 2017. Turnout fell most markedly in seats where Labour are relatively strong, suggesting that some of those who usually support the party opted to stay at home. The Conservatives' success means that Britain will now leave the EU at the end of January. However, it seems unlikely to end the debate about Britain's relationship with the EU. The country's divisions over Brexit were exposed in the very different swings across the country. Meanwhile, at 47%, fewer than half of voters backed the Conservatives or the Brexit Party - the parties in favour of leaving the EU without another referendum. This is a point to which opponents of Brexit are likely to point in the weeks and months to come. But for now at least, the day clearly belongs to Mr Johnson.

'Flexibility' call to reach UN climate consensus,"Talks in Madrid have gone into extra time as delegates try to agree on measures The Chilean official leading UN climate talks in Madrid has called on delegates to show flexibility, as they struggle to reach agreement on crucial measures needed to tackle climate change. The negotiations, which were scheduled to end on Friday, continued throughout Saturday and into Sunday morning. Carolina Schmidt said a deal was almost there but the outcome needed to be ambitious. The goal is a commitment to new carbon emissions cuts by the end of 2020. The European Union and small island states vulnerable to climate change are pushing for stronger commitments to cut those emissions. Some of the biggest polluters, including the United States, Brazil and India, say they see no need to change their current plans. Ms Schmidt, Chile's environment minister who is the conference's president, said early on Sunday: ""I request all the flexibility, all your strength to find this agreement to have an ambitious result."" She added: ""It's hard, it's difficult but it's worth it. I specially need you. But people in our countries need us.""

The pact's intention is to keep the global average temperature rise to well below 2C. This was regarded at the time as the threshold for dangerous global warming, though scientists subsequently shifted the definition of the ""safe"" limit to a rise of 1.5C above pre-industrial levels. The situation was unprecedented since talks began in 1991, said Alden Meyer from the Union of Concerned Scientists. He commented: ""The latest version of the Paris Agreement decision text put forward by the Chilean presidency is totally unacceptable. It has no call for countries to enhance the ambition of their emissions reduction commitments. ""If world leaders fail to increase ambition in the lead up to next year's climate summit in Glasgow, they will make the task of meeting the Paris agreement's 'well below 2C' temperature limitation goal - much less the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal - almost impossible.""

His view was echoed by David Waskow, international climate director for the World Resources Institute (WRI). ""If this text is accepted, the low ambition coalition will have won the day,"" he said. The conference in the Spanish capital has become enmeshed in deep, technical arguments about a number of issues including the role of carbon markets and the financing of loss and damage caused by rising temperatures. Responding to the messages from science and from climate strikers, the countries running this 26th conference of the parties (COP) meeting are keen to have a final decision here that would see countries put new, ambitious plans to cut carbon on the table. Greenland ice melt 'is accelerating' Madrid climate talks will set the tone for Glasgow According to the UN, 84 countries have promised to enhance their national plans by the end of next year. Some 73 have said they will set a long-term target of net zero by the middle of the century. But earlier in the meeting, negotiators from the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS) pointed the finger of blame at countries including Australia, the United States, Canada, Russia, India, China and Brazil. Protests led by young delegates have seen up to 200 protestors ejected from the talks They had failed to submit revised plans that would help the world keep the rise in global temperatures under 1.5C this century. At a ""stock-taking"" session on Saturday morning, Tina Stege, a negotiator with the Marshall Islands delegation, said: ""I need to go home and look my kids in the eye and tell them we came out with an outcome that will ensure their future."" She added: ""The text must address the need for new and more ambitious NDCs and long-term goals. We can't leave with anything else."" Reinforcing the sense of division, India, supported by China, Saudi Arabia and Brazil, has been taking a hard line on promises made by richer countries in previous agreements before the Paris pact was signed in 2015. The deal saw every country, India included, sign up to take actions. This was a key concession to the richer nations who insisted that the deal would only work if everyone pledged to cut carbon, unlike previous agreements in which only the better off had to limit their CO2. Some visitors have other things to do at the COP But India now wants to see evidence that in the years up to 2020, the developed world has lived up to past promises. For many delegates, the deadlock is intensely frustrating in light of the urgent need to tackle emissions. ""I've been attending these climate negotiations since they first started in 1991. But never have I seen the almost total disconnect we've seen here at COP25 in Madrid between what the science requires and the people of the world demand, and what the climate negotiations are delivering in terms of meaningful action,"" said Alden Meyer. ""The planet is on fire and our window of escape is getting harder and harder to reach the longer we wait to act. Ministers here in Madrid must strengthen the final decision text, to respond to the mounting impacts of climate change that are devastating both communities and ecosystems all over the world."" Jake Schmidt, from the US-based Natural Resources Defense Council, said: ""In Madrid, the key polluting countries responsible for 80% of the world's climate-wrecking emissions stood mute, while smaller countries announced they'll work to drive down harmful emissions in the coming year. ""The mute majority must step up, and ramp up, their commitments to tackle the growing climate crisis well ahead of the COP26 gathering."" Also on Saturday, activists staged a protest outside the summit venue to express their frustration at what they see as the failure of world leaders in taking meaningful action on climate change.

Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Correspondent The leader of the Scottish Conservative Party, Jackson Carlaw, has effectively rejected a membership application from UKIP's former leader in Scotland, David Coburn. Mr Coburn contacted the BBC on Saturday to say that he had joined the Tories to help Boris Johnson âsave the Unionâ in any future independence referendum campaign. He also confirmed that he would be backing the Scottish Tories in the 2021 Holyrood elections. But Mr Coburn, who served as an MEP for Scotland from 2014 to 2019 and as leader of UKIP in Scotland, is a highly controversial figure. The Scottish justice secretary, Humza Yousaf, said Mr Coburn had used an Islamophobic slur against him when he called him ""Abu Hamza"". At the time, Mr Coburnapologised for the comment,which he made during a newspaper interview, and said it was an ""inappropriate joke"". Mr Yousaf said that if Mr Coburn was allowed to join the Tories, it would confirm that Islamophobia was âsystemicâ in the party. But the Scottish Tory leader, Jackson Carlaw, has moved to block Mr Coburnâs membership. On social media, Mr Carlaw said Mr Coburnâs past comments were âincompatibleâ with Tory membership and that he âcannot and will notâ support his application. Allow Twitter content?

John Pienaar Brave infantrymen in the muddy trenches of the Great War would hurl themselves onto the barbed wire to allow their comrades to march over their backs and advance towards the guns of the enemy. Can you imagine doing that? No, me neither. It's maybe no easier to see why there's already a line of Labour politicians preparing to join the battle to succeed Jeremy Corbyn. Boris Johnson's 80-strong House of Commons majority by any normal standard could be big enough to repel Labour's next advance in five years. It's reasonable to imagine that another leader could come and go before Labour recaptures the territory it has lost, assuming it ever does. Whoever wins the coming leadership contest will first have to triumph in the struggle to map Labour's course through the field of battle; to decide how deep a shade of red the party's battle flag should be (just to torture the metaphor a little more). Read more from John about who might run in the party's leadership contest. BBC News Channel Lord Ricketts held various top diplomatic posts before his retirement The PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings is reportedly preparingan overhaul of the civil service, the Sunday Telegraph reports today,external- in order to ensure it delivers on Boris Johnson's agenda. It's not the first time a PM decides after an election they are going to put their stamp on Whitehall with a big shake-up, says former head of the Foreign Office Lord Ricketts. ""In my experience it never achieves the outcome people want. It absorbs the civil service in friction of redoing the plumbing while they should be out there making new policies."" Lord Ricketts, who is also the UK's former national security adviser, adds: ""I'm cautious about a big upheaval especially when we face a year with the EU where we're going to have to have some enormously complex negotiations about our future relationship. ""No doubt there will be some change but I would not go for a large shake-up."" He says the civil service ""has not been the problem over these last chaotic three-and-a-half years"". ""Indeed I could make the case that the civil service has kept the country on the road while the politicians have squabbled about Brexit. ""They planned for no-deal, they turned themselves inside out to find a way of getting Theresa May's contradictory red lines to work, then they turned their attention to Boris Johnson's [revised deal]. ""Each time they delivered."" If you thought things might quieten down after the election, you'd be wrong Tony BonsignoreBBC Westminster This next week is going to be a huge one in Westminster and in Parliament. You've got all these new MPs trooping in tomorrow and Tuesday, going to be sworn in. Thursday is the first really big day for this government now because it's the Queen's Speech. It's the chance for them to set out what their priorities are beyond Brexit. We're going to have a very busy few weeks with the government trying to get Brexit legislation through Parliament in time for that key date, 31 January -  the latest and, what the government hopes, will be the final Brexit day. And beyond that, there's all sorts of talk about a major rethink of the way that government works. And we know that, for example, is a big pet project of Boris Johnson's special adviser Dominic Cummings. Former Tory MP Sam Gyimah, who joined the Lib Dems in September, says his party has ""much to be proud of"". He was one of21 Tories who had the whip removed,externalafter rebelling over Brexit. He went on to stand for election as a Lib Dem in Kensington but lost. Mr Gyimah says ""campaigns are not about one person"", adding that ""the wheel of history will turn again"". The Lib Dems now have 11 seats, one fewer than at the 2017 election after leader Jo Swinson lost her seat. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News Channel Labour is a ""disaster area"", says political commentator Steve Richards, speaking on the Dateline London programme on the BBC News Channel. ""They lost four elections after 1979 in a row, they've just lost another four in a row. ""This is a party that's so dysfunctional that it cannot win elections when it should be able to do so."" Mr Richards says although on most levels ""it's much harder"" than when they last lost four elections in a row in 1992, when the Tories had a small majority, he thinks it is ""doable"". He says the alliance of voters that Boris Johnson has won is ""a fragile one"". ""Those voters in the north of England who are disillusioned now can become disillusioned again with him in a different way,"" says Mr Richards. ""There is a route back but it needs a giant figure. And I don't know who that giant figure is and it needs the Labour Party to be wholly overhauled because it too often loses elections.""

Wera Hobhouse was reelected in Bath, which she has represented since 2017 Bath's Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse has questioned whether the British people are ready to have a first-generation immigrant lead a major political party. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics West this morning, she said she was regularly referred to as ""German-born"" Wera Hobhouse, implying that she could not represent the British people. Even so, she has refused to rule herself out of the contest to succeed Jo Swinson as her party's leader, saying it was a ""discussion"" she is ready to have. Wera Hobhouse was born in Hanover, Germany, and moved to the UK in 1990. She said:
""I'm a first generation immigrant and we have just voted for a party that has stoked up anti-immigrant feeling. ""I need to have that discussion of whether being a first-generation immigrant is standing in the way of the Liberal Democrats fighting prejudice and anti-foreigner sentiment. ""Or is it the first thing that will always colour what is going to be said by the Liberal Democrats? That is, 'She is not British, she is German-born.' ""The right-wing press always talks about me as 'German-born Wera Hobhouse.' It's a big issue. I've had it in the Daily Mail and over the years. The underlying thing is that she doesn't speak for the British people.""

Ms Flint also blamed shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and other Remain figures in the party for the loss of the seats. And she claimed Ms Thornberry, MP for Islington South and Finsbury, told one of her colleagues that âIâm glad my
constituents arenât as stupid as yoursâ. The BBC has approached Ms Thornberry for a comment. Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Ms Flint said: ""Iâm sorry - itâs not acceptable. ""I do believe that in the
pursuit of Remain, a number of people who've been ardent Remainers in our
party, on our front bench - people like Keir Starmer, people like Emily
Thornberry - but many others - Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper - they have
contributed to sacrificing 59 seats. ""I donât believe anybody
who have been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is
credible to be leader. I donât think they can win back these seats."" She also said the only people
âworth looking atâ to be the next leader were Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey.

BBC News Channel Lord Ricketts held various top diplomatic posts before his retirement The PM's chief adviser Dominic Cummings is reportedly preparingan overhaul of the civil service, the Sunday Telegraph reports today,external- in order to ensure it delivers on Boris Johnson's agenda. It's not the first time a PM decides after an election they are going to put their stamp on Whitehall with a big shake-up, says former head of the Foreign Office Lord Ricketts. ""In my experience it never achieves the outcome people want. It absorbs the civil service in friction of redoing the plumbing while they should be out there making new policies."" Lord Ricketts, who is also the UK's former national security adviser, adds: ""I'm cautious about a big upheaval especially when we face a year with the EU where we're going to have to have some enormously complex negotiations about our future relationship. ""No doubt there will be some change but I would not go for a large shake-up."" He says the civil service ""has not been the problem over these last chaotic three-and-a-half years"". ""Indeed I could make the case that the civil service has kept the country on the road while the politicians have squabbled about Brexit. ""They planned for no-deal, they turned themselves inside out to find a way of getting Theresa May's contradictory red lines to work, then they turned their attention to Boris Johnson's [revised deal]. ""Each time they delivered."" If you thought things might quieten down after the election, you'd be wrong Tony BonsignoreBBC Westminster This next week is going to be a huge one in Westminster and in Parliament. You've got all these new MPs trooping in tomorrow and Tuesday, going to be sworn in. Thursday is the first really big day for this government now because it's the Queen's Speech. It's the chance for them to set out what their priorities are beyond Brexit. We're going to have a very busy few weeks with the government trying to get Brexit legislation through Parliament in time for that key date, 31 January -  the latest and, what the government hopes, will be the final Brexit day. And beyond that, there's all sorts of talk about a major rethink of the way that government works. And we know that, for example, is a big pet project of Boris Johnson's special adviser Dominic Cummings. Former Tory MP Sam Gyimah, who joined the Lib Dems in September, says his party has ""much to be proud of"". He was one of21 Tories who had the whip removed,externalafter rebelling over Brexit. He went on to stand for election as a Lib Dem in Kensington but lost. Mr Gyimah says ""campaigns are not about one person"", adding that ""the wheel of history will turn again"". The Lib Dems now have 11 seats, one fewer than at the 2017 election after leader Jo Swinson lost her seat. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

BBC News Channel Labour is a ""disaster area"", says political commentator Steve Richards, speaking on the Dateline London programme on the BBC News Channel. ""They lost four elections after 1979 in a row, they've just lost another four in a row. ""This is a party that's so dysfunctional that it cannot win elections when it should be able to do so."" Mr Richards says although on most levels ""it's much harder"" than when they last lost four elections in a row in 1992, when the Tories had a small majority, he thinks it is ""doable"". He says the alliance of voters that Boris Johnson has won is ""a fragile one"". ""Those voters in the north of England who are disillusioned now can become disillusioned again with him in a different way,"" says Mr Richards. ""There is a route back but it needs a giant figure.

Wera Hobhouse was reelected in Bath, which she has represented since 2017 Bath's Lib Dem MP Wera Hobhouse has questioned whether the British people are ready to have a first-generation immigrant lead a major political party. Speaking on BBC One's Sunday Politics West this morning, she said she was regularly referred to as ""German-born"" Wera Hobhouse, implying that she could not represent the British people. Even so, she has refused to rule herself out of the contest to succeed Jo Swinson as her party's leader, saying it was a ""discussion"" she is ready to have. Wera Hobhouse was born in Hanover, Germany, and moved to the UK in 1990. She said:
""I'm a first generation immigrant and we have just voted for a party that has stoked up anti-immigrant feeling. ""I need to have that discussion of whether being a first-generation immigrant is standing in the way of the Liberal Democrats fighting prejudice and anti-foreigner sentiment. ""Or is it the first thing that will always colour what is going to be said by the Liberal Democrats? That is, 'She is not British, she is German-born.' ""The right-wing press always talks about me as 'German-born Wera Hobhouse.' It's a big issue. I've had it in the Daily Mail and over the years. The underlying thing is that she doesn't speak for the British people."" Political guests appeared on the BBC's Andrew Marr show and Pienaar's Politics as well as Sky's Sophy Ridge on Sunday Sky News More on Sky's interview with Caroline Flint this morning, where she blamed both Labour's Brexit stance and leadership under Jeremy Corbyn as reasons for the party's defeat. Ms Flint also blamed shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry and other Remain figures in the party for the loss of the seats. And she claimed Ms Thornberry, MP for Islington South and Finsbury, told one of her colleagues that âIâm glad my
constituents arenât as stupid as yoursâ. The BBC has approached Ms Thornberry for a comment. Speaking on Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Ms Flint said: ""Iâm sorry - itâs not acceptable. ""I do believe that in the
pursuit of Remain, a number of people who've been ardent Remainers in our
party, on our front bench - people like Keir Starmer, people like Emily
Thornberry - but many others - Hilary Benn, Yvette Cooper - they have
contributed to sacrificing 59 seats. ""I donât believe anybody
who have been the architects of our European policy in the last few years is
credible to be leader. I donât think they can win back these seats."" She also said the only people
âworth looking atâ to be the next leader were Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy says she is ""seriously thinking"" about running as a candidate to replace Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader.

A constituency that changed its mind,"Once, you would have got long odds on the first Conservative election win coming from Blyth Valley in Northumberland. As a former mining community, it hardly seemed natural Tory territory. But mental health care assistant Ian Levy overcame a Labour majority of almost 8,000 to secure it. In his victory speech, he pledged to bring investment and change to the community as soon as he arrived in Westminster. So what do Mr Levy and Prime Minister Boris Johnson need to deliver to ensure that promise to the people of Blyth Valley means something? Unemployment in Blyth Valley is above the national average. That is typical of many communities in the North East that are still wrestling with the impact of industrial decline. It's a community proud of its mining heritage, but the days when coal was king are slipping into memory.The town council says that in 1961,externalBlyth was one of the busiest ports in England, shipping more than six million tonnes of coal. But ""the late 1960s had seen a rapid decline in the traditionally male-dominated heavy industries"".  Â£520.40average weekly wage, compared to Â£587 for whole of the UK 4.9%Northumberland's unemployment rate. Great Britain's is 4.1% 1 in 5work in manufacturing, compared to fewer than 1 in 10 in GB Â£145,000average Blyth house price. It's Â£235,000 in England/Wales. Instead its seafront now faces a cluster of offshore wind turbines, and it has ambitions to service a new generation of turbines in the North Sea. Its port also remains an important employer, and manufacturing a significant part of the economy. And some new industries are moving in. Sir Paul McCartney's former wife Heather Mills is planning to build a vegan food factory there. But like many communities of its size, Blyth has a struggling town centre â though it is in the running for money from the government's Future High Street Fund. Perhaps the new MP and Mr Johnson will need to deliver more jobs - and better paid ones - to ensure local people have money to spend there. At the moment many of the constituents commute into Tyneside for work and leisure. And Brexit could pose a challenge. Economic studies suggest the exporting North East economy has most to lose from leaving the European Union in terms of lower economic growth. The constituency did vote for Brexit though, with more than 6 in 10 backing leaving the EU in the 2016 referendum. How the Blyth Valley vote divided up Blyth lost its railway station in 1964 in the Beeching cuts. Trains still pass through the town, but they are only carrying freight at the moment. Voters, then, might have been attracted by the Conservative election pledge to look at reversing some of those 1960s cuts. The Tories have promised a Â£500m Beeching reversal fund, and have mentioned the return of passenger services to Blyth as one of the projects which could win support from that fund. But the estimated cost of Â£99m to return services to the Ashington, Blyth and Tyne line has yet to be committed. That leaves many locals relying on buses, so they will also want to see the prime minister deliver on promised investment into the network. The local health trust that covers the constituency outperforms much of England, though in the most recent figures it still missed A&E and cancer targets. It performed well though when it came to meeting mental health targets. The Northumbria Healthcare NHS Foundation Trust has been rated as ""outstanding"" by the Care Quality Commission. And this is one community where Boris Johnson might not have to deliver a new hospital. A new purpose-built emergency care hospital opened in Cramlington in the constituency in 2015. It was the first of its kind, and has been seen as a model of how hospitals should operate. Although the constituency as a whole is about average for life expectancy, it has an above average number of over-65s - an ageing population that will want to see the government come up with a solution to social care funding. Check your local NHS performance with our tracker The North East of England has some of the best performing primary schools, but some of the worst performing secondary schools. But actually Blyth Valley has a better educational record than much of the region. Although achievement was slightly below average at primary level, secondary standards are above average. It is one of the few parts of the country where at least some students are in a three-tier schooling system, with First, Middle and High Schools. You can bet the schools though will want to see more funding delivered by the prime minister and their new MP. The local further education college will also hope Mr Johnson makes good on promises to put money into a sector which suffered a funding squeeze under David Cameron and Theresa May. Northumbria Police has suffered some of the worst funding cuts - in fact itschief constable described them as the worst in the country in 2018,external. The force has lost more than 1,000 officers since 2010 and had to dip into its financial reserves to avoid deeper cuts. Part of the problem was a narrow base for council tax - meaning cuts from central government were not replaced by local funds. Mr Johnson has already committed to increasing the number of police. The Home Office expect 185 extra officers to be recruited in the Northumbria force area by 2021, but that does not replace all those that have been lost. The prime minister and new MP will be under pressure to show they will go further in a community which is in the top 10% of the country when it comes to crime. Immigration into the area is negligible. Figures aren't available purely for Blyth Valley, but from mid 2016-2017, it is estimated that the short-term international migration flow to the entire Northumberland region was made up of just 47 people. Given the county's population is over 300,000, this is not a community struggling to cope with the weight of inward migration. Blyth Valley is also an overwhelmingly white constituency.  60.5%voted for Brexit, compared with the UK average of 51.9% 97.7%were born in the UK compared to 87.3% average (2011 census) 42%are aged 50+, compared with 37% of the UK population 5% of live birthsin 2018 were to non-UK mothers. England's average is 29.1% That does not mean voters are not concerned about immigration into the UK more widely. But in a region with skill shortages, some employers will be keen to retain access to workers from overseas â and the PM will have to balance those two competing demands.

Six months on - Beijing's dilemma in Hong Kong,"A few months ago a Chinese official asked me if I thought foreign powers were fomenting Hong Kong's social unrest. ""To get so many people to come to the streets,"" he mused, ""must take organisation, a big sum of money and political resources."" Since then, the protests sparked at the beginning of Hong Kong's hot summer have raged on through autumn and into winter. The massive marches have continued, interspersed with increasingly violent pitched battles between smaller groups of more militant protesters and the police. The toll is measured in a stark ledger of police figures that, even a short while ago, would have seemed impossible for one of the world's leading financial capitals and a bastion of social stability. More than 6,000 arrests, 16,000 tear-gas rounds, 10,000 rubber bullets. As the sense of political crisis has deepened and divisions have hardened, China has continued to see the sinister hand of foreign meddling behind every twist and turn. In January, China's supreme political leader Xi Jinping convened a high-level Communist Party meeting focused on ""major risk prevention"". He told the assembled senior officials to be on their guard for ""black swans"" - the unpredictable, unseen events that can plunge a system into crisis. But he also warned them about what he called ""grey rhinoceroses"" - the known risks that are ignored until it's too late. Xi Jinping toasts 70 years of Communist Party rule, while protests rage in Hong Kong Whilestate media reports show the discussions ranging over issues from housing bubbles to food safety,external, there's no mention at all of Hong Kong. And yet the seeds were already being sown for what has become the biggest challenge to Communist Party rule in a generation. A few weeks after the meeting, the Hong Kong government, with the strong backing of Beijing, introduced a bill that would allow the extradition of suspects to mainland China. Opposition to the bill was immediate, deep-seated and widespread, driven by the fear that it would allow China's legal system to reach deep inside Hong Kong. Hong Kong-China extradition plans explained Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words How is Hong Kong run? Despite assurances that ""political crimes"" would not be covered, many saw it as a fundamental breach of the ""one country, two systems"" principle under which the territory is supposed to be governed. It wasn't just human rights groups and legal experts expressing alarm, but the business community, multinational corporations and foreign governments too, worried that overseas nationals might also find themselves targeted by such a law. And so, the first claims of ""foreign meddling"" began to be heard. Protests have ranged from peaceful family events to large-scale, armed street violence On 9 June, a massive and overwhelmingly peaceful rally against the bill was held, with organisers putting the attendance at more than a million. The accusations made in person by officials, like the one mentioned earlier, were echoes of a narrative being taken up in earnest by China's Communist Party-controlled media. The morning after the march, anEnglish language editorial in the China Daily raised the spectre of ""interference"".,external ""Unfortunately, some Hong Kong residents have been hoodwinked by the opposition camp and their foreign allies into supporting the anti-extradition campaign,"" it said. From the protesters' point of view, the dismissal of their grievances as externally driven explains, to a large extent, what happened next. The city's political elite, backed by Beijing and insulated from ordinary Hong Kongers by a political system rigged in its favour, demonstrated a spectacular failure to accurately read the public mood. This video can not be played The trauma of Hong Kong's teenage protesters Three days after the march, with Hong Kong's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, insisting she would not back down, thousands of people surrounded the Legislative Council building where the bill was being debated. It was on the same spot just outside the chamber, less than five years earlier, that a phalanx of trucks with mechanical grabbers had begun scooping up rows of abandoned tents. To the sound of the snapping of poles and the crunching of bamboo barricades - the detritus of weeks of protest and occupation -2014's pro-democracy demonstrations finally ran out of steam. Now the proposed law, one that may once have been seen as relatively inconsequential, was about to reignite the movement. What led to the first gunshot being fired? Most striking images from six months of anger The protesters threw bricks and bottles, the police fired tear gas and by the evening of 12 June, Hong Kong had witnessed one of its worst outbreaks of violence in decades. More than 6,000 people have been arrested through the months of increasingly violent unrest No-one could be in any doubt that the Umbrella Movement, with its demands for wider democratic reform, was back with a vengeance. The few concessions - first the suspension and finally the withdrawal of the bill - came too late to stop the cycle of escalating violence from both the protesters and the police. Beijing is right to point out that there are plenty of Hong Kongers who deplore the mask-clad militants building barricades, vandalising public property and setting fires. Some of them are ardent supporters of Chinese rule, others are simply being pragmatic, believing that violence will only provoke the central government into intervening more strongly in Hong Kong's affairs. First-time voters and candidates ousted seasoned veterans in some constituencies But the authorities were stunned last month by a test of the true strength of those viewpoints, when - on a record turnout in local elections - the pro-democracy camp swept the board. The poll gave its candidates almost 60% of the total share of the votes. Hong Kong's young winners and the veterans they toppled Chinese media downplay Hong Kong elections Why Starbucks? The brands attacked in Hong Kong At first there was an astonished silence from mainland China, which had genuinely thought the pro-Beijing side would win. The initial news reports mentioned only the conclusion of the voting, not the results, but then came a familiar refrain. The state-run Xinhua news agency blamed ""rioters"" conspiring with ""foreign forces"". ""The politicians behind them who are anti-China and want to mess up Hong Kong reaped substantial political benefits,"" it said. Former UK consulate worker says China tortured him As proof of interference,China cites cases of foreign politicians voicing support for democracy,externalor raising concerns about its erosion under Chinese rule. It has also blamed Washington for passing a lawmandating an annual assessment of Hong Kong's political freedoms as a pre-condition for continuing the territory's special trading status. Hong Kong's protesters have adopted the word ""Chinazi"" to display their views towards Beijing Xinhua has denounced it as ""a malicious political manipulation,externalthat seriously interferes with Hong Kong affairs"". But no evidence has been produced of any outside forces co-ordinating or directing the protests on the ground. In reality, the young, radical protesters, with the ubiquitous use of the portmanteau ""Chinazi"" in their street graffiti, appear as much motivated by statements from Beijing as they are from Washington. The very institutions - independent courts and a free press - that are supposed to be protected by the ""one country, two systems"" formula, are derided by the ruling Communist Party as dangerous, foreign constructs. Where once Hong Kongers might have hoped that China's economic rise would bring political freedoms to the mainland and a closer alignment with their values, many now fear the opposite. Massdetention camps in Xinjiang, a widercrackdown on civil society, and theabduction of Hong Kong citizensfor perceived political crimes have all underlined the concern that their city is now ruled by political masters inherently hostile to the very things that make it special. China separating Muslim children from families China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained And any appeal to universal values as underwriting Hong Kong's side of the ""two systems"", is anathema to Beijing, one that it rejects by conflating it with outside foreign meddling. Despite earlier fears, the central government seems unlikely to send in the army - a move certain to provoke even more of an international outcry. Mainland Chinese soldiers deployed in Hong Kong have remained in their barracks throughout the protests But nor can it offer a political solution. Giving the pro-democracy movement any more of what the Communist Party strains every fibre of its organisational structure to deny to the mass of Chinese people is impossible. Its values are stability and control, not freedom and democracy, and it struggles to understand how anyone would choose the latter over the former. So Beijing finds itself bound by a sense of historical destiny to a territory with which it is - in large part - in deep ideological opposition. It is a tension that has not gone unnoticed elsewhere in the region, in particular, in Taiwan, the self-governing island that China considers a breakaway province. Hong Kong's experience of one country, two systems, the Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen has suggested, has shown that authoritarianism and democracy cannot coexist. Referring to the prospect of a similar formula being foisted on Taiwan she tweeted, in Chinese characters, the phrase bu ke neng - ""Not a chance"".

"Me, my camera, my brother... our cancerSix months on - Beijing's dilemma in Hong Kong","When Carly Clarke was diagnosed with cancer in 2012, she set out to photograph how she changed during what could have been the last days of her life. Seven years on, by cruel coincidence, she is at her brother's side, photographing him going through the same ordeal. ""I have my own hair on my hands, on my clothes and down in the bath below me. As I wash, then brush, more continues to fall out. ""In the mirror I can see my appearance change, strand-by-strand."" Carly Clarke is reliving her experience as a cancer patient, showing me one of the many self-portraits she took during six painful months of treatment. Eventually, she would ask her dad to shave the last hairs from her head. She was just 26. ""I used to have a lot of hair. Now I look like a cancer patient,"" she notes. Six months before these photographs were taken, Carly had been living out a dream in Canada - shooting a final-year university photography project in Vancouver's poverty-stricken downtown eastside. She had been sick for months, with a violent cough, appetite loss and pain in her chest and back. Doctors had diagnosed her with illnesses ranging from pneumonia to asthma and warned her she could suffer a collapsed lung on the flight. But she had ignored them. ""I wasn't going to let this illness - whatever it was - get in the way of living my life,"" she says. ""In Vancouver, I could empathise with those with illnesses and addiction. My concern for my own life made me compassionate during the shoot."" Many of those she spoke to on the near-freezing streets had become hooked after taking strong opiates in hospital, as they were treated for serious conditions, such as cancer. Three months later, Carly would need morphine herself to alleviate the pain in her chest and back, so she could sleep. Persuaded by Canadian doctors to go home for specialist attention, she was finally diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma - a rare and quite aggressive form of cancer - in March 2012. A tumour the size of a grapefruit had already grown in her right lung and chest wall. ""I burst into tears at Guy's Hospital in London,"" she says. ""I didn't know if I would survive the chemotherapy treatment, being diagnosed at such a late stage. I was terrified."" It was hard for her family to take. ""My parents felt like their stomachs fell out. There hadn't been a lot of cancer in the family,"" she says. ""My boyfriend was also devastated and he flew out from California to England to be with me."" Back at home in Eastbourne, Carly scrawled hospital appointments and medication timetables on to a calendar that not long before had been packed with coursework deadlines and photoshoots. ""My life slowed down to concentrating on getting through each moment, drug to drug, endless examinations, giant needles, biopsies drilling deep into bone, tubes down my throat, and hoping for some day, the pain to end,"" she says. Pain from her chest was now radiating down her arm, fluid on her lungs made breathing difficult, and she could not shake an ""awful, non-stop cough"". ""A plastic line through my arm fed sickening but healing medicine into my heart, trying to kill the cancer but taking my strength with it,"" she says. ""My skeleton became more visible by the day, a reminder of each precious pound lost. Out of nowhere my life was on the line."" Her view of the world - and herself - was changing. So she decided to photograph it. ""I thought that having a creative outlet would allow me to step out of some of that reality for a moment or two and think about my current trauma from another perspective,"" Carly says. Reality Trauma was to be a series of self-portraits documenting her changing appearance, her life in and out of hospital, and her resilience. During day visits, or short stays, the hospital gave her the freedom to use a tripod and cable release as often as she could. Doctors and nurses sometimes pushed the shutter for her. ""I thought about how others might view these images further down the line and whether or not I would even be around to tell my story,"" she says. Carly wanted her work to inspire others to ""have the courage to stare cancer in the face"" and not let it take over their identity entirely. Image-by-image, Carly noticed her skin was becoming paler and tighter around her bones, giving her an ""unfamiliar, almost alien"" appearance. She lost around 12kg (26lb) in the space of two months and needed regular blood transfusions to make up for circulatory problems that were starving her body of oxygen and turning her blue. ""People were afraid to look at me. Especially, I think, parents with children also going through cancer - because they saw me and probably feared the worst for their own,"" she says. ""Seeing myself that way made me feel uneasy and frightened."" Soon afterwards, she found herself attending hospital so frequently she was admitted full-time. At her lowest, constantly nauseous or asleep, she would reject all food from the hospital trolley. She was unable to study and, some days, too tired to photograph herself or phone her boyfriend. By now she was also coughing so hard she would bring up blood. And sometimes she would wake after a night of cold sweats, itching and drenched as if she had showered in her hospital bed. But then one day, after about three months of chemotherapy, the coughing stopped. Her other symptoms also began to ease. The treatment was working, she thought. Biopsies confirmed it: the cancer was losing. Her perception of life changed again. ""Helplessness turned into hopefulness - and then euphoria. When you come so close to death, suddenly you want to live your life to the fullest."" The hospital ward went from being a place of pain to home. Staff became friends, and some patients even closer. Now Carly would venture outside her room. The fish tank in the communal area of the ward attracted patients of all ages. An elderly couple, being treated for different types of terminal leukaemia, would often undergo chemotherapy on the same day as Carly. One day, the husband said his wife had been told she would not make it to Christmas. ""I remember hugging her and wishing her well - that couple would never leave my mind."" As Carly began to feel better, she also started to connect more with the world outside. Her boyfriend and friends would take her for lunch, sometimes driving to Beachy Head - where white cliffs meet the sea - and Carly would talk about the future while watching boats move slowly across the horizon. From course mates and tutors, she began to realise that her photographs were affecting other people. Not only were they capturing the physical and emotional effects of cancer treatment but demonstrating that it didn't always have to be scary - it could be positive, Carly says. ""Looking back at the images I had taken, it made me feel stronger because in those photos I was faced with an end-of-life situation but a part of me still believed I could get through it."" Carly began showing her work to other cancer patients and took portraits of some of them in the ward. It became a way of starting a conversation or putting a smile on their faces. Carly's photographs captured the mood of those who had undergone successful treatment ""If it's true that a simple smile, small gesture of help or kind word can change how a person feels and brighten their day, and have a positive effect on every cell in one's body, then a positive photographic story can help change someone's life,"" says Carly. ""It can be the defining factor in someone's mental strength and affect their willpower enough to keep them going through the suffering in hope that it will soon end and that, in my opinion, is what helps to keep you alive against all odds."" As Carly's treatment came to an end, in September 2012, she could look back through each phase of her journey, in 15 rolls of film and 150 photographs, and say she survived cancer. Her image titled Last Day of Chemotherapy was shortlisted in the Portrait of Britain Awards 2018 It was a moment for celebration, but returning to the family home - to ""piece her life back together"" - was not easy. When she took back her boxes of unused medicine, she felt sad she was no longer in hospital. ""The hospital staff and some of the patients felt like family to me because we had built a very close relationship over many months."" A few months later, Carly flew to California and stayed with her boyfriend for most of the following year. 'Why me? I had ovarian cancer at 14' The year my cancer changed everything Crystal has face cancer and wants to work in theatre She returned home several times, and visited the hospital ward for the first of her twice-yearly check-ups. Every time she went back, she looked around for old faces: nurses who had treated her, patients she had shared moments with. On one occasion, a few years after finishing treatment, she arrived early for a consultation and sat alongside a woman in the waiting area. ""We casually glanced at each other and suddenly tears came to my eyes."" It was the woman whose husband had told Carly she would not live to see Christmas back in 2012. ""I couldn't believe it was her,"" Carly recalls. ""Moments like this are beautiful."" Carly quickly rediscovered her hunger to document the lives of people around the world. In 2014, she spent four months in India. Her work on that trip would garner honourable mentions in the International Photo Awards in 2018. That same year her ""Last Day of Chemotherapy"" photograph from Reality Trauma was shortlisted in the Portrait of Britain Awards. She got work assisting photographer Michael Wharley, producing promotional images for Summerland, a forthcoming film starring Gemma Arterton. As her inbox filled with awards invitations and her calendar with shoot schedules, she began drawing up a project concept with her local hospice, St Wilfred's, to take portraits of cancer patients in their last stages of life. She wanted to document how terminal illnesses affect people's psychological state, and the ways patients spend their remaining moments, trying new hobbies or saying last goodbyes. But that plan was halted abruptly in September last year by a phone call from her older brother, Lee. He told her their younger brother, Joe, had been diagnosed with Hodgkin lymphoma - the very same cancer Carly had beaten six years earlier. ""We both shed tears on the phone,"" says Carly. Joe was just 16 and starting college. His cancer was less advanced than Carly's had been but - just like his sister - he had also been ill for months before being diagnosed. Doctors had initially put his severe itching down to ""dry skin"", or imagination. ""He wasn't prepared for his diagnosis. None us of were,"" says Carly. The NHS says Hodgkin lymphoma is an uncommon cancer that develops in a network of vessels and glands called the lymphatic system. It can quickly spread throughout the body but is also one of the most easily treated types of cancer. NHS: Hodgkin lymphoma,external What is Hodgkin lymphoma?,external(Macmillan Cancer Support) Lymphoma Action,external Joe tried to live as normally as he could, spending time with his girlfriend, learning to drive and making career plans. But as he spent more and more time travelling to hospital and back, his grades took a hit and he began to lose touch with some of his friends. Wanting to spend more time with him, earlier this year Carly asked if she could photograph his cancer journey. He agreed. Sixteen years older than Joe, Carly had left home when he was still young. But, as his only sister, she had always felt a responsibility towards him, teaching him how to draw and paint when he was a toddler. Later, when Carly moved to London for university, they saw each other only occasionally. With each visit, she noticed him stand a little taller, his voice slightly deepen. But now she stood behind the camera in his hospital ward, she captured a rapid change with every photograph. The hair he'd dyed blonde and then coloured flamboyantly, knowing it would fall out, came out in chunks until he shaved it off, as Carly had done, to stop it getting all over his clothes and bedroom floor. He began covering his head in the photos, and talked about wearing a wig. The steroids he took in preparation for the next stage of chemotherapy aged him, and had another dramatic effect. ""Joe put on weight to the point where he was unrecognisable. The pictures also showed his stretch marks from the severe weight gain,"" Carly says. More and more, Joe reached out to Carly for support and advice. As a young boy he'd seen her go through cancer; he knew what the illness had done to his sister, but he also saw her defeat it. ""Even when he had doubts and misgivings, the fact that I recovered meant I could provide him with the hope and positivity to continue his treatment,"" she says. Because Joe's cancer was less advanced, she thought his treatment would be quicker and her photographic series shorter. The collection would represent the journey of a young man overcoming cancer. But Joe's first round of chemotherapy was unsuccessful. ""The news shook everybody up a lot. Our relationship changed, it became a little more unstable,"" Carly says. Having suffered a relapse, Joe would have to endure four more months of chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplants. His hair, which had begun to grow back, fell out again. Joe said he no longer wanted to be photographed - a decision Carly says she understood and respected - but with time came greater determination and fresh positivity. A month or so later, he changed his mind again. ""The image I liked most was him turning away in a contemplative manner. There, he knew what was to come, and his eyes glared into the distance,"" Carly says. ""It showed how he had changed and how he had adapted to this role of being a young cancer patient."" Against his consultant's advice Joe stopped stem-cell treatment. He feared the side-effects - the breathing trouble, skin problems, jaundice and diarrhoea that can occur if donor cells attack the host - would blight his life. And shortly after taking that decision, in May, his scans came back clear. It meant that he was put into remission and able to join his family on holiday in Menorca, and then at Lee's wedding. He will have regular appointments over the next few months to monitor his condition, but he has lost the weight he gained and his hair is finally growing back again. Carly says her images offer stark evidence of how reality changed for the family during a time in which both her and Joe's ""body, mind and soul were tested to the ultimate ends"". ""These photographs I have captured, of both Joe and I, evoke some painful memories for me; however, they also remind me of the huge capacity of the human body to endure through such hellish times. ""This collection of images may give only a glimpse into those times but my hope is that an audience can see not just the horrifying aspects, but also the promise that being a survivor of cancer gives and the tremendous hope for others facing a similar condition.""

Sturgeon joins MPs after 'watershed' election win,"Nicola Sturgeon joined the SNPâs newly-elected MPs for a group photo outside the V&A Museum Nicola Sturgeon has welcomed the SNP's new raft of MPs in Dundee following their ""watershed"" general election win. The partywon 48 of Scotland's 59 constituencies in Thursday's poll. Ms Sturgeon was joined by a large number of her new Westminster contingent for a photo call at the city's V&A museum. She said the result showed that the majority of people in Scotland ""want a very different future"" to the rest of the UK. In a phone call on Friday, the first minister told Boris Johnson she would publish a paper next week outlining the case for another vote on Scottish independence. The prime minister said he was opposed to a referendum, despite the SNP's general election success. PM Johnson 'remains opposed' to holding indyref2 Sturgeon: PM has 'no right' to block Indyref2 Speaking in Dundee, Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish electorate had rejected Mr Johnson, the Conservative party and Brexit. They had sent a clear signal that they wanted the future of Scotland to be ""in the hands of people who live here"", she added. ""The Tories - although they will rage against that reality, no doubt, for as long as they can - have to accept and understand it,"" she said. ""They were rejected in Scotland. They put the issue of opposition to an independence referendum... on the ballot paper and they lost vote share, they lost more than 50% of their seats - it was a catastrophic defeat for the Tories on that single issue."" She said the UK government ""can't ultimately block the will of the Scottish people"", adding that the ""mandate and momentum"" is on the side of another referendum. SNP MPs pose for selfies at the photo call in Dundee Ms Sturgeon's party secured 45% of the vote in this election - 8.1% more than in the last in 2017, when it won 35 seats. It was their second best resultafter 2015 - when they took 56 seats. Ms Sturgeon said Friday's result exceeded her expectations. Across the UK, the Conservatives secured their biggest majority since the 1980sin what Boris Johnson described as a ""historic"" election victory. On Friday he told Ms Sturgeon he opposed a second referendum, they he was committed to the union and the result of the 2014 referendum should be respected. Nicola Sturgeon and SNP MPs posed in front of the Forth Bridge in 2015 after winning their best ever result - securing 56 of Scotland's 59 seats Scottish Labour will return only one MP to Westminster- Edinburgh South's Ian Murray - after losing six seats in Scotland. Itsgoverning body met on Saturdayto discuss how to move on from the election defeat. Scottish Labour leaderRichard Leonard lamented his party's ""devastating"" result, putting the defeat down to constitutional issues rather than shifting blame on to Jeremy Corbyn. Willie Rennie, the Scottish Liberal Democrat leader, is also expected to gather his MPs for the first time since the vote. The party maintained four seats in Scotland, despite the high-profile loss of UK leader Jo Swinson. The SNP took Jo Swinson's seat Shelost out by 149 votes in East Dunbartonshire, in what was seen as a major scalp for the SNP. However, the Lib Dems won in the UK's most marginal constituency, North East Fife, withWendy Chamberlain beating the SNP's Stephen Gethins, who previously won with the UK's smallest majority - just two votes. The Scottish Conservatives lost more than half the seats they had held north of the border. They now have six MPs, in the south and the north-east of the country.
