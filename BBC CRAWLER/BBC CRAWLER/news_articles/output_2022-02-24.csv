BBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place any more,"I was awake at night when I got a message from a colleague about Vladimir Putin's speech announcing an invasion. Then immediately the explosions began. I could hear them from my home, and people in different parts of the city started sending messages to our WhatsApp group, about explosions happening close to them. To realise that Kyiv itself was under attack, not the front line in the east of the country, was a big shock. There is no safe place in Ukraine any more. The biggest fear for ordinary people here is running out of electricity and the internet not working - then we would be really isolated. Another fear is that bridges over the Dnieper river will be bombed, dividing the eastern and western halves of the city. The explosions continued for about 30 minutes. I dressed my 10-year-old son. We had some breakfast, sitting as far from the windows as we could, but he was so scared he vomited. We took a candle and some water to our cellar, which will be our refuge if things get worse. There are huge queues outside the supermarkets near my home and at ATMs, many of which have run out of money. Some petrol stations too have now run out and closed. There is an air of panic, now that we know the entire country is under attack. The roads out of the city are blocked with traffic, but it's a perilous journey - sitting in long, slow-moving queues of traffic you could easily run out of fuel far from home. Trains are operating, but there are big crowds of people trying to get a seat. Ukrainian airspace is closed, under the martial law introduced by President Zelensky. It's not only military targets that have been destroyed - we have photographs of residential buildings in a number of cities around the country that have taken direct hits. The Russian bombardment has affected all regions of the country. Even in Lviv, close to the Polish border, sirens went off this morning and a colleague had to take refuge in a bomb shelter. One colleague has taken his family out of Kyiv in the hope of avoiding the attacks from the air. The countryside may be safer than the city, but in a country under attack from north, east and south, there is no truly safe place here any more.

"Warning UK energy bills could top Â£3,000 a year","Household energy bills could top Â£3,000 a year in England, Wales and Scotland from October, in part due to the Ukraine crisis, a report has warned. The bank Investec said the conflict, along with surging global demand, had made gas and electricity prices soar. It expects the energy price cap, which limits what suppliers can charge, to hit Â£3,238 a year for the average home when it's next adjusted in October. The cap is already due to rise by Â£693 to Â£1,971 in April. Investec analyst Martin Young said a further rise in October, which would impact about 22 million households in England, Wales and Scotland, would be ""devastating"". He said such an increase would ""plunge many people into fuel poverty"", with many facing an ""eat or heat dilemma in the winter season"". ""Absent sharp and significant declines in wholesale prices, we expect a significant jump in the cap in October,"" he said. Will Russia's invasion of Ukraine push up gas bills? Oil hits new high and shares sink as Russia invades UK gas and electricity prices have been rising for months, due to surging global demand following the end of pandemic restrictions. However, Investec said prices had risen even higher following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and would remain elevated for months. Russia is the world's largest natural gas exporter, and there are concerns western sanctions could push President Vladimir Putin to ""weaponise"" his resources and constrict supplies to Europe. That would drive up wholesale prices worldwide, including in the UK, which gets little of its gas from Russia directly. Nathan Piper, oil and gas analyst at Investec, told the BBC: ""Disruption to the flow of gas [from Russia to Europe] would result in extremely high prices with no real alternatives. ""So, we were tight in Europe with domestic production declining and the invasion of Ukraine has raised stakes higher."" Energy bills have soared in the last six months due to a record increase in global gas prices. It has led to almost 30, mostly smaller energy firms, going bust due to suppliers being unable to deliver price promises and has affected 4.3 million domestic customers. It has come at time when the prices of food, manufactured goods and fuel are also soaring, squeezing household budgets. The UK inflation rate is currently at a 30-year high of 5.5%. Approval of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, running from Russia's Baltic coast to north-eastern Germany, has been put on hold because of the invasion of Ukraine The government has said millions of households will receive energy bill discounts totalling Â£350 from October to ease the crisis. However, Â£200 of this will be repayable, and Mr Young called the support ""little more than a poorly disguised loan"". ""Energy is likely to intensify as a political crisis for the government,"" he said. ""We suggest that a return to the drawing board is necessary to ensure support is there for those that need it, and if this means tough decisions for the chancellor then these decisions must be made.""

'Twosday' twins born on 22/2/22,"Thomas and Daniel had been due to be born a day earlier A mum who gave birth to twins on the 22nd day of the second month of 2022 says the date has to be lucky. Laura, 30, and her partner Jon, 38, from Fleckney, Leicestershire, became parents of two boys - Thomas and Daniel - on 22/2/22 - which was celebrated on social media as ""Twosday"". The boys - Thomas and Daniel - had been due to be delivered a day earlier but there was a delay at the hospital. Laura said the boys, born just before 37 weeks, were doing really well. The boys were due to be delivered by Caesarean on Monday but the operation at Leicester Royal Infirmary was pushed back. The twins were born just before 37 weeks Laura said her step-daughters had already mentioned how good it would be if the twins were born on 22 February. She said she thought she was ""never going to get to that date"". ""It's got to be good luck hasn't it? To have twins on all the twos - on a Tuesday as well,"" she said. Laura and the twins are still in hospital but she said they were doing ""really well"" A second baby, Kioyn, was born at the same hospital on the same day at 14:02 GMT - or 2:02pm. His father Frederick, 37, said his son's timing made him a ""special child"". He had been due to be born by Caesarean on Friday but his delivery was brought forward. Frederick said his new son was a ""very good boy"" Frederick said he and his wife, from Newbold Verdon, Leicestershire, had not realised the significance of the new date until after their son was born. ""We were just excited. The date didn't really matter to us,"" he said. ""They are doing well. Kioyn is a very good boy. He's been sleeping all night and he doesn't cry at all."" The couple already have two daughters and Frederick said he was now ""the happiest man you can imagine"". Fiona Ford, midwifery matron at the University Hospitals of Leicester NHS Trust, said: ""It's always a privilege being part of the team bringing new babies into the world but it's extra special to think those born on Tuesday will share such a unique date of birth. ""And we were lucky enough to have twins, and one baby born at 2:02pm - what are the chances? ""Congratulations to all of the families.""

MP urges government to seize Roman Abramovich assets,"The government should seize the assets of Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich, a Labour MP has said, citing concerns about alleged links to corruption. Chris Bryant told MPs he had a leaked Home Office document which suggested the Chelsea Football Club owner should not be able to base himself in the UK. Mr Bryant said it was written in 2019 and ""little"" had been done since then. A spokesperson for Mr Abramovich declined to comment. Replying to Mr Bryant, senior minister Mark Spencer said the government had taken ""very strong action against high-profile Russian individuals who are of concern"". Abramovich gets apology over false Putin claim PM misspoke over Roman Abramovich sanction claim Sanctions urged for Russians in English football Downing Street would not be drawn on the claims about Mr Abramovich made in the Commons. The PM's spokesman said: ""I couldn't comment on individuals in that way or on leaked documents of that type."" Earlier this week the government announced it wouldimpose sanctions on three billionaires with close links to President Vladimir Putinas part of the UK's response to Russia's actions in Ukraine. Mr Abramovich is one of Russia's richest people and is believed to be close to President Putin. Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Bryant urged the government to take action against Mr Abramovich, including removing his ownership of Chelsea Football Club and seizing his assets. Quoting from the leaked Home Office document, he said: ""'As part of HMG's [Her Majesty's Government] Russia strategy aimed at targeting illicit finance and malign activity, Abramovich remains of interest to HMG due to his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices. An example of this is Abramovich admitting in court proceedings that he paid for political influence. Therefore HMG is focused on ensuring individuals linked to illicit finance and malign activity are unable to base themselves in the UK and will use the relevant tools at its disposal, including immigration powers to prevent this'."" Mr Bryant noted that the document had been produced three years ago and said: ""Surely Mr Abramovich should no longer be able to own a football club in this country? ""Surely we should be looking at seizing some of his assets including his Â£152m home?"" Mr Abramovich with then-Chelsea captain Frank Lampard in 2005 As well as owning Chelsea, Mr Abramovich is also the primary owner of the private investment company Millhouse LLC. He built his fortune in oil following the collapse of the former Soviet Union in the 1990s. In 2018, Mr Abramovich experienced delays when applying to extend his visa to stay in the UK and eventually withdrew his application. In October 2021, the businessman's spokesperson confirmed he travelled to London as an Israeli citizen - therefore entering the United Kingdom without the need for a visa. Tier 1 investor visas, offering foreign investors fast-track residency in the UK, are being scrapped with immediate effect, Home Secretary Priti Patel confirmed last week.

'Turning point in history' - World leaders react,"The Poland-Ukraine border. Poland is setting up reception points for expected refugees Major Western nations have reacted with outrage at Russia's invasion of Ukraine, accusing it of bringing war back to Europe. France's Emmanuel Macron said this was a ""turning point in the history of Europe"", with the G7 group of nations vowing to impose severe sanctions. In eastern Europe, the fears extended to coping with a wave of refugees. But China bridled at the word invasion and joined those nations focusing more on their citizens' safety. Ukraine says Russia is carrying out a full-scale attack from many directions, but the details of the assault and the number of casualties are not yet clear. Russian President Vladimir Putin has spoken of a ""special military operation"" aimed at the demilitarisation and ""denazification"" of Ukraine, but his overall goals also remain unclear. The uncertainty has not stopped an angry and defiant response from Western allies. A largely united voice spoke out with condemnation and promises of sanctions. US President Joe Biden said: ""President Putin has chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering."" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said Mr Putin was ""responsible for bringing war back to Europe"". UK PM Boris Johnson said Mr Putin had ""chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction"" with an ""unprovoked attack"". German Chancellor Olaf Scholz also reacted angrily, calling this ""Putin's war"" and saying the Russian leader would pay a ""bitter price"" for his ""serious error"". LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? FROM KYIV:""There is no safe place any more"" FROM MOSCOW:Shock and support in Russian capital IN MAPS:How Russia carried out the invasion The G7 - the US, Japan, Germany, Britain, France, Italy and Canada - vowed in a joint statement to bring forward ""severe and co-ordinated"" sanctions. The EU bloc will have more of them, which Ms Von der Leyen said would ""weaken Russia's economic base and its capacity to modernise"". But there remains huge concern at what could happen next. One German minister spoke of a ""land war in Europe that we thought was only to find in history books"", while another, Interior Minister Nancy Faeser, said Germany would help neighbours if there was a ""large-scale influx"" of refugees. That concern is also shared by Ukraine's neighbours, but many were also scrambling to shore up their own security. The president of Lithuania, a Nato member, said he was going to impose a state of emergency. A similar decree has been issued by Moldova further south. Dozens of cars were reportedly queuing on the border with Ukraine, with Moldova saying it would accept tens of thousands of refugees. Europe prepares for wave of refugees Romania said it could take half a million. Poland is setting up reception points for refugees. It told Russia to end its attacks and leave Ukraine alone. Georgia - which fought Russia in 2008 over disputed regions - backed Ukraine, saying the Russian attack would have ""dire consequences"" for the international community. Russia's ally, Belarus, said it was not taking part in the military action, but would consider it if asked. Belarus has hosted Russian troops during the crisis, and they crossed from the country into Ukraine as part of the attack. Ukraine has asked Nato member Turkey to close the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits to Russian ships. Turkey will consider the request but shares friendly ties with both nations, and said it was ""sincerely saddened"" that they had come ""face-to-face"". There has been a lot of interest in how China would respond. Its initial response was to call the word invasion a ""typical Western media question method"", with the foreign ministry saying ""we won't go rushing to a conclusion"". Senior diplomat Wang Yi said China understood Russia's security concerns. China and Russia now have a strategic partnership aimed at countering US influence, sealed when Mr Putin and President Xi Jinping met just before the Winter Olympics in Beijing. China told its citizens in Ukraine to fly a Chinese flag to try to protect themselves. This video can not be played WATCH: Footage from Ukraine shows explosions, a missile strike and a helicopter under fire United Nations chief, AntÃ³nio Guterres, urged Vladimir Putin to halt the attack ""in the name of humanity"". A US-led draft resolution will demand Russia leaves Ukraine ""immediately, completely, unconditionally"", although Moscow has the power to veto it. South Korea condemned the attack, saying it would join international economic sanctions. And Australia will expand those it has already enforced. There must be ""a cost for this violent, unacceptable and egregious behaviour"", Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. India has focused on trying to keep its citizens inside Ukraine safe, although media reported that PM Narendra Modi could talk later to Mr Putin in a possible role as mediator. Iran called for a political solution, with its foreign minister blaming Nato provocations for the Ukraine crisis. Fear and frustration as people leave eastern Ukraine.

Misleading images of Russian attack spread online,"Old footage of aircraft taking part in Victory Day celebrations over Moscow were incorrectly labelled on Twitter The Russian invasion of Ukraine has led to false or misleading videos and photographs being posted on social media claiming to be from the conflict. Some of those checked by the BBC include footage from previous conflicts in Ukraine or elsewhere in the world, and images of troops on exercises. Social media platforms such as Twitter seem to be taking a proactive role in confronting misleading content, removing several videos shown to be misleading by fact-checkers and researchers. In the opening hours of the conflict, several videos claiming to be the Russian air force operating over Ukraine were posted and went viral on social media. One clip, which has subsequently been deleted, shows a fighter jet flying over an urban area. It is accompanied by a caption which implies it was filmed in the current Ukraine conflict. This does not show a Russian or a Ukrainian jet Closer inspection, however, reveals that the aircraft is an American-built F-16 Fighting Falcon, which has never been in service in either Russia or Ukraine. A second clip shows formations of fighters and bombers flying over an urban area to the sound of air raid sirens. These aircraft were preparing for a military parade flypast in 2020 Checks made by the BBC found that the footage showed preparations for a military parade flypast in 2020. The sound of an air raid siren had been dubbed over the original audio. Another video clip claims to show Russian paratroopers landing near the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv. These troops weren't filmed parachuting into Ukraine It's been viewed hundreds of thousands of times on Twitter, but actually first appeared on Russian-language internet in 2016. A fourth clip shared widely on Twitter and YouTube is labelled as showing a Russian jet being shot down over Ukraine. This footage is from Libya and is over 10 years old However, BBC journalists have seen this footage before. It's a Libyan government aircraft being shot down by rebels over Benghazi in 2011. Voices on the video can be heard celebrating in Arabic. Some imagery does not show combat operations at all. Footage of an explosion behind some apartment blocks claims to be from the city of Mariupol in south-eastern Ukraine. Among those sharing the clip is the Twitter account of former Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Volodymyr Yelchenko. This footage appeared on TikTok in January However, a version of this video wasuploaded to TikTok on 29 January,external, on an account which regularly posts images and film of explosions. Further, as the caption to the video suggests in Russian, it shows the result of a lightning strike on a power station, rather than any military action. Users have also questioned the greenery on the trees, with available data showing average February temperatures in Mariupol at around zero Celsius. Some social media users have shared an image which claims to be of Russian troops raising a flag on the municipal building in the Ukrainian city of Kharkiv today. This photo is from 2014 While the caption is correct - it does show Russians hoisting the flag on that building in Kharkiv - reverse image search tools show that the event took place in 2014, during an earlier period of unrest. Finally, a video shared by one Chinese-language Twitter account, with the caption ""Putin the Great has attacked Ukraine"" is easily recognisable as the explosion of a port building in Beirut in August 2020, which caused more than 200 deaths. The is an image of an explosion in Beirut in 2020 Fast-moving events mean that misleading imagery will inevitably appear on social media. It is easily shared, often by those who believe the images to be genuine. Social media users can limit the spread of disinformation by taking a few seconds before hitting the ""share"" button to consider whether what they're seeing seems genuine and is from a source that they trust. Most news organisations go to great lengths to verify footage before using it in their reports, so checking with multiple trusted sources before sharing will help to prevent these images from being widely shared.

What we know about Ukraine invasion so far,"This video can not be played Watch: Kyiv residents explain why they're fleeing the Ukrainian capital Russia has begun a large-scale military attack on Ukraine, its southern neighbour, on the orders of Russian President Vladimir Putin. There are reports of attacks on Ukrainian military infrastructure across the country, and Russian convoys entering from all directions. Here is what we know so far. In a televised speech at 05:55 Moscow time (02:55 GMT), Mr Putin announced a ""military operation"" in Ukraine's eastern Donbas region. This area is home to many Russian-speaking Ukrainians. Parts of it has been occupied and run by Russian-backed rebels since 2014. Mr Putin said Russia was intervening as an act of self-defence. Russia did not want to occupy Ukraine, he said, but would demilitarise and ""de-Nazify"" the country. Why does Russia portray Ukraine as pro-Nazi? He urged Ukrainian soldiers in the combat zone to lay down their weapons and go home, but said clashes were inevitable and ""only a question of time"". And he added that any intervention from outside powers to resist the Russian attack would be met with an ""instant"" and devastating response. BBC correspondents heard loud bangs in the capital Kyiv, as well as Kramatorsk in the Donetsk region of eastern Ukraine. Blasts have also been heard in the southern port city of Odesa. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia had carried out missile strikes on Ukraine's infrastructure and on border guards. Russia's defence ministry has denied attacking Ukrainian cities - saying it was targeting military infrastructure, air defence and air forces with ""high-precision weapons"". Tanks and troops have poured into Ukraine at points along its eastern, southern and northern borders, Ukraine says. Russian military convoys have crossed from Belarus into Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region, and from Russia into the Sumy region, which is also in the north, Ukraine's border guard service (DPSU) said. Belarus is a long-time ally of Russia. Analysts describe the small country as Russia's ""client state"". A Russian convoy enters Ukraine's Kherson region from Crimea Convoys have also entered the eastern Luhansk and Kharkiv regions, and moved into the Kherson region from Crimea - a territory that Russia annexed from Ukraine in 2014. The Russian offensive was preceded by artillery fire and there were injuries to border guards, the DPSU said. There have also been reports of troops landing by sea at the Black Sea port cities of Mariupol and Odesa in the south. A British resident of Odesa told the BBC many people were leaving. About 10 civilians are believed to have been killed, including six in an air strike in Brovary near the capital Kyiv. A man was also killed in shelling outside the major eastern city of Kharkiv. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said that more than 40 soldiers had died and dozens more were wounded. Ukraine said it had killed 50 Russian troops. LIVE:Follow latest developments THE BASICS:What does Putin want? EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The Ukrainian armed forces said they had shot down five Russian planes and a helicopter - which Russia denies - and inflicted casualties on invading troops. But later on Thursday President Zelensky said Ukraine had suffered losses and a lot of aircraft and armoured vehicles had been destroyed. Russia said it has destroyed more than 70 military targets in Ukraine. Much of the fighting appears to be centred around the east of the country. But clashes have also been taking place around Kyiv and the Black Sea port cities of Odesa and Mariupol. Ukraine said its Antonov aircraft had been shot down near Kyiv Ukraine has declared martial law - which means the military takes control temporarily. It has cut diplomatic ties with Russia, offered weapons to anyone who wants them and declared an overnight curfew for Kyiv. Meanwhile Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba implored the world to impose devastating sanctions, including banning Russia from the international Swift bank transfer system In Kyiv there are huge jams on expressways as people flee the city. Social media testimonies speak to a growing sense of panic, with some saying they are being rushed into bomb shelters and into basements. Television footage has showed people praying in the streets. Many people in Kyiv have sought shelter in underground metro stations. There were long queues at petrol stations and cash machines. Residents have been sheltering in metro stations Further east in Kramatorsk, in the eastern Donetsk region, the BBC's Eastern European Correspondent Sarah Rainsford said people did not expect such a full-on assault. ""People were out on the streets last night in this city - they were waving the Ukrainian flag. They said this was their land. They were going nowhere,"" she reported. ""This is what people have been expecting, they have been waiting for, but no-one here can quite believe it's actually happening."" Oil prices surged above $100 for the first time in more than seven years. Meanwhile Russia's currency, the rouble, fell to an all-time low against the dollar and the euro. And the London Stock Exchange's leading FTSE 100 index plunged more than 200 points, or 2.7%, within moments of opening. People have driven across fields to leave the eastern city of Kharkiv US President Joe Biden said Mr Putin had ""chosen a premeditated war that will bring a catastrophic loss of life and human suffering"". He said he would address Americans on Thursday about consequences Russia would face. UKPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that the ""hideous and barbaric venture by Vladimir Putin must end in failure"". Addressing Russians, he said: ""I cannot believe this is being done in your name, or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime.""

Europe was ""facing its darkest hours since World War Two"", EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said.

Oil hits new high and shares sink as Russia invades,"Oil prices surged past $100 (Â£74) a barrel to hit their highest level for more than seven years after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine. Global shares fell on worries of the possible impact of the conflict, but US tech stocks rebounded in late trading. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Brent crude eased from $105 to $98 a barrel,but not before UK petrol prices had hit another record high. The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The price of UK natural gas futures soared nearly 60% on Thursday. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Russia launches military operation in Ukraine What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average petrol prices hit a record high of nearly 149.5p on Wednesday, with diesel at 152.83p. The RAC said that if the oil price reached $110 a barrel the average price of petrol could hit Â£1.55 a litre. If prices do get this high it will ""cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work and running their lives as it would sky rocket the cost of a full tank to Â£85"", said the RAC's Simon Williams. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because crude oil is traded in dollars. The price of crude oil is up, and the pound is down against the dollar. News of Russia's actions led to steep falls on global stock markets. In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index fell more 3.9%, its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. Germany's Dax index lost 4%. In the US, the Dow Jones fell nearly 2% in early trading but a late rally in the tech sector meant in ended 0.3% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 3.3% and the S&P 500 closed trading up 1.5%. Shares in Netflix and Microsoft were both up more than 5%, respectively. After talking with allies from the G7, US President Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned companies. Wall Street which traded in the red at the start of the day on news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hit session highs in the wake of Biden's comments. The Moscow Stock Exchange saw trading suspended briefly, but when it reopened the index fell by more than a third. On the currency markets, the rouble sank to a record low against the US dollar. The price of gold - which is considered a haven asset in times of uncertainty - jumped 3% to its highest price in more than a year. Will Russia-Ukraine tensions push up UK gas bills? Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the oil price surge ""was terrible news for businesses and consumers"" because ""it will serve to further stoke inflation"". ""Not only will energy bills keep going up, but food prices look set to jump even higher. Ukraine and Russia are both big food suppliers and any disruption to supplies will force buyers to seek alternative sources, which could jack up prices."" The UK's cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 30 years, as energy, fuel and food prices continued to soar,squeezing household budgets. Meanwhile, Mr Mould said the fall in the FTSE 100 ""was bad news for the millions of savers and investors who have money in UK equities"". Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Small wonder then that prices are shooting up. Brent crude oil has gone above $100 a barrel, while prices for gas on wholesale markets - where domestic suppliers buy what they need - are up sharply as well. Supplies from Russia do not appear to have been affected - yet. But the fear that they will be, and that there could be a scramble for other resources, is pushing up costs. Stock markets across Europe are tumbling, as investors fret about the potential economic impact of high energy prices and the potential for much wider sanctions as well. And as for Russian shares, a graph showing the performance of the MOEX stock exchange in Moscow looks like a cliff in the Ural mountains today. In response to Russia's military action, the UK, US and European Union are set to put more sanctions on Russia. There are fears that sanctions, along with the impact of the invasion, could disrupt the supply of agricultural products and raw materials from Ukraine and Russia. The two countries combined are major wheat suppliers, producing 29% of global exports, most of which travels through ports in the Black Sea. Russia also produces aluminium, cobalt, copper, diamonds, fertiliser, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, titanium and steel. TheEuropean Council said,externalit would ""impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its actions"". Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said the sanctions ""will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia"". Russian assets in the EU will be frozen and Russian banks' access to European financial markets will be stopped, she said. ""These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war,"" she added. The biggest economic hit would come from disconnecting Russia's banking system from the international Swift payment system, but that could also affect the US and European economies. The US and EU have already imposeda series of sanctionsin response to Mr Putin's actions against Ukraine. The UK has frozen the assets of five banks and three Russian billionaires, who have also been hit with travel bans. Meanwhile Germany has frozen final approval for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which connects the country with Russia and was set to boost Russian gas exports to the EU.

Russia unleashes forces on Ukraine on three sides,"This video can not be played WATCH: Footage from Ukraine shows explosions, a missile strike and a helicopter under fire Russian forces have launched a major assault on Ukraine, firing missiles on cities and military targets. The invasion by land, air and sea began after a pre-dawn TV address where Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine's military lay down its arms. Initial reports of casualties included Ukrainian civilians and soldiers, and Russian troops. Ukraine's leader said his country ""won't give up its freedom"". ""Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted. Ukraine has declared martial law and severed all diplomatic relations with Russia. It says weapons will be given to anyone who wants them. In the capital Kyiv, home to almost three million people, warning sirens blared out as traffic queued to leave the city and crowds sought shelter in metro stations. ""We don't understand what we should do now,"" one woman called Svetlana told the BBC. ""We're now going to a place where we can be safe and we hope we can leave safely."" Mark, a 27-year-old sales executive, said he was ready to be called up to fight. ""We don't have another way,"" he said. Several neighbouring countries have begun preparations to take in a large number of refugees. Moldova alone said more than 4,000 people had come over the border from Ukraine. LIVE:Follow latest developments THE BASICS:What does Putin want? EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Thursday's invasion followed weeks of escalating tensions, as Russia massed troops along Ukraine's borders. The UK, EU and other Western allies have vowed to impose tough new sanctions to punish Moscow, but say they will not send in troops. ""These are among the darkest hours of Europe since the Second World War,"" EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said. Dozens of people have been killed, including about 10 civilians. Six died in an air strike in Brovary near the capital Kyiv. A man was also killed in shelling outside the major north-eastern city of Kharkiv. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said that more than 40 soldiers had died and many more were wounded. Ukraine said it had killed 50 Russian troops and shot down six Russian aircraft, but this has not been verified. Mr Zelensky said Russia had positioned almost 200,000 troops and thousands of combat vehicles on Ukraine's borders ahead of Thursday's invasion. Moscow first struck Ukraine's military infrastructure and border guard units. Then Ukrainian forces said Russian military vehicles had crossed the border near Kharkiv in the north, Luhansk in the east, Russian-annexed Crimea in the south and from Belarus too. Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko said his country's military were not involved but could be if needed. Russian tanks were later seen on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million people. Russian forces also reportedly landed by sea at Ukraine's major port cities of Odesa on the Black Sea and Mariupol on the internal Sea of Azov. Much of the fighting appears to be centred around the east. Residents of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, say windows in apartment blocks were shaking from constant blasts as the Ukrainian military and Russian forces exchanged shellfire. But clashes have have also been taking place around the capital Kyiv in the north and the southern ports of Odesa and Mariupol. Ukraine's army said Kyiv's Boryspil international airport was among a number of airfields that had been bombed, along with military headquarters and warehouses in the big cities of Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Footage verified by the BBC showed missiles slamming into an airport in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk. Russia claimed to have destroyed more than 70 military targets. The Russian leader launched the ""special military operation"" by repeating a number of unfounded claims he has made this week, including alleging that Ukraine's democratically elected government had been responsible for eight years of genocide. President Putin announced the military attack on Ukraine in a pre-recorded TV address He said the goal was demilitarisation and ""denazification"" of Ukraine. Hours earlier Ukraine's president had asked how a people who lost eight million of its citizens fighting Nazis could support Nazism. ""How could I be a Nazi?"" said Mr Zelensky, who is himself Jewish. Mr Putin also warned that any outside power intervening on Ukraine's behalf would face an ""instant"" response. Neighbouring countries have reacted to the crisis. In the Baltic republic ofEstonia,which borders Russia, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said anumber of Nato allies that shared borders with Russia had agreed to launch consultations,externalunder Nato's Article 4. Under the defensive alliance's treaty, Nato can be brought together if any member fears their independence or territory is under threat. ""Russia's widespread aggression is a threat to the entire world and to all Nato countries,"" she said. As cars queued on Ukraine's border withMoldova, the country's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu said she was declaring a state of emergency and was prepared to give help to tens of thousands of Ukrainians.LithuanianPresident Gitanas Nauseda also said he was signing a state of emergency to be approved by parliament. ""President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,"" saidUNSecretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. Ukraine's Western allies had repeatedly warned that Russia was poised to invade, despite repeated denials from Moscow. The US, EU, UK andJapanimposed sanctions against leading Russians, Russian banks and MPs who backed the move. In a televised address,UKPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that the ""hideous and barbaric venture by Vladimir Putin must end in failure"". Addressing Russians, he said: ""I cannot believe this is being done in your name, or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime."" He told Ukrainians that the UK was ""on your side"". USPresident Joe Biden said the world would hold Russia accountable. He is expected to address Americans on Thursday about consequences Russia will face. France's President Emmanuel Macron said the attack would have ""deep, lasting consequences for our lives"". There are long queues as Kyiv residents try to leave Earlier this week Russia's president announced he was recognising the independence of two self-proclaimed people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. The breakaway regions were seized by Russian-backed rebels after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. Mr Putin launched that attack after mass street protests in Ukraine that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Since then more than 14,000 people have died in the east in a conflict between the rebels and Ukrainian forces. A shaky ceasefire had held but there has been a surge in violations in recent days. Mr Putin said the military operation's objective was to defend the people in the breakaway areas. Kyiv and its Western allies have repeatedly rejected as absurd Mr Putin's claims that Ukraine was being run by neo-Nazis, instead pointing out that Ukraine was now a nation with growing democratic institutions, unlike an authoritarian Russia. Fears of a Russian attack have been rising for months. Mr Putin has repeatedly accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining the Nato military alliance and offer Moscow security guarantees.

There is no safe place any more,"I was awake at night when I got a message from a colleague about Vladimir Putin's speech announcing an invasion. Then immediately the explosions began. I could hear them from my home, and people in different parts of the city started sending messages to our WhatsApp group, about explosions happening close to them. To realise that Kyiv itself was under attack, not the front line in the east of the country, was a big shock. There is no safe place in Ukraine any more. The biggest fear for ordinary people here is running out of electricity and the internet not working - then we would be really isolated. Another fear is that bridges over the Dnieper river will be bombed, dividing the eastern and western halves of the city. The explosions continued for about 30 minutes. I dressed my 10-year-old son. We had some breakfast, sitting as far from the windows as we could, but he was so scared he vomited. We took a candle and some water to our cellar, which will be our refuge if things get worse. There are huge queues outside the supermarkets near my home and at ATMs, many of which have run out of money. Some petrol stations too have now run out and closed. There is an air of panic, now that we know the entire country is under attack. The roads out of the city are blocked with traffic, but it's a perilous journey - sitting in long, slow-moving queues of traffic you could easily run out of fuel far from home. Trains are operating, but there are big crowds of people trying to get a seat. Ukrainian airspace is closed, under the martial law introduced by President Zelensky. It's not only military targets that have been destroyed - we have photographs of residential buildings in a number of cities around the country that have taken direct hits. The Russian bombardment has affected all regions of the country. Even in Lviv, close to the Polish border, sirens went off this morning and a colleague had to take refuge in a bomb shelter. One colleague has taken his family out of Kyiv in the hope of avoiding the attacks from the air. The countryside may be safer than the city, but in a country under attack from north, east and south, there is no truly safe place here any more.

How hard will it be to defend Ukraine?,"The Russian armed forces dwarf those of Ukraine - and they have much more hardware and air power How hard will it be for Ukraine to defend itself now that an attack by Russia has begun? Ukraine is outgunned and outnumbered right across the board - after significant investment and modernisation in Russia's armed forces by President Putin. Dr Jack Watling, of the Royal United Services Institute, says: ""I think the Ukrainians are in a very difficult position."" He's just returned from Ukraine and says the country's military leaders now face some ""very hard choices"". Western officials estimate that Russia had up to 190,000 troops on Ukraine's border - far more than Ukraine's entire regular army of 125,600. Russian forces are already crossing the border from multiple directions. The military airport at Chuhuyev near Kharkiv was among targets hit first by Russia Ukraine will find it hard to defend thousands of miles of its frontier - from Belarus in the north all the way down to Crimea in the south. If you think of Ukraine as a clock face, the Russians can mount attacks from 10 o'clock to 7 o'clock. Ben Barry, of the International Institute of Strategic Studies (IISS) and a former British Army brigadier, says it's a ""very difficult position for a defender"". Added to that, Ukraine is being threatened in multiple directions and their forces are ""spread pretty thinly"", Jack Watling of the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) says. But the real disparity between Russian and Ukrainian forces is in the sky. Ukraine has 105 combat aircraft on the border compared with Russia's 300, Mr Watling says. The Russians, he predicts, ""will very quickly gain air superiority"". Russia's advanced air defence systems, such as S-400 missiles, also gives its forces an advantage. In contrast, Ukraine has older and more limited air defences. Mr Watling gives the example of Israel being able to defend itself from multiple directions. But he adds it's only been able to do so because of its superiority in the air. That's something Ukraine simply doesn't have. LIVE:Follow latest developments THE BASICS:What does Putin want? EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Moscow has developed its own version of ""shock and awe"" with integrated air, missile and long-range rocket artillery, says Ben Barry. It allows the Russians to attack Ukraine's command and control centres, ammunition depots, air force and air defences from far away. That already appears to have begun, with cruise missile attacks on targets near the capital Kyiv. Mr Watling says the Russians have a very significant arsenal of modern weapons and capabilities that Ukraine  doesn't have an answer to - like the Iskander cruise and ballistic missile systems. Ukraine has recently received supplies of ""lethal aid"" from the US and the UK, but these are mostly short-range air-to-air missiles and anti-tank weapons. In short, Russia outguns and outranges Ukraine. With Russia's air superiority and long-range weapons, the danger for Ukraine's forces is that they'll soon be pinned down. Ukraine's forces could be stopped from being able to manoeuvre and reposition to face the Russian advance from any other direction, Mr Watling believes. Many of Ukraine's best trained and equipped units are in the east of the country - near the line of control in Luhansk and Donetsk - where there's been fighting since 2014. Western intelligence officials have told the BBC there's a real worry that Russia could try to encircle them. However, Ukraine's armed forces are better trained and equipped than they were when Russia invaded Crimea. Mr Barry says units and soldiers have gained useful battle experience from the fight with Russian-backed separatists in the east of the country. But he adds they've mainly been involved in linear trench warfare and the demands of ""manoeuvre warfare"" will be much harder. Russia's forces are able to move quickly with mobile rocket and missile launchers and air defences. Russian troops, too, have been battle hardened from its invasion of Crimea, and in Syria. If the fighting enters Ukraine's towns and cities then that might give Ukraine's forces a chance. A well prepared defender can make urban fighting difficult and bloody for any attacker - as shown in Stalingrad in World War Two and more recently in Mosul in Iraq. A woman cleans her damaged house after artillery fire from an area of Donetsk under the control of Russian-backed rebels Ben Barry believes that Russian forces may initially try to bypass towns and cities. But he believes it's very unlikely that the Russians can avoid urban combat, not least in Kyiv given its political significance. Jack Watling says if Ukraine can defend its cities properly then they might be able to hold out for quite a long time. British-supplied light anti-tank weapons (also known as NLAWs) may help in close combat where Ukrainian forces can move around using the cover of buildings. An unknown number of civilians could also take up arms. Russia cannot just rely on airstrikes and artillery to control towns and cities. But Mr Watling says Russia already has agents and operatives on the ground. He says ""there will be subversion and unconventional operations in Kyiv to try and destabilise the government"". Russia, he adds, will also try to encircle cities and use long-range artillery to target pockets of resistance and then try to use special forces and agents to ""essentially murder civil society leaders"". Ukraine is now fighting for its survival. It's been engaged in combat with Russian-backed forces in the east for the past eight years, but the threat is now an existential one for the entire country. Having just visited Ukraine, Mr Watling says there is a ""grim determination to survive as a country, but there is a recognition that they are overmatched and that it's going to be exceedingly bloody"".

Mums in politics want family-friendly Welsh Parliament,"Heledd Fychan says the option to work remotely would lead to greater representation and diversity in the Senedd Virtual Senedd meetings should continue long after Covid to make politics accessible to all, a politician with an eight-year-old son has said. Heledd Fychan saidhybrid working in the pandemic,externalmeant she could balance the needs of her job and her child. Former Education Minister Kirsty Williams and former MS Eluned Parrott said raising children when elected had been difficult and reform was needed. A cross-party committee will consider how the Senedd can be reformed. There have long been calls for a Seneddcreche and job shares for MSs. No babies allowed in Commons, MP Stella Creasy told MP cradles baby on Commons benches Kirsty Williams: Abuse of women in politics getting worse Heledd Fychan being sworn into the Senedd remotely, with her son alongside her Ms Fychan, who became the member of the Senedd (MS) for South Wales Central in May, said starting the role in the middle of pandemic had been ""a bit strange"" but had also had its benefits. ""I feel lucky that we've have had that option [to work from home] since I became a member but I very much hope that will continue going forward,"" she said. Plenary has been held remotely during much of the pandemic ""There's certainly some people that are very keen to see all 60 members back and things to return to normal, but I would argue normal wasn't working for the majority of people and normal wasn't working in terms of getting greater representation and diversity in the chamber."" She said a number of reforms were needed: ""I would ensure there is a creche in the Senedd and I would look at different models in terms of flexibility and how to cover maternity or paternity leave as well."" Kirsty Williams, pictured with her husband Richard, left the Senedd after 22 years in May Kirsty Williams stood down as education minister and MS ahead of May's election after representing Brecon and Radnorshire since 1999. In 2001, she became the first member of the Senedd to have a baby while in office. With no proxy voting then in place she went back to work when her daughter was three months old. ""Looking back in it now, I really wish I had made a different decision and it's certainly not a decision I'd repeat, but at the time I didn't feel I had any other choice,"" she said. ""It was really challenging, so I would be in work all day, I was desperately trying to continue to breastfeed overnight, and I think those years really are an absolute blur."" The Senedd was still in its infancy and there was no support or provisions made apart from exclusive use of a fridge to store expressed breast milk, she said. Two more daughters followed in 2004 and 2006 but she said nothing had changed in that time. Kirsty relied very heavily on her mother in law but it was ""an incredible juggle"". She said the introduction of the proxy vote and funding to cover constituency work during maternity leave were ""very welcome"" but didn't go far enough. ""We've learned over the last 18 months that you don't actually need to be in the Senedd building to participate,"" she said. ""Being able to join the Senedd meeting remotely while you're on maternity leave and being able to vote yourself remotely while you're on maternity leave is something I think we need to consider."" She said life is a lot less stressful since standing down and she had had time to reflect on the sacrifices she made for her job. ""I've realised how much I missed out in the day to day lives of my children,"" she said. ""One of the upsides of leaving office is that I'm able to do lots more things that I previously wasn't able to do with them."" Eluned Parrott says her young daughter was relieved when she lost her seat Eluned Parrott became the member of the Senedd for South Wales Central in 2011 when her children were three and six. ""I think what's really telling is that after I'd lost my seat, my daughter admitted to me that she was hoping I would lose my seat, because she wanted her mum back,"" she said. ""I understand why she felt that way, it was such a difficult time."" She said in politics there was ""no such thing as the work being done"". ""You're torn between feeling like you're not doing enough in work and not doing enough at home either,"" she said. ""You're working such long hours that in fact it's not possible to use normal childcare... if I didn't have a husband at home who collected the kids on time what exactly was I supposed to do."" She would like to see changes, inclining a Senedd creche, the introduction of job shares and an increase in the number of MSs to decrease workload. Bethan Sayed quit the Senedd because it was ""impossible"" to balance her toddler and the job Bethan Sayed stood downas the Plaid Cymru MS for South Wales West at May's election, saying it was ""impossible"" to raise her then one-year-old with the hours her job demanded. Ms Sayed, who successfully campaigned for funding for an additional staff member to cover her constituency work while she was on maternity leave, has continued campaigning for reforms including a Senedd creche and job share options for MSs. She is due to meet with the Senedd's remuneration board in the new year. ""I think that change can happen, but it's too slow,"" she said. ""It shouldn't have taken me, after many years of devolution, to have maternity cover only by virtue of campaigning for it. ""We need to see action from the Senedd and we need to see this higher up the political agenda, so that we don't see the same faces, time and time again standing for election."" Catherine Fookes wants to see a 50/50 split between male and female MSs Catherine Fookes, director of Women's Equality Network Wales, said a Labour and Plaid agreement tointroduce gender quotas for MSs into lawwas ""ground-breaking"". The mother-of-two, who stood in the 2016 Senedd election, said: ""If there's a larger number of women in the Senedd we will get laws and a system that are more child-friendly and more family-friendly and that will do fathers good too."" Wales' Future Generations Commissioner Sophie Howe says having parents elected to the Senedd is ""so important"" Future Generations Commissionerfor Wales Sophie Howe, who has five children, agreed it was crucial more parents get elected to the Senedd. ""I was six months pregnant when I was elected to a position as a councillor in Cardiff, andÂ I had two other children whilst I was still a councillor and it was incredibly difficult,"" she said. ""I can remember, I had to take my third child into the council chamber with me for a big vote on a really important issue in the area that I represented whilst I was still breastfeeding, and I couldn't leave himÂ with anyone else because he wouldn't take a bottle but also I wasn't willing to let my constituents down. ""Those are some of the real issues that I think women in politics are grappling with. I'm not in a political role anymore, but I am in aÂ public facing role, and I think sometimes the challenges and the expectations on women and, indeed dads, who have got carry responsibilities, are really difficult to combine in terms of expectations of what you can do working evenings work on weekends, whilst also juggling family."" Ms Howe said many women who have small children aren't in the Senedd because they know how it operates, and they ""make a choice"". ""It it's so important that we do have people with these perspectives in politics and in public life, because these people are making policies for parents - they're making policies on what sort of nursery education happens, whether flexible working should be a universal rights and so on, and it's so important that people with real life perspectives of those things are contributing to making those policies."" MPs can claim funding to hire extra staff to cover maternity leave but they cannot take part in Commons debates or vote. This is similar in Wales, where MSs who want to take leave after having a baby can apply for an allowance to employ an additional member of staff to carry their constituency work but that cannot carry out official Senedd business such as attending plenary. The UK parliament does not have a proxy vote system, unlike in Wales where another member to cast a vote on an MS's behalf if they are unable to attend plenary meetings while on parental leave. Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle has asked a committee of MPs to review the rules on bringing babies into the Commons after Labour MP Stella Creasy was informed it wasagainst the rules. The Senedd has no specific policy, but a spokesperson said: ""Members of the Senedd with parental and caring responsibilities are provided with provisions to continue to perform their duties. For example, members may seek support for additional office staff during their parental leave as well as costs such as childcare. ""In October, Members of the Senedd voted to create a new cross-party committee which will consider how the Senedd could be reformed. It will consider options which would encourage the election of a more diverse Senedd.""

For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

Oil hits new high and shares sink as Russia invadesPetrol hits another record as crude prices reach their highest level for more than seven years.BusinessComments,"Oil prices surged past $100 (Â£74) a barrel to hit their highest level for more than seven years after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine. Global shares fell on worries of the possible impact of the conflict, but US tech stocks rebounded in late trading. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Brent crude eased from $105 to $98 a barrel,but not before UK petrol prices had hit another record high. The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The price of UK natural gas futures soared nearly 60% on Thursday. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Russia launches military operation in Ukraine What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average petrol prices hit a record high of nearly 149.5p on Wednesday, with diesel at 152.83p. The RAC said that if the oil price reached $110 a barrel the average price of petrol could hit Â£1.55 a litre. If prices do get this high it will ""cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work and running their lives as it would sky rocket the cost of a full tank to Â£85"", said the RAC's Simon Williams. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because crude oil is traded in dollars. The price of crude oil is up, and the pound is down against the dollar. News of Russia's actions led to steep falls on global stock markets. In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index fell more 3.9%, its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. Germany's Dax index lost 4%. In the US, the Dow Jones fell nearly 2% in early trading but a late rally in the tech sector meant in ended 0.3% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 3.3% and the S&P 500 closed trading up 1.5%. Shares in Netflix and Microsoft were both up more than 5%, respectively. After talking with allies from the G7, US President Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned companies. Wall Street which traded in the red at the start of the day on news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hit session highs in the wake of Biden's comments. The Moscow Stock Exchange saw trading suspended briefly, but when it reopened the index fell by more than a third. On the currency markets, the rouble sank to a record low against the US dollar. The price of gold - which is considered a haven asset in times of uncertainty - jumped 3% to its highest price in more than a year. Will Russia-Ukraine tensions push up UK gas bills? Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the oil price surge ""was terrible news for businesses and consumers"" because ""it will serve to further stoke inflation"". ""Not only will energy bills keep going up, but food prices look set to jump even higher. Ukraine and Russia are both big food suppliers and any disruption to supplies will force buyers to seek alternative sources, which could jack up prices."" The UK's cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 30 years, as energy, fuel and food prices continued to soar,squeezing household budgets. Meanwhile, Mr Mould said the fall in the FTSE 100 ""was bad news for the millions of savers and investors who have money in UK equities"". Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Small wonder then that prices are shooting up. Brent crude oil has gone above $100 a barrel, while prices for gas on wholesale markets - where domestic suppliers buy what they need - are up sharply as well. Supplies from Russia do not appear to have been affected - yet. But the fear that they will be, and that there could be a scramble for other resources, is pushing up costs. Stock markets across Europe are tumbling, as investors fret about the potential economic impact of high energy prices and the potential for much wider sanctions as well. And as for Russian shares, a graph showing the performance of the MOEX stock exchange in Moscow looks like a cliff in the Ural mountains today. In response to Russia's military action, the UK, US and European Union are set to put more sanctions on Russia. There are fears that sanctions, along with the impact of the invasion, could disrupt the supply of agricultural products and raw materials from Ukraine and Russia. The two countries combined are major wheat suppliers, producing 29% of global exports, most of which travels through ports in the Black Sea. Russia also produces aluminium, cobalt, copper, diamonds, fertiliser, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, titanium and steel. TheEuropean Council said,externalit would ""impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its actions"". Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said the sanctions ""will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia"". Russian assets in the EU will be frozen and Russian banks' access to European financial markets will be stopped, she said. ""These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war,"" she added. The biggest economic hit would come from disconnecting Russia's banking system from the international Swift payment system, but that could also affect the US and European economies. The US and EU have already imposeda series of sanctionsin response to Mr Putin's actions against Ukraine. The UK has frozen the assets of five banks and three Russian billionaires, who have also been hit with travel bans. Meanwhile Germany has frozen final approval for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which connects the country with Russia and was set to boost Russian gas exports to the EU.

"Students to pay off loans into their 60s, plans say","Students who start university next year could be paying off their loans for 40 years after graduating, under new government plans for England. Under the current system, loans are written off after 30 years. The government says extending the repayment period, as part of a student finance shake-up, will reduce the bill for taxpayers. But Labour says it will ""hit those on low incomes hardest"", with lower-earning graduates affected more. The plans - part of a response to the 2019Augar review of post-18 education- apply to students in England starting courses from September 2023. The government has also said: The maximum a university can charge for a course per year will be frozen at Â£9,250 for a further two years The income level at which graduates start repaying their student loan will be reduced from Â£27,295 to Â£25,000 and this will remain set until 2026-27 The interest rate will be cut to match the Retail Price Index (RPI) - one of the ways inflation is measured in the UK The government is proposing these changes because more students than ever are going to university, and only 25% of those who started full-time undergraduate degrees in 2020 are expected to pay back their loans in full. The average debt among those who finished studying in 2020 was Â£45,000,government figures suggest.,external And at the end of March 2021, Â£161bn was yet to be paid back in student loans - a figure forecast to rise to Â£500bn by 2043. Student loans may depend on English and maths GCSEs Your simple guide to student loan repayments Tuition fees 'should be cut to Â£7,500' By requiring graduates to start paying back at Â£25,000, and to continue paying for an extra 10 years, the government hopes more will repay their loans in full. The proposal to slash interest rates follows a 2019 Conservative manifesto pledge to reduce ""the burden of debt on students"". Haya, Sonal and Maryam will leave school later this year. In Hounslow, west London, a group of Year 13 students are weighing up who's got the best deal - pupils like Sonal and Maryam, who are hoping to go to university this year, or those who, like Haya, are taking gap years and starting university in September 2023. ""It's quite unfair because she's going to uni one year later and this policy has come in quickly and out of the blue,"" says Sonal. ""The debt's going to be a long time,"" adds Haya. But for Maryam, there are ""no winners from the situation"". ""If [people in Haya's year] have to pay for an extra 10 years, but we have to pay every year with extra interest, it raises the question: 'who actually pays the most?'"" she asks. Maryam thinks some good can come of the government's focus on ending growth of what it has called poor quality degrees. However, all three are worried aboutthe idea of minimum grades being neededin order to receive student loans - and Sonal is particularly concerned about people who speak English as a second language. ""If they come into the country and they take their GCSEs when their English is still not that good... they're at a disadvantage,"" she says. Under the current system, students' interest is RPI plus up to 3% while they are at university, and varies depending on income from the April after they graduate. The government says its plans would mean a student enrolling on a three-year course at the end of next year could see their debt reduced by up to Â£11,500 - if and when they earn Â£25,000. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said Â£900m of investment was being reinforced by reforms to make student finance ""fairer"". At an event on Thursday, hosted by the Centre for Policy Studies, he said: ""The cost of higher education is rising, so we want to ensure that the student loans system is on a sustainable footing, so that it provides that value for money for the student but also for the taxpayer."" Start paying earlier, pay longer, pay more: that's what these plans will mean for many. Hardest hit will be middle earners paying longer - while the most highly-paid graduates are the biggest winners. These high earners already pay off their loans in full, but currently pay interest of up to 3% plus the RPI after university. That will fall to just RPI, for all students and graduates. The highest lifetime earnerswill pay back 26% less,externalunder the new system. So while this will reduce the bill to taxpayers from unpaid loans, it carries political risk for a governmentpromising to level up. In turn, that creates a potential space for Labour to reframe its policies around tuition fees and maintenance grants, to appeal to future students. Asked at the same event about the impact on middle earners, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan told the BBC: ""It will mean that any student graduating in the future won't pay any more in real terms than we've borrowed. Because that's fair."" Ms Donelan urged studentsto contribute to a consultationannounced on Wednesday on plans, for England, to: require students to achieve English and maths GCSEs, or two A-levels at grade E, in order to qualify for a student loan limit the number of university places available in England She said any minimum eligibility requirements would aim to stop students being pushed ""towards university before they're ready for it"", adding that the government was capping the cost of foundation years to assist students. Ms Donelan denied there would be any ""cap"" on student numbers, but said there were ""pockets of some poor quality in our universities"" and that the government was considering ""targeted student number controls for individual courses just to stop them from growing at the expense of high quality courses"". 'My student loan refund took six years' Universities to get job targets for poor students Cash incentives on student accounts squeezed Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson called the changes to student finance a ""stealth tax for new graduates starting out on their working lives, which will hit those on low incomes hardest"". ""Instead of fixing the broken system, these changes simply store up problems for the future,"" she said. Ms Phillipson added: ""Instead of focusing on supporting more students to succeed at school or widening access to university, the government is slamming the door on opportunity."" Sir Philip Augar, who chaired the 2019 review, said the plans were ""consistent with the spirit of the report"" and form ""the basis of a properly connected further and higher education sector"". ""That connection is long overdue,"" he added. But Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton pointed out the government's plans ""stop some way short"" of the recommendations in the Augar review, which included reducing tuition fees to Â£7,500 per year and reintroducing maintenance grants. ""This latter omission is particularly disappointing in terms of improving social mobility and access to university,"" Mr Barton said. He welcomed the steps to reduce interest rates - but added the plans would come ""with a sting"" because of the lengthier payment window. The government isalso consulting on plans for a Lifelong Loan Entitlement,,externalwhich would make loans worth the equivalent of four years of post-18 education (Â£37,000 in today's fees) available to students at any stage in their lives. Ms Donelan also confirmed the government would not be introducing post-qualification admissions - an ideathat had been under consultation,externaland which would have meant university offers were made after students had received their A-level or equivalent grades.

Oil tops $100 and shares sink after Russian action,"Oil prices surged past $100 (Â£74) a barrel to hit their highest level for more than seven years after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine. Global shares fell on worries of the possible impact of the conflict, but US tech stocks rebounded in late trading. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Brent crude eased from $105 to $98 a barrel,but not before UK petrol prices had hit another record high. The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The price of UK natural gas futures soared nearly 60% on Thursday. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Russia launches military operation in Ukraine What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average petrol prices hit a record high of nearly 149.5p on Wednesday, with diesel at 152.83p. The RAC said that if the oil price reached $110 a barrel the average price of petrol could hit Â£1.55 a litre. If prices do get this high it will ""cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work and running their lives as it would sky rocket the cost of a full tank to Â£85"", said the RAC's Simon Williams. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because crude oil is traded in dollars. The price of crude oil is up, and the pound is down against the dollar. News of Russia's actions led to steep falls on global stock markets. In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index fell more 3.9%, its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. Germany's Dax index lost 4%. In the US, the Dow Jones fell nearly 2% in early trading but a late rally in the tech sector meant in ended 0.3% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 3.3% and the S&P 500 closed trading up 1.5%. Shares in Netflix and Microsoft were both up more than 5%, respectively. After talking with allies from the G7, US President Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned companies. Wall Street which traded in the red at the start of the day on news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hit session highs in the wake of Biden's comments. The Moscow Stock Exchange saw trading suspended briefly, but when it reopened the index fell by more than a third. On the currency markets, the rouble sank to a record low against the US dollar. The price of gold - which is considered a haven asset in times of uncertainty - jumped 3% to its highest price in more than a year. Will Russia-Ukraine tensions push up UK gas bills? Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the oil price surge ""was terrible news for businesses and consumers"" because ""it will serve to further stoke inflation"". ""Not only will energy bills keep going up, but food prices look set to jump even higher. Ukraine and Russia are both big food suppliers and any disruption to supplies will force buyers to seek alternative sources, which could jack up prices."" The UK's cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 30 years, as energy, fuel and food prices continued to soar,squeezing household budgets. Meanwhile, Mr Mould said the fall in the FTSE 100 ""was bad news for the millions of savers and investors who have money in UK equities"". Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Small wonder then that prices are shooting up. Brent crude oil has gone above $100 a barrel, while prices for gas on wholesale markets - where domestic suppliers buy what they need - are up sharply as well. Supplies from Russia do not appear to have been affected - yet. But the fear that they will be, and that there could be a scramble for other resources, is pushing up costs. Stock markets across Europe are tumbling, as investors fret about the potential economic impact of high energy prices and the potential for much wider sanctions as well. And as for Russian shares, a graph showing the performance of the MOEX stock exchange in Moscow looks like a cliff in the Ural mountains today. In response to Russia's military action, the UK, US and European Union are set to put more sanctions on Russia. There are fears that sanctions, along with the impact of the invasion, could disrupt the supply of agricultural products and raw materials from Ukraine and Russia. The two countries combined are major wheat suppliers, producing 29% of global exports, most of which travels through ports in the Black Sea. Russia also produces aluminium, cobalt, copper, diamonds, fertiliser, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, titanium and steel. TheEuropean Council said,externalit would ""impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its actions"". Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said the sanctions ""will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia"". Russian assets in the EU will be frozen and Russian banks' access to European financial markets will be stopped, she said. ""These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war,"" she added. The biggest economic hit would come from disconnecting Russia's banking system from the international Swift payment system, but that could also affect the US and European economies. The US and EU have already imposeda series of sanctionsin response to Mr Putin's actions against Ukraine. The UK has frozen the assets of five banks and three Russian billionaires, who have also been hit with travel bans. Meanwhile Germany has frozen final approval for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which connects the country with Russia and was set to boost Russian gas exports to the EU.

"Facebook accused of blacklisting OnlyFansâ rivalsââIt is claimed Facebook colluded with OnlyFans to disable social accounts of adult entertainers working for rivals, BBC learns.","Facebook has been accused of colluding with OnlyFans to blacklist rival adult websites in a lawsuit filed in the US. This week,BBC News revealed that OnlyFans was being suedover claims it directed a social media company to disable accounts of adult entertainers by placing their content on a terrorism database. Facebook has now been named as the company alleged to have conspired with OnlyFans in a class action filing. Its parent company, Meta, says the claims are ""without merit"". UK website OnlyFans - best known for hosting pornography - has grown hugely in recent years. It lets users share video clips and photos with subscribers in return for a monthly fee. Performers often use social media accounts to promote and link to adult websites showing their explicit content. On Tuesday, BBC News revealed that rival adult website FanCentro is suing OnlyFans in the US. The legal action claims that social media content of adult performers promoting rival websites to OnlyFans was placed on a database of extremist material shared between tech companies that is run by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). The database - used by Facebook, YouTube and Twitter - flags terror content to other members so they can moderate similar content on their platform. OnlyFans has not yet issued a legal response but a spokesperson said the company was aware of the claims and they had ""no merit"". Now, a class action lawsuit has been launched which names Facebook as the company accused of colluding with OnlyFans.ââ Do you have more information about this story? You can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720 or by email atnoel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk,external The lawsuit, made on behalf of three adult entertainers, lists both Facebook and OnlyFans' parent company as defendants. It was made by the same US legal firm, Milberg, which is suing OnlyFans directly. The filing claims that performers' content was placed on the GIFCT's database despite not being terrorist in nature, and this led to reduced visibility on social media and a marked decline in traffic being driven to OnlyFans' rival websites. Performers who only promoted their OnlyFans accounts on social media did not face this punitive content moderation - it is alleged - leading to a big growth in traffic visiting the website. In recent years, performers using Instagram to promote and link to their adult websites have complained that even though they have not broken the site's community guidelines - they have been served with violation notifications and had posts removed. The subsequent loss of visibility and promotion of these accounts became known as a ""shadowban"". BBC investigations into OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans Under the skin of OnlyFans BBC News has spoken to a performer and adult website owner who say their incomes fell significantly after posts on Instagram - also owned by Meta - began being taken down in late 2018. Both say they do not know how or why this happened. The performer says some of her posts - which typically feature her in a bikini or underwear - included tourist snaps when she was fully clothed. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: ""These allegations are without merit and we will address them in the context of the litigation as needed."" It said it had investigated and found no evidence the terrorism database had been abused, and added it could not comment on the performer and business owner claims without their usernames or website names. Content hashed on the database run by the GIFCT is not independently audited. In a statement, a GIFCT spokesperson said: ""We are not aware of any evidence to support the theories presented in this lawsuit between two parties with no connection to GIFCT.""

Kyiv residents awake to war,"Many residents are seeking shelter in underground metro stations Residents of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, woke to the sound of explosions and sirens, with many now either trying to seek shelter or flee the country. Some are hunkering down in the city's metro stations and air raid shelters. But others are trying to escape. Traffic is jammed on motorways going west out of the capital towards the Polish border. So on the streets of Kyiv this morning there are two starkly different tempos. One of them is strangely subdued. Many people are still going to work as normal - trudging the streets and getting on buses. The other mood is urgent. Many people have been rushing to air raid shelters or metro stations to take cover. Others are forming long queues at banks, supermarkets, petrol stations. Some are fleeing west by car. One man stops me in the street and says: ""This is war."" Mark, a 27-year-old sales executive had - like us - been woken at around 7am by the sound of blasts and sirens. He found a young girl in tears downstairs, and took her to the nearest metro station to shelter. One of Ukraine's 900,000 army reservists, Mark says he is ready to be called up to fight with Russia. ""We don't have another way,"" he tells me. ""We must defend our country. And maybe die in this war."" Mark says he is prepared to be killed fighting for ""every millimetre"" of Ukraine. ""It's only one way - if our military comes to me and says I must die for my country, I will do it."" Elsewhere we meet Svetlana, a school worker who is on her way to an air raid shelter. After she was woken at dawn ""when something went boom"", Svetlana took a call from her friends in Russian-annexed Crimea, where Russian tanks have reportedly been crossing into Ukraine. ""It's a war,"" they told her. LIVE:Follow latest developments THE BASICS:Why is Russia invading Ukraine? EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Svetlana quickly packed a bag to take with her to the shelter. It contains a wash kit and a laptop, so she can continue working on her masters degree in psychology. ""We don't understand what we do now - we're going to a place where we can be in safety,"" Svetlana says. But she is worried about her family who live in Mariupol, the south-eastern port city where Russian troops have reportedly landed. ""I can't say all what I feel - but it's very, very nervous. I'm very scared."" Many families are taking shelter in the city's metro stations For many, the safest places to be are metro stations deep under Kyiv. I meet a couple with a two-year-old who are following news on their phones and trying to work out what to do. They were scared and didn't speak much English. But I understood when they asked me: ""Where are Nato?"" While some are hunkering down in the city's metro and air raid shelters, others in Kyiv are trying to escape. Traffic is jammed on motorways going west out of the capital towards the Polish border. 31-year-old Alex Svitelskyi tells me he wants to get his parents out of Kyiv. He's worried about his sister, too: ""I want her to be far from here."" Alex says news of the Russian assault did not come to him as a surprise. ""We all knew that this would happen sooner or later, and I hope that our soldiers are ready because they were preparing themselves,"" he says. ""We hope that they will hold the line."" But Alex says he fears that if Russian forces do reach Kyiv they will carry out atrocities on its residents, reminiscent of those perpetrated by the Nazis in Ukraine during World War Two. He says he wants to get his parents away from the capital before it's too late. ""I want them to leave Kyiv to some village, because there will be shelling soon.""

BBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place anymore,"I was awake at night when I got a message from a colleague about Vladimir Putin's speech announcing an invasion. Then immediately the explosions began. I could hear them from my home, and people in different parts of the city started sending messages to our WhatsApp group, about explosions happening close to them. To realise that Kyiv itself was under attack, not the front line in the east of the country, was a big shock. There is no safe place in Ukraine any more. The biggest fear for ordinary people here is running out of electricity and the internet not working - then we would be really isolated. Another fear is that bridges over the Dnieper river will be bombed, dividing the eastern and western halves of the city. The explosions continued for about 30 minutes. I dressed my 10-year-old son. We had some breakfast, sitting as far from the windows as we could, but he was so scared he vomited. We took a candle and some water to our cellar, which will be our refuge if things get worse. There are huge queues outside the supermarkets near my home and at ATMs, many of which have run out of money. Some petrol stations too have now run out and closed. There is an air of panic, now that we know the entire country is under attack.

'Putin will pay bitter price' - World leaders react,"The Poland-Ukraine border.

"Students to pay off loans into their 60s, plans sayThe government announces a shake-up of student finance in England to reduce the bill for taxpayers.Family & EducationComments","Students who start university next year could be paying off their loans for 40 years after graduating, under new government plans for England. Under the current system, loans are written off after 30 years. The government says extending the repayment period, as part of a student finance shake-up, will reduce the bill for taxpayers. But Labour says it will ""hit those on low incomes hardest"", with lower-earning graduates affected more. The plans - part of a response to the 2019Augar review of post-18 education- apply to students in England starting courses from September 2023. The government has also said: The maximum a university can charge for a course per year will be frozen at Â£9,250 for a further two years The income level at which graduates start repaying their student loan will be reduced from Â£27,295 to Â£25,000 and this will remain set until 2026-27 The interest rate will be cut to match the Retail Price Index (RPI) - one of the ways inflation is measured in the UK The government is proposing these changes because more students than ever are going to university, and only 25% of those who started full-time undergraduate degrees in 2020 are expected to pay back their loans in full. The average debt among those who finished studying in 2020 was Â£45,000,government figures suggest.,external And at the end of March 2021, Â£161bn was yet to be paid back in student loans - a figure forecast to rise to Â£500bn by 2043. Student loans may depend on English and maths GCSEs Your simple guide to student loan repayments Tuition fees 'should be cut to Â£7,500' By requiring graduates to start paying back at Â£25,000, and to continue paying for an extra 10 years, the government hopes more will repay their loans in full. The proposal to slash interest rates follows a 2019 Conservative manifesto pledge to reduce ""the burden of debt on students"". Haya, Sonal and Maryam will leave school later this year. In Hounslow, west London, a group of Year 13 students are weighing up who's got the best deal - pupils like Sonal and Maryam, who are hoping to go to university this year, or those who, like Haya, are taking gap years and starting university in September 2023. ""It's quite unfair because she's going to uni one year later and this policy has come in quickly and out of the blue,"" says Sonal. ""The debt's going to be a long time,"" adds Haya. But for Maryam, there are ""no winners from the situation"". ""If [people in Haya's year] have to pay for an extra 10 years, but we have to pay every year with extra interest, it raises the question: 'who actually pays the most?'"" she asks. Maryam thinks some good can come of the government's focus on ending growth of what it has called poor quality degrees. However, all three are worried aboutthe idea of minimum grades being neededin order to receive student loans - and Sonal is particularly concerned about people who speak English as a second language. ""If they come into the country and they take their GCSEs when their English is still not that good... they're at a disadvantage,"" she says. Under the current system, students' interest is RPI plus up to 3% while they are at university, and varies depending on income from the April after they graduate. The government says its plans would mean a student enrolling on a three-year course at the end of next year could see their debt reduced by up to Â£11,500 - if and when they earn Â£25,000. Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said Â£900m of investment was being reinforced by reforms to make student finance ""fairer"". At an event on Thursday, hosted by the Centre for Policy Studies, he said: ""The cost of higher education is rising, so we want to ensure that the student loans system is on a sustainable footing, so that it provides that value for money for the student but also for the taxpayer."" Start paying earlier, pay longer, pay more: that's what these plans will mean for many. Hardest hit will be middle earners paying longer - while the most highly-paid graduates are the biggest winners. These high earners already pay off their loans in full, but currently pay interest of up to 3% plus the RPI after university. That will fall to just RPI, for all students and graduates. The highest lifetime earnerswill pay back 26% less,externalunder the new system. So while this will reduce the bill to taxpayers from unpaid loans, it carries political risk for a governmentpromising to level up. In turn, that creates a potential space for Labour to reframe its policies around tuition fees and maintenance grants, to appeal to future students. Asked at the same event about the impact on middle earners, Universities Minister Michelle Donelan told the BBC: ""It will mean that any student graduating in the future won't pay any more in real terms than we've borrowed. Because that's fair."" Ms Donelan urged studentsto contribute to a consultationannounced on Wednesday on plans, for England, to: require students to achieve English and maths GCSEs, or two A-levels at grade E, in order to qualify for a student loan limit the number of university places available in England She said any minimum eligibility requirements would aim to stop students being pushed ""towards university before they're ready for it"", adding that the government was capping the cost of foundation years to assist students. Ms Donelan denied there would be any ""cap"" on student numbers, but said there were ""pockets of some poor quality in our universities"" and that the government was considering ""targeted student number controls for individual courses just to stop them from growing at the expense of high quality courses"". 'My student loan refund took six years' Universities to get job targets for poor students Cash incentives on student accounts squeezed Labour's shadow education secretary Bridget Phillipson called the changes to student finance a ""stealth tax for new graduates starting out on their working lives, which will hit those on low incomes hardest"". ""Instead of fixing the broken system, these changes simply store up problems for the future,"" she said. Ms Phillipson added: ""Instead of focusing on supporting more students to succeed at school or widening access to university, the government is slamming the door on opportunity."" Sir Philip Augar, who chaired the 2019 review, said the plans were ""consistent with the spirit of the report"" and form ""the basis of a properly connected further and higher education sector"". ""That connection is long overdue,"" he added. But Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton pointed out the government's plans ""stop some way short"" of the recommendations in the Augar review, which included reducing tuition fees to Â£7,500 per year and reintroducing maintenance grants. ""This latter omission is particularly disappointing in terms of improving social mobility and access to university,"" Mr Barton said. He welcomed the steps to reduce interest rates - but added the plans would come ""with a sting"" because of the lengthier payment window.

"Russia attack on Ukraine a catastrophe, says PMBoris Johnson will give a televised statement later before revealing new sanctions against Russia to MPs.UKComments","This video can not be played WATCH: Footage from Ukraine shows explosions, a missile strike and a helicopter under fire Russia's invasion of Ukraine is a ""catastrophe for our continent"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He chaired an emergency Cobra meeting earlier and will give a televised statement later on the UK's response to Russia's ""unprovoked attack"". Mr Putin has insisted he does not plan to occupy Ukraine, but Ukraine has branded it a ""full-scale invasion"". Mr Johnson will outline new sanctions against Russia in the Commons at 17:00 GMT. Hesaid on Twitter,externalhe would also speak to his fellow G7 leaders and called for an urgent meeting of all Nato leaders as soon as possible. Russian forces have launched an assault on Ukraine,crossing its borders and bombing military targets near big cities. Martial law- which means the military takes control temporarily - has been imposed across the whole of Ukraine and traffic jams built up as people fled the capital city of Kyiv. In a phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky early on Thursday morning, Mr Johnson vowed the West ""would not stand by as President Putin waged his campaign against the Ukrainian people"". Mr Johnsonhad tweeted earlier:,external""President Putin has chosen a path of bloodshed and destruction by launching this unprovoked attack on Ukraine."" Foreign Secretary Liz Trusssaid,externalshe had summoned the Russian ambassador to explain Russia's ""illegal, unprovoked invasion of Ukraine"" and that the UK would be ""imposing severe sanctions"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer warned Putin's attack on Ukraine would ""have horrendous and tragic consequences that will echo throughout the world and throughout history"", and called for the ""hardest possible sanctions"" against the Russian leader and his associates. He added: ""There can be no space for equivocation when faced with the evil that Putin has unleashed. His actions pose a grave threat to the international order on which we all depend."" Putin unleashes Russian forces on Ukraine PM announces UK sanctions against Russia Oil soars past $100 after Russia military action Russian military vehicles are reported to have breached Ukraine's border in a number of places, in the north, south and east, including from Belarus. At least seven people are known to have been killed by Russian shelling, including civilians. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said that more than 40 soldiers had died and dozens more were wounded, but this has not been independently confirmed. It comes after President Putin announced a ""special military operation"" in Ukraine's Donbas region in a televised address to the Russian people earlier and said the Ukrainian people would be able ""to choose freely"" who ran the country. Mr Putin also urged Ukrainian soldiers in the combat zone in the east of the country to lay down their weapons and return to their homes, warning that Moscow's response would be ""instant"" if anyone tried to take on Russia. This video can not be played Watch: Putin declares special military operation in TV declaration On Wednesday, theUK announced a package of sanctions against Russiaas part of a co-ordinated Western response to the crisis. Mr Johnson announced that five Russian banks had had their assets frozen and three Russian billionaires would have travel bans imposed. It followed the Kremlin ordering troops into the rebel-held Ukrainian regions of Donetsk and Luhansk on recognising them as independent. Foreign Office minister James Cleverly warned Mr Putin's comments in recent days suggested he wanted to create ""a wider Russian empire in all but name"". ""We do fear that this is the start of quite an extensive military operation. This is not just limited to the east. There have been military strikes across a number of parts of Ukraine,"" he told the BBC on Thursday morning. He said new UK sanctions against Russia would be announced ""in waves"" and warned it would be ""the largest and most severe economic sanctions"" package Russia had ever seen. Asked about the prospect of UK boots on the ground in Ukraine, Mr Cleverly said that while Ukraine was a ""good friend"" of the UK, it was not a member of the Nato military alliance - which obliges members to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against a member state. The UK is providing additional military support to eastern Nato member states and will support Ukrainians in their defence of their homeland, he added. UK nationals were advised two weeks ago to leave Ukraine while commercial flights were still available. Those remaining have again been urged to leave Ukraine immediately - if they judge it is safe to do so. Ukraine has closed its airspace to civilian flights.The only airlines still flying from the UK, Wizz Air and Ryanair, have suspended all flights to the country. Tobias Ellwood, chairman of the defence select committee, said the West had failed to alter the trajectory of the Russian invasion. He said the UK's ""baffling"" decision to hold back sanctions until after Russia's incursion into Ukraine had not deterred Mr Putin. He said Ukraine needed tangible support including weapons and communication systems, counter cyber capabilities and that a Nato no-fly zone would be a ""gamechanger"" in deterring Russia. Families sought shelter in Kyiv's deep underground network A stream of cars left Kyiv after Russia announced it was launching its military operation Tom Tugendhat, chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, described the scenes of people abandoning their homes in Ukraine as ""a human tragedy"". He told BBC Breakfast: ""To see these columns of people forced out by naked aggression by Russia and by Vladimir Putin is horrific and extremely painful, and we should be thinking very clearly about the families torn apart, the lives separated."" The latest move by Russia has drawn international condemnation, with US President Joe Biden denouncing Russia's military action as an ""unprovoked and unjustified attack"", declaring ""the world will hold Russia accountable"". Writing on Twitter, he added the US and its allies and partners would impose ""severe sanctions on Russia"" and continue to provide support to Ukraine and its people. Ukraine airspace closed to civilian flights The Brits trying to get family out of Ukraine The Ukraine crisis is a major challenge for China European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen accused Mr Putin of ""bringing war back to Europe"" and warned a raft of ""massive"" sanctions would be proposed later aimed at Russia's economic base and its ""capacity to modernise"". Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg criticised Russia's ""reckless"" attack on Ukraine and said despite weeks of tireless international diplomacy, Russia had chosen ""the path of aggression"". Mr Stoltenberg has called an emergency meeting of the North Atlantic Council this morning. A news conference is expected to be held in Brussels at 12:00 local time. This video can not be played Watch: On the front line of the Ukraine-Russia crisis Defence Secretary Ben Wallace branded Russia's actions ""naked aggression against a democratic country"" and said no one had been fooled by the Kremlin's ""false flags and fake narratives"". Fears of a Russian invasion into Ukraine have been rising for months. Mr Putin has accused the West of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining the western Nato military alliance and offer Moscow security guarantees.

'I'm very scared' - Kyiv residents awake to war,"Many residents are seeking shelter in underground metro stations Residents of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, woke to the sound of explosions and sirens, with many now either trying to seek shelter or flee the country. Some are hunkering down in the city's metro stations and air raid shelters. But others are trying to escape. Traffic is jammed on motorways going west out of the capital towards the Polish border. So on the streets of Kyiv this morning there are two starkly different tempos. One of them is strangely subdued. Many people are still going to work as normal - trudging the streets and getting on buses. The other mood is urgent. Many people have been rushing to air raid shelters or metro stations to take cover. Others are forming long queues at banks, supermarkets, petrol stations. Some are fleeing west by car. One man stops me in the street and says: ""This is war."" Mark, a 27-year-old sales executive had - like us - been woken at around 7am by the sound of blasts and sirens. He found a young girl in tears downstairs, and took her to the nearest metro station to shelter. One of Ukraine's 900,000 army reservists, Mark says he is ready to be called up to fight with Russia. ""We don't have another way,"" he tells me. ""We must defend our country. And maybe die in this war."" Mark says he is prepared to be killed fighting for ""every millimetre"" of Ukraine. ""It's only one way - if our military comes to me and says I must die for my country, I will do it."" Elsewhere we meet Svetlana, a school worker who is on her way to an air raid shelter. After she was woken at dawn ""when something went boom"", Svetlana took a call from her friends in Russian-annexed Crimea, where Russian tanks have reportedly been crossing into Ukraine. ""It's a war,"" they told her. LIVE:Follow latest developments THE BASICS:Why is Russia invading Ukraine? EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Svetlana quickly packed a bag to take with her to the shelter. It contains a wash kit and a laptop, so she can continue working on her masters degree in psychology. ""We don't understand what we do now - we're going to a place where we can be in safety,"" Svetlana says. But she is worried about her family who live in Mariupol, the south-eastern port city where Russian troops have reportedly landed. ""I can't say all what I feel - but it's very, very nervous. I'm very scared."" Many families are taking shelter in the city's metro stations For many, the safest places to be are metro stations deep under Kyiv. I meet a couple with a two-year-old who are following news on their phones and trying to work out what to do. They were scared and didn't speak much English. But I understood when they asked me: ""Where are Nato?"" While some are hunkering down in the city's metro and air raid shelters, others in Kyiv are trying to escape. Traffic is jammed on motorways going west out of the capital towards the Polish border. 31-year-old Alex Svitelskyi tells me he wants to get his parents out of Kyiv. He's worried about his sister, too: ""I want her to be far from here."" Alex says news of the Russian assault did not come to him as a surprise. ""We all knew that this would happen sooner or later, and I hope that our soldiers are ready because they were preparing themselves,"" he says. ""We hope that they will hold the line."" But Alex says he fears that if Russian forces do reach Kyiv they will carry out atrocities on its residents, reminiscent of those perpetrated by the Nazis in Ukraine during World War Two. He says he wants to get his parents away from the capital before it's too late. ""I want them to leave Kyiv to some village, because there will be shelling soon.""

"Oil soars past $100 after Russia military actionPetrol prices will rise, says RAC, after crude prices hit their highest level for more than seven years.","Oil prices surged past $100 (Â£74) a barrel to hit their highest level for more than seven years after Russia launched an invasion of Ukraine. Global shares fell on worries of the possible impact of the conflict, but US tech stocks rebounded in late trading. Russia is the second biggest exporter of crude oil, and is also the world's largest natural gas exporter. Brent crude eased from $105 to $98 a barrel,but not before UK petrol prices had hit another record high. The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there are concerns sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The price of UK natural gas futures soared nearly 60% on Thursday. UK consumers are already paying a high price for energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions. Russia launches military operation in Ukraine What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average petrol prices hit a record high of nearly 149.5p on Wednesday, with diesel at 152.83p. The RAC said that if the oil price reached $110 a barrel the average price of petrol could hit Â£1.55 a litre. If prices do get this high it will ""cause untold financial difficulties for many people who depend on their cars for getting to work and running their lives as it would sky rocket the cost of a full tank to Â£85"", said the RAC's Simon Williams. Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because crude oil is traded in dollars. The price of crude oil is up, and the pound is down against the dollar. News of Russia's actions led to steep falls on global stock markets. In Europe, the UK's FTSE 100 index fell more 3.9%, its biggest one-day fall since June 2020. Germany's Dax index lost 4%. In the US, the Dow Jones fell nearly 2% in early trading but a late rally in the tech sector meant in ended 0.3% higher. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index climbed 3.3% and the S&P 500 closed trading up 1.5%. Shares in Netflix and Microsoft were both up more than 5%, respectively. After talking with allies from the G7, US President Biden announced measures to impede Russia's ability to do business in the world's major currencies, along with sanctions against banks and state-owned companies. Wall Street which traded in the red at the start of the day on news of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, hit session highs in the wake of Biden's comments. The Moscow Stock Exchange saw trading suspended briefly, but when it reopened the index fell by more than a third. On the currency markets, the rouble sank to a record low against the US dollar. The price of gold - which is considered a haven asset in times of uncertainty - jumped 3% to its highest price in more than a year. Will Russia-Ukraine tensions push up UK gas bills? Europe gas prices: How far is Russia responsible? Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the oil price surge ""was terrible news for businesses and consumers"" because ""it will serve to further stoke inflation"". ""Not only will energy bills keep going up, but food prices look set to jump even higher. Ukraine and Russia are both big food suppliers and any disruption to supplies will force buyers to seek alternative sources, which could jack up prices."" The UK's cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 30 years, as energy, fuel and food prices continued to soar,squeezing household budgets. Meanwhile, Mr Mould said the fall in the FTSE 100 ""was bad news for the millions of savers and investors who have money in UK equities"". Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Small wonder then that prices are shooting up. Brent crude oil has gone above $100 a barrel, while prices for gas on wholesale markets - where domestic suppliers buy what they need - are up sharply as well. Supplies from Russia do not appear to have been affected - yet. But the fear that they will be, and that there could be a scramble for other resources, is pushing up costs. Stock markets across Europe are tumbling, as investors fret about the potential economic impact of high energy prices and the potential for much wider sanctions as well. And as for Russian shares, a graph showing the performance of the MOEX stock exchange in Moscow looks like a cliff in the Ural mountains today. In response to Russia's military action, the UK, US and European Union are set to put more sanctions on Russia. There are fears that sanctions, along with the impact of the invasion, could disrupt the supply of agricultural products and raw materials from Ukraine and Russia. The two countries combined are major wheat suppliers, producing 29% of global exports, most of which travels through ports in the Black Sea. Russia also produces aluminium, cobalt, copper, diamonds, fertiliser, gold, nickel, palladium, platinum, titanium and steel. TheEuropean Council said,externalit would ""impose massive and severe consequences on Russia for its actions"". Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, said the sanctions ""will target strategic sectors of the Russian economy by blocking their access to technologies and markets that are key for Russia"". Russian assets in the EU will be frozen and Russian banks' access to European financial markets will be stopped, she said. ""These sanctions are designed to take a heavy toll on the Kremlin's interests and their ability to finance war,"" she added. The biggest economic hit would come from disconnecting Russia's banking system from the international Swift payment system, but that could also affect the US and European economies. The US and EU have already imposeda series of sanctionsin response to Mr Putin's actions against Ukraine. The UK has frozen the assets of five banks and three Russian billionaires, who have also been hit with travel bans. Meanwhile Germany has frozen final approval for the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which connects the country with Russia and was set to boost Russian gas exports to the EU.

"Don't drop foie gras and fur ban, Tory MPs urge","Making foie gras involves force-feeding ducks to fatten their liver A group of Conservatives have urged the UK government not to abandon its plans to ban imports of foie gras and fur. The BBC revealed on Saturday that the measure is likely to be dropped from a new law, amid opposition from some cabinet ministers. But ina letter to the Times,external, a group including six Tory MPs said the products were cruel and a ban should go ahead. The government said no final decisions have been made. But sources have previously said the measures are likely to be shelved for now, provoking anger among animal welfare campaigners. Ministers set to abort UK ban on foie gras and fur Attempt to ban foie gras fails in Parliament UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare British farmers are already banned from producing foie gras, a liver-based luxury French food opposed by campaigners because it is made by force-feeding ducks or geese. Fur farming has also been illegal in the UK since 2000, but campaigners have long been pushing for an import ban on fur farmed abroad. A UK import ban was meant to be included in the Animals Abroad Bill, one of three laws the government says will boost animal welfare. But cabinet ministers opposing a ban include Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, who believes ministers should not restrict consumer choice. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also raised concerns about banning the bear fur used by some British soldiers in ceremonial uniforms. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also said a ban might not be allowed in Northern Ireland, which continues to follow product rules from the EU - where foie gras is traded freely - under the UK's Brexit deal. The Grenadier Guards wear hats made from the fur of Canadian black bears In their Times letter, the Conservatives argue fur and foie gras production involved ""inhumane practices"" that are ""rightly banned in the UK"". They wrote that products derived from ""such cruel industries"" should also not be allowed - and said polling showed the public support an import ban. ""It is right to limit the choice of a tiny minority of consumers when failing to do so causes great harm,"" they added. ""Fur and foie gras bans would uphold a commitment to high animal welfare standards both here and overseas."" The letter was signed by Tory MPs Bob Blackman, Tracey Crouch, Louie French, Sir Roger Gale, Tim Loughton, and Chris Loder - as well as Tory peer Lord Randall of Uxbridge and former Tory MEP John Flack. It was also signed by the co-founders of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation - a pressure group that counts the prime minister's father Stanley Johnson and his wife Carrie Johnson among its prominent backers. Environment minister Zac Goldsmith, another supporter of the group,told the Guardian this week,externalthe public is ""strongly in favour of measures to curb the fur trade and foie gras"". He added: ""There are some who view the issue as a matter of personal choice, but no one would extend that principle to things like dog-fighting or bear-baiting, so it's not clear why fur farming or force-feeding geese, which arguably are associated with far greater levels of cruelty, should be any different.""

For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Facebook accused of blacklisting OnlyFansâ rivalsââIt is claimed Facebook colluded with OnlyFans to disable social accounts of adult entertainers working for rivals, BBC News has learned.UK","Facebook has been accused of colluding with OnlyFans to blacklist rival adult websites in a lawsuit filed in the US. This week,BBC News revealed that OnlyFans was being suedover claims it directed a social media company to disable accounts of adult entertainers by placing their content on a terrorism database. Facebook has now been named as the company alleged to have conspired with OnlyFans in a class action filing. Its parent company, Meta, says the claims are ""without merit"". UK website OnlyFans - best known for hosting pornography - has grown hugely in recent years. It lets users share video clips and photos with subscribers in return for a monthly fee. Performers often use social media accounts to promote and link to adult websites showing their explicit content. On Tuesday, BBC News revealed that rival adult website FanCentro is suing OnlyFans in the US. The legal action claims that social media content of adult performers promoting rival websites to OnlyFans was placed on a database of extremist material shared between tech companies that is run by the Global Internet Forum to Counter Terrorism (GIFCT). The database - used by Facebook, YouTube and Twitter - flags terror content to other members so they can moderate similar content on their platform. OnlyFans has not yet issued a legal response but a spokesperson said the company was aware of the claims and they had ""no merit"". Now, a class action lawsuit has been launched which names Facebook as the company accused of colluding with OnlyFans.ââ Do you have more information about this story? You can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720 or by email atnoel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk,external The lawsuit, made on behalf of three adult entertainers, lists both Facebook and OnlyFans' parent company as defendants. It was made by the same US legal firm, Milberg, which is suing OnlyFans directly. The filing claims that performers' content was placed on the GIFCT's database despite not being terrorist in nature, and this led to reduced visibility on social media and a marked decline in traffic being driven to OnlyFans' rival websites. Performers who only promoted their OnlyFans accounts on social media did not face this punitive content moderation - it is alleged - leading to a big growth in traffic visiting the website. In recent years, performers using Instagram to promote and link to their adult websites have complained that even though they have not broken the site's community guidelines - they have been served with violation notifications and had posts removed. The subsequent loss of visibility and promotion of these accounts became known as a ""shadowban"". BBC investigations into OnlyFans: How it handles illegal sex videos The children selling explicit videos on OnlyFans Under the skin of OnlyFans BBC News has spoken to a performer and adult website owner who say their incomes fell significantly after posts on Instagram - also owned by Meta - began being taken down in late 2018. Both say they do not know how or why this happened. The performer says some of her posts - which typically feature her in a bikini or underwear - included tourist snaps when she was fully clothed. In a statement, a Meta spokesperson said: ""These allegations are without merit and we will address them in the context of the litigation as needed."" It said it had investigated and found no evidence the terrorism database had been abused, and added it could not comment on the performer and business owner claims without their usernames or website names. Content hashed on the database run by the GIFCT is not independently audited. In a statement, a GIFCT spokesperson said: ""We are not aware of any evidence to support the theories presented in this lawsuit between two parties with no connection to GIFCT.""

Beauty spot to bid for dark sky zone status,"This video can not be played The Clwydian Range and Dee Valley  wants global recognition as a dark sky zone A swathe of the north-east Wales uplands could soon be recognised as a hotspot for gazing at the stars. The Clwydian Range and Dee Valley Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) plans to submit a bid for global recognition as adark sky zone. It would be the fourth area of Wales to be given a status by the International Dark Sky Association. This week is the inaugural Welsh Dark Sky Week, with events across the country. Ahead of a stargazing walk up Moel Famau, the highest peak in the Clwydian hills, AONB area manager David Shiel said the sky was a ""really important part of the landscape itself"". Northern Lights illuminate Wales' dark sky potential WATCH: How lockdown has darkened our skies WATCH: Australian night sky on show in 'starlapse' video ""It's really, really important for the biodiversity within the AONB as well,"" he said. ""About 60% of our biodiversity depends upon darkness so we're just concerned that we take steps to preserve the quality of our night skies."" Jubilee Tower on the summit of Moel Famau is in the Clwydian Range Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty The AONB, which straddles the counties of Denbighshire, Flintshire and Wrexham, is aiming to become aDark Sky Community,external, one of a number of statuses handed out by the International Dark Sky Association. It is given to areas that show ""exceptional dedication to the preservation of the night sky through the implementation and enforcement of a quality outdoor lighting ordinance, dark sky education and citizen support of dark skies"". Both Snowdonia and the Brecon Beacons national parks are Dark Sky Reserves, while the Elan Valley estate in Powys has gained Dark Sky Park status. ""[There's] a lot of work going on to monitor the quality of our skies, getting lots of people out to do stargazing like this event and doing lots of work on improving external lighting across the AONB as well, to show that we're really serious about preserving our dark skies,"" Mr Shiel added. Leading the trek up Moel Famau was astronomer and science lecturer Rob Jones, from Wrexham. ""The sky belongs to all of us,"" he said. ""You might look up and think of a story, while someone else might think of the cultural or scientific aspect of it. Moel Famau is the highest hill in the Clwydian Range ""Everyone takes something different out of it, but when we come together to share these stories and this information, it's great."" Wales' four other AONBs are also aiming for eventual international recognition as dark sky zones, and several spots in areas such as the Cambrian Mountains, which cover parts of Powys, Ceredigion and Carmarthenshire, have been recognised on a UK level. With the Clwydian Range's proximity to Deeside, Wrexham and the large conurbations of north-west England, some might cast doubt on its claims of pitch-black skies. But astrophotographer Dylan Parry Evans said it was one of the ""top places"" in north Wales, and measures to tackle light pollution were necessary. ""Light pollution can stop me in my tracks, because I need the perfect dark sky to do my work,"" he said. ""The status, I suppose, guarantees the dark sky for future generations. ""Work's been going on to ensure there's less light pollution, and as this work goes on we'll ensure that in hundreds of years there's a dark sky to look up to.""

What sanctions are being imposed on Russia?VideoVideoFear and frustration as families leave eastern UkraineVideoVideoWhy China matters in the Ukraine conflict,"The US, UK and EU have announced new sanctions on Russia, two years after its invasion of Ukraine. The measures also marked a week since the death in custody of opposition leader Alexei Navalny. Sanctions are penalties imposed by one country on another, to stop them acting aggressively or breaking international law. They are among the toughest measures nations can take, short of going to war. Announcing500 new sanctions against Russia, US President Joe Biden said they would target Russia's war machine. Export restrictions will be imposed on nearly 100 firms or individuals. President Biden said the measures wouldalso target people connected with the imprisonment of Mr Navalny, who died in an Arctic penal camp. The UKhas frozen the assets of six bosses at the prisonand banned them from travelling to the UK. The UK has also imposed new bans on Russianmetal, diamond and energy exports. The EU hasannounced sanctions on 200 organisations and people,externalwhich it says are helping Russia acquire weapons, or taking Ukrainian children from their homes. The sanctions include companies and individuals involved in shipping North Korean armaments to Russia. Alexei Navalny: What we know about his death Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, the US, UK and EU, along with countries including Australia, Canada and Japan, haveimposed more than 16,500 sanctions on Russia,external. Their main target has been Russia's money. Foreign currency reserves worth $350bn (Â£276bn)- about half its total reserves - were frozen. About70% of the assets of Russian banks,externalwere also frozen, the EU says, and some wereexcluded from Swift, a high-speed messaging service for financial institutions. Western nations have also: banned exports of technology Russia might use for making weapons banned imports of gold and diamonds from Russia banned flights from Russia sanctioned oligarchs - the wealthy business people linked with the Kremlin  - and impounded their yachts Roman Abramovich, former owner of Chelsea FC, is one oligarch who has been sanctioned Russia's oil industry has been another major target. The US and UK banned Russian oil and natural gas. The EU has banned seaborne crude imports. The G7 - an organisation of the world's seven largest ""advanced"" economies - has imposeda maximum price of $60 (Â£47) a barrel,externalon Russian crude oil, to try to reduce its earnings. Hundreds of major firms, includingMcDonald's, Coca-Cola, Starbucks and Heineken,have stopped selling and making goods in Russia. However, some still do business in Russia. PepsiCo, for example, has been accused ofcontinuing to sell food products in Russia. And the BBC discovered thatUS cosmetics firm Avonwas making goods in a factory near Moscow. President Vladimir Putin has claimed European sanctions have done Russia no harm, saying:""We have growth, and they have decline."",external Russia has managed to selloil abroad for more than the G7's price cap,external, according to the Atlantic Council, a US think tank. It says a""shadow fleet"" of about 1,000 tankers is used to ship it,external. The International Energy Agency says Russia is still exporting8.3 million barrels of oil a day,external- having increased supplies to India and China. Russiais also able to import many sanctioned Western goods,externalby buying them through countries such as Georgia, Belarus and Kazakhstan, according to researchers at King's College London. China has been a vital supplier of alternative hi-tech products to those produced in the West, says Dr Maria Snegovaya from the US think tank, the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""China sells it chips and other components it needs to for keep its military production going,"" she says. ""Russia wouldn't be able to pull that off without China's help."" Russian oil getting into UK via refinery loophole What support is China giving Russia? In 2022, the first year of the war, Russia's economyshrank by 2.1%,external, according to the International Monetary Fund. However, it estimates that Russia's economy grew by 2.2% in 2023 and predicts growth of 1.1% in 2024. Nevertheless, the US Treasury claims sanctions are damaging Russia,having cut 5% from the economic growth,externalit might have had over the past two years. But Dr Snegovaya suggests: ""Sanctions have not made waging this war sufficiently costly for Russia, and that means it can continue with it for some time to come"". The US Treasury also says that the war in Ukraine and sanctions have ledmore than a million people,external- many of them young and highly educated - to leave Russia. Russia's government has also been slashing health spending to fund the war in Ukraine,according to the UK's Ministry of Defence,external. ""This mainly hits people in rural areas,"" says James Nixey of foreign affairs think tank Chatham House.

LiveLivePutin announces military operation in Ukraine,"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

Russia launches military operation in Ukraine,"This video can not be played WATCH: Footage from Ukraine shows explosions, a missile strike and a helicopter under fire Russian forces have launched a major assault on Ukraine, firing missiles on cities and military targets. The invasion by land, air and sea began after a pre-dawn TV address where Russian President Vladimir Putin demanded that Ukraine's military lay down its arms. Initial reports of casualties included Ukrainian civilians and soldiers, and Russian troops. Ukraine's leader said his country ""won't give up its freedom"". ""Russia has embarked on a path of evil, but Ukraine is defending itself,"" President Volodymyr Zelensky tweeted. Ukraine has declared martial law and severed all diplomatic relations with Russia. It says weapons will be given to anyone who wants them. In the capital Kyiv, home to almost three million people, warning sirens blared out as traffic queued to leave the city and crowds sought shelter in metro stations. ""We don't understand what we should do now,"" one woman called Svetlana told the BBC. ""We're now going to a place where we can be safe and we hope we can leave safely."" Mark, a 27-year-old sales executive, said he was ready to be called up to fight. ""We don't have another way,"" he said. Several neighbouring countries have begun preparations to take in a large number of refugees. Moldova alone said more than 4,000 people had come over the border from Ukraine. LIVE:Follow latest developments THE BASICS:What does Putin want? EXPLAINER:What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Thursday's invasion followed weeks of escalating tensions, as Russia massed troops along Ukraine's borders. The UK, EU and other Western allies have vowed to impose tough new sanctions to punish Moscow, but say they will not send in troops. ""These are among the darkest hours of Europe since the Second World War,"" EU foreign affairs chief Josep Borrell said. Dozens of people have been killed, including about 10 civilians. Six died in an air strike in Brovary near the capital Kyiv. A man was also killed in shelling outside the major north-eastern city of Kharkiv. A Ukrainian presidential adviser said that more than 40 soldiers had died and many more were wounded. Ukraine said it had killed 50 Russian troops and shot down six Russian aircraft, but this has not been verified. Mr Zelensky said Russia had positioned almost 200,000 troops and thousands of combat vehicles on Ukraine's borders ahead of Thursday's invasion. Moscow first struck Ukraine's military infrastructure and border guard units. Then Ukrainian forces said Russian military vehicles had crossed the border near Kharkiv in the north, Luhansk in the east, Russian-annexed Crimea in the south and from Belarus too. Belarus's authoritarian leader Alexander Lukashenko said his country's military were not involved but could be if needed. Russian tanks were later seen on the outskirts of Kharkiv, a city of 1.4 million people. Russian forces also reportedly landed by sea at Ukraine's major port cities of Odesa on the Black Sea and Mariupol on the internal Sea of Azov. Much of the fighting appears to be centred around the east. Residents of Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, say windows in apartment blocks were shaking from constant blasts as the Ukrainian military and Russian forces exchanged shellfire. But clashes have have also been taking place around the capital Kyiv in the north and the southern ports of Odesa and Mariupol. Ukraine's army said Kyiv's Boryspil international airport was among a number of airfields that had been bombed, along with military headquarters and warehouses in the big cities of Kyiv, Dnipro, Kharkiv and Mariupol. Footage verified by the BBC showed missiles slamming into an airport in the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk. Russia claimed to have destroyed more than 70 military targets. The Russian leader launched the ""special military operation"" by repeating a number of unfounded claims he has made this week, including alleging that Ukraine's democratically elected government had been responsible for eight years of genocide. President Putin announced the military attack on Ukraine in a pre-recorded TV address He said the goal was demilitarisation and ""denazification"" of Ukraine. Hours earlier Ukraine's president had asked how a people who lost eight million of its citizens fighting Nazis could support Nazism. ""How could I be a Nazi?"" said Mr Zelensky, who is himself Jewish. Mr Putin also warned that any outside power intervening on Ukraine's behalf would face an ""instant"" response. Neighbouring countries have reacted to the crisis. In the Baltic republic ofEstonia,which borders Russia, Prime Minister Kaja Kallas said anumber of Nato allies that shared borders with Russia had agreed to launch consultations,externalunder Nato's Article 4. Under the defensive alliance's treaty, Nato can be brought together if any member fears their independence or territory is under threat. ""Russia's widespread aggression is a threat to the entire world and to all Nato countries,"" she said. As cars queued on Ukraine's border withMoldova, the country's pro-EU president, Maia Sandu said she was declaring a state of emergency and was prepared to give help to tens of thousands of Ukrainians.LithuanianPresident Gitanas Nauseda also said he was signing a state of emergency to be approved by parliament. ""President Putin, in the name of humanity, bring your troops back to Russia,"" saidUNSecretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres. Ukraine's Western allies had repeatedly warned that Russia was poised to invade, despite repeated denials from Moscow. The US, EU, UK andJapanimposed sanctions against leading Russians, Russian banks and MPs who backed the move. In a televised address,UKPrime Minister Boris Johnson said that the ""hideous and barbaric venture by Vladimir Putin must end in failure"". Addressing Russians, he said: ""I cannot believe this is being done in your name, or that you really want the pariah status it will bring to the Putin regime."" He told Ukrainians that the UK was ""on your side"". USPresident Joe Biden said the world would hold Russia accountable. He is expected to address Americans on Thursday about consequences Russia will face. France's President Emmanuel Macron said the attack would have ""deep, lasting consequences for our lives"". There are long queues as Kyiv residents try to leave Earlier this week Russia's president announced he was recognising the independence of two self-proclaimed people's republics of Donetsk and Luhansk in eastern Ukraine. The breakaway regions were seized by Russian-backed rebels after Russia invaded Crimea in 2014. Mr Putin launched that attack after mass street protests in Ukraine that ousted pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych. Since then more than 14,000 people have died in the east in a conflict between the rebels and Ukrainian forces. A shaky ceasefire had held but there has been a surge in violations in recent days. Mr Putin said the military operation's objective was to defend the people in the breakaway areas. Kyiv and its Western allies have repeatedly rejected as absurd Mr Putin's claims that Ukraine was being run by neo-Nazis, instead pointing out that Ukraine was now a nation with growing democratic institutions, unlike an authoritarian Russia. Fears of a Russian attack have been rising for months. Mr Putin has repeatedly accused the US and its allies of ignoring Russia's demands to prevent Ukraine from joining the Nato military alliance and offer Moscow security guarantees.

"Don't drop foie gras and fur ban, Tory MPs urgeThe government is set to abandon plans for an import ban - but some Conservatives say it must go ahead.UK Politics","Making foie gras involves force-feeding ducks to fatten their liver A group of Conservatives have urged the UK government not to abandon its plans to ban imports of foie gras and fur. The BBC revealed on Saturday that the measure is likely to be dropped from a new law, amid opposition from some cabinet ministers. But ina letter to the Times,external, a group including six Tory MPs said the products were cruel and a ban should go ahead. The government said no final decisions have been made. But sources have previously said the measures are likely to be shelved for now, provoking anger among animal welfare campaigners. Ministers set to abort UK ban on foie gras and fur Attempt to ban foie gras fails in Parliament UK to be 'global leader' on animal welfare British farmers are already banned from producing foie gras, a liver-based luxury French food opposed by campaigners because it is made by force-feeding ducks or geese. Fur farming has also been illegal in the UK since 2000, but campaigners have long been pushing for an import ban on fur farmed abroad. A UK import ban was meant to be included in the Animals Abroad Bill, one of three laws the government says will boost animal welfare. But cabinet ministers opposing a ban include Brexit opportunities minister Jacob Rees-Mogg, who believes ministers should not restrict consumer choice. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has also raised concerns about banning the bear fur used by some British soldiers in ceremonial uniforms. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis also said a ban might not be allowed in Northern Ireland, which continues to follow product rules from the EU - where foie gras is traded freely - under the UK's Brexit deal. The Grenadier Guards wear hats made from the fur of Canadian black bears In their Times letter, the Conservatives argue fur and foie gras production involved ""inhumane practices"" that are ""rightly banned in the UK"". They wrote that products derived from ""such cruel industries"" should also not be allowed - and said polling showed the public support an import ban. ""It is right to limit the choice of a tiny minority of consumers when failing to do so causes great harm,"" they added. ""Fur and foie gras bans would uphold a commitment to high animal welfare standards both here and overseas."" The letter was signed by Tory MPs Bob Blackman, Tracey Crouch, Louie French, Sir Roger Gale, Tim Loughton, and Chris Loder - as well as Tory peer Lord Randall of Uxbridge and former Tory MEP John Flack. It was also signed by the co-founders of the Conservative Animal Welfare Foundation - a pressure group that counts the prime minister's father Stanley Johnson and his wife Carrie Johnson among its prominent backers. Environment minister Zac Goldsmith, another supporter of the group,told the Guardian this week,externalthe public is ""strongly in favour of measures to curb the fur trade and foie gras"". He added: ""There are some who view the issue as a matter of personal choice, but no one would extend that principle to things like dog-fighting or bear-baiting, so it's not clear why fur farming or force-feeding geese, which arguably are associated with far greater levels of cruelty, should be any different."" The government said it was committed to ""world-leading"" reforms ""at home and abroad"" as part of its action plan for animal welfare. A spokesperson added that a summary of responses to a recent call for evidence on the current fur sector would be published soon.
