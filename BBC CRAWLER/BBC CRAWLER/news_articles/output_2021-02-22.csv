PM unveils plan to end England lockdown by 21 June,"This video can not be played Watch the full statement by Boris Johnson on England's roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM. From 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs. It requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be ""cautious but irreversible"" and at every stage decisions would be led by ""data not dates"". There was ""no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world"", he said. Kuenssberg: PM steers country towards the exit Why can't we unlock more quickly? Holiday bookings surge on lockdown exit plans Mr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be ""seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all"". He described the plan as a ""one-way road to freedom"" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible ""but the intention is that it should be"". It comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rolloutsuggested it was having a ""spectacular"" impact on stopping serious illness. As part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England: From 8 March -All schools will open with outdoor after-school sports and activities allowed. Recreation in an outdoor public spaces - such as a park - will be allowed between two people, meaning they would be allowed to sit down for a coffee, drink or picnic From 29 March -Outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be allowed. It is understood this will include gatherings in private gardens. Outdoor sports facilities such as tennis or basketball courts will reopen andorganised adult and children's sport, such as grassroots football, will also return Secondary school pupilscan access tests and will be required to wear face coveringsin classrooms and shared spaces like corridors. There will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. The second stepfrom 12 Aprilwould see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen: Non-essential retail opens, hairdressers and some public buildings like libraries Outdoor settings like alcohol takeaways, beer gardens, zoos and theme parks Indoor leisure like swimming pools and gyms Self-contained holiday accommodation, such as self-catering lets and camp sites But wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed. Mr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol. He said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest. Funerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests. The third step will comefrom 17 May- if the data allows - and will see the ""rule of six"" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people: Two households can mix indoors - with the rule of six applied in hospitality settings like pubs Cinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events reopen - though social distancing remains Up to 10,000 spectatorscan attend the very largest outdoor seated venueslike football stadiums Up to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes. Mr Johnson said this step would also ""consider the potential role of Covid status certification"" - which could refer to so-called ""vaccine passports"" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely. This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty explains the length of gaps between each stage of reopening Before the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other ""long-term measures"" designed to reduce transmission, including the ""one metre plus"" rule and the wearing of face coverings. They will also consider whether to lift the ""work from home"" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed. England care home residents to get one visitor each Live music 'at the back of queue to reopen' 'We're delighted to have dates to work towards' The fourth stepfrom 21 Junewill potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs. The government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished. Music and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector,with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is ""at the back of the queue to re-open"" once restrictions are lifted. MPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers. This video can not be played Sir Patrick Vallance says home-working and mask-wearing measures may continue until next winter Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the ""right balance"" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day. Speaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was ""very important"" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid ""flying blind"". Sir Patrick also said ""baseline"" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter. The vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year. So why, many may ask, is there such caution? The answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap. Among the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London. It showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022. There is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus. The gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidScotlandwould return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased. It means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? InWales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterwants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schoolsfollowing Mr Johnson's announcement in England. The prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight. He faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions. One participant suggested he was talking ""gibberish"" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey. Another said the PM had been ""rattled"". What annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted ""before"" certain dates. He was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was ""no backtracking"" on the five-week wait between steps. The prime minister also said that ""a debate had to be had"" on domestic vaccine passport certificates. It came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according tolatest government figures,external.

Kuenssberg: PM steers country towards the exit,"Imagine if, at the first coronavirus briefing in Downing Street last year, Boris Johnson had said that he would put limits on our lives and the economy for 15 months. Imagine that he had, a week later, instead of saying that the tide could be turned in 12 weeks, said we should prepare for kids to be out of school, that most shops would be closed on and off for months, that families who don't live near each other might not be able to see each other either, that some of the most vulnerable would have to shield at home, from the disease, for all of that time. You would hardly have believed it. He would hardly have believed it either. The prime minister's trademark used to be optimism - accused often of bluffing over detail to hope for the political best. Plans to reopen England's shops and gyms in April What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? How risky is the route out of lockdown? Yet as Mr Johnson tries to steer the country towards the exit in the second year of this pandemic, that habit is not much in evidence. He has accepted, at the insistence of the chief medical officer, there will be long gaps between the steps out of lockdown. Also, despite the remarkable progress, and excited rhetoric around the vaccine, there was an important acknowledgement from Mr Johnson too, that it will never reach everyone. The ""significant minority"" who will never take the vaccine will still therefore pose a risk. And while he has repeatedly promised the steps out of lockdown will be ""irreversible"", inside government of course there is an awareness that is just not the case. Everyone fervently hopes this is the last time but an aggressive and unforeseen variant of the disease could interrupt that plan. Some massive upset with the vaccine rollout could knock things off course. Even the limited easing up will lead to an increase in cases, and if that is more dramatic than hoped, the brakes could of course go back on. Dramatic changes in the public's behaviour could also make a difference in the wrong way. And the government also retains the right to bring back aggressive local lockdowns if infections surge in particular areas. But Mr Johnson's strongest motivation for the go-slow is the determination that this national lockdown can, should, and will be the last. With a belief too that much of the public will be perhaps not content, but willing, to wait that bit longer for a drink with friends if it means children can go back to school and stay there. All schools in England are going back from 8 March with schools able to decide a phased return during that week. His calculation is that people, after all this time, will prefer certainty over haste. That's why the prime minister won't be persuaded to go faster by some of his own restless backbenches. That's why other parts of government, even those eager to pull back restrictions, worried about the costs of all this, concede to hurry would be wrong this time. And that's why Mr Johnson, right now at least, is playing the role of a leader for whom caution is number one. A mantle this long pandemic has lent him - a political persona that also, would have been almost impossible to imagine last year. P.s. A huge amount of information did emerge today about the road ahead for England, but there were also really big gaps. There was no firm advice on when the millions of people who have been working at home will be expected to go back into the office. No solid expectations of when foreign travel will come back, when the social distancing rules could be relaxed, or whether the government might really introduce some kind of vaccine certification after all (despite previous suggestions that they would not). Alongside the plans are several reviews that will shape much of what happens in the next few months. The government, as well as Holyrood, Belfast and Cardiff, still has many big decisions to take.

Four can meet for exercise in Wales,"This video can not be played Case rates and positivity rates are two of the key factors on the road out of lockdown Four people from a maximum of two households in Wales will be able to meet outdoors for exercise from Saturday. It is one in a small list of changes announced to lockdown restrictions. Stay at home travel rules are staying in place but First Minister Mark Drakeford said they could be eased in three weeks' time. As part of the plans primary school children aged eight and over may be able to return to school from 15 March. The first minister's review set out how the rules could be eased further if case rates - currently the lowest since September - continue to improve. Some non-essential shops and hairdressers could also reopen in March, but pubs, restaurants, cafes and gyms are unlikely to be allowed to resume trading soon. The road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Q&A: What Covid safety steps are schools taking? The government said tight restrictions were still needed now to ensure a safe return to school, with the youngest pupils returning next week. But the Conservatives said it was regrettable more opportunities were not given for businesses to reopen. Plaid Cymru said a ""stay local"" message was needed for as long as necessary. Four people will be able to exercise together outside Mr Drakeford told a press conference the new exercise rules did not mean it was ""permissible for people to drive somewhere to exercise"". ""It does mean exercise, not socialising,"" he said. The rules do not apply in private gardens, where households are still banned from meeting up, barring support bubbles. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford said lockdown restrictions could lift if case rates fall From 1 March licensed wedding venues will be able to reopen to hold wedding and civil partnership ceremonies, in line with current rules for register offices. What do Covid case rates look like in school hubs? Schools in Covid hotspot areas to delay opening More elite athletes will be able to return to training, although it is not clear from when, while more visits to care homes are also being considered. Talks are taking place about reopening tourismin time for Easter, with bed and breakfasts and hotels with room service likely to be the priority. This video can not be played What do pupils feel about going back to school? Friday's announcement is the latest three-week review of of the coronavirus lockdown imposed in Walesbefore Christmas. Children aged between three and seven - those in the foundation phase - arereturning to school from Monday. The next review will look at all primary pupils, and some older students preparing for exams, returning to schools and colleges from 15 March. That includes years 11 and 13, and students doing similar qualifications in college, returning in a ""safe and flexible way"", Education Minister Kirsty Williams said. She added there could be some ""flexibility"" for years 12 and year 10, who have been entered for qualifications. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The next review of Wales lockdown rules is due around 12 March. Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales: ""If in three weeks' time the numbers are still falling, the positivity rate is falling, the R number's below one, hospital pressures continue to reduce, then I hope we'll be able to move beyond 'stay at home'."" He said it was ""too uncertain"" to say how far restrictions on movement might be eased, but he suggested a ""stay local"" arrangement, similar to local lockdowns which were imposed in the autumn, was a possibility. Sarah Bruton said she had learned ""not to hope too much"" The managing director of a spa in Caerphilly said she was ""really happy"" to hear close contact services may reopen in three weeks. But Sarah Bruton said: ""We've been down the road before with Mark Drakeford - we've learnt the hard way not to hope too much. ""I don't think off the back of those statements we can start contacting our clients or preparing our business yet."" But a caravan park owner said he was ""buzzing"" at the prospect of an Easter reopening. Ed Williams, of Llansantffraid in Powys, said: ""It's the best news we've had all winter."" More reaction Discussions are taking place over allowing non-essential retailers, such as shops and hairdressers, to reopen by the middle of March. Mr Drakeford warned there would not be a ""wholesale"" reopening of shops. Cardiff University virologist Richard Stanton said he was concerned about the prospect of parts of the retail sector opening in three weeks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are seeing the schools reopening fairly soon, we know that is likely to push transmission rates up slightly. ""I think if you add the opening of non-essential retail onto that as well we might see quite significant increases in the rates of virus transmission."" Elsewhere in the UK, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said England will exit lockdown""cautiously""- a road map for easing restrictions is expected on Monday. In Northern Ireland lockdown has beenextended to 1 April, while in Scotlandmost lockdown measuresare due to remain in place until the end of February. Speaking at the press conference, Mr Drakeford played down any imminent reopening for pubs, restaurants and cafes. He said they were not likely to see a reopening in the next two review periods over the next six weeks. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? What do the figures tell us? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? He added the hospitality industry did not want a ""stop-start"" reopening: ""They don't want to be able to re-open and then find that, because the virus gets a grip again everything has got to close."" There are no plans to reopen gyms in Wales. Mr Drakeford said advice from scientists was the Kent variant of coronavirus made doing so ""more challenging"". Both gyms and hospitality are listed as being of greater risk to reopen than non-essential retail in a plan for coming out of lockdown,published on Friday,external. The  control plan suggested it was not clear what impact easing restrictions will have with rising concern over variants of the virus. ""The early signs are very promising that the vaccines will reduce transmission, but we need more evidence for this to be clear,"" the plan said. Earlier Mr Drakeford said there were examples of a Nigerian variant in Wales, and expressed concerns over versions of the Kent variant found in Bristol and Liverpool. The Welsh Government said one in three adults in Wales has been vaccinated - latest figures show 839,065 people had been given their first dose in Wales. The case rate in Wales was one of the highest in the world for a period in December, but it has been falling since the week before Christmas. It now stands at 84 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. Wales went into lockdown on 20 December,after a rise in casesblamed partly on a new, more infectious variant of the virus. The rules mean non-essential travel is banned and people are expected to stay home except for work, exercise and other essential reasons. Pubs and restaurants are closed and non-essential shops are shut. Speaking to LBC, Mr Drakeford said chief medical officer Frank Atherton had told him he believes a third wave is being ""baked into what will happen during this year"". He said he was ""not going to say to anybody"" that another lockdown would not be needed. Restrictions on shops are expected to last for at least another three weeks Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies welcomed the moves to re-open schools but was concerned that not enough was being done for businesses. ""We know the damage and scarring what's going on the interruption to children and students' educational pathway"". ""What I think is regrettable is that the First Minister didn't open up a few more windows of opportunity for businesses to hang their hats on, so they can know when they could be planning to restock shelves and get staff back into work"". ""I think that's an opportunity that's been missed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the ""direction of travel is an incredibly positive one"" but he was still concerned about Covid variants. ""We do have some indication that they have a higher level of transmissibility, and that's what I think is really what is driving the caution, the tone of caution, that we heard today,"" he said. ""The government's own advisors, as well as the TAC report today, has said relaxing restrictions too early or too quickly will lead to a large number of new cases of hospitalisations and deaths"". ""So we have to be careful, because we don't yet know the effect of the new variants that are that are currently dominant in Wales"". THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? SCHOOLS:When will they reopen?. Prior to the announcement Abolish the Assembly Party leader Richard Suchorzewski called for Mr Drakeford to make changes on the sale of non-essential items in supermarkets and other essential retailers. ""At the very least, he should allow the people of Wales to have the same rights to purchase what he regards as 'non-essential items' e.g. jumpers, shoes and underwear, as they are allowed to in English supermarkets,"" he said. While Welsh shops are expected to close aisles selling goods deemed non-essential ""if reasonably practicable"", English stores can keep them open. How has coronavirus affected you?

Holiday bookings surge on lockdown exit plans,"Holiday firms and airlines have reported a surge in bookings since the plan for easing lockdown was unveiled. Despite questions over the return of international travel, the UK's biggest holiday firm, Tui, said bookings for foreign trips jumped 500% overnight. The owner of UK-based holiday firms Hoseasons and Cottages.com said it sold a record 10,000 breaks. The government said a decision on easing international travel would not happen until mid-May at the earliest. But Tui said its bookings for July-onwards had soared with Greece, Spain and Turkey the most popular destinations. Amid uncertainty over when foreign travel will be allowed, some holidaymakers have their sights set on a UK break. Simon Altham, group chief commercial officer at Awaze, the company behind Hoseasons, said: ""Last year following similar announcements we saw bookings peak at one every 11 seconds, but this time demand has exceeded our expectations and comfortably broken that record."" Nat Sommers has booked a break in Yorkshire Nat Sommers told the BBC she had booked a family trip to Yorkshire after Boris had announced his plans to ease lockdown. ""We'd been keeping our eye on a few places over the last few weeks in anticipation of lockdown being eased,"" she said. ""We just decided to go for it an book it in the hope that things would be back to relative normality come August."" Boris Johnson has said a global travel taskforce would put forward a report by 12 April on how to return to international travel. The government would then make a decision on removing restrictions on international travel, but not before 17 May at the earliest. What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown? When can I go on holiday in the UK or travel abroad? Airlines' Covid travel pass ready 'within weeks' As the government has said dates could move for the start of international travel, Tui has said that anyone due to travel between 17 May and the end of June can change their booking to a later date without a fee. Andrew Flintham, managing director for Tui UK and Ireland, described the government's steps as ""positive"". Thomas Cook said traffic to its website was up over 100% on Monday from 15:00 GMT onwards, with bookings ""flooding in"" for countries such as Greece, Cyprus, Mexico and the Dominican Republic. ""The government's announcement today is good news for those of us desperate to get away on holiday,"" said Thomas Cook's chief executive Alan French. ""While we await more details, it's clear that the government's ambition is to open up international travel in the coming months and hopefully in time for the summer holidays."" There was a big leap in family bookings for the summer holidays, especially for August, as well as people booking for the October half term and Christmas, a Thomas Cook spokesman said. Crete has seen a surge in bookings, according to EasyJet EasyJet reported a 337% surge in flight bookings and a 630% jump in holiday bookings for locations such as Alicante, Malaga, Palmo, Faro and Crete. The airline's chief executive, Johan Lundgren, said Boris Johnson's announcement had ""provided a much-needed boost in confidence"" for its UK customers. 'We're delighted to have dates to work towards' Plans to reopen England's shops and gyms in April ""We have consistently seen that there is pent up demand for travel and this surge in bookings shows that this signal from the government that it plans to reopen travel has been what UK consumers have been waiting for,"" he said. Tour operator and airline Jet2 also reported a 1,000% increase in bookings in the 24 hours following the prime minister's announcement. Popular destinations include Spain, the Canary Islands and the Balearic Islands, with a notable spike in demand from July onwards. Its chief executive, Steve Heapy, said: ""The government's announcement is the news [holidaymakers] have been longing for, and the continued surge in bookings shows how ready our customers are to get away to the sunshine on a real package holiday."" While bookings are high, there are still plenty of questions about how international travel will resume - and no guarantees that it will start again in mid-May. The industry has seen restrictions put on top of restrictions over the last few months, with visitors from entire continents banned, the introduction of quarantine hotels and multiple tests required. Removing them will take some careful unpicking. The government has said that any removal will depend on the location of concerning variants, progress of vaccine rollouts here and abroad as well as death rates and hospital admissions. It's also not just about us. Other countries will need to agree to allow British tourists in. But after fears they could be left off the roadmap, the travel industry is keen to make this plan and these dates work. Amanda Matthews, managing director and owner of Ramsbottom-based luxury travel agency network Designer Travel, said her firm had seen double the number of enquiries and new bookings for the summer. ""But we've also had hundreds of calls from people who've got bookings for travel in March, April, May and June - still very uncertain about whether they will be travelling or not,"" she told the BBC. ""Because there's no concrete date yet for the reopening of international travel, as a travel agent, we can't answer our existing clients' questions about holidays they've already booked for spring and summer. We've got no idea."" Designer Travel owner Amanda Matthews says her firm saw double the usual number of enquiries on Monday While the roadmap has provided hope for summer holidays, retail expert Kate Hardcastle said there was also ""huge disappointment"" for the travel industry - particularly among domestic overnight accommodation providers such as mobile home holiday parks and holiday cottage providers. ""Easter is obviously a critical part of the travel calendar for travel agencies and the industry, so it's a lost opportunity, one less holiday to be able to sell within,"" she told the BBC. ""I also know a lot of families are dependent on Easter holidays as it tends to be cheaper and more cost effective than the summer holidays. It would be awful to think that some people are completely priced out of a holiday this year."" But data from hotel technology company Avvio suggests a heyday for upmarket UK hotels, with August revenue for 4- and 5-star hotels more than tripling as would-be holiday makers bank on domestic breaks being more likely. On Tuesday, global hotels group InterContinental Hotels, which owns the Crowne Plaza and Holiday Inn brands, said the sector was unlikely to see a recovery until later this year, dependent on vaccine rollouts. ""2021 has begun with many of these challenges still in place,"" chief executive Keith Barr said, as the company unveiled a $260m (Â£185m) loss.

Live music 'at the back of queue to reopen',"The chief executive of a live music trade body has said the industry is ""at the back of the queue to re-open"" once coronavirus restrictions are lifted. The comments come afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson set out his four-step planto release England from lockdown. Mr Johnson said on Monday he hoped step four would see the end of all legal limits on social contact. But Greg Parmley, chief executive of Live, said his sector ""could be months behind the rest of the economy"". ""The chancellor must acknowledge our extended closure in the budget and provide the economic support needed to ensure the jobs and livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of people that work in our industry exist as we come through this pandemic,"" he said. The proposed step two, from no earlier than 12 April, could see the return of outdoor hospitality, including drive-in cinemas. Step three, which would follow at least five weeks later, on 17 May at the earliest, could allow limited indoor mixing. That would mean cinemas, theatres and other indoor entertainment attractions could operate with social distancing. Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venue Trust, welcomed the timeline for the return of socially distanced events, but said he now hoped to see ""sector-specific financial support to mitigate the damage being done to businesses and people's lives, careers and families right across the live music industry"". Theatres could operate with social distancing as part of step three Jon Morgan, director of The Theatres Trust, said it ""supports the Government's cautious approach to easing lockdown restrictions"". ""We want to play our part in helping keep people safe and we do not want to be in a situation where theatres reopen too early only to be forced to close again after a short period,"" he said. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association trade body, said: ""We are pleased to hear within the Prime Minister's statement the inclusion of a timeline for night-time economy businesses, in particular some of the hardest-hit businesses, many of which have been closed since March 2020, like nightclubs, bars and casinos."" Record labels 'should fund struggling venues' Covid is âcreating a new genreâ for live music Stars back plea to support UK live music industry He added: ""The sector urgently needs additional clarity on reopening and critical financial support from the Chancellor if we are to avoid economic and social damage that will last a generation."" Last summer, the government announced the roll out of its Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund to help tackle the crisis facing cultural organisations and heritage sites.

Cancer survivor joins historic space mission,"Hayley Arceneaux, a cancer survivor, will achieve a number of firsts when she goes to space this year The first bone cancer survivor to become an astronaut. The first person with a prosthetic body part to visit space. And the youngest American ever to orbit Earth. These are the impressive firsts that could soon be attributable to 29-year-old Hayley Arceneaux. In January, the physician assistant was picked to join the crew of the world's first all-civilian space mission. Ms Arceneaux was ecstatic but, at first, she had to keep her lips sealed. ""I've held onto the biggest secret of my life for a month and a half. So now I get to share it with the world,"" she told the BBC. Her selection for the historic mission was announced on Monday by the St Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee, where Ms Arceneaux was once a cancer patient as a child and now works. Later this year, she will launch from Florida on a Falcon 9 rocket made by SpaceX, the company founded by business mogul Elon Musk. ""I think this mission is going to inspire people in so many ways,"" Ms Arceneaux said. ""It shows them that anything is possible."" Ms Arceneaux works as a physician's assistant in the hospital where she was a patient There will be no professional astronauts on board the spacecraft. Rather, Ms Arceneaux will be joined by two contest winners and flight commander Jared Isaacman, a 38-year-old billionaire who is paying for the entire mission. The mission is the pet project of Mr Isaacman, who announced on 1 February that he had bought the rocket launch. Mr Isaacman is aiming to use the flight to raise $200m (Â£142m) for St Jude, half of which he said he will donate himself. Of the four available seats on the spacecraft, one was offered to a member of staff at the hospital. ""From the start, we wanted a crew member that represented the mission's spirit of hope,"" Mr Isaacman said. ""I can't think of a better person than Hayley to fulfil that responsibility."" For Ms Arceneaux, the flight will be the realisation of a feat she never thought was possible. At the age of 10, Ms Arceneaux was a bone cancer patient at St Jude. As part of her treatment at the hospital, Ms Arceneaux had chemotherapy and surgery to replace some of her leg bones with artificial ones. Ms Arceneaux was diagnosed with bone cancer as a child In a different era, Ms Arceneaux's prosthetic leg bones would have grounded her ambitions for space travel as a Nasa astronaut, because of the agency's strict medical requirements. But the emergence of private space missions in recent years has enabled more of us to reach for the stars. ""Until this mission, I could have never been an astronaut,"" Ms Arceneaux said. ""This mission is opening space travel to people who are not physically perfect."" Ms Arceneaux was at home in Tennessee when she got the ""out of the blue"" call on 5 January asking if she would join the mission. Her response? ""Immediately, I said, 'yes, yes please'."" After checking with her family to ""make sure they were not adamantly opposed"", and her brother and sister-in-law who - as aerospace engineers - ""really reassured me how safe space travel is"", she agreed to join the crew. Mr Isaacman is planning to select and reveal the remaining two crew members by March. One will be the winner of a sweepstake competition, whose proceeds will be donated to St Jude. The other will go to the winner of a contest which asks entrepreneurs to design an online store using software made by Shift4, Mr Isaacman's payment technology company. Mr Isaacman will be the commander of the spacecraft Once selected, the crew will undergo a rigorous, months-long training programme, including mission simulations in zero gravity. Ms Arceneaux -  the flight's medical officer - has already tried on her space suit. It was ""so cool"" but ""heavier than I expected"", she said. She will presumably get used to it by the time the rocket lifts off from Florida's Kennedy Space Center, sometime at the latter end of 2021. Then, Ms Arceneaux will be wearing the suit for several days as her spacecraft - a SpaceX Dragon capsule - circles the globe. At the end of the mission, the Dragon will re-enter Earth's atmosphere for a soft-water landing off the east coast of the US. Are Ms Arceneaux's nerves jangling? Ms Arceneaux said she hoped her space mission would inspire people with cancer ""I'm really not nervous. I've met the lead engineers for every aspect of this mission. I really trust them."" Compared to what she went through as a child, space travel should be no problem. ""Getting to represent cancer patients and survivors is an incredible honour. It really wasn't that long ago that I was in their shoes,"" she said. ""When you're going through cancer treatment, you're so focused on the day-to-day. It can be really difficult to look toward the future. I hope that this mission will allow them to imagine their future.""

WhatsApp to limit service to all who reject termsThe company lays out what will happen to users who do not accept its updated conditions.,"WhatsApp users who do not accept its updated terms and conditions by the 15 May deadline will be unable to receive or send messages until they do so. Their account will be listed as ""inactive"". And inactive accounts can be deleted after 120 days. Calls and notifications will still function for ""a short while"" but, TechCrunch reported,probably only a ""few weeks"",external. WhatsApp announced the update in January. There was a backlash among many users who thought it meant the company was planning to change the amount of data it shared with its parent company, Facebook. It later clarified this was not the case - the update is actually aimed at enabling payments to be made to businesses. WhatsApp already shares some information with Facebook, such as the user's IP address (a sequence of numbers attached to every device which connects to the internet, it can also be used to pin down its location) and purchases made via the platform. But this is not the case in Europe and the UK, where different privacy laws exist. Following the initial announcement, platforms such as Telegram and Signal sawa huge surge in demandas WhatsApp users sought alternative encrypted-messaging services.

Grenfell cladding use 'accident waiting to happen',"More than 70 people died following the fire at Grenfell Tower in June 2017 The use of a company's cladding at Grenfell Tower was ""an accident waiting to happen"", one of its bosses has agreed at a public inquiry. Claude Schmidt said ""maybe yes"" to a barrister's description of the risk. Mr Schmidt, Arconic's French president, was giving his fifth day of evidence to the Grenfell Tower public inquiry. The inquiry heard that even after the fire, an ""error"" on a draft product certificate for the cladding suggested it could be used on tall buildings. Mr Schmidt was being questioned by Richard Millett QC, the inquiry's senior counsel, about the weeks after the fire on 14 June 2017, which led to 72 deaths. Grenfell cladding email: Keep test 'confidential' Grenfell cladding firm gave fire test 'half-truth' Newscast: 'Half-truths' at the Grenfell Inquiry London Fire Brigade still to fix Grenfell failings Â£3.5bn for unsafe cladding 'too little, too late' Arconic's cladding panels had quickly emerged as a likely cause of the swift spread of flames across Grenfell Tower in North Kensington, west London. On 26 June, Arconic withdrew the product from the market for buildings taller than 18m, claiming that it had realised it was being ""incorrectly used"", including on Grenfell. Mr Millett asked him ""isn't the reality that Grenfell, as far as the use of Reynobond PE 55 [cladding] was concerned, that it was an accident waiting to happen and only then did you withdraw it from the market"". Mr Schmidt's response, as translated from French, was ""maybe yes."" But he said the company ""were among the only ones to withdraw the product from the market. It was because we couldn't control the supply chain."" Arconic's case is that it realised after the fire it could not be sure customers would use its flammable polyethylene version of the cladding safely. Mr Millett said ""wasn't that all the more reason to stop selling"". ""Yes"", Mr Schmidt agreed. He said that the decision not to sell the cladding for high-rise buildings was not made because it was ""inherently dangerous"" but said it did ""have certain characteristics which, if it is used incorrectly, can increase the risk of fire spread"". The inquiry says the cladding was a major cause of the rapid spread of flames during the disaster and this phase of its hearings are determining why it was used. The inquiry has heard, and Mr Schmidt also agreed, that for 12 years before the Grenfell fire, Arconic failed to reveal poor fire test data for the cassette form of its cladding to an important British building industry body. The British Board of AgrÃ©ment had issued a standards certificate for the product, relied on by the industry, which suggested all versions of the cladding met British standards. This document was sent to the contractors for Grenfell. They selected the Arconic cladding, and a design which would use it in exactly the cassette configuration which the tests suggested would allow fires to spread. Even after the fire, a redrafted BBA certificate continued to claim better fire test data than the company had. It also emerged at the inquiry thata BBC investigation into Arconic in 2018prompted the Board to challenge the cladding firm about what information it had been given. The BBC had discovered the series of poor fire tests reports, commissioned by Arconic, which have been at the heart of this phase of the inquiry. They were carried out in France, but were not published in the UK, and not passed to the British Board of AgrÃ©ment. In March 2018 the BBC shared them with the Board, which confirmed the information, crucial to the product certificate, had not been handed over. Challenged by the BBA, Mr Schmidt said he was ""happy"" to send them.  Brian Moore, from the BBA, responded that it was ""concerning"" to hear that Arconic had the reports. But despite this exchange of emails, they were never handed over, due to legal advice, Mr Schmidt said. By this point, the inquiry, and the police had begun in-depth investigations.

US passes half a million Covid deaths,"This video can not be played Biden: ""This nation will smile again"" President Joe Biden has addressed the nation as the US passed the figure of 500,000 Covid-related deaths, the highest number of any country. ""As a nation, we can't accept such a cruel fate. We have to resist becoming numb to the sorrow,"" he said on Monday. The president and vice-president, and their spouses, then observed a moment of silence outside the White House during a candle-lighting ceremony. Confirmed US infections now stand at 28.1 million, also a global record. What 500,000 US deaths look like ""Today I ask all Americans to remember. Remember those we lost and remember those we left behind,"" President Biden said, calling for Americans to fight Covid together. This video can not be played The 'colourful' lives lost to Covid - how obituaries are helping us all mourn The president ordered all flags on federal property to be lowered to half mast for the next five days. At the White House, he opened his speech by noting that the number of American deaths from Covid was higher than the death toll from World War One, World War Two, and the Vietnam War combined. ""Today we mark a truly grim, heartbreaking milestone - 500,071 dead,"" he said. ""We often hear people described as ordinary Americans,"" he went on to say. ""There's no such thing, there's nothing ordinary about them. The people we lost were extraordinary. They span generations. Born in America, emigrated to America."" ""So many of them took their final breath alone in America."" Family mourn Gregory Blanks, 50, who died with Covid in January in Texas He drew on his own experience with grief - his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash in 1972 and one of his sons died from brain cancer in 2015. ""I know what it's like to not be there when it happens. I know what it's like when you are there holding their hands; there's a look in their eye and they slip away,"" he said. ""For me, the way through sorrow and grief is to find purpose."" Mr Biden's approach to the pandemic is different to his predecessor, Donald Trump, who cast doubt on the impact of the deadly virus and was viewed as having politicised the wearing of masks and other measures needed to prevent the spread of the virus. President Biden, Vice-President Harris, the First Lady and the Second Gentleman during a moment of silence On 19 January, one day before Mr Biden took office, he held an event to mark 400,000 Americans dying of the disease. Monday's event, marking the latest death toll, comes about one month later. Elsewhere in Washington, the bells at the National Cathedral tolled 500 times, once for every 1,000 Americans lost during the pandemic. Although numbers are now going in the right direction, hospital admissions - and deaths - remain high, as the key statistics show: The 28.1 million confirmed US infections is nearly double that of second-highest India (11 million) and Brazil (10.1 million),according to Johns Hopkins University research,external But the US ranks ninth in terms of deaths per 100,000 population, behind countries like the UK and Italy At least 90,000 more Americans are expected to have died with the virus by 1 June, an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projection says. By late May, the virus will kill around 500 Americans per day - down from approximately 2,000 now Hospital admission rates have fallen for 40 straight days Average vaccine administrations per day now stand at 1.7 million, twice as many as when Mr Biden took office The growing number of variants, which could spark new deadly outbreaks, remains a concern Dr Ashish Jha, dean of the school of public health at Brown University, told BBC News: ""A year ago I could not have imagined that half a million Americans would lose their lives to this disease. ""We have so much capability, so many resources... this was all preventable and should not have happened. And yet here we are."" Covid world map: Where have the 111m cases been? The nation's top immunologist, Dr Anthony Fauci, told CNN on Sunday: ""People decades from now are going to be talking about this as a terribly historic milestone in the history of this country, to have these many people to have died from a respiratory-borne infection."" Americans' average life expectancy has dropped by one full year due to Covid-19, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week. The change has been most acute among racial minorities, who have been disproportionally affected by the deadly virus. US life expectancy falls by a year amid pandemic Black men suffered the largest decline, with life expectancy dropping by three years between January and June 2020. And Hispanic men saw a fall in life expectancy of 2.4 years during that period. When did you first say 'coronavirus'? About a year ago, the pandemic hit.

'We're delighted to have dates to work towards',"Gareth and Claire McKeever of Pure Lakes Skin Care in Kendal A number of businesses will be able to reopen from 12 April if conditions are met, the Prime Minister has announced. The news has prompted relief across the business community, although many sectors warn they remain under severe financial pressure. ""We are delighted to have some dates to work towards at last,"" skincare maker Gareth McKeever told the BBC. He and wife Claire hand-make Pure Lakes Skin Care products at a workshop in the Lake District. They supply hotels and shops, as well as sell online, but lost four-fifths of their business during lockdown, so have been desperate for some certainty about the future so they can plan. PM plans to reopen shops and gyms on 12 April 'We are burning through about Â£500,000 a day' UK vaccine rollout working 'spectacularly' ""Although our online sales have been a Godsend during lockdown, 80% of our business is supplying hospitality and non-essential retail, and that disappeared almost overnight,"" said Mr McKeever. ""We may still have some time to wait before these customers can reopen but at least we can now start to plan ahead and prepare."" He added that for a small, family-run business with limited access to third-party finance, ""uncertainty is a huge obstacle"" to buying raw materials and maintaining stock levels, let alone future growth plans. ""It is a big relief that we now have something to work towards."" Restaurants and non-essential retailers have given a cautious welcome to the roadmap with its offer of hope of reopenings. Franzos marketing advisor Mark Smith Mark Smith, marketing adviser for the Franzos chicken chain in the south east of England, said the news was a relief. ""It is great to hear the announcement today, a clear roadmap with restaurants allowed to allow customers to dine-in again inside in May,"" he told the BBC. ""We, as does the wider hospitality industry, welcome this decision and can't wait to welcome customers back."" Ian Watson, chief executive of Hotter Shoes in Lancashire, is pleased but cautious: ""It's good to see a route map for the reopening of non-essential retail, however I worry it is still lacking in confirmed dates and reliant on many ifs and buts."" He said retailers will need to understand the confirmed dates and criteria they are working to, ""not only so that we can prepare the business internally, but in order to care for our staff and our suppliers effectively. ""Our retail staff have been in limbo for the majority of the past 12 months, and now need clarity on when they will be returning to work."" Other business sectors have welcomed the possibility of starting up again, but have warned that they will need more help to survive. Having some certainty will help the events industry, said Matthew Shaw, creative director at events company Sauveur. Matthew Shaw, creative director at events company Sauveur ""The events and weddings industries have been crying out for a clear framework from which to build. At long last, this roadmap offers some much-needed visibility and guidance,"" he said. But he warned that it is only the first step. ""The second summer season decimated by the pandemic will not be easy,"" said Mr Shaw. ""It's vital that the Budget includes extensive support for freelancers and the self-employed, a clear plan for small businesses, and a substantial commitment to the events industry."" Sarah Haywood, spokesperson for the UK Weddings Taskforce, warned that 400,000 jobs in the industry remain at risk. ""It is disappointing that for the next four months we will only gradually get to 30 guests permitted at a wedding. This is simply unviable for most businesses,"" she warned. ""The infrastructure at the heart of our sector is close to collapse and until weddings can proceed normally, 400,000 jobs across 60,000 businesses remain in jeopardy."" The hospitality sector is also on a knife-edge, said UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls. Couples who have splashed out on dream wedding venues say they are struggling to get new dates booked ""The sector is devastated that its reopening will be so far away. From the start of November, the sector will have been closed for nearly 200 days, with just a couple of weeks of heavily-restricted trading in December,"" she said. ""A major package of financial support is imperative if hospitality is to survive."" The gym sector too will need support, said Neil Randall, chief executive of Anytime Fitness UK. ""Today's announcement is a positive step and we acknowledge that leisure and gym facilities been given next priority after education and outdoor sport,"" said Mr Randall. ""However, we urge the chancellor to provide a comprehensive relief package for our sector which was endured over eight months of closure in the past twelve months."" Jonathan Geldart, director general of The Institute of Directors said:""It is crucial that businesses have clarity around how the government perceives the UK is meeting its four key tests to help them plan, taking into considering the lead time's they need to ensure workplaces are Covid-safe and so they can start rehiring."" Mike Chery, national chairman, The Federation of Small Businesses said:""It's important for this plan to protect against a fourth Covid wave and accompanying lockdown, the imposition of which would be devastating for the 250,000 firms that fear closure this year. The Chancellor must deliver on the Prime Minister's 'whatever it takes' pledge at next week's Budget."" Ian Wright, chief executive of The Food and Drink Federation said:""For a great many of the food and drink manufacturers supplying the hospitality and food service sectors, a return to 'business as usual' seems an awful long way off. As such, it is only correct that the Chancellor outlines significant extensions to the furlough and credit insurance schemes as part of his Budget announcement next week."" Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK said:""We're grateful to the Prime Minister and Department for Transport for providing the clarity the whole sector was looking for that international travel can reopen this summer, as soon as it is safe to do so."" Mike Hawes, chief executive of The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said:""The fact that retail showrooms must remain closed until April at least, is deeply disappointing given these facilities are Covid-secure, large premises with low footfall and able to operate on an appointment-only basis.""

Youngest pupils return as Scotland's schools reopen,"P1 pupils Grace Lee (left) and classmate Grace McKeeman, both aged five, arrive for their first day back at Inverkip Primary School Scotland's youngest pupils are returning to the classroom for the first time since the Christmas break. It is stage one in a phased reopening of schools which have been closed to all but a minority of pupils since the beginning of January. Education Secretary John Swinneyinsisted ""detailed clinical analysis"" assured him it is safe. But concerns have been raised about the measures in place to reduce risk of transmission. How will the phased return to school work? Youngest pupils to return to Scotland's classrooms Covid: Are teachers more at risk of dying? Mr Swinney told BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandthat case prevalence data would be closely monitored to determine the impact of the phase one return. But he said Scotland would not be following England, where all pupils aredue to return to school on 8 March. Asked if it would be ""dangerous"" to send everyone back on that date, Mr Swinney said: ""I wouldn't have clinical authorisation to do that."" The deputy first minister added: ""We will move as quickly as we possibly can do but we have to do it within the scientific and clinical advice that is available to us."" Mr Swinney also urged parents to act responsibly during the first phase of lockdown easing. He added: ""The biggest threat to the opening of schools is not outbreaks in schools. It is community transmission."" Epidemiologist Dr Deepti Gurdasani told BBC Scotland at the weekend there was some evidence from England that younger children could bring infections back into homes. But Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University, said the return of schools was about balancing the ""risks and benefits"". She told BBC Good Morning Scotland: ""There will likely be cases emerging in schools over the next few weeks but the vast majority of schools should be fine, and that we have to keep perspective on."" She said the majority of scientific evidence was that there is an ""age gradient"" in infections - with very few outbreaks in nurseries but with teenagers and university students much more prone to infection. Prof Sridhar added: ""I think what we have to do is work back up through that gradient. We are doing that starting with primaries and early years - the approach Denmark has also taken."" On Sunday the deputy first minister pointed todocuments prepared by a government expert advisory group,externalwhich states that younger children are less likely to catch or pass on the virus than older children and adults.

As well as the youngest children returning to school, a small number of senior secondary pupils will be allowed into school buildings on a part-time basis to complete work for national qualifications. Other age groups will continue to learn from home and it is unlikely they will return to the classroom before 15 March at the earliest. In primary schools measures to minimise the spread of the virus include regular hand-washing, open windows, and 2m physical distancing between adults, and between adults and children. Staff will also be offered regular lateral flow tests. Resources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown. BBC Bitesize Learning at Home Primary school programmes on iPlayer Secondary school programmes on iPlayer Learn at BBC Scotland collection Prof Jason Leitch, the national clinical director, has written to parents asking them to play their part in the safe return. He urged them to: wear a face covering at drop off and pick up times, and in congested areas limit drop off and pick up times to one adult keep 2m away from other adults when waiting for children avoid car shares and limit use of public transport be vigilant for symptoms of coronavirus in the household and follow the Test and Protect guidance. Appealing to parents not to relax the rules elsewhere, he reminded them that indoor play dates are not allowed  - though children can play together outside. And he said parents should continue to work from home if they are able to do so. Mr Swinney's safety assurance came after an epidemiology expert raised concerns about the knock-on effects of sending children back to school. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, of Queen Mary University of London, said data from England showed primary school children were two times more likely to be the first Covid case in a household, and once infected were two times more likely to infect their contacts. Speaking to BBC Scotland'sThe Sunday Show, she said children aged six and above should wear masks in schools and more attention should be paid to ventilation. The EIS teaching union has also raised concerns about school safety and have said a blended learning model - with about half of pupils in classes at any one time - would be more appropriate.

Live music 'at back of queue to re-open',"The chief executive of a live music trade body has said the industry is ""at the back of the queue to re-open"" once coronavirus restrictions are lifted. The comments come afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson set out his four-step planto release England from lockdown. Mr Johnson said on Monday he hoped step four would see the end of all legal limits on social contact. But Greg Parmley, chief executive of Live, said his sector ""could be months behind the rest of the economy"". ""The chancellor must acknowledge our extended closure in the budget and provide the economic support needed to ensure the jobs and livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of people that work in our industry exist as we come through this pandemic,"" he said. The proposed step two, from no earlier than 12 April, could see the return of outdoor hospitality, including drive-in cinemas. Step three, which would follow at least five weeks later, on 17 May at the earliest, could allow limited indoor mixing. That would mean cinemas, theatres and other indoor entertainment attractions could operate with social distancing. Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venue Trust, welcomed the timeline for the return of socially distanced events, but said he now hoped to see ""sector-specific financial support to mitigate the damage being done to businesses and people's lives, careers and families right across the live music industry"". Theatres could operate with social distancing as part of step three Jon Morgan, director of The Theatres Trust, said it ""supports the Government's cautious approach to easing lockdown restrictions"". ""We want to play our part in helping keep people safe and we do not want to be in a situation where theatres reopen too early only to be forced to close again after a short period,"" he said. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association trade body, said: ""We are pleased to hear within the Prime Minister's statement the inclusion of a timeline for night-time economy businesses, in particular some of the hardest-hit businesses, many of which have been closed since March 2020, like nightclubs, bars and casinos."" Record labels 'should fund struggling venues' Covid is âcreating a new genreâ for live music Stars back plea to support UK live music industry He added: ""The sector urgently needs additional clarity on reopening and critical financial support from the Chancellor if we are to avoid economic and social damage that will last a generation.""

Plans to reopen England's shops and gyms in AprilBoris Johnson hopes all legal limits on social contact could be lifted in England from 21 June.UKComments,"This video can not be played Watch the full statement by Boris Johnson on England's roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM. From 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs. It requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be ""cautious but irreversible"" and at every stage decisions would be led by ""data not dates"". There was ""no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world"", he said. Kuenssberg: PM steers country towards the exit Why can't we unlock more quickly? Holiday bookings surge on lockdown exit plans Mr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be ""seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all"". He described the plan as a ""one-way road to freedom"" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible ""but the intention is that it should be"". It comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rolloutsuggested it was having a ""spectacular"" impact on stopping serious illness. As part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England: From 8 March -All schools will open with outdoor after-school sports and activities allowed. Recreation in an outdoor public spaces - such as a park - will be allowed between two people, meaning they would be allowed to sit down for a coffee, drink or picnic From 29 March -Outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be allowed. It is understood this will include gatherings in private gardens. Outdoor sports facilities such as tennis or basketball courts will reopen andorganised adult and children's sport, such as grassroots football, will also return Secondary school pupilscan access tests and will be required to wear face coveringsin classrooms and shared spaces like corridors. There will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. The second stepfrom 12 Aprilwould see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen: Non-essential retail opens, hairdressers and some public buildings like libraries Outdoor settings like alcohol takeaways, beer gardens, zoos and theme parks Indoor leisure like swimming pools and gyms Self-contained holiday accommodation, such as self-catering lets and camp sites But wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed. Mr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol. He said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest. Funerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests. The third step will comefrom 17 May- if the data allows - and will see the ""rule of six"" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people: Two households can mix indoors - with the rule of six applied in hospitality settings like pubs Cinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events reopen - though social distancing remains Up to 10,000 spectatorscan attend the very largest outdoor seated venueslike football stadiums Up to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes. Mr Johnson said this step would also ""consider the potential role of Covid status certification"" - which could refer to so-called ""vaccine passports"" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely. This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty explains the length of gaps between each stage of reopening Before the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other ""long-term measures"" designed to reduce transmission, including the ""one metre plus"" rule and the wearing of face coverings. They will also consider whether to lift the ""work from home"" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed. England care home residents to get one visitor each Live music 'at the back of queue to reopen' 'We're delighted to have dates to work towards' The fourth stepfrom 21 Junewill potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs. The government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished. Music and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector,with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is ""at the back of the queue to re-open"" once restrictions are lifted. MPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers. This video can not be played Sir Patrick Vallance says home-working and mask-wearing measures may continue until next winter Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the ""right balance"" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day. Speaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was ""very important"" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid ""flying blind"". Sir Patrick also said ""baseline"" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter. The vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year. So why, many may ask, is there such caution? The answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap. Among the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London. It showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022. There is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus. The gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidScotlandwould return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased. It means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? InWales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterwants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schoolsfollowing Mr Johnson's announcement in England. The prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight. He faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions. One participant suggested he was talking ""gibberish"" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey. Another said the PM had been ""rattled"". What annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted ""before"" certain dates. He was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was ""no backtracking"" on the five-week wait between steps. The prime minister also said that ""a debate had to be had"" on domestic vaccine passport certificates.

Plans to reopen England's shops and gyms in AprilBoris Johnson hopes all legal limits on social contact could be lifted in England from 21 June.,"This video can not be played Watch the full statement by Boris Johnson on England's roadmap out of the Covid-19 lockdown A new four-step plan to ease England's lockdown could see all legal limits on social contact lifted by 21 June, if strict conditions are met. Shops, hairdressers, gyms and outdoor hospitality could reopen on 12 April in England under plans set out by the PM. From 17 May, two households might be allowed to mix in homes, while the rule of six could apply in places like pubs. It requires four tests on vaccines, infection rates and new coronavirus variants to be met at each stage. Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs the plan aimed to be ""cautious but irreversible"" and at every stage decisions would be led by ""data not dates"". There was ""no credible route to a zero-Covid Britain nor indeed a zero-Covid world"", he said. Kuenssberg: PM steers country towards the exit Why can't we unlock more quickly? Holiday bookings surge on lockdown exit plans Mr Johnson later told a Downing Street news conference the coming spring and summer would be ""seasons of hope, looking and feeling incomparably better for us all"". He described the plan as a ""one-way road to freedom"" but said he could not guarantee it would be irreversible ""but the intention is that it should be"". It comes as the first data on the UK's coronavirus vaccine rolloutsuggested it was having a ""spectacular"" impact on stopping serious illness. As part of the first step of the plan for easing lockdown in England: From 8 March -All schools will open with outdoor after-school sports and activities allowed. Recreation in an outdoor public spaces - such as a park - will be allowed between two people, meaning they would be allowed to sit down for a coffee, drink or picnic From 29 March -Outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be allowed. It is understood this will include gatherings in private gardens. Outdoor sports facilities such as tennis or basketball courts will reopen andorganised adult and children's sport, such as grassroots football, will also return Secondary school pupilscan access tests and will be required to wear face coveringsin classrooms and shared spaces like corridors. There will be a gap of at least five weeks between each of the plan's subsequent steps to allow for the impact of changes on infection rates and hospital admissions to be assessed. The second stepfrom 12 Aprilwould see major parts of the economy permitted to reopen: Non-essential retail opens, hairdressers and some public buildings like libraries Outdoor settings like alcohol takeaways, beer gardens, zoos and theme parks Indoor leisure like swimming pools and gyms Self-contained holiday accommodation, such as self-catering lets and camp sites But wider social contact rules will continue to apply in all settings - meaning no indoor mixing between different households will be allowed. Mr Johnson confirmed the end of hospitality curfews - and requirements to eat a substantial meal alongside alcohol. He said a review of international leisure travel restrictions would be announced by 12 April at the earliest. Funerals continue with up to 30 people, and weddings with up to 15 guests. The third step will comefrom 17 May- if the data allows - and will see the ""rule of six"" abolished for outdoor gatherings, replaced with a limit of 30 people: Two households can mix indoors - with the rule of six applied in hospitality settings like pubs Cinemas, museums, hotels, performances and sporting events reopen - though social distancing remains Up to 10,000 spectatorscan attend the very largest outdoor seated venueslike football stadiums Up to 30 people will be able to attend weddings, receptions, funerals and wakes. Mr Johnson said this step would also ""consider the potential role of Covid status certification"" - which could refer to so-called ""vaccine passports"" - in helping indoor venues to reopen safely. This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty explains the length of gaps between each stage of reopening Before the fourth step, ministers will carry out a review into social distancing and other ""long-term measures"" designed to reduce transmission, including the ""one metre plus"" rule and the wearing of face coverings. They will also consider whether to lift the ""work from home"" guidance, which the government says people should continue to follow until the review has been completed. England care home residents to get one visitor each Live music 'at the back of queue to reopen' 'We're delighted to have dates to work towards' The fourth stepfrom 21 Junewill potentially see all legal limits on social contact removed, with the final closed sectors of the economy reopened - such as nightclubs. The government hopes that - from this date - restrictions on weddings and funerals will also be abolished. Music and events leaders called for more financial support for the sector,with the boss of one live music trade body saying his industry is ""at the back of the queue to re-open"" once restrictions are lifted. MPs will vote on the roadmap in late March. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer welcomed the plan but said certainty was needed over the future of the government furlough scheme for both businesses and workers. This video can not be played Sir Patrick Vallance says home-working and mask-wearing measures may continue until next winter Prof Neil Ferguson, of Imperial College London, said he thought the roadmap struck the ""right balance"" - but warned reopening schools risks increasing the number of cases reported each day. Speaking later at the Downing Street briefing, UK chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance said it was ""very important"" to leave a gap of five weeks between the changes in the roadmap to avoid ""flying blind"". Sir Patrick also said ""baseline"" measures - such as face coverings in certain situations, hand washing, and self-isolation - may be necessary next winter. The vaccines are working well and infection levels have fallen to a fifth of what they were since the start of the year. So why, many may ask, is there such caution? The answer lies in the mountain of data published by the government as it unveiled its roadmap. Among the documents was modelling done by Imperial College London. It showed a rapid easing of restrictions could lead to surge in deaths over the summer and a total of 80,000 deaths by the middle of 2022. There is much uncertainty about scenarios like this - for one thing it did not take into account any seasonal impact that the warmer weather could bring by reducing spread of the virus. The gradual lifting could, by comparison, reduce that to around 30,000. That would bring it in line with the sort of deaths we could see during a bad flu winter. UK chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty says that should be the context in which we judge Covid now. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions but have largely moved in the same direction, though at different speeds, during the pandemic. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidScotlandwould return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased. It means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? InWales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterwants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schoolsfollowing Mr Johnson's announcement in England. The prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight. He faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions. One participant suggested he was talking ""gibberish"" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey. Another said the PM had been ""rattled"". What annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted ""before"" certain dates. He was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was ""no backtracking"" on the five-week wait between steps. The prime minister also said that ""a debate had to be had"" on domestic vaccine passport certificates. It came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according tolatest government figures,external.

"'We are burning through about Â£500,000 a day'","Lockdown has been costing budget gym franchise PureGym hundreds of thousands of pounds a day, the company's boss has said. ""We are burning about Â£500,000 a day and that's the average over eight months of closure,"" Humphrey Cobbold toldthe BBC's Today programme. It has meant about Â£120m of costs with no revenue for his 275 gyms, he says. He is among business leaders who will carefully study Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to re-open the economy. Mr Johnson will share his finalised roadmap with ministers later, before unveiling it to MPs and then leading a news conference at 19:00 GMT. It is speculated that businesses branded as non-essential may not open until as late as May. PM to unveil 'cautious' England lockdown exit plan When will lockdown rules change? Hospitality 'needs more notice' on lockdown easing ""It's been brutally tough,"" said Mr Cobbold of the period under lockdown. While the government furlough scheme has been paying a portion of staff salaries, he said his business has still been paying some staff costs such as pension contributions and has amassed sizeable rent arrears. Mr Cobbold says he has been able to raise funds from investors, which has helped the business survive, and he insists that his business is ready to re-open safely. ""The sooner the better within safe operating procedures for us,"" he said. ""We can make a massive contribution to the health of the nation"" However, he says his and other firms have learned the hard way that government plans can come late and can be changed. ""I've learned over the last year not to make too many assumptions,"" he said. Ralph Findlay, chief executive of pub chain Marston's, says he would also like to see a route out of the restrictions, since for pubs like his, they mean operating at a loss. ""For many businesses, operating with restrictions is very difficult,"" he told the Today programme. ""We did open last year - it's not as if we haven't done this before."" The severity of lockdown for pubs means ""sadly it's inevitable"" that some pubs will not be able to re-open, he said. ""As a sector we have had no income for nine months and we are still incurring costs,"" he said. There are economic reasons to open pubs as well as social ones, he said. The industry employs millions of people, and Marston's generates about Â£500m a year for the government  including direct and indirect taxes, he added. On Monday, rival pub chain Mitchells and Butlers also revealed more of the scale of the challenges it faces. The chain, which runs outlets including Harvesters, O'Neill's and All Bar One, said it was burning through Â£30-35m a month. It said sales between the end of September and 16 January were 69.8% below last year. It said it had agreed a temporary break from paying into its staff pension funds. It is now in the process of trying to raise Â£351m from investors. Phil Urban, the company's chief executive, said: ""M&B was a high performing business coming into the pandemic... we have every confidence that we can emerge in a strong competitive position once current restrictions are lifted. ""The hospitality industry has done everything that has been asked of it to date and, now that the vaccines are being rolled out and infections are dropping, we are hopeful that pubs and restaurants will soon be allowed to re-open safely so that we can start to serve our customers again.""

Live music 'at the back of queue to re-open',"The chief executive of a live music trade body has said the industry is ""at the back of the queue to re-open"" once coronavirus restrictions are lifted. The comments come afterPrime Minister Boris Johnson set out his four-step planto release England from lockdown. Mr Johnson said on Monday he hoped step four would see the end of all legal limits on social contact. But Greg Parmley, chief executive of Live, said his sector ""could be months behind the rest of the economy"". ""The chancellor must acknowledge our extended closure in the budget and provide the economic support needed to ensure the jobs and livelihoods of the hundreds of thousands of people that work in our industry exist as we come through this pandemic,"" he said. The proposed step two, from no earlier than 12 April, could see the return of outdoor hospitality, including drive-in cinemas. Step three, which would follow at least five weeks later, on 17 May at the earliest, could allow limited indoor mixing. That would mean cinemas, theatres and other indoor entertainment attractions could operate with social distancing. Mark Davyd, chief executive of the Music Venue Trust, welcomed the timeline for the return of socially distanced events, but said he now hoped to see ""sector-specific financial support to mitigate the damage being done to businesses and people's lives, careers and families right across the live music industry"". Theatres could operate with social distancing as part of step three Jon Morgan, director of The Theatres Trust, said it ""supports the Government's cautious approach to easing lockdown restrictions"". ""We want to play our part in helping keep people safe and we do not want to be in a situation where theatres reopen too early only to be forced to close again after a short period,"" he said. Michael Kill, chief executive of the Night Time Industries Association trade body, said: ""We are pleased to hear within the Prime Minister's statement the inclusion of a timeline for night-time economy businesses, in particular some of the hardest-hit businesses, many of which have been closed since March 2020, like nightclubs, bars and casinos."" Record labels 'should fund struggling venues' Covid is âcreating a new genreâ for live music Stars back plea to support UK live music industry He added: ""The sector urgently needs additional clarity on reopening and critical financial support from the Chancellor if we are to avoid economic and social damage that will last a generation."" Last summer, the government announced the roll out of its Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund to help tackle the crisis facing cultural organisations and heritage sites.

John Lewis considers closing more stores,"John Lewis is considering more store closures as it tries to cut costs and adapt to the boom in online shopping. In what would be another blow for the High Street, the BBC understands up to eight department stores may remain permanently closed. That would be on top of the eight stores it shut last year, which included two small travel hub shops at Heathrow and St Pancras. That could leave it with 34 stores, down from its current total of 42. John Lewis has declined to comment on the potential move,which was first reported by the Sunday Times,external. Any closures would be another blow to the high street and town centres, which are already grappling with the fall-out from the collapse of Debenhams and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia empire. The rise in internet shopping, exacerbated by various lockdown measures amid coronavirus, has forced John Lewis to rethink how many stores it needs. It already expects up to 70% of its sales will be online by 2025. In July last year, John Lewis announced it was closing its stores in Birmingham, Croydon, Watford, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, as well as the smaller hubs at St Pancras and Heathrow, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. In January, John Lewis said its Christmas trading had been better than anticipated and that it expected its full year profits to be ahead of its previous guidance of a small loss or a small profit. 2,450 jobs lost as Dorothy Perkins sold to Boohoo Thousands of jobs at risk after Asos Arcadia deal Any announcement on further store closures could come next month, when the John Lewis Partnership, which includes Waitrose, announces its annual results on 11 March. The last set of results showed a half-year loss of Â£635m, and prompted it to cancel its annual staff bonus for the first time since 1953. The shutting of more John Lewis stores would be another blow for the High Street, which has seen the closure of a number of so-called anchor brands - big names that attract shoppers and other shops to the area. Topshop, part of Sir Philip Green's failed Arcadia empire, and Debenhams have been among the high profile casualties of the shift of retailing online. Earlier this month, online fashion retailer Asos bought Topshop and other Arcadia brands Topman and Miss Selfridge out of administration. And Boohoo, another fast-growing online retailer, bought Arcadia brands Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton. Neither deal included the shops. 2,450 jobs lost as Dorothy Perkins sold to Boohoo John Lewis suspends click and collect due to virus Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

WhatsApp to limit service to all who reject terms,"WhatsApp users who do not accept its updated terms and conditions by the 15 May deadline will be unable to receive or send messages until they do so. Their account will be listed as ""inactive"". And inactive accounts can be deleted after 120 days. Calls and notifications will still function for ""a short while"" but, TechCrunch reported,probably only a ""few weeks"",external. WhatsApp announced the update in January. There was a backlash among many users who thought it meant the company was planning to change the amount of data it shared with its parent company, Facebook. It later clarified this was not the case - the update is actually aimed at enabling payments to be made to businesses. WhatsApp already shares some information with Facebook, such as the user's IP address (a sequence of numbers attached to every device which connects to the internet, it can also be used to pin down its location) and purchases made via the platform. But this is not the case in Europe and the UK, where different privacy laws exist.

First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has saidScotlandwould return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased. It means different parts of the country could be under different rules. Ms Sturgeon added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? InWales, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Fosterwants its executive to discuss the reopening date for schoolsfollowing Mr Johnson's announcement in England. The prime minister addressed the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative MPs tonight. He faced criticism of what some saw as slow progress in removing restrictions. One participant suggested he was talking ""gibberish"" when he compared his routemap to a motorway journey. Another said the PM had been ""rattled"". What annoyed some MPs was an apparent lack of flexibility in the plan with restrictions not being lifted ""before"" certain dates. He was urged to keep open the possibility of bringing these dates forward if data allowed but there was ""no backtracking"" on the five-week wait between steps. The prime minister also said that ""a debate had to be had"" on domestic vaccine passport certificates. It came as a further 10,641 coronavirus cases were reported on Monday, alongside another 178 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. More than 17.7 million people across the UK have now received at least one vaccine dose, according tolatest government figures,external.

'They wanted to jail a banker - I was that banker',"This video can not be played Libor banker's appeal being examined by crime commission Tom Hayes, the first banker to be jailed for rigging interest rates, has told the BBC he believes fresh evidence will show his conviction was unsafe. It raises questions about more than 20 other cases and some of the only bankers prosecuted in the UK since the financial crash. His case is now being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) said he was found guilty by a jury and the Court of Appeal upheld the conviction. ""I don't blame the jury for it but they were presented with a false narrative and they reached a conclusion based on those facts. I believe had they been presented with full evidence they would have reached a very different conclusion,"" Mr Hayes - who was jailed for 11 years and served five and a half - told the BBC in his first TV interview since being released. ""This wasn't an easy sentence. In that time, I lost my mind, I lost my mental health. I suffered deep bouts of depression. I harboured suicidal thoughts often. I was very angry and bitter. I struggled with my emotions. ""Now I sit here in the park and I can smell freedom... but believe me, when you're sitting in a cell for 23 and a half hours a day with two other gentlemen and there's not even room to stand up - that's difficult, very difficult."" The former UBS trader was found guilty of manipulating Libor, the benchmark that tracks the interest rate banks pay to borrow cash from each other. The new evidence is part of eight grounds of appeal now being examined by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), the body set up to review allegations of miscarriages of justice. In 2015, the SFO called Tom Hayes the ""ringmaster"" of an international conspiracy to rig interest rates. After a jury returned a guilty verdict, he became the first UK banker to be jailed since the financial crash. Former trader Tom Hayes with his then wife Sarah Tighe at Southwark Crown Court in August 2015. Rulings made prior to his 2015 trial outlawed any consideration of a bank's commercial interests when setting the Libor benchmark. They followed evidence from a key prosecution witness, John Ewan, who said it was against the rules to allow a bank's trading positions to interfere with the process of setting that interest rate and that at no point did he suspect that was taking place. Mr Hayes says the new evidence, of a conversation involving Mr Ewan at the body that regulates Libor, is in ""stark contrast"" to that testimony. The rulings have since been used by the SFO to prosecute 23 further defendants in subsequent trials for interest-rate rigging. However, more have been acquitted than convicted as defendants' lawyers questioned if traders' conduct was regarded as unlawful at the time. Criminal proceedings have also been issued in the United States against six defendants for the same offence, resulting in four convictions, two of which have been overturned. What the FTSE or Nikkei are to share prices, Libor is to interest rates - an index that tracks the cost of borrowing cash between the banks. It's used to set interest rates on millions of residential and commercial loans around the world. To work out Libor each day, 16 banks answer a question - at what interest rate could they borrow money? They submit their answers and an average is taken and published as Libor (the London Interbank Offered Rate). The evidence against Tom Hayes and other traders consisted of messages and emails asking for those interest rates to be submitted ""high"" or ""low"". Mr Hayes acknowledges his hope was it might move the Libor average in favour of his bank, UBS, which could make or lose money on trades it had done linked to the Libor rate. ""I sent emails and I made phone calls in full knowledge that all of these things were recorded. And I did it with abandon, because I didn't believe I was doing anything wrong,"" he said. The Libor rate is meant to track how much banks pay to borrow cash from each other. While prosecutors said it was ""self-evidently"" corrupt, a key plank of his defence was that it was normal practice to ask for ""high"" or ""low"" rates - as long as they were still accurate. Each day banks were able to borrow at a number of slightly different rates (e.g. Barclays offering 3.18%, HSBC offering 3.20%, Lloyds offering 3.19%), creating a narrow range of rates which were all accurate answers to the Libor question - at what interest rate could you borrow? It was standard industry practice, according to the CCRC application for Mr Hayes, to select a rate within that accurate range best suited to the bank's commercial interests - based, for example, on the trades it had done. That was, according to him and the other defendants in rate-rigging trials, in line with a fiduciary duty they had as part of their jobs to do all they could to maximise revenues and minimise losses for their banks. However, in his closing speech to the jury, SFO prosecutor Mukul Chawla repeatedly attacked the idea of a range, claiming that ""rangeâ¦does not exist"". Prior to Mr Hayes' trial, presiding judge Mr Justice Jeremy Cooke found that any attempt to influence a Libor submission to suit a bank's commercial interests was in breach of the rules. His finding, upheld by the Court of Appeal, established a precedent which was then used to prosecute 24 money brokers and traders at other banks such as Barclays and Deutsche Bank. Mr Justice Cooke made his finding after seeing a witness statement from key prosecution witness John Ewan, who previously oversaw the rate-setting process at the British Bankers Association, which owned and supervised Libor. Mr Ewan's witness statement prior to Mr Hayes' trial stated that attempting to move Libor to help a bank's trades was against the rules. The former Libor manager at the British Bankers Association testified that ""at no point"" did he suspect this was taking place. If he had been aware of it, it would have been investigated and steps taken to stop it. 'I'm being jailed for four emails from 12 years ago' Two Barclays traders found not guilty in Libor retrial Libor: What is it and why does it matter? But while in prison Tom Hayes came across a transcript, disclosed in US criminal proceedings but not at his trial. He says it shows taking trades into account was seen as acceptable if the rates submitted were ""representative"" - meaning they reflected the real rates at which banks were offering to lend cash that day. ""I was going through piles of paperwork in my cell and I couldn't quite believe what I was reading. ""John Ewan said in that conversation: 'I don't know if this is the result of any derivatives trading going on but the rates are representative so from that point of view I'm fine.'"" ""Now had commerciality not been allowed in the decision-making process, the moment he knew, or suspected that this was a result of derivatives trading going on, he wouldn't have cared whether the rates were representative or not, he would have straightaway said: 'Well, this is against the rules. I need to investigate.' ""It's absolutely in complete contrast to the rulings made by the court, to the evidence given at my trial."" The BBC offered John Ewan an opportunity to comment but has received no response. At a later trial in early 2017Mr Ewan acknowledged under cross-examinationit was legitimate to set Libor with commercial interests in mind within the range of high or low rates that were ""representative"" of offers in the market. The defendants in that trial were acquitted. Mr Hayes has filed an application, running to more than 2,300 pages, currently being considered by the CCRC, the body set up to review miscarriages of justice. In it he also questions why key evidence of Bank of England involvement in ""rigging"" Libor was not disclosed at his trial. In 2017, the BBC discovered a secret recording implicating the Bank of England in rigging Libor in 2007 and 2008, pressuring banks to under-state what they were paying to borrow cash - a practice known as ""low-balling"", for which banks have been fined.It prompted MPs to call for an ""immediate inquiry"". ""Unfortunately some of that evidence was not actually in front of my jury,"" Mr Hayes said. ""But there was no desire to go after the real story here, which was the low-balling story - which was the submission of false and inaccurate rates - because it was just easier for everyone to go after the traders. At the time it was expedient that, for political reasons, a banker went to prison and I was that banker. I was given an egregious sentence and my life destroyed."" In 2019, after noting evidence of Bank of England involvement in manipulating Libor, a senior New York judge, Colleen McMahon, gave former Deutsche Bank trader Gavin Black and supervisor Matt Connolly, both convicted by a jury of manipulating Libor, light sentences of ""home confinement"". ""At certain times, such as during the height of the 2008 financial crisis, submissions were actually being manipulated at the request of the Bank of England,"" Judge McMahon stated in her sentencing remarks. She later added: ""I'm always uncomfortable when I'm asked in any context - it usually happens in the drug context - to sentence the low man on the totem pole while the big guy goes free."" The Bank of England has said Libor was not regulated in the UK at the time. The SFO maintained throughout Mr Hayes' trial and subsequent trials between 2016 and 2019 of traders at Barclays and Deutsche Bank that it was investigating low-balling and would pursue the evidence ""as high as it went"". However in December 2019, itshut down its investigation into low-balling. In a short statement, the SFO said: ""Tom Hayes was found guilty by a jury of manipulating the Libor benchmark, and the Court of Appeal upheld Tom Hayes' conviction.""

John Lewis considers closing more storesThe department store giant may close another eight stores in a further blow for the High Street.Business,"John Lewis is considering more store closures as it tries to cut costs and adapt to the boom in online shopping. In what would be another blow for the High Street, the BBC understands up to eight department stores may remain permanently closed. That would be on top of the eight stores it shut last year, which included two small travel hub shops at Heathrow and St Pancras. That could leave it with 34 stores, down from its current total of 42. John Lewis has declined to comment on the potential move,which was first reported by the Sunday Times,external. Any closures would be another blow to the high street and town centres, which are already grappling with the fall-out from the collapse of Debenhams and Sir Philip Green's Arcadia empire. The rise in internet shopping, exacerbated by various lockdown measures amid coronavirus, has forced John Lewis to rethink how many stores it needs. It already expects up to 70% of its sales will be online by 2025. In July last year, John Lewis announced it was closing its stores in Birmingham, Croydon, Watford, Newbury, Swindon and Tamworth, as well as the smaller hubs at St Pancras and Heathrow, with the loss of 1,300 jobs. In January, John Lewis said its Christmas trading had been better than anticipated and that it expected its full year profits to be ahead of its previous guidance of a small loss or a small profit. 2,450 jobs lost as Dorothy Perkins sold to Boohoo Thousands of jobs at risk after Asos Arcadia deal Any announcement on further store closures could come next month, when the John Lewis Partnership, which includes Waitrose, announces its annual results on 11 March. The last set of results showed a half-year loss of Â£635m, and prompted it to cancel its annual staff bonus for the first time since 1953. The shutting of more John Lewis stores would be another blow for the High Street, which has seen the closure of a number of so-called anchor brands - big names that attract shoppers and other shops to the area. Topshop, part of Sir Philip Green's failed Arcadia empire, and Debenhams have been among the high profile casualties of the shift of retailing online. Earlier this month, online fashion retailer Asos bought Topshop and other Arcadia brands Topman and Miss Selfridge out of administration. And Boohoo, another fast-growing online retailer, bought Arcadia brands Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton. Neither deal included the shops. 2,450 jobs lost as Dorothy Perkins sold to Boohoo John Lewis suspends click and collect due to virus Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

"PM to unveil 'cautious' England lockdown exit planAll schools are expected to reopen on 8 March, with some outdoor socialising allowed from 29 March.UKComments","This video can not be played Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi outlined some lockdown-easing measures in England All schools in England are to reopen on 8 March as part of the prime minister's ""cautious"" four-part plan to lift the coronavirus lockdown. Boris Johnson will share his finalised roadmap with ministers later, before unveiling it to MPs and then leading a news conference at 19:00 GMT. Up to six people or two households will be allowed to meet outdoors from 29 March, the vaccines minister said. Rules will be lifted in stages and four conditions must be met at each stage. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the prime minister would set out more details on the plan in a Commons statement, which is expected at around 15:30. The first stage of easing will be split into two parts: From 8 March -All schools will open with outdoor after-school sports and activities allowed. Recreation in a public space - such as a park - will be allowed between two people, meaning they would be allowed to sit down for a coffee, drink or picnic From 29 March -Outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be allowed. It is understood this will include gatherings in private gardens. Outdoor sports facilities such as tennis or basketball courts will reopen andorganised adult and children's sport, such as grassroots football, will also return Although schools are set to reopen to all pupils on 8 March, it is thought a few days' flexibility may be built in to allow measures like testing to be put in place. Also on 8 March, new rules will alloweach care home resident in England to have one regular visitor, with whom they can hold hands. And from 29 March it is also understood that people will once again be able to travel out of their areas - although guidance will likely still recommend staying local, and overnight stays will not be permitted. The gap between each stage of restrictions being eased is expected to be five weeks, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. It comes aschildren aged three to seven in Wales return to the classroom, along with some students on practical college courses. Scotland's youngest pupils are also returning to face-to-face teachingin the first step of the phased reopening of schools there. Meanwhile, vaccination has had a significant impact on the risk of serious illness from Covid-19,analysis by Public Health Scotland shows. Figures for England are expected later. What time will lockdown changes be announced? How risky are the routes out of lockdown? Gym boss: 'We are burning through about Â£500,000 a day' 'Reckless' if all pupils back 8 March, say unions Data will be used to inform ""every step"" of lifting restrictions, Mr Johnson said. ""We will be cautious about this approach so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far and the sacrifices each and every one of you has made to keep yourself and others safe,"" he added. The roadmap will outline four steps for easing restrictions. But before proceeding to each next step, the government will examine the data to assess the impact of previous changes. The four conditions that must be met at each phase of lockdown easing are: The coronavirus vaccine programme continues to go to plan Evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently reducing the number of people dying with the virus or needing hospital treatment Infection rates do not risk a surge in hospital admissions New variants of the virus do not fundamentally change the risk of lifting restrictions Downing Street said the four tests are currently being met so the first step of lockdown easing in England will proceed as planned on 8 March. The first stage of easing restrictions will be across the whole of England, Downing Street added, due to the current uniform spread of the virus. MPs will be given the chance to vote on the regulations enabling England's roadmap in the coming weeks. Sir Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said the government needed ""flexibility"" if infections levels dropped more quickly than expected. ""You can't have a timeline and say you you're going to be data driven. You can either have one or the other,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. The rules of combat are beginning to change. No longer is controlling infection and keeping R below 1 seen as the be-all and end-all. That much is clear from the government's four tests for its roadmap to lift lockdown in England. Infection rates are only being seen as a problem if they risk a surge in hospital admissions. The reasons for that change can be found from the early results published on the UK vaccination programme. Scottish researchers have found a ""spectacular"" reduction in the risk of serious illness four weeks after the first dose of the vaccine is given. The link between infections and serious illness is being broken. That is not to say a surge in infections can or will be tolerated - the number of Covid patients in hospital is still only just below where it was in the first peak and not all vulnerable people have been vaccinated yet. But it does give ministers some room for manoeuvre. That is important. Schools are not seen as a significant driver of infection, but reopening them for all could push infection levels up. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted the prime minister ""to learn the lessons of the last two lockdowns"" when ""he came out too quickly"". He told LBC that with restrictions in place for longer, businesses ""desperately"" needed more support, including the extension of business rates relief and VAT cuts for the hospitality sector. All four UK nations have been in lockdown for weeks, after hospitals were put under unprecedented pressure due to the rapid spread of a variant of the virus, first detected in Kent. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidScotlandwould return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. She added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. InWales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of restrictions being eased in time for Easter. A review of current measures will take place on 18 March. Pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to threewill return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school. Children of key workers and vulnerable pupils have been able to attend school in all parts of the UK throughout the lockdown. On Sunday,Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""early data"" suggesting a reduction in transmission of the virus in people who have had a vaccine, adding that hospital admissions were falling ""much more sharply"" than they were in the pandemic's first wave. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the number of people in hospital - currently around 18,000 - was still ""far too high"". Sir David Spiegelhalter, professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge, said the data on factors like hospital admissions and deaths were ""extremely positive"" and ""better than people would have predicted"". However, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government would need to ""keep in reserve"" the option of using local measures to tackle outbreaks because of the big difference in infection rates in different parts of the country.

"'We are burning through about Â£500,000 a day'The owner of PureGym says lockdown has been costing his business hundreds of thousands of pounds a day.BusinessComments","Lockdown has been costing budget gym franchise PureGym hundreds of thousands of pounds a day, the company's boss has said. ""We are burning about Â£500,000 a day and that's the average over eight months of closure,"" Humphrey Cobbold toldthe BBC's Today programme. It has meant about Â£120m of costs with no revenue for his 275 gyms, he says. He is among business leaders who will carefully study Prime Minister Boris Johnson's plan to re-open the economy. Mr Johnson will share his finalised roadmap with ministers later, before unveiling it to MPs and then leading a news conference at 19:00 GMT. It is speculated that businesses branded as non-essential may not open until as late as May. PM to unveil 'cautious' England lockdown exit plan When will lockdown rules change? Hospitality 'needs more notice' on lockdown easing ""It's been brutally tough,"" said Mr Cobbold of the period under lockdown. While the government furlough scheme has been paying a portion of staff salaries, he said his business has still been paying some staff costs such as pension contributions and has amassed sizeable rent arrears. Mr Cobbold says he has been able to raise funds from investors, which has helped the business survive, and he insists that his business is ready to re-open safely. ""The sooner the better within safe operating procedures for us,"" he said. ""We can make a massive contribution to the health of the nation"" However, he says his and other firms have learned the hard way that government plans can come late and can be changed. ""I've learned over the last year not to make too many assumptions,"" he said. Ralph Findlay, chief executive of pub chain Marston's, says he would also like to see a route out of the restrictions, since for pubs like his, they mean operating at a loss. ""For many businesses, operating with restrictions is very difficult,"" he told the Today programme. ""We did open last year - it's not as if we haven't done this before."" The severity of lockdown for pubs means ""sadly it's inevitable"" that some pubs will not be able to re-open, he said. ""As a sector we have had no income for nine months and we are still incurring costs,"" he said. There are economic reasons to open pubs as well as social ones, he said. The industry employs millions of people, and Marston's generates about Â£500m a year for the government  including direct and indirect taxes, he added. On Monday, rival pub chain Mitchells and Butlers also revealed more of the scale of the challenges it faces. The chain, which runs outlets including Harvesters, O'Neill's and All Bar One, said it was burning through Â£30-35m a month. It said sales between the end of September and 16 January were 69.8% below last year. It said it had agreed a temporary break from paying into its staff pension funds. It is now in the process of trying to raise Â£351m from investors. Phil Urban, the company's chief executive, said: ""M&B was a high performing business coming into the pandemic... we have every confidence that we can emerge in a strong competitive position once current restrictions are lifted. ""The hospitality industry has done everything that has been asked of it to date and, now that the vaccines are being rolled out and infections are dropping, we are hopeful that pubs and restaurants will soon be allowed to re-open safely so that we can start to serve our customers again.""

More than half of UK firms plan to hire new staff,"More than half of UK employers intend to recruit staff in the next three months, according to new research. The human resources body, the CIPD, said it was the first positive signs for employment prospects it had seen in a year. About 56% of 2,000 firms surveyed planned to hire in the first three months of 2021. The sectors with the strongest hiring intentions include healthcare, finance and insurance, education and ICT. ""Our findings suggest that unemployment may be close to peak and may even undershoot official forecasts, especially given the reported fall in the supply of overseas workers,"" said Gerwyn Davies from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which carried out the survey with recruitment firm Adecco. The survey also found that the number of firms planning to make redundancies in the first quarter of 2021 dropped from 30% to 20%, compared with the previous three-month period. Fewest firms planning job cuts since Covid began How high could the unemployment rate go? Temporary jobs for UK workers 'surge in December' The most recent unemployment rate - for September to November - was 5%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is an increase of 0.6% over the previous three months, and means that 1.72 million people were unemployed. There were 819,000 fewer workers on UK company payrolls in November than at the start of the pandemic, ONS figures show. According to figures released by the Insolvency Service in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request,some 292 British employers made plans to cut jobs in January, the lowest figure since the pandemic began. Hospitality was the worst hit sector, accounting for a third of the job losses, followed by retail. Only 36% of hospitality employers were intending to recruit new staff, the CIPD and Adecco found. The government's furlough scheme, which is meant to end on 30 April, has slowed down the number of redundancies. Nearly 10 million people were furloughed,externalbetween the start of the scheme and 13 December (the latest date for which figures are available). The scheme has enabled many businesses to keep their staff by furloughing them instead of making them redundant. However, the body for HR professionals cautioned that it could not rule out further private sector redundancies if the government does not extend the furlough scheme to the end of June, or if the British economy were to suffer any further ""shocks"". ""It would be hugely counterproductive if the government's financial support faltered, while some of the biggest sectors of the UK economy are still in survival mode,"" said Mr Davies.

Flood prevention 'should be national priority',"The River Usk burst its banks, affecting roads in Crickhowell and nearby Llangattock in Powys Nowhere near enough money is being invested in flood prevention in Wales, the leader of Plaid Cymru has said. Homes were evacuated and roads were closedas some areas saw a month's worth of rain within 24 hours. A pub owner in Powys said his pub was flooded on Saturday - a year after it suffered more than Â£400,000 worth of damageduring Storm Dennis. The Welsh Government said it had invested more than Â£390m to manage flood risk in the past five years. Adam Price said the ""severity and frequency"" of flooding events ""should convince us all that flooding needs to become a strategic national priority"". Howard Baker, owner of the Bridge End Inn in Crickhowell, said the pub was flooded for the 30th time in 22 years at the weekend. The pub, which sits on the banks of the River Usk, was gutted during Storm Dennis last February. ""It's taken us a year to get the pub back to where it was and this flood has taken it all out apart from the top floor,"" he toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""We have just spent 12 months and a lot of insurance money on doing it up, and now we are back to stage one again."" All three floors of the Bridge End Inn in Crickhowell, Powys, were damaged by floods during Storm Dennis last year Mr Baker said his insurance company has told him it would cover the costs of repairing the latest damage - estimated at between Â£20,000 and Â£30,000 - but would not cover him for flooding when it is time to renew his policy. He added: ""It's devastating. With these floods that are happening, when you lose your home, it's terrible. When you lose your business, it's terrible, but to lose two of them in one go, it's heart-breaking."" Gary Rees employs 12 people at his lorry repair garage in Llanybydder, Carmarthenshire, which was flooded during Storm Callum in 2018, and had come ""within an inch"" of being flooded again on Saturday. He said insurance costs for his business had shot up to Â£30,000 since the floods in 2018. ""Had that flood come in, I would have had no alternative but to close the garage and pack it in,"" he said. The Quay Centre community hub sits on the bank of the River Towy in Carmarthen In an interview with BBC Radio Cymru's Dros Frecwast, Mr Price said: ""On the evidence of the last few days, once again, the fact that the severity and the frequency of these flooding events should I think convince all of us that flooding needs to become a strategic national priority. ""And in particular, we are investing nowhere near what is necessary to provide the level of resilience that is required to our communities. ""We need urgency in terms of getting from where we are now to providing the level of investment that for example theNational Infrastructure Commission,externalhas recommended."" Parts of the Tywi Valley, near Capel Dewi in Carmarthenshire, were flooded Welsh Conservative member of the Senedd (MS) Janet Finch-Saunders said: ""Once again Wales is being hit by flooding, with people's homes and businesses being devastated, and yet very little has happened since the major floods last year to prevent or reduce their impact. ""The Welsh Government has had responsibility to protect communities from flooding for 20 years and yet year after year communities continue to be blighted. ""We need action not words to prevent flooding in the future."" Their calls come after 5in (127.6mm) of rain fell at Llyn-y-Fan, Carmarthenshire, between 06:00 on Friday and 08:00 on Saturday, and 4.5in (115mm) at Treherbert in Rhondda Cynon Taf. That compares to an average rainfall of 3.9in (98mm) for the whole of February in south Wales. One year ago, communities across the south Wales valleys weredevastated by floods caused by Storm Dennis. The Welsh Government said: ""We know major flooding incidents are devastating for communities. ""Between 2016 and 2021, Welsh Government invested more than Â£390m in helping manage flood risk."" The River Cynin bursts its banks at St Clears It said it would ""continue to pro-actively manage and respond to flood risk across Wales"" in line with its newNational Strategy for Flood and Coastal Erosion Risk Management,external.

Youngest pupils return as Scotland's schools reopenSchools across the country have been closed to the vast majority of pupils since December.Scotland,"P1 pupils Grace Lee (left) and classmate Grace McKeeman, both aged five, arrive for their first day back at Inverkip Primary School Scotland's youngest pupils are returning to the classroom for the first time since the Christmas break. It is stage one in a phased reopening of schools which have been closed to all but a minority of pupils since the beginning of January. Education Secretary John Swinneyinsisted ""detailed clinical analysis"" assured him it is safe. But concerns have been raised about the measures in place to reduce risk of transmission. How will the phased return to school work? Youngest pupils to return to Scotland's classrooms Covid: Are teachers more at risk of dying? Mr Swinney told BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandthat case prevalence data would be closely monitored to determine the impact of the phase one return. But he said Scotland would not be following England, where all pupils aredue to return to school on 8 March. Asked if it would be ""dangerous"" to send everyone back on that date, Mr Swinney said: ""I wouldn't have clinical authorisation to do that."" The deputy first minister added: ""We will move as quickly as we possibly can do but we have to do it within the scientific and clinical advice that is available to us."" Mr Swinney also urged parents to act responsibly during the first phase of lockdown easing. He added: ""The biggest threat to the opening of schools is not outbreaks in schools. It is community transmission."" Epidemiologist Dr Deepti Gurdasani told BBC Scotland at the weekend there was some evidence from England that younger children could bring infections back into homes. But Prof Devi Sridhar, chairwoman of global public health at Edinburgh University, said the return of schools was about balancing the ""risks and benefits"". She told BBC Good Morning Scotland: ""There will likely be cases emerging in schools over the next few weeks but the vast majority of schools should be fine, and that we have to keep perspective on."" She said the majority of scientific evidence was that there is an ""age gradient"" in infections - with very few outbreaks in nurseries but with teenagers and university students much more prone to infection. Prof Sridhar added: ""I think what we have to do is work back up through that gradient. We are doing that starting with primaries and early years - the approach Denmark has also taken."" On Sunday the deputy first minister pointed todocuments prepared by a government expert advisory group,externalwhich states that younger children are less likely to catch or pass on the virus than older children and adults.

As well as the youngest children returning to school, a small number of senior secondary pupils will be allowed into school buildings on a part-time basis to complete work for national qualifications. Other age groups will continue to learn from home and it is unlikely they will return to the classroom before 15 March at the earliest. In primary schools measures to minimise the spread of the virus include regular hand-washing, open windows, and 2m physical distancing between adults, and between adults and children. Staff will also be offered regular lateral flow tests. Resources to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown. BBC Bitesize Learning at Home Primary school programmes on iPlayer Secondary school programmes on iPlayer Learn at BBC Scotland collection Prof Jason Leitch, the national clinical director, has written to parents asking them to play their part in the safe return. He urged them to: wear a face covering at drop off and pick up times, and in congested areas limit drop off and pick up times to one adult keep 2m away from other adults when waiting for children avoid car shares and limit use of public transport be vigilant for symptoms of coronavirus in the household and follow the Test and Protect guidance. Appealing to parents not to relax the rules elsewhere, he reminded them that indoor play dates are not allowed  - though children can play together outside. And he said parents should continue to work from home if they are able to do so. Mr Swinney's safety assurance came after an epidemiology expert raised concerns about the knock-on effects of sending children back to school. Dr Deepti Gurdasani, of Queen Mary University of London, said data from England showed primary school children were two times more likely to be the first Covid case in a household, and once infected were two times more likely to infect their contacts. Speaking to BBC Scotland'sThe Sunday Show, she said children aged six and above should wear masks in schools and more attention should be paid to ventilation. The EIS teaching union has also raised concerns about school safety and have said a blended learning model - with about half of pupils in classes at any one time - would be more appropriate.

"PM to unveil 'cautious' England lockdown exit planAll schools are expected to reopen on 8 March, with some outdoor socialising allowed from 29 March.UK","This video can not be played Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi outlined some lockdown-easing measures in England All schools in England are to reopen on 8 March as part of the prime minister's ""cautious"" four-part plan to lift the coronavirus lockdown. Boris Johnson will share his finalised roadmap with ministers later, before unveiling it to MPs and then leading a news conference at 19:00 GMT. Up to six people or two households will be allowed to meet outdoors from 29 March, the vaccines minister said. Rules will be lifted in stages and four conditions must be met at each stage. Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the prime minister would set out more details on the plan in a Commons statement, which is expected at around 15:30. The first stage of easing will be split into two parts: From 8 March -All schools will open with outdoor after-school sports and activities allowed. Recreation in a public space - such as a park - will be allowed between two people, meaning they would be allowed to sit down for a coffee, drink or picnic From 29 March -Outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households will be allowed. It is understood this will include gatherings in private gardens. Outdoor sports facilities such as tennis or basketball courts will reopen andorganised adult and children's sport, such as grassroots football, will also return Although schools are set to reopen to all pupils on 8 March, it is thought a few days' flexibility may be built in to allow measures like testing to be put in place. Also on 8 March, new rules will alloweach care home resident in England to have one regular visitor, with whom they can hold hands. And from 29 March it is also understood that people will once again be able to travel out of their areas - although guidance will likely still recommend staying local, and overnight stays will not be permitted. The gap between each stage of restrictions being eased is expected to be five weeks, according to BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg. It comes aschildren aged three to seven in Wales return to the classroom, along with some students on practical college courses. Scotland's youngest pupils are also returning to face-to-face teachingin the first step of the phased reopening of schools there.

Gym boss: 'We are burning through about Â£500,000 a day' 'Reckless' if all pupils back 8 March, say unions Data will be used to inform ""every step"" of lifting restrictions, Mr Johnson said. ""We will be cautious about this approach so that we do not undo the progress we have achieved so far and the sacrifices each and every one of you has made to keep yourself and others safe,"" he added. The roadmap will outline four steps for easing restrictions. But before proceeding to each next step, the government will examine the data to assess the impact of previous changes. The four conditions that must be met at each phase of lockdown easing are: The coronavirus vaccine programme continues to go to plan Evidence shows vaccines are sufficiently reducing the number of people dying with the virus or needing hospital treatment Infection rates do not risk a surge in hospital admissions New variants of the virus do not fundamentally change the risk of lifting restrictions Downing Street said the four tests are currently being met so the first step of lockdown easing in England will proceed as planned on 8 March. The first stage of easing restrictions will be across the whole of England, Downing Street added, due to the current uniform spread of the virus. MPs will be given the chance to vote on the regulations enabling England's roadmap in the coming weeks. Sir Charles Walker, the vice-chair of the 1922 Committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said the government needed ""flexibility"" if infections levels dropped more quickly than expected. ""You can't have a timeline and say you you're going to be data driven. You can either have one or the other,"" he told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme. The rules of combat are beginning to change. No longer is controlling infection and keeping R below 1 seen as the be-all and end-all. That much is clear from the government's four tests for its roadmap to lift lockdown in England. Infection rates are only being seen as a problem if they risk a surge in hospital admissions. The reasons for that change can be found from the early results published on the UK vaccination programme. Scottish researchers have found a ""spectacular"" reduction in the risk of serious illness four weeks after the first dose of the vaccine is given. The link between infections and serious illness is being broken. That is not to say a surge in infections can or will be tolerated - the number of Covid patients in hospital is still only just below where it was in the first peak and not all vulnerable people have been vaccinated yet. But it does give ministers some room for manoeuvre. That is important. Schools are not seen as a significant driver of infection, but reopening them for all could push infection levels up. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he wanted the prime minister ""to learn the lessons of the last two lockdowns"" when ""he came out too quickly"". He told LBC that with restrictions in place for longer, businesses ""desperately"" needed more support, including the extension of business rates relief and VAT cuts for the hospitality sector. All four UK nations have been in lockdown for weeks, after hospitals were put under unprecedented pressure due to the rapid spread of a variant of the virus, first detected in Kent. The devolved nations have the power to set their own restrictions. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saidScotlandwould return to a tiered system of restrictions when lockdown measures are eased, meaning different parts of the country could be under different rules. She added that she would set out the likely phases for a gradual lifting of restrictions on Tuesday. InWales, First Minister Mark Drakeford said he hopes the ""stay-at-home"" requirement could end within three weeks, with some non-essential shops and hairdressers possibly reopening at the same time. Northern Ireland's health minister has played down the prospect of restrictions being eased in time for Easter. A review of current measures will take place on 18 March. Pre-school, nursery and pupils in primaries one to threewill return to classrooms in Northern Ireland on 8 March. After two weeks, they will resume remote learning so older pupils in years 12 to 14 can go back to school. Children of key workers and vulnerable pupils have been able to attend school in all parts of the UK throughout the lockdown. On Sunday,Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there was ""early data"" suggesting a reduction in transmission of the virus in people who have had a vaccine, adding that hospital admissions were falling ""much more sharply"" than they were in the pandemic's first wave. But he told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show that the number of people in hospital - currently around 18,000 - was still ""far too high"". Sir David Spiegelhalter, professor of statistics at the University of Cambridge, said the data on factors like hospital admissions and deaths were ""extremely positive"" and ""better than people would have predicted"". However, he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the government would need to ""keep in reserve"" the option of using local measures to tackle outbreaks because of the big difference in infection rates in different parts of the country.

Bitcoin keeps hitting new highs after Tesla backing,"Much talked-about cryptocurrency Bitcoin has continued to hit record highs having broken through $50,000 (Â£35,700) last week. On Sunday, Bitcoin hit another peak rising above $58,000 as it continues its strong momentum this year. The cryptocurrency has risen more than 90% since the start of January, pushing its total market value above $1tn. The recent spike has been fuelled by Tesla and other big companies accepting it as payment. However, Bitcoin has a track record of wild price swings and has fallen sharply a number of times since it was created in 2009. Bitcoin hits new record of $50,000 Man has two guesses to unlock bitcoin fortune Bitcoin consumes 'more electricity than Argentina' Bitcoin started the year at roughly $28,900, according to figures from cryptocurrency news site CoinDesk. When it broke through the $40,000 mark in early January, it triggered a downward trend that saw it drop to around $30,000 by the end of the month. However, having passed $50,000 on 16 February, it has continued its upward momentum breaking through $58,000 on Sunday. The Bitcoin rally has been largely spurred on by well-known companies adopting it as a method of payment. Elon Musk revealed last week his electric carmaker Tesla had bought $1.5bn worth of Bitcoin and would be accepting it as payment for its cars in future. Mastercard also plans to accept certain cryptocurrencies as a form of payment while BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is exploring ways it can use the digital currency. ""Who's next and what will tip (Bitcoin) over the edge and trigger the next surge?"" said Craig Erlam, an analyst at New York-based foreign-exchange firm Oanda. The Covid-19 pandemic has also played its part in Bitcoin's price rise, as more people go online for shopping, moving further away from physical coins and notes. But critics have argued Bitcoin is less of a currency and more of a speculative trading tool that is open to market manipulation. Prominent economist and Bitcoin critic Nouriel Roubini has said it has very little practical use and doesn't provide a steady income like a bond or a share. This video can not be played Bitcoin explained: How do cryptocurrencies work? ""Elon Musk may be buying it but that doesn't mean everyone else should follow suit,"" he tweeted recently. Novice investors still need to be aware of the risks involved said Matt Dixon, founder of cryptocurrency rating platform Evai. Talking about January's slide from $40,000 to $30,000 in a matter of weeks, he said: ""Though undoubtedly panic-inducing for the uninitiated, this isn't anything particularly remarkable for long-term holders. ""New investors need to ensure their hands remain steady to avoid any undue loss from Bitcoin's regular shakeouts. The upside potential may be vast, but the risks can be just as high."" Kurt Wuckert is a long-term Bitcoin investor having stumbled upon it in 2012, when he accepted it as payment for a small side project. Kurt Wuckert received his first bitcoins in 2012 ""I agreed to accept the Bitcoins fully expecting them to be some kind of video game tokens or something, but decided to be cool about it. Then I got to reading about it online and doing my own research."" Since then, he has been regularly investing in the cryptocurrency and considers himself an ""investor in the more proper sense"". But he warns others to do their research first before jumping onto the Bitcoin rollercoaster. ""To this day, I tell curious friends to set aside their beer money but not their rent money because it is what I have always done.""

China tea shop apologises for sexist merchandise,"The popular beverage Chain referred to women as a 'bargain' A popular Chinese beverage chain has apologised for using sexist slogans on its merchandise, after they sparked widespread outrage online. Sexy Tea shop had referred to women as a ""bargain"" on one of its mugs, adding that customers could pick up women while waiting for their drinks. The shop had in the past also sold tea bags with the slogan ""Master, I want you"" along with images of tadpoles. The shop later said it had no intention of ""disrespecting women"". It added that it would recall its latest range of mugs and was ""very ashamed"" of its latest creation. The Sexy Tea shop had recently put out a range of ""Changsha dialect mugs"" - a dialect spoken predominantly in the capital of Hunan province. The chain has a reported 270 outlets there. It printed various local phrases on the mug, including the phrase ""jian lou zi"", which in slang refers to picking up a deal for cheap. It then gives an example of how the phrase can be used, with the sentence: ""When I went to buy bubble tea, there were lots of pretty girls there. If you meet one like this, you can tell your friend - I picked up a bargain"". Make-up wipes ad pulled over victim-blaming claims 'Banshee, shrew': An angry song wants women to be seen A picture of the mug went viral on Chinese social media site Weibo and quickly attracted a barrage of criticism. ""This is vulgar marketing,"" one person on the platform said. ""It's not the phrase itself that is insulting - its the sentence example given by the company,"" another added. ""Didn't anyone in the marketing team see anything wrong with this?"" The beverage chain is popular in China The company later put out a long statement apologising for its interpretation of the phrase. ""We made a very inappropriate sentence that even people in Changsha did not approve of.... we are very ashamed. We have absolutely no intention of disrespecting women,"" it said. ""We will immediately recall the batch of Changsha dialect themed mugs and seriously reflect on this incident."" Users are also pointing out that this is not the first time Sexy Tea has used sexually suggestive phrases in its marketing campaigns. Many pointed out the pictures of tadpoles it had printed on some of its teabags, suggesting that it was used to depict sperm.

More than half of UK employers planning to recruit,"More than half of UK employers intend to recruit staff in the next three months, according to new research. The human resources body, the CIPD, said it was the first positive signs for employment prospects it had seen in a year. About 56% of 2,000 firms surveyed planned to hire in the first three months of 2021. The sectors with the strongest hiring intentions include healthcare, finance and insurance, education and ICT. ""Our findings suggest that unemployment may be close to peak and may even undershoot official forecasts, especially given the reported fall in the supply of overseas workers,"" said Gerwyn Davies from the Chartered Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD), which carried out the survey with recruitment firm Adecco. The survey also found that the number of firms planning to make redundancies in the first quarter of 2021 dropped from 30% to 20%, compared with the previous three-month period. Fewest firms planning job cuts since Covid began How high could the unemployment rate go? Temporary jobs for UK workers 'surge in December' The most recent unemployment rate - for September to November - was 5%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). That is an increase of 0.6% over the previous three months, and means that 1.72 million people were unemployed. There were 819,000 fewer workers on UK company payrolls in November than at the start of the pandemic, ONS figures show. According to figures released by the Insolvency Service in response to a BBC Freedom of Information request,some 292 British employers made plans to cut jobs in January, the lowest figure since the pandemic began. Hospitality was the worst hit sector, accounting for a third of the job losses, followed by retail. Only 36% of hospitality employers were intending to recruit new staff, the CIPD and Adecco found. The government's furlough scheme, which is meant to end on 30 April, has slowed down the number of redundancies. Nearly 10 million people were furloughed,externalbetween the start of the scheme and 13 December (the latest date for which figures are available). The scheme has enabled many businesses to keep their staff by furloughing them instead of making them redundant. However, the body for HR professionals cautioned that it could not rule out further private sector redundancies if the government does not extend the furlough scheme to the end of June, or if the British economy were to suffer any further ""shocks"". ""It would be hugely counterproductive if the government's financial support faltered, while some of the biggest sectors of the UK economy are still in survival mode,"" said Mr Davies.

"Huge crowds mourn woman killed in Myanmar protestsMya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot just before her 20th birthday, during rallies against a military coup.","This video can not be played Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot in the head just before her 20th birthday by security forces Huge crowds in Myanmar's capital Nay Pyi Taw have attended the funeral of a young woman killed in protests against a military coup. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing was shot in the head just before her 20th birthday, the first of at least three people to die in the protests. On Sunday, thousands lined the streets to honour her, some making the three-fingered salutes used by demonstrators. The military overthrew the elected government earlier this month. Promises to hold early elections have failed to satisfy demonstrators, who are also seeking the release of the elected leader Aung San Suu Kyi and other members of her National League for Democracy (NLD) party. The military alleges the NLD's landslide election win last year was fraudulent but has not provided proof. Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? How Facebook became the 'digital tea shop' The shooting of a young protester Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing, a supermarket worker, was injured when police tried to disperse protesters earlier this month. She was kept on life support for 10 days but died on Friday. She has become a focal point for demonstrators, with her image often displayed by people resisting the coup. Her coffin was driven through the streets in a black and gold hearse, accompanied by hundreds of motorbikes. Protesters took to the streets across the country again on Sunday, despite the previous day seeing the worst violence yet in weeks of protests. Mya Thwe Thwe Khaing's body was driven through the streets of the capital Two protesters were shot dead when police used live ammunition to disperse crowds. The deaths brought widespread condemnation, withUN Secretary General Antonio Guterres,externalsaying: ""The use of lethal force, intimidation & harassment against peaceful demonstrators is unacceptable."" Also on Sunday, the wife of prominent actor Lu Min said he had been arrested after posting a video denouncing the military leadership. The two-week-old civil disobedience movement in Myanmar now has its martyrs - represented in posters, paintings and cartoons at rallies which have continued to take place across the country. Their deaths will inflame public anger against the military government, but remind people too of the cost of resisting it. The plan now is to escalate the daily protests into a nationwide general strike, starting next week. This must damage an economy which is already suffering from the Covid pandemic - but its effect on the generals who seized power is harder to predict. In the early hours of Monday, Myanmar entered its second week of nightly internet shutdowns, monitoring group NetBlocks reported. The junta has been regularly blocking the web to try to stifle mass protests. Earlier, social media giant Facebook deleted a news site run by the military. ""In line with our global policies, we've removed the Tatmadaw True News Information Team Page from Facebook for repeated violations of our Community Standards prohibiting incitement of violence and coordinating harm,"" the company said. This video can not be played From blindfolded protests to dressing like Aung San Suu Kyi, why creatives are concerning Myanmar's army The site is the main one run by the military, used to issue warnings to protesters and push its allegations about the election results. Facebook is the primary source of information and news in Myanmar. An estimated 22 million of the 54 million people in Myanmar use Facebook. The military's leader Min Aung Hlaing and other top army chiefs are already banned from Facebook over allegations of human rights abuses against Rohingya Muslims. Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948. For much of its modern history it has been under military rule Restrictions began loosening from 2010 onwards, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government led by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, militants from the Rohingya ethnic group attacked police posts, and Myanmar's army and local Buddhist mobs responded with a deadly crackdown, reportedly killing thousands of Rohingya.

"Global response to moonflower bloom 'amazing'Having thousands watch a rare cactus bloom online leaves the team that planted it ""overwhelmed"".","This video can not be played Cambridge moonflower: Time-lapse video captures 'UK first' The team who cared for a rare Amazonian cactus that flowered for just one night have been ""overwhelmed"" by the global response to the bloom. Experts at Cambridge University Botanic Garden believe it is the first time the moonflowerSelenicereus wittiihas bloomed in the UK. Thousands tuned in as the flowering drew close and a YouTube stream has had almost 195,000 views. Glasshouse supervisor Alex Summers said the experience had been ""amazing"". Mr Summers said the flower's scent changed from ""lovely"" to something ""in the realm of public toilets"" The cactus -which normally flowers at night for just 12 hours- caught many of those awaiting the bloom off guardwhen it started to blossom at about 15:00 GMT on Saturday. A webcam had been focused on the single bud for the previous 11 days. Mr Summers said the flower,which was spotted developing in November, had been ""supposed to come out"" at 21:00, ""but plants never read the books"". He said since the bloom, the team had ""been able to record it, pollinate it and share it with as many people as possible"". 'Rotten flesh' flower finally flourishes Botanic garden's plant collection listed online Uni garden shares 'asparagus on steroids' plants However, only the glasshouse's staff have been able to experience its unique scent, which Mr Summers said had ""started off... like honeysuckle or gardenias"", but by morning, had ""slightly altered and we're now in the realm of public toilets"". The bud was spotted developing by the garden's staff in November The plant normally grows high above the Amazonian floodplains by attaching itself to a host plant and flowers at night to attract its two pollinating species of hawkmoth. The delicate petals of the white flower, measuring 11in (28cm) long by 6in (15cm) wide and sitting at a height of 12ft (3.5m) on the plant, started to fade overnight. Thegarden's dedicated moonflower page,externalhas received nearly 205,000 views, from people as far afield as Australia, Finland and Thailand. The moonflower started to bloom in the early afternoon and not at sunset as expected Mr Summers said he thought the interest was due to the cactus usually being ""inaccessible"" where it grows in the ""deepest, darkest Amazon"".
