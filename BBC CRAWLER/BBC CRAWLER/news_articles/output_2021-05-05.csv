Father calls for proof of age on pornography sites,"Mr Dekas is seeking a High Court hearing with a young woman who is also concerned A father and a student campaigner are seeking a High Court hearing to consider whether the government should tighten youngsters' access to porn. Ioannis Dekas and Ava Vakil want the government to implement proof of age for access to pornography promised in the 2017 Digital Economy Act. It comes as new research suggests the majority of 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK have recently seen pornography. The government is currently preparing a new Online Harms Bill. This bill would go further than the Digital Economy Act, giving the watchdog, Ofcom, powers to block access to online services - including social media platforms and search engines - which fail to do enough to protect children. It is expected to be put before Parliament later this year. Online harms law to let regulator block apps in UK Children as young as seven 'stumble' on porn Porn 'desensitising young people' Ioannis Dekas, a father of four sons, became concerned after he found one of his boys had accessed pornography. He said this was a wake-up call for him and his wife as parents, making them confront the potential danger to their son and the impact on them all as a family. ""In the two weeks leading up to this moment, we'd noticed a drastic change in his behaviour, withdrawal, a sense of anger towards his siblings, we could sense frustration in his life."" When he and his wife talked to their son, they found he was under peer pressure to be familiar with the language of porn. ""What I don't often hear is how to deal with this. What happens in your household when this happens? With the availability, it's not a matter of if, but of when."" Mr Dekas wants the government to put in place the age verification requirements set out in part three of the Digital Economy Act - a law that was passed in 2017. However, in 2019, the then Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan said the measures would no longer go ahead, with efforts instead focused on the government's wider Online Harms Bill. But Mr Dekas says that this bill still has to be brought before Parliament, and may be delayed if detailed regulations need to be drawn up. In the meantime, children are being exposed to pornography, he says, when they could be protected using the Digital Economy Act's full powers. Ava Vakil is also calling on the government to enforce age restrictions on porn sites Mr Dekas is bringing the challenge jointly with 20-year-old University of Oxford student Ava Vakil, whose letter about what she described as a culture of sexual violence in some schools went viral online. Ms Vakil told the BBC: ""I think porn is everywhere, and growing up as a young woman I've seen the influence of that. ""I think young men are ingesting pornography online to an extent that people aren't aware of. ""I'm sure everyone, and particularly young women, can look back on so many conversations they've had with boyfriends and male friends and think 100% it was impacted by porn."" The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said it would not be appropriate to comment on legal proceedings. A spokesman said the government was committed to protecting children from harmful content. The legal action comes as research from City, University of London found many teenagers had seen porn. Prof Neil Thurman conducted a survey of more than 1,000 16 and 17-year-olds in the UK, using a panel from the specialist market research company Youthsite. While 63% said they came across porn on social media, 47% said they had also visited porn websites. The research suggests the government's approach of widening the range of legislation to more platforms is right, Prof Thurman said. More worryingly, 46% had used technology that disguises identity when browsing online, such as a virtual private network, and which could allow evasion of age verification. However, Prof Thurman said this was not a reason not to regulate access. ""It doesn't mean we shouldn't bring in legislation,"" he said. ""Firstly I think it would reduce accidental exposure, particularly for younger children and teenagers, and it does send a signal, not present at the moment, that they are accessing something inappropriate for their age group."" Vanessa Morse, head of the Centre to End All Sexual Exploitation, said there was a ""wealth of evidence"" to show that viewing pornography led to harmful sexual attitudes and behaviours. ""The government's own research, which it published this year, showed an association between porn consumption and real world violence against women. It's no surprise considering one in eight porn videos contains sexual violence,"" she said. ""Pornography has made violent acts in sex completely normalised."" A new report by the internet safety body, Internet Matters, looking at children's use of technology during lockdown has found that although the internet had a positive impact on how children learn and socialise, parents also reported a rise in the amount of online harms children experienced. A survey of 2,000 parents in the UK in March this year suggests a 39% increase in the sharing of sexual images among children since January 2020. Psychologist Dr Linda Papadopoulos, ambassador of Internet Matters, says ""as children have come to rely on technology more than ever during the pandemic, and therefore spending sometimes several hours a day online, it also gives them increased exposure to all of the risks that go with it.""

US backs waiver on vaccine patents to boost supply,"The US has thrown its support behind a move at the World Trade Organization (WTO) to temporarily lift patent protections for coronavirus vaccines. Advocates of the move say it would increase global vaccine production, but drugs manufacturers argue it will not have the desired effect. Critics say it strips financial rewards from cutting-edge drug developers. The decision by US President Joe Biden comes amid pressure from Democrats in his party to remove patent protections. In announcing the new policy, US Trade Representative Katherine Tai said that ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". Ms Tai said the US would now embark on negotiations at the WTO to try to secure the waiver, but warned this could take time. India and South Africa were the leading voices in a group of about 60 countries which for the last six months has been trying to get the patents on vaccines set aside. One hundred of the WTO's 164 states are said to be in favour, and a panel on intellectual property is expected to discuss the issue next month. If approved, supporters say, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthy countries. The countries in favour of the move met with strong opposition from the previous US administration of Donald Trump, the UK and the EU. Mr Biden had proposed a waiver during the 2020 presidential election campaign. How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? Vaccine makers 'should work with poorer countries' Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Intellectual property describes creations, such as inventions, which are protected by patents, copyrights and trademarks. These prevent copying and allow the originator to be financially rewarded. Patents give innovating firms a short-term monopoly on production to cover the costs of development and encourage investment. Biotech firms argue that such protection has provided incentives to produce Covid vaccines in record times. Biden backed a waiver during the 2020 presidential campaign Many developing countries have argued that rules requiring countries to protect patents and other forms of intellectual property are an obstacle to increasing the production of vaccines and other products needed to tackle the pandemic. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, head of the WHO, called the US decision ""historic"" and said it marked ""a monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19"". The medical NGO, MSF - Doctors Without Borders - said the move would ""increase sufficient and timely access to these lifesaving medical tools as Covid-19 continues to ravage countries across the globe."" Calls for a vaccine patent waiver come as lower income countries face acute vaccine shortages. MSF points out that many of the low-income states where it operates ""only received 0.3 percent of global Covid-19 vaccine supply while the US has secured enough doses to protect its entire population"". India, which was shipping vaccines to other countries, has now had to cancel exports as it grapples with surging coronavirus cases and falls behind on its vaccination targets. Indians' desperate wait for Covid jab to get longer But pharmaceutical companies have voiced their opposition to a waiver, insisting that patents are not the primary obstacle, and cautioned that the move could stifle innovation. The head of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Associations, Thomas Cueni, told the BBC's Today programme that technology transfer should not be enforced. ""I'm deeply concerned if you hand this over and allow companies to try to get it done the right way, safe and high quality, you could compromise the quality and safety of vaccines which we see now and it would be disruptive."" He said Western pharmaceutical companies were already sharing technology on a voluntary basis. ""The bottlenecks right now are trade barriers, preventing companies from moving their goods from one country to another. It is shortages and scarcity in the supply chains, which need to be addressed. And it is also right now the disappointing unwillingness of rich countries to early share doses with the poor countries. ""None of this is addressed with the patent waiver."" Dr Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, told the Reuters news agency that the waiver ""amounts to the expropriation of the property of the pharmaceutical companies whose innovation and financial investments made the development of Covid-19 vaccines possible in the first place"". This video can not be played How to tell a Covid-19 vaccine sceptic the facts Nobody is protected until everyone's protected: on that world and business leaders are agreed. But pharmaceutical companies have called the decision by the US to back the sharing of secret recipes for vaccinations short-sighted, claiming it is understanding the production process that is the real challenge, particularly when it comes to the new breed of mRNA vaccines - such as Pfizer and Moderna - as well as the availability of raw materials. It is, they say, akin to handing out a recipe without sharing the method or the ingredients, and could lead to quality issues and less efficient production. Instead, the UK and the EU have favoured a system of licensing, whereby know-how is shared and there is more oversight. It is already being done on some cases on a voluntary basis - such as the tie up between Oxford AstraZeneca and the Serum Institute of India. And that licensing can be made compulsory, although the pharmaceutical companies could then be eligible for compensation. Some trade specialists have speculated that the US might be hoping that, by backing a lifting of patents, manufacturers might be more open to sharing expertise voluntarily - or at least, for a reduced charge. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said ""the EU is also ready to discuss any proposals that address the crisis in an effective and pragmatic manner"". French President Emmanuel Macron has changed his position, now saying he is ""absolutely in favour"". A UK government spokesperson said the UK was ""working with WTO members to resolve this issue"" and was ""in discussions with the US and WTO members to facilitate increased production and supply of Covid-19 vaccines"". The head of the World Health Organization called the US announcement a ""monumental moment"" in the fight against Covid-19. The prospect of a waiver hit shares in the pharmaceutical companies Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax. Some experts say pharmaceutical companies would also need to share know-how, such as production techniques, with poorer countries to have any real beneficial effect. Licensing agreements are another way of boosting production. One of the largest Covid vaccine producers is the Serum Institute of India which manufactures the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab under a licensing agreement with the Anglo-Swedish company.

No full-time return to the office for over a million,"This video can not be played Tara Tomes, of the East Village PR firm, in Birmingham, explains why she's ditching the office Almost all of 50 of the UK's biggest employers questioned by the BBC have said they do not plan to bring staff back to the office full-time. Some 43 of the firms said they would embrace a mix of home and office working, with staff encouraged to work from home two to three days a week. Four firms said they were keeping the idea of hybrid working, working from home some of the time, under review. Currently,people who can work from home are still advised to do so.,external However, that is likely to change in June when the government hopes to end all social distancing restrictions. ""We're never going to go back to working the way we used to work,"" said Mark Read, chief executive of advertising firm WPP. But the new ways of using the office require careful planning, he told the BBC. ""People are working from home three to four days a week so we probably need 20% less space, but we're not going to do that if everyone's working from home on Mondays and Fridays."" Other companies cite ""smart working"" and ""flexibility"" as reasons for introducing hybrid working, with many suggesting that workers would be able to make their own choices about how often they come into the office. Danny Harmer, chief people officer at insurance giant Aviva - which has 16,000 UK workers - said 95% of its workers said they would like to be able to spend some of their time working flexibly and remotely in different locations. But she said the company had to be mindful that many staff appreciate being in an office, such as those who live alone or do not have a suitable place to work. Recruitment firm Adecco, which has 34,000 workers, said about four-fifths of its staff now work remotely. ""Rather than having pre-set rules we are encouraging our leaders to engage with colleagues to implement strategies that work for their business,"" it said. Can I ask to keep working from home? PwC says start when you like, leave when you like The BBC questioned 50 big employers, ranging from banks to retailers, to get an idea of when workers may return to the office. The firms contacted by the BBC covered 1.1 million workers in the UK. Businesses that depend on custom from office workers - such as cafes and restaurants - are keen for them to return as soon as possible. Joao Almeida, from Panda Cup Coffee, relies on office workers for trade ""We rely really heavily on the office trade,"" Joao Almeida, of Panda Cup Coffee in London's Blackfriars, told the BBC. He was one of millions of people unable to work from home during the pandemic. ""There are locations that have 5,000 people, but only 140 come to the building with most working from home or maybe once a week coming in. That makes it really difficult."" Carl Forder, who owns the Pottergate Pantry sandwich shop in Norwich. saw an 80% drop in business when workers, including 5,000 at the nearby Aviva office, were told to work from home where possible. ""We really hope a lot more office workers return to Norwich when it's safe for them to do so. ""It affects a lot of businesses, from the cleaners who clean the offices, right through to coffee shops and sandwich bars. We want that buzz back again."" But in the financial services industry it can be a problem if people work from home, reckons Andrew Monk, chief executive of investment bank VSA Capital. ""People working from home don't realise it but they're gradually getting slower and slower whereas the people in the office aren't,"" he told BBC Radio Five Live. ""In the financial services industry you need to discuss ideas and discuss what's going on. People working from home miss out on an awful lot of the activity in the office because we don't have time to tell them."" But there may not be a deluge of workers returning this month. The companies told the BBC they were opening offices ""in line with government guidance"", which means many plan to reopen offices from 21 June. Some have already reopened their offices to a limited number of workers. Investment firm JP Morgan and recruiter Michael Page allowed workers to return from 29 March, while Adecco, recruiter Hays Group and WPP reopened offices on 12 April. Investment firm Rathbones has allowed workers to return ""if they wish"", subject to a 25% capacity. WPP reopened its UK offices at a 30% capacity, but is increasing that to 50% this month. Goldman tells bankers to return to office in June KPMG's 16,000 UK staff to get more time off work Nationwide tells 13,000 staff to 'work anywhere' Many have given workers the choice, with Michael Page saying staff could return to the office ""should they choose to do so"". But some other companies are delaying their office re-opening plans. Outsourcing giant Capita said workers have been told they will work from home until at least the end of June, while Lloyds Bank has asked staff to stay at home until at least the summer. David Kimberley: ""It's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen."" Tom, who works in property, is not looking forward to going back to the office. The commute is long, expensive, uncomfortable and unnecessary, he told the BBC. ""My office is modern and seemingly comfortable. But the culture can be difficult and the false familiarity is suffocating. It's a petri dish of anxiety and breeding ground of mental health issues."" He says working at home is more comfortable. ""The technology enables a more inclusive mode of working where information is shared more easily and talent can shine. There's also more time for family and more time for real friends."" In contrast, David Kimberley said he ""couldn't wait"". He returned to the stockbroker's office he works at two weeks ago. ""There's something healthy about having a psychological separation between your work and home life. I find that hard to do when I'm working from home,"" he told the BBC. ""There's something quite gloomy, especially in winter, about working from home, and it's depressing waking up and commuting to your kitchen. ""It also makes it much harder to collaborate. I work closely with another member of the team and in the office we can sort things out in seconds, When working from home it can take 10 minutes to get a response, and you have no real idea about how they're feeling as you can't see them to gauge their emotions."" Only a few of the companies surveyed by the BBC have been shutting offices, with some saying they will wait until leases run out. Capita has closed 49 out of 294 of its offices since the start of the pandemic while accountants Deloitte has closed offices at Gatwick, Liverpool, Nottingham and Southampton. Lloyds Bank said it planned to close 20% of its offices over the next three years while NatWest closed its Regent House, London office last summer, in a move that had been planned, but speeded up by the pandemic. Newspaper group Reach has closed its district offices as part of a move to a hub-based model. Meanwhile, Welsh Water closed its head office last year. But not all are keen on the move away from offices. WPP boss Mark Read says he worries about the long-term impact on the company's culture and training. ""Advertising and creative industries are something you learn from your colleagues and you can only do that, really, if you're around them in an office."" Accounting software firm Sage has just opened a new office - planned before the pandemic - which has space for 1,800 people. Sage's chief people officer Amanda Cusdin says that despite using a mix of home and office working going forward, the office will still be needed. ""We know for a lot of people maybe don't have a quiet space to work at home and would rather do it in the office.""

Peloton recalls treadmills after child's death,"Peloton has recalled treadmills in the US and UK over a series of safety issues following investigations by a US watchdog. In the US, 125,000 Tread and Tread+ machines are being recalled after the death of a six-year-old child. The watchdog said they could cause injury or death to adults, children and pets if they get pulled underneath. Tread machines sold in the UK are also being recalled because display consoles could fall off. In addition to the death, Peloton had 72 reports of injuries such as broken bones, cuts and grazes. Peloton boss John Foley said the firm had ""made a mistake"" in not recalling the machines sooner. In March, Peloton warned parents to keep children away from its Tread+ machine after the death of the six-year-old, who was pulled underneath the rear of the treadmill. At the time Mr Foley called it a ""tragic accident"" - one of a ""small handful"" of incidents in which children have been hurt on the firm's exercise equipment. Peloton warning after âtragicâ child death ""I want to be clear, Peloton made a mistake in our initial response to the Consumer Product Safety Commission's request that we recall the Tread+,"" Mr Foleysaid in a statement,externalon Wednesday. ""We should have engaged more productively with them from the outset. For that, I apologise."" The US Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) said that Peloton had voluntarily recalled the Tread+ and Peloton Tread, which posed a safety risk because the display console can fall off. An agreement between the watchdog and Peloton means the firm must stop selling the machines in the US and give a full refund to people who want to return them. Because of the type motor used in the Tread+, the machine needs a higher ground clearance than typical treadmills. Robert Adler, Acting Chairman of the CPSC, said: ""The agreement between CPSC and Peloton is the result of weeks of intense negotiation and effort, culminating in a cooperative agreement that I believe serves the best interests of Peloton and of consumers. ""I would like to thank the CPSC technical staff who have worked tirelessly to protect consumers and to warn the public. Today we have taken steps to prevent further harm from these two products."" The company has yet to respond to a BBC request for clarity over how the recall might affect sales outside the US. However, the PA news agency said a Peloton spokesman confirmed that the recall also related to the Tread in the UK. In the US, the Tread was only sold as part of a limited invitation-only release from about November, 2020 to about March, 2021 and the company's statement said it ""is currently working on a repair to be offered to Tread owners in the coming weeks"". But the statement does not mention Tread repairs outside the US. The touchscreen on the Tread can detach and fall, according to the CPSC. There have been reports of minor injuries such as abrasions, cuts and bruises in the UK and Canada. However, the Tread+ carries a more serious hazard because ""adult users, children, pets and objects can be pulled underneath the rear of the treadmill, posing a risk of injury or death"". Peloton rose to prominence during the pandemic as a premium option for allowing people to exercise from home with live video from trainers, as gyms were forced to close. Shares in the New York-based company tumbled more than 14% after the recall announcement. In addition to the death, there have been about 72 reports of adult users, children, pets and objects being pulled under the rear of the treadmill, including 29 reports of injuries to children such as second and third-degree abrasions, broken bones and lacerations.

You are not allowed to take photos inside a polling station because the Electoral Commission - which oversees UK elections - says it risks the secrecy of the ballot. The punishment for revealing how someone else voted - even accidentally - is a fine of up to Â£5,000, or six months in prison. People are welcome to take photos outside. You can, but voters are advised not to update their social media accounts inside the polling station. The rules for postal voting are different, so voters can share photos of their own postal ballot paper on social media if they wish. Animals, apart from assistance dogs,are not usually allowed in polling stations.,external However, other dogs can be admitted at the discretion of the local authority. The Electoral Commission says there is nothing in law to prevent someone wearing a political slogan when going into a polling station to vote. However, they should leave immediately afterwards, as campaigning inside polling stations is not allowed. Political discussion is banned inside polling stations. Staff will intervene if they hear any references to candidates or parties. Bringing children to the polling station is encouraged, to help educate them about democracy. But children are not allowed to mark your vote on the ballot paper. People who have been drinking or are drunk can vote, unless they are disruptive. Polling station staff can help you, or you can bring someone with you. In England, anyone over the age of 18 can help you cast your vote. They do not need to be eligible to vote in that election. Polling stations should have large-print sample ballot papers and tactile voting devices to help people with visual impairments. You can take your phone into the polling booth to use magnifier or text-to-speech apps, or the phone torch to improve lighting. But you must not take any photos inside the polling station. Voting in UK elections is not compulsory. It is entirely up to you whether or not to vote. Some people deliberately spoil their vote - for example, by writing a message on the ballot paper as a protest. These are recorded, but do not count for or against any candidate. If you sign your ballot and your name is identifiable, the vote does not count. Sometimes ""tellers"" stand outside the polling station and ask voters for the number on their polling card. They are volunteers who work for candidates. They use the information to check who has voted, so they can remind people who have not yet done so. They are allowed to ask for your polling card number, but you do not have to give it to them.

Jeff Bezos sets date for space sightseeing flight,"New Shepard is operated from desert land in West Texas Amazon.com founder Jeff Bezos is now ready to take people into space. The US entrepreneur'sBlue Origin company,externalsays it will launch a crew aboard its New Shepard rocket and capsule system on 20 July. The astronauts are likely to include company personnel, but one seat is being auctioned online. New Shepard's flights are sub-orbital. They're designed to take passengers on a straight up-and-down trip that briefly goes above 100km (62 miles). This is the so-called KÃ¡rmÃ¡n Line, which has been designated by broad international agreement as the starting point of space. ""Only 569 people have ever been over the KÃ¡rmÃ¡n Line. With our New Shepard vehicle, we're about to change that and change it dramatically,"" said Ariane Cornell, Blue Origin's director of astronaut sales. She declined to comment on whether Mr Bezos himself might be on the 20 July flight. Jeff Bezos has big ambitions, with far bigger rockets under development Blue Origin's announcement is further evidence of a resurgence in space tourism after a gap of almost 12 years. Mr Bezos's proposition is just one of several now open to the super wealthy. Rival businessman Elon Musk is expected to launch one of his SpaceX Dragonships in the autumn with an all-civilian crew aboard. It will go orbital; the capsule will stay up for several days. At 18m in height and 4m wide, New Shepard is a fully reusable, vertical takeoff, vertical landing (VTVL) space vehicle. The New Shepard capsule has six seats with large windows It operates from desert land in Van Horn in West Texas. During a flight, the booster unit lifts the pressurised passenger vessel to about 76km in altitude, where the pair then separate. Momentum carries the capsule on upwards into space, before dropping back down to the ground under three parachutes. The booster also comes home in a controlled manner, making a propulsive landing on a concrete pad. Blue Origin is hoping the New Shepard experience will prove a big draw. Passengers will experience about three minutes of weightlessness at the top of the climb. They'll also get to see the blackness of space and Earth's curved horizon. The whole system has gone through several years of rigorous testing For the moment, the company is not discussing future pricing options - just the details of the public auction for one seat on that first mission in two months' time. Blue Origin says the cash raised from this particular sale will go to its foundation that promotes science and technology education. But long-term, the company could expect to earn perhaps $200,000 (Â£143,780) per seat, maybe even more initially. ""This is a nascent market,"" said Ms Cornell. ""We're opening the doors and look forward to seeing what the market says. ""I personally think people are going to see what a cool experience this is and are going to want to do it themselves. And then, as hopefully the prices come down, the scale goes up."" The hope is that ticket prices will eventually fall Throughout the 2000s a number of high-value individuals paid to visit the International Space Station (ISS). But this tourism, organised under the patronage of the Russian space agency, ceased in 2009. Now, it seems, the sector is being rekindled. As well as the initiatives from Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk, British entrepreneur Sir Richard Branson continues to push his Virgin Galactic rocket plane concept. There are also those who want to launch private space stations this decade. Among these is Axiom, a company started by a former Nasa ISS programme manager. Blue Origin's announcement was timed to coincide with the 60th anniversary of the first spaceflight made by an American astronaut - Alan Shepard, in whose honour the new tourist vehicle is named. Alan Shepard conducted a 15-minute sub-orbital flight in his Project Mercury Freedom-7 capsule on 5 May, 1961.

Final day of campaigning in Senedd election race,"The election will decide the make up of the 60-member Senedd Wales' political parties made their final pitches to voters on Wednesday as the Senedd election campaign came to a close. Party leaders campaigned in key seats in north, south and mid Wales. UK Conservative Chancellor Rishi Sunak visited Rhyl in north Wales while Labour leader Mark Drakeford headed to Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price focused on Llanelli while the Welsh Lib Dems' Jane Dodds visited Ystradgynlais. Voting will begin at 07:00 BST on Thursday, with counting not taking place until Friday because of the pandemic. A really simple guide to the Welsh elections How to follow the election results on the BBC Who should I vote for in the Welsh election? Voters will be electing 60 politicians to sit in the Welsh Parliament in Cardiff Bay - known as the National Assembly for Walesuntil last year. They get two votes - one for their constituency, and one for their region. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Mr Price and Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies are challenging Mr Drakeford to take his job as Wales' first minister. Where parties choose to campaign tends to show where they think they could win extra seats or lose them - on Wednesday the Welsh Conservatives returned to north Wales with Rishi Sunak visiting Marine Holiday Park in Rhyl, Vale of Clwyd. Four seats held by Labour in north east Wales were won by the Conservatives at the 2019 UK general election. Rishi Sunak served fish and chips to Welsh Secretary Simon Hart ""If you want to see change that we're bringing across the United Kingdom, if you vote for a Conservative government here in Wales, we'll be able to deliver that change here as well,"" said Mr Sunak on a tightly-controlled visit. BBC Wales asked if the chancellor could see why he was criticised for a decision not to extend job support when the Welsh governmentwanted to hold its firebreak lockdown last autumn. Furlough was extended when England locked down. ""I think at every point during the past 12 months during this crisis, I and the government have acted to protect people in all parts of the United Kingdom,"" Mr Sunak said. ""If you think about things like the furlough scheme, that's protected almost half a million jobs here in Wales, 50,000 businesses have benefited from government-backed loans."" WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford admitted at a campaign event his party was ""battling hard in north Wales"", where the Tories focused their energies on Wednesday. Mr Drakeford visited the Hangfire Southern Kitchen in Barry, in the south Wales constituency of the Vale of Glamorgan. Wales' incumbent first minister Mark Drakeford is on the campaign trail in Barry The seat is held by the Conservatives in the House of Commons, but Labour in the Senedd, and is another constituency the Tories are hoping to gain from Labour. ""We have to restore our bargain with the people of north Wales,"" Mr Drakeford said. Asked if the fact that he had chosen to go to the Vale of Glamorgan suggested he was worried about the seat, he said: ""I'm here because the real contest in this election is between a Labour progressive government for Wales and handing Wales back to London with the Tories."" ""In this constituency, that's exactly the argument that is on the line."" Adam Price (right) visted Castell Howell in the Llanelli constituency Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price said ""every vote will count in constituencies right across Wales"", telling BBC Wales the election was ""going to be won on small margins"". He visited a food wholesaler and processing company at Cross Hands, in the marginal Senedd seat of Llanelli, held by Labour in 2016. ""Our message to people out there is get out and vote them tomorrow, every vote will count,"" he said. ""We have a historic opportunity to elect the first Plaid Cymru government in our history. That will send headlines across the world."" The Covid-19 pandemic has turned our lives upside down over the last year and a bit - and it has done the same for this Senedd election campaign. Pre-Covid, Welsh Labour had been in power for more than two decades and faced a defensive election trying to hold on to a number of marginal seats against opposition parties with the wind in their sails. Before the pandemic struck, few ordinary voters could have picked the Welsh Labour leader, Mark Drakeford, out of a line-up. Some of his own troops had misgivings about fighting an election under his understated, academic style of leadership. Fast forward to April 2021 and a very different political world.

Liberal Democrats William Powell and Jane Dodds campaigned in Ystradgynlais, in the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency Jane Dodds campaigned in Ystradgynlais on Wednesday in the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency - the only seat the party held onto at the 2016 Welsh Assembly election. On the campaign trail she acknowledged she is not going to be the next first minister of Wales. She declined to rule out entering a coalition after the election, but said her primary concern was winning more seats for the Liberal Democrats. Can Labour strike lucky twice in Welsh election? How Covid changed the Welsh election campaign Five things to find out from the Welsh election ""We're hopeful for all the seats that we are going for,"" Ms Dodds said. ""Certainly we want to win Brecon and Radnorshire, but we are looking to get some places in the regional seats as well which we've always done well in."" By Laura McAllister,  Cardiff University's professor of public policy These Senedd elections are not the ones we anticipated and there's a strange contradictory feel to them. It's been a low-key campaign which has scarcely dazzled, yet the results on Friday feel more significant than ever. Small shifts in votes could determine the distribution of seats to parties and therefore the shape of our next Welsh government. Read more from Laura here. This video can not be played In Wales people get two votes when they go to the polls on 6 May this year Meanwhile, the Wales Green Party asked voters to lend their support in the regional vote. The party's deputy leader Amelia Womack said: ""It is long overdue that we in Wales get the Green scrutiny in the Senedd that we deserve."" Abolish The Welsh Assembly's Mark Reckless asked voters not to ""waste their votes on parties which helped give us Brexit, but have had their day now"". ""For over 20 years devolution has only ever gone one way, towards independence,"" he said. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton will be in Torfaen on Wednesday. ""UKIP is presenting voters with a real alternative to Labour who have failed communities like Torfaen,"" a spokesman said. Reform UK said its Welsh leader, Nathan Gill, was campaigning in Conwy. Mr Gill said: ""We need to get out of lockdown now, our children need to allowed to be children, and our businesses need to do what they do best, serve their customers and get the Welsh economy rolling again."" Labour is defending 29 seats from the Welsh Parliament election in 2016 Voters will elect 40 Members of the Senedd (MSs) representing local constituencies, and 20 representing five large regions. Each of the regions elects four MSs. Voters will get two ballots - one to back a candidate in their constituency, and one to back a party or individual in the region. The ballot for the region is decided by a system that picks people more according to their share of the vote. But the system takes into account who has won the constituency seats within that region, and gives parties winning fewer or none of those constituencies a better chance of winning regional ones. That is different to the constituencies, where the candidate with the most votes wins. The party or combination of parties that can command the greatest support in the Senedd after the election will form the next Welsh government.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   By Adrian Browne, BBC Wales political reporter Labour, which has been in charge in Wales since devolution 22 years ago, has been campaigning hard in seats it lost to the Conservatives at the 2019 General Election. For their part, the Tories have been putting in the hours to try to convert those Westminster gains they made into Senedd victories. Wrexham, Vale of Clwyd, Clwyd South and Delyn turned from red to blue in 2019, and it is no surprise both parties have focused much of their attention on these seats this time around. In the south, the Conservatives have hopes of ousting Labour in the Vale of Glamorgan, a seat the Tories have held at Westminster since 2010. Labour is also keen to win back the Rhondda seat captured by Plaid Cymru at the 2016 poll. As well as hoping to prevent that seat from returning to the Labour fold, Plaid is targeting the Labour marginal of Llanelli, which has flipped between the two parties since the dawn of devolution in 1999. Rhondda is among the key seats parties are fighting over at this election Tory-held Aberconwy is also a Plaid Cymru target seat, and the party has also used its campaign to urge voters to chose Plaid in their second vote, with the aim of picking up extra members in the regional seats. The Liberal Democrats are concentrating on keeping their one remaining seat, Brecon and Radnorshire, with the possibility of picking up a regional list seat as compensation if they fail to do so. Meanwhile, Abolish the Welsh Assembly, Reform UK, and the Green Party are hoping to make a breakthrough in those regional votes. UKIP won seven regional seats in 2016, shortly before Wales and the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum. It will be hoping to, at the very least, retain a presence in Cardiff Bay.

Royal Navy to patrol Jersey port amid fishing row,"This video can not be played ""They want talks"": The BBC's Robert Hall is at Jersey's St Helier port Jersey officials are meeting French fishermen, who have been protesting over their post-Brexit rights, in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Two Royal Navy ships and two French vessels are patrolling near Jersey while about 60 French and Jersey boats are at the island's St Helier port. French fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued by the island under a new system. No 10 said the PM has been in contact with Jersey officials over the row. HMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, can be seen from the port, sitting off about a mile from the French boats. HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and not making any effort to intervene. No 10 said it sent the two navy vessels to ""monitor the situation"", while the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French patrol vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety. France has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the UK government. Live updates: Latest on protest in St Helier What's the fishing row about? The boats are protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. French authorities say ""new technical measures"" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". ""It's really important that we are able to work with those fishermen to help them provide the necessary evidence so that, if required, their licences can be amended,"" Senator Ian Gorst, Jersey's external relations minister, told BBC News. ""As I've said, it's important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy."" Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? Jersey fisherman Loic Farnham said of his French counterparts: ""They are professional fishermen, the same as we all are, we'd like to keep it all amicable so we can have access to the markets and they can carry on earning a living in our waters."" An ElysÃ©e source said France was monitoring the situation ""very closely"", adding that it is ""currently calm and we hope that this will remain the case"". ""We want to be able to return to negotiations, that we can obtain the fishing licenses provided for in the agreement."" The maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, were not on military missions. It said the boats' roles were to stay in French waters and to be near to the fisherman in order to ensure safety. A European Commission spokeswoman said talks were continuing with the UK. By Freddie Miller, BBC Jersey political reporter In the darkness you could see the lights from boats slowly making their way from the direction of France towards Jersey. They then all gathered outside the St Helier harbour and they stayed there for about half an hour. At about 06:30 BST they started making their way slowly into the harbour. Flares were set off - red flares, orange flares, burning bright. French flags were being flown, there were banners talking about fishing. Meanwhile, on the pier-side where I am, islanders had gathered - probably about 30 in total, including a couple of police officers. Jersey flags had been hung to the railings of the pier, some were waving flags. There were also some Jersey boats in support of the French, flying both French and Jersey flags, and also a couple that were there trying to stop the French from coming into the harbour. Amidst all of this you've got the two navy vessels in the distance - you can just see the outline shadow of them through the mist, just keeping watch of everything. MEP Stephanie Yon-Courtin, a member of the EU fisheries committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said ""all retaliatory measures will be explored"". Of the threats to cut off electricity to Jersey, she said ""these are only words we are not ready for war"". On Thursday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the two Royal Navy vessels would ""remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure"". A statement from the Jersey government read: ""Diplomatic efforts will continue to resolve the outstanding issues relating to fishing licences and to de-escalate the situation."" HMS Tamar is one of two Royal Navy ships that are off the coast of Jersey Their boats were draped with makeshift banners - which read ""en colÃ¨re""- we are angry,writes BBC Europe correspondent Jean Mackenzie, who was with the fishermen as they set off from the French coast. A handful left this small port on the Normandy coast about 02:30, to be joined by dozens more on the way to Jersey. The fishermen seemed more shocked than angry, that their access to waters they have fished in for decades is being challenged. Under the post-Brexit trade deal, Jersey has to allow European vessels into its waters, but they now need licences - but the fishermen say the permits have come with a long list of restrictions that were never agreed. Reacting to the French maritime minister's threat to cut off Jersey's electricity in retaliation - the fishermen were pleased. ""It's good to know our country is on our side,"" they said HMS Severn is one of the two offshore patrol vessels monitoring Jersey waters Dimitri Rogoff, head of fisheries for the Normandy region, said the boats would not try to block St Helier and would return to France in the afternoon, AFP reported. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the threats were ""completely unreasonable"" and urged the UK government to ""get round the table with French colleagues and authorities in Jersey and sort this issue out"". French fishermen have complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. Jersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats were required to have a licence to operate there. On Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located. But the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that ""were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about"". Chris Le Masurier, who runs Jersey Oyster and Normandy Trader Freight, said the French fisherman were rightly upset by the situation. He said: ""I see it as very much an insult to them and they are extremely upset. The criteria that they were given was to prove they have fished in Jersey waters for 10 days. Nothing about what species were caught, nothing about if you've fished for 20 days or 30 days [and having to] prove that."" But Don Thompson, from the Jersey Fisherman's Association, said affected French crews have ""had since 1 January"" to comply with the new rules and ""perhaps some of the boats that perhaps didn't qualify are a little bit put-out"". Thethreat to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France - was made by French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin on Tuesday. HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which are based in Portsmouth, are each crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines. The ships are routinely used for fisheries protection - with sailors able to board other boats for spot checks.

French threat in fishing row is 'unacceptable',"The Government of Jersey granted 41 licences to French fishing boats on Friday A French government threat to cut off Jersey's electricity over a post-Brexit fishing dispute was ""clearly unacceptable and disproportionate"", the UK government has said. French Maritime Minister Annick Girardinthreatened ""retaliatory measures""over the new licensing regime for fishing in Jersey's waters. About 95% of the island's electricity comes from France via undersea cables. A UK government spokesman said they were working with the EU and Jersey. ""To threaten Jersey like this is clearly unacceptable and disproportionate,"" the spokesman said. ""We are working closely with the EU and Jersey on fisheries access provisions following the end of the transition period so trust the French will use the mechanisms of our new treaty to solve problems."" The row emerged over a new licensing system for French fishing vessels. The system was introduced by the Government of Jersey under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA). Jerseyissued 41 licences for access to its waters on Fridaywhen an interim agreement came to an end. The Jersey government said the permits must ""correspond to the previous activity a vessel has carried out in Jersey waters"" under the terms of the TCA and its new system was ""in line with the data submitted by the French and EU authorities"". A spokeswoman said it took French complaints over the terms of the licensing agreement ""very seriously"" and would respond, but said it had acted in ""good faith"" setting up the regime. ""The government remains committed to the sustainable management of Jersey waters for the benefit of this and future generations,"" she said. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ian Gorst, External Relations Minister for the Government of Jersey, argued there was no justification for such severe measures. ""This is not the first threat that the French have made to either Jersey or the United Kingdom since we are into this new deal,"" he said. ""It would seem disproportionate to cut off electricity for the sake of needing to provide extra details so that we can refine the licences."" On Tuesday, he explained there was ""no time limit"" for the French fishing industry or government to provide evidence of previous activity in Jersey waters and he wanted to ""heal this relationship"". ""If French fishermen or the authorities have further evidence they would like to submit, we will update the licences to reflect that evidence."" French authorities said ""new technical measures"" for fishing off the Channel Islands had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". Representatives from Normandy have closed their office in St Helier in protest of ""inexplicable conditions"" in the new scheme, which had been introduced ""against all expectations"". These include caps on the number of fishing days for different vessels, restrictions on gear and the closure of fishing areas. The UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said the self-governing Crown Dependency is ""responsible for its own territorial waters"".

A statement from the Jersey government read: ""Diplomatic efforts will continue to resolve the outstanding issues relating to fishing licences and to de-escalate the situation."" HMS Tamar is one of two Royal Navy ships that are off the coast of Jersey Their boats were draped with makeshift banners - which read ""en colÃ¨re""- we are angry,writes BBC Europe correspondent Jean Mackenzie, who was with the fishermen as they set off from the French coast. A handful left this small port on the Normandy coast about 02:30, to be joined by dozens more on the way to Jersey. The fishermen seemed more shocked than angry, that their access to waters they have fished in for decades is being challenged. Under the post-Brexit trade deal, Jersey has to allow European vessels into its waters, but they now need licences - but the fishermen say the permits have come with a long list of restrictions that were never agreed. Reacting to the French maritime minister's threat to cut off Jersey's electricity in retaliation - the fishermen were pleased. ""It's good to know our country is on our side,"" they said HMS Severn is one of the two offshore patrol vessels monitoring Jersey waters Dimitri Rogoff, head of fisheries for the Normandy region, said the boats would not try to block St Helier and would return to France in the afternoon, AFP reported. Labour's shadow defence secretary John Healey said the threats were ""completely unreasonable"" and urged the UK government to ""get round the table with French colleagues and authorities in Jersey and sort this issue out"". French fishermen have complained about being prevented from operating in British waters because of difficulties in obtaining licences. Under an agreement with the EU, French boat operators must show a history of fishing in the area to receive a licence for Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. Jersey has the sole power to issue the licences, and as of last week all fishing boats were required to have a licence to operate there. On Friday, the Jersey government granted 41 permits to French fishing vessels that are equipped with technology that allows them to be located. But the French government claimed the list of approved ships came with further demands that ""were not arranged or discussed, and which we were not notified about"". Chris Le Masurier, who runs Jersey Oyster and Normandy Trader Freight, said the French fisherman were rightly upset by the situation. He said: ""I see it as very much an insult to them and they are extremely upset. The criteria that they were given was to prove they have fished in Jersey waters for 10 days. Nothing about what species were caught, nothing about if you've fished for 20 days or 30 days [and having to] prove that."" But Don Thompson, from the Jersey Fisherman's Association, said affected French crews have ""had since 1 January"" to comply with the new rules and ""perhaps some of the boats that perhaps didn't qualify are a little bit put-out"". Thethreat to cut off Jersey's electricity supply- 95% of which is delivered by three underwater cables from France - was made by French Maritime Minister Annick Girardin on Tuesday. HMS Severn and HMS Tamar, which are based in Portsmouth, are each crewed by 45 sailors and up to 50 Royal Marines. The ships are routinely used for fisheries protection - with sailors able to board other boats for spot checks.

Final day of campaigning in Wales,"The election will decide the make up of the 60-member Senedd Wales' political parties made their final pitches to voters on Wednesday as the Senedd election campaign came to a close. Party leaders campaigned in key seats in north, south and mid Wales. UK Conservative Chancellor Rishi Sunak visited Rhyl in north Wales while Labour leader Mark Drakeford headed to Barry in the Vale of Glamorgan. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price focused on Llanelli while the Welsh Lib Dems' Jane Dodds visited Ystradgynlais. Voting will begin at 07:00 BST on Thursday, with counting not taking place until Friday because of the pandemic. A really simple guide to the Welsh elections How to follow the election results on the BBC Who should I vote for in the Welsh election? Voters will be electing 60 politicians to sit in the Welsh Parliament in Cardiff Bay - known as the National Assembly for Walesuntil last year. They get two votes - one for their constituency, and one for their region. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Mr Price and Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies are challenging Mr Drakeford to take his job as Wales' first minister. Where parties choose to campaign tends to show where they think they could win extra seats or lose them - on Wednesday the Welsh Conservatives returned to north Wales with Rishi Sunak visiting Marine Holiday Park in Rhyl, Vale of Clwyd. Four seats held by Labour in north east Wales were won by the Conservatives at the 2019 UK general election. Rishi Sunak served fish and chips to Welsh Secretary Simon Hart ""If you want to see change that we're bringing across the United Kingdom, if you vote for a Conservative government here in Wales, we'll be able to deliver that change here as well,"" said Mr Sunak on a tightly-controlled visit. BBC Wales asked if the chancellor could see why he was criticised for a decision not to extend job support when the Welsh governmentwanted to hold its firebreak lockdown last autumn. Furlough was extended when England locked down. ""I think at every point during the past 12 months during this crisis, I and the government have acted to protect people in all parts of the United Kingdom,"" Mr Sunak said. ""If you think about things like the furlough scheme, that's protected almost half a million jobs here in Wales, 50,000 businesses have benefited from government-backed loans."" WALES ELECTION: THE BASICS What's happening?On 6 May, people will vote to elect 60 Members of the Senedd (MSs). The party that can command the support of a majority of MSs will form the Welsh government.Find out more here. What powers does the Senedd have?MSs pass laws on aspects of life in Wales such as health, education and transport - and have some tax powers. Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford admitted at a campaign event his party was ""battling hard in north Wales"", where the Tories focused their energies on Wednesday. Mr Drakeford visited the Hangfire Southern Kitchen in Barry, in the south Wales constituency of the Vale of Glamorgan. Wales' incumbent first minister Mark Drakeford is on the campaign trail in Barry The seat is held by the Conservatives in the House of Commons, but Labour in the Senedd, and is another constituency the Tories are hoping to gain from Labour. ""We have to restore our bargain with the people of north Wales,"" Mr Drakeford said. Asked if the fact that he had chosen to go to the Vale of Glamorgan suggested he was worried about the seat, he said: ""I'm here because the real contest in this election is between a Labour progressive government for Wales and handing Wales back to London with the Tories."" ""In this constituency, that's exactly the argument that is on the line."" Adam Price (right) visted Castell Howell in the Llanelli constituency Plaid Cymru's leader Adam Price said ""every vote will count in constituencies right across Wales"", telling BBC Wales the election was ""going to be won on small margins"". He visited a food wholesaler and processing company at Cross Hands, in the marginal Senedd seat of Llanelli, held by Labour in 2016. ""Our message to people out there is get out and vote them tomorrow, every vote will count,"" he said. ""We have a historic opportunity to elect the first Plaid Cymru government in our history. That will send headlines across the world."" The Covid-19 pandemic has turned our lives upside down over the last year and a bit - and it has done the same for this Senedd election campaign. Pre-Covid, Welsh Labour had been in power for more than two decades and faced a defensive election trying to hold on to a number of marginal seats against opposition parties with the wind in their sails. Before the pandemic struck, few ordinary voters could have picked the Welsh Labour leader, Mark Drakeford, out of a line-up. Some of his own troops had misgivings about fighting an election under his understated, academic style of leadership. Fast forward to April 2021 and a very different political world.

Liberal Democrats William Powell and Jane Dodds campaigned in Ystradgynlais, in the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency Jane Dodds campaigned in Ystradgynlais on Wednesday in the Brecon and Radnorshire constituency - the only seat the party held onto at the 2016 Welsh Assembly election. On the campaign trail she acknowledged she is not going to be the next first minister of Wales. She declined to rule out entering a coalition after the election, but said her primary concern was winning more seats for the Liberal Democrats. Can Labour strike lucky twice in Welsh election? How Covid changed the Welsh election campaign Five things to find out from the Welsh election ""We're hopeful for all the seats that we are going for,"" Ms Dodds said. ""Certainly we want to win Brecon and Radnorshire, but we are looking to get some places in the regional seats as well which we've always done well in."" By Laura McAllister,  Cardiff University's professor of public policy These Senedd elections are not the ones we anticipated and there's a strange contradictory feel to them. It's been a low-key campaign which has scarcely dazzled, yet the results on Friday feel more significant than ever. Small shifts in votes could determine the distribution of seats to parties and therefore the shape of our next Welsh government. Read more from Laura here. This video can not be played In Wales people get two votes when they go to the polls on 6 May this year Meanwhile, the Wales Green Party asked voters to lend their support in the regional vote. The party's deputy leader Amelia Womack said: ""It is long overdue that we in Wales get the Green scrutiny in the Senedd that we deserve."" Abolish The Welsh Assembly's Mark Reckless asked voters not to ""waste their votes on parties which helped give us Brexit, but have had their day now"". ""For over 20 years devolution has only ever gone one way, towards independence,"" he said. UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton will be in Torfaen on Wednesday. ""UKIP is presenting voters with a real alternative to Labour who have failed communities like Torfaen,"" a spokesman said. Reform UK said its Welsh leader, Nathan Gill, was campaigning in Conwy. Mr Gill said: ""We need to get out of lockdown now, our children need to allowed to be children, and our businesses need to do what they do best, serve their customers and get the Welsh economy rolling again."" Labour is defending 29 seats from the Welsh Parliament election in 2016 Voters will elect 40 Members of the Senedd (MSs) representing local constituencies, and 20 representing five large regions. Each of the regions elects four MSs. Voters will get two ballots - one to back a candidate in their constituency, and one to back a party or individual in the region. The ballot for the region is decided by a system that picks people more according to their share of the vote. But the system takes into account who has won the constituency seats within that region, and gives parties winning fewer or none of those constituencies a better chance of winning regional ones. That is different to the constituencies, where the candidate with the most votes wins. The party or combination of parties that can command the greatest support in the Senedd after the election will form the next Welsh government.

Eg 'W1A 1AA' or 'Westminster'   By Adrian Browne, BBC Wales political reporter Labour, which has been in charge in Wales since devolution 22 years ago, has been campaigning hard in seats it lost to the Conservatives at the 2019 General Election. For their part, the Tories have been putting in the hours to try to convert those Westminster gains they made into Senedd victories. Wrexham, Vale of Clwyd, Clwyd South and Delyn turned from red to blue in 2019, and it is no surprise both parties have focused much of their attention on these seats this time around. In the south, the Conservatives have hopes of ousting Labour in the Vale of Glamorgan, a seat the Tories have held at Westminster since 2010. Labour is also keen to win back the Rhondda seat captured by Plaid Cymru at the 2016 poll. As well as hoping to prevent that seat from returning to the Labour fold, Plaid is targeting the Labour marginal of Llanelli, which has flipped between the two parties since the dawn of devolution in 1999. Rhondda is among the key seats parties are fighting over at this election Tory-held Aberconwy is also a Plaid Cymru target seat, and the party has also used its campaign to urge voters to chose Plaid in their second vote, with the aim of picking up extra members in the regional seats. The Liberal Democrats are concentrating on keeping their one remaining seat, Brecon and Radnorshire, with the possibility of picking up a regional list seat as compensation if they fail to do so. Meanwhile, Abolish the Welsh Assembly, Reform UK, and the Green Party are hoping to make a breakthrough in those regional votes. UKIP won seven regional seats in 2016, shortly before Wales and the UK voted to leave the EU in a referendum. It will be hoping to, at the very least, retain a presence in Cardiff Bay.

"UK sends Royal Navy to monitor Jersey blockadeBoris Johnson outlines his ""unwavering support"" for Jersey as French fishing boats prepare a blockade.UK","This video can not be played ""They want talks"": The BBC's Robert Hall is at Jersey's St Helier port Jersey officials are meeting French fishermen, who have been protesting over their post-Brexit rights, in an attempt to resolve the dispute. Two Royal Navy ships and two French vessels are patrolling near Jersey while about 60 French and Jersey boats are at the island's St Helier port. French fishermen say their rights are unfairly restricted by licences issued by the island under a new system. No 10 said the PM has been in contact with Jersey officials over the row. HMS Severn, which has previously been used to shadow Russian navy warships off the English coast, can be seen from the port, sitting off about a mile from the French boats. HMS Tamar is nearby and both ships are maintaining a presence and not making any effort to intervene. No 10 said it sent the two navy vessels to ""monitor the situation"", while the maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French patrol vessels were on a public service mission to ensure safety. France has threatened to cut off electricity to Jersey, the largest Channel Island and a Crown dependency, located 14 miles (22km) off France. Crown dependencies are not part of the UK, but are defended and represented internationally by the UK government. Live updates: Latest on protest in St Helier What's the fishing row about? The boats are protesting against new fishing rules - introduced last week by the Jersey government under the UK-EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement (TCA) - which require French boats to show they have a history of fishing in Jersey's waters. But it has been claimed additional requirements were added without notice. French authorities say ""new technical measures"" had not been communicated to the EU, rendering them ""null and void"". ""It's really important that we are able to work with those fishermen to help them provide the necessary evidence so that, if required, their licences can be amended,"" Senator Ian Gorst, Jersey's external relations minister, told BBC News. ""As I've said, it's important that we respond to threats, but the answer to this solution is to continue to talk and diplomacy."" Who really owns UK fishing rights? What does the Brexit trade deal mean for fishing? Jersey fisherman Loic Farnham said of his French counterparts: ""They are professional fishermen, the same as we all are, we'd like to keep it all amicable so we can have access to the markets and they can carry on earning a living in our waters."" An ElysÃ©e source said France was monitoring the situation ""very closely"", adding that it is ""currently calm and we hope that this will remain the case"". ""We want to be able to return to negotiations, that we can obtain the fishing licenses provided for in the agreement."" The maritime prefecture of Manche and mer du Nord told the BBC the two French vessels, police boat Athos and patroller Themis, were not on military missions. It said the boats' roles were to stay in French waters and to be near to the fisherman in order to ensure safety. A European Commission spokeswoman said talks were continuing with the UK. By Freddie Miller, BBC Jersey political reporter In the darkness you could see the lights from boats slowly making their way from the direction of France towards Jersey. They then all gathered outside the St Helier harbour and they stayed there for about half an hour. At about 06:30 BST they started making their way slowly into the harbour. Flares were set off - red flares, orange flares, burning bright. French flags were being flown, there were banners talking about fishing. Meanwhile, on the pier-side where I am, islanders had gathered - probably about 30 in total, including a couple of police officers. Jersey flags had been hung to the railings of the pier, some were waving flags. There were also some Jersey boats in support of the French, flying both French and Jersey flags, and also a couple that were there trying to stop the French from coming into the harbour. Amidst all of this you've got the two navy vessels in the distance - you can just see the outline shadow of them through the mist, just keeping watch of everything. MEP Stephanie Yon-Courtin, a member of the EU fisheries committee, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme said ""all retaliatory measures will be explored"". Of the threats to cut off electricity to Jersey, she said ""these are only words we are not ready for war"". On Thursday morning, Prime Minister Boris Johnson confirmed that the two Royal Navy vessels would ""remain in place to monitor the situation as a precautionary measure"".

Give jabs to poorer hotspots before boosters - WHO,"Countries like India are experiencing a surge in the number of coronavirus cases Wealthy countries including the UK should send spare vaccine doses to virus-hit nations before organising booster jabs, a World Health Organization (WHO) official has said. Special envoy David Nabarro told the BBC top-ups and extra vaccinations ""should come a bit later"". He said Covid was ""bigger than ever, it's fiercer than ever and it's causing more distress than ever"" worldwide. The UK has said its booster programme could start as early as September. The government has also pledged to donate surplus vaccine doses to poorer nations. But the WHO has urged richer countries to do more - and sooner - as Covid cases surge in countries, including India and South Asian nations. What you need to know about how Covid is changing What is the India Covid variant and will vaccines work? Extra $45bn needed for Covax plan to vaccinate poor Mr Nabarro told BBC Radio 4's World at One programme the virus was now spreading in places where testing was poor - so the numbers being reported risked being a ""major under-estimate"". ""This is a bad phase,"" he said. As foreign ministers of the G7 group of countries met in London, he urged leaders to begin to distribute spare doses to those countries in the grip of the virus amid a global shortage of supply. He said he wanted ""to plead with G7 leaders, with G20 leaders, with every leader, with everybody who's got influence, to please recognise that we've got to try to get vaccines distributed to those who need them the most now in this period of acute shortage of supply"". Mr Nabarro added that ""top-ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries... should come a bit later"". It comes after UK Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said extra funding would fast-track new vaccines to ""future-proof"" the UK against new virus variants. Existing vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps on mutating. Mr Zahawi said the Â£29.3m funding increase would improve testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory. He also said the booster programme could begin in September ""or later in the year, or early next year"". He told BBC Breakfast clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme. Last week, the UK governmentordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters. Following the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years."" UK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: ""A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. ""This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants. ""While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops."" The government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Prof Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), saidnew variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic. ""In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,"" he told the BBC. ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? EPIDEMIC v PANDEMIC:What's the difference? VACCINE:When will I get the jab? NEW VARIANTS:How worried should we be? Prof Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored ""carefully"", but the UK had gone from a ""terrible situation"" in January to a ""remarkably good situation now"". Covid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval. In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May. On Wednesday, the UK reported another 2,144 daily cases, as well as a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. The government's latest data,externalshowed more than 50 million Covid vaccinations have been given in the UK so far, with more than 34.7 million first doses and 15.8 million second doses administered.

Goldman tells bankers to return to office in JuneStaff are being encouraged to return to office-based working when Covid restrictions are lifted.,"Goldman boss David Solomon previously described working from home as ""an aberration"" Goldman Sachs has told its UK bankers they need to be ready to return to the office in June. That is the date on which the government hopes to lift legal limits on social contact in England. While for many working from home has become normal, Goldman boss David Solomon previously described it as ""an aberration"". But rival investment bank JP Morgan is planning for ""significantly"" less office space, it said in April. Goldman bankers have in large part already returned to the office in parts of the Asia-Pacific region. But, in India and Latin America ""the devastating rise in the number of infections and deaths is leading to new lockdowns and significant strain"", three Goldman top executives said in an internal memo on Tuesday. However, the bank is ""encouraged by the rollout of vaccines"" in many places, chief executive David Solomon, president John Waldron and chief financial officer Stephen Scherr said. Can I ask to keep working from home? Covid: 'People are tired of working from home' Coronavirus: 'Nine in 10 would continue working from home' US bankers should be ready to come back into the office on 14 June, and UK bankers should make plans to be back on 21 June, they said. Goldman Sachs employees will be encouraged to come back to London offices from 21 June ""We know from experience that our culture of collaboration, innovation and apprenticeship thrives when our people come together, and we look forward to having more of our colleagues back in the office so that they can experience that once again on a regular basis,"" they said. Staff who wish to continue to work from home should discuss this with their manager, they added. While some bank bosses have indicated that working from home may not be a long term option for some employees, others are planning for smaller offices. JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said in April that the investment bank will require ""significantly"" less office space in the coming years, needing just 60 seats per 100 people. Some traders have been working in Canary Wharf during the pandemic HSBC boss Noel Quinn said at the end of April that the bank plans to move to a hybrid model of working, with employees having a mixture of working in the office and from home. Some investment bank traders at Canary Wharfhave been working from the officeduring the pandemic. Barclays expects to keep a significant number of traders at Canary Wharf in the future. Barclays boss Jes Staley has previously said home working is ""not sustainable"" for large financial institutions.

Meghan wins copyright claim over father's letter,"The Duchess of Sussex has won the remainder of her copyright claim against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a letter to her estranged father. In February,Meghan won most of her claimfor misuse of private information and copyright infringement. But the newspaper had suggested she may not have been the sole copyright owner. The duchess won her case after her former communications secretary denied co-writing the letter. Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline - had previously argued the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's former communications secretary Jason Knauf was a co-author of the letter, meaning its copyright belonged to the Crown. On Wednesday, the High Court heard that Mr Knauf has ""emphatically"" denied co-writing the letter to Thomas Markle. Through his lawyers, he said ""it was the duchess's letter alone"". Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Meghan's Mail on Sunday statement on hold Ian Mill, representing the duchess, told the court that this ""gives the lie"" to the newspaper's suggestion that Meghan considered using the letter ""as part of a media strategy"". The court also heard that lawyers representing ""the Keeper of the Privy Purse, acting on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen"" told Meghan's solicitors they ""did not consider the Crown to be the copyright owner"". Launching their case against ANL in 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan said they were forced to take action against ""relentless propaganda"", with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to ""the same powerful forces"" as his mother. In the High Court in February, Lord Justice Warby ruled the publication of Meghan's handwritten letter to her father by the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline was ""manifestly excessive and hence unlawful"". The judge said it was a ""a personal and private letter"" that dealt with the duchess's ""feelings of anguish about her father's behaviour, as she saw it, and the resulting rift between them"". On Wednesday, Mr Mill acknowledged that Meghan had ""shared a draft"" of the letter with Harry and Mr Knauf ""for support, as this was a deeply painful process that they had lived through with her"". ""Mr Knauf was responsible for keeping the senior members of the royal household apprised of any public-facing issues, the media spectacle surrounding Mr Markle being one such issue,"" the barrister said. The former communications secretary had ""suggested that a reference to Mr Markle's ill-health be included"", which Meghan added, but he ""did not suggest any specific wording"", the court heard. His lawyers said he did not draft any part of the letter and ""would never have asserted copyright over any of their content"". Prince Harry and Meghan had said the publication of the letter was part of a ""relentless propaganda"" campaign Mr Knauf, who is now chief executive of the Royal Foundation, set up by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, had said in a joint letter with other royal aides in January thathe did not want to ""take sides"" in the legal dispute. Andrew Caldecott, representing the publisher, said it was a ""matter of regret"" that Mr Knauf had not made clear he was not the author of the letter sooner. He said as soon as ANL heard his account, the publisher indicated it would not oppose summary judgment in this case - meaning it could be resolved without going to trial. But ANL isapplying to the Court of Appeal for permission to appealagainst the judge's February ruling on privacy and copyright, when the duchess won the bulk of her case. An order that it must print a statement on its front page and page three that it infringed Meghan's copyright ison hold until the Court of Appeal's decision.

As it happened: Last bids to win over Welsh votersParties battled to win hearts and minds on the last day of the election campaign in Wales.Wales,"Politicians have been making their last-ditch bids to win over the voters ahead of polling day on Thursday Chancellor Rishi Sunak joined the Conservative effort to repeat their general election gains in north Wales Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford visited the Vale of Glamorgan to defend another Tory target seat Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price campaigned in Carmarthenshire, hoping to capture Labour-held Llanelli Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds turned her focus to defending the party's Brecon and Radnorshire seat Rachel Flint, Natalie Grice and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the final day of campaigning in Wales for tomorrow's Senedd election. Polling stations will be open from 0700 to 2200 BST on Thursday. The results will take a little longer than usual to come, not least because counting in Wales will not start until Friday morning due to the pandemic. Click herefor details of results coverage from the BBC on TV, radio, online and social media. We hope you'll join us again soon. Polling stations will be open for tomorrow's Senedd and police and crime commissioner elections, but there will be rules to ensure voting is Covid safe. Full details are available,externalon the Welsh Government website. Covid measures were in place at the Russian Embassy in London last summer when ex-pat Russians used it as a polling station for a referendum Jenny Rathbone said Labour had allowed Plaid Cymru to appear the more radical party A Welsh Labour candidate has said she would have preferred âa
slightly more radical approachâ in her partyâs Senedd manifesto. Jenny Rathbone said she thought it was ""slightly over-cautious"", allowing Plaid Cymru to ""nibble away at people who want something more radicalâ. âItâs a cautious approach. I would have preferred us to have
a slightly more radical approach,"" she told theLabourList,externalwebsite. Ms Rathbone said she thought Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford was ""as radical"" as the party's former UK leader Jeremy Corbyn, but ""a much more cautious guy"". ""He doesnât promise anything he feels he canât
deliver, which I think is the right way to go about it,"" she said. âOverpromise and underdeliver? Not politically very sharp."" However, Ms Rathbone added: âI think Markâs objective was to ensure that
Plaid didnât appear to be more radical than us, and I donât think that heâs
managed to do it.â If you're going to the polls tomorrow in Wales you'll also be given a ballot paper to choose a police and crime commissioner. The elected posts - one for each force area - were created by the UK government in 2012 with the aim of giving greater scrutiny and local public accountability to policing.

Shavanah Taj of the Wales TUC said urgent action was needed to ""rebuild a fairer and more resilient Wales"" With just hours left before the polls open, trade unions are calling for the next Welsh government to ""fight for fairness"". The Wales TUC is calling for pay rises for all public sector workers, including NHS staff, porters and cleaners, with 85% of members backing pay increases for nurses. In its manifesto, ahead of Thursday's vote, the organisation said workers backed further devolution of powers from London to Cardiff Bay. Wales TUC General Secretary Shavanah Taj said people should elect a new government which would ""prioritise greater workplace equality and fight to make Wales a Fair Work nation"". âThe last year has shown the grim reality of our labour market for tens of thousands of workers across Wales,"" she said. ""Young workers, BAME workers, and people in insecure work have been disproportionately hit â losing jobs, income, skills and opportunities."" Ms Taj added that urgent action was needed to ""rebuild a fairer and more resilient Wales"". David DeansBBC Wales politics reporter More people have registered for
a postal vote in the 2021 Senedd election than in the last assembly election
five years ago. But the figures, which are not
complete, suggest there may not be a substantial increase on the numbers from
2016 despite the pandemic. Figures
obtained by BBC Wales show that at least 451,006 people have registered to vote by
post across Wales' 40 constituencies. That is at
least 14% more than the 395,878 postal voters in the Welsh Assembly election in
2016. However, the
overall number of people registered to vote has risen by 6%, from 2.2m to 2.3m. The postal vote figures do not
include the Monmouthshire part of Newport East, but without those figures it
amounts to at least 19% of the electorate. Thatâs compared to 17.62% in
2016. Many of the figures were
provided by the Association of Electoral Administrators, and by some individual
councils. BBC Wales correspondent Hywel Griffith is not the only one to note that visiting politicians seem inordinately keen on eating chips at the Welsh seaside.

Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent In a brief
interview with us here in the Vale of Clwyd, Rishi Sunak hit the Conservatives'
key message that the Tories offer change in this election. We didn't cover
much ground. His aides called time after two questions. The chancellor also
pointed to the billions in additional funding he's given the Welsh government
during the pandemic. Around Â£1bn is waiting to be allocated after the
election. But there is a
question about what happens when all that money has been spent. The clever people
at the Wales Governance Centre talk about the possible implications in their
fascinating analysis of the three main parties' manifestos.You can see it here,external. As far as the
Tories' manifesto is concerned, the analysis says paying for all its promises â
such as on NHS funding and a possible income-tax cut â will overshoot
pessimistic projections for the size of the budget. Like the Tories,
Plaid Cymru would also need a more generous settlement from Westminster.
Labour's plans are more modest. What they all have
in common is a âlack of detail on spending across the boardâ, the analysis team
says. By the way, it's
not surprising the chancellor chose to come to the Vale of Clwyd constituency,
the seat Sir Keir Starmer visited yesterday. It's a key
Labour-Tory battleground. If the Tories are heading for a good result â and a
poll out today will buoy their confidence â many would consider this seat the
most likely to turn blue. There aremore Steves and Daves running in Thursday's Senedd electionthan there are women candidates running in all but one of the 18 parties standing. Of the 469 candidates, 14 are called Steve, Stephen or Steven and there are 11 named David, Dave or Dai. The only party fielding more women than the combined number of candidates called Steve or Dave is Welsh Labour. The party's 50/50 gender split between its 60 candidates means it had 30 women standing. Plaid Cymru has put forward 19 women candidates (35%) and the Welsh Conservatives have 17 (30%). As might be expected, the most common candidate surname in Wales for Thursday's election is Jones with a total of 23 standing. That is followed by Davies (15), Williams (13) and Evans (11). At this election 16 and 17-year-olds can vote for the first time Tens of thousands of young people have not taken up the chance to vote for the first time at the Senedd election. On Thursday, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to vote in the Welsh Parliament election after the voting age was lowered. However,figures compiled by the BBC suggest 54% of young people have failed to register to votein Thursday's poll. The data compares numbers registered with population estimates for 21 of Wales' 22 council areas. Figures show 2,421,108 people in Wales - about 76.7% of the whole population - are registered. The finding comes despite the efforts of grime artists, fitness stars, and Instagram and TikTok influencers to engage young people in the election. However, campaigners have said they felt young people were not being listened to by politicians, and that parties had not done enough to reach potential new voters. Leader Jane Dodds takes to the streets on the final day of campaigning The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats has
acknowledged she is not going to be the next first minister of Wales. Jane Dodds is campaigning in the seat of Brecon and
Radnorshire on the final day before voters go to the polls. The seat was previously held by the Lib Demsâ only
MS in the last Senedd, Kirsty Williams. Speaking outside the Minersâ Institute in Ystradgynlais, Ms
Dodds said: âI would love to be first minister, but I'm going to be honest, I'm
not going to be the first minister of Wales this time. âI think, if I had a chance of being in government, the
first thing that I would be doing is looking at child poverty. I would want to
look at how we can address child poverty here in Wales."" Ms Dodds declined to rule out entering a coalition with
any of the other parties after the election, but said her primary concern was
winning more seats. âWe're very clear that right now we're going to fight for
every single vote,â she said. âWe're not taking anything for granted. We're not bargaining
with any votes. Let's see what happens tomorrow, and we'll take it from there. âCertainly we want to win Brecon and Radnorshire, but we are
looking to get some places in the regional seats as well which we've always
done well in,"" she said. Asked whether her leadership was tenable if the party failed
to gain any representation in the Senedd, Ms Dodds said she would not stand
down regardless of the outcome. âMy position as leader will be that I will carry on. âI'm not here to talk
about my job, I'm here to talk about the jobs of others. That's what's most
important, that's what we're hearing on the doorstep - that people want us to
talk about jobs, about mental health, and about the environment."" You could get into trouble depending what's in the background of your photo.

support them. Leader Anthony Slaughter said: ""We are hearing on the
doorstep from first-time Green voters they are lending us their regional ballot

Mark Drakeford went behind the scenes in a restaurant in Barry Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford has admitted his party
is âbattling hard in north Walesâ. Labour lost four seats to the Conservatives in the north east at
the Westminster election in 2019 â and the party is hoping to stop it happening in the Senedd. âWe have to restore our bargain with the people of north Wales,â Mr Drakeford said. He made the comments while visiting the Hangfire Southern Kitchen in Barry,
in the south Wales constituency of the Vale of Glamorgan. The seat is held by the Conservatives in the House of
Commons, but by Labour in the Senedd. It's another constituency the Tories are
hoping to gain from Labour. Asked if the fact he had chosen to go to the Vale of
Glamorgan suggested he was worried about the seat, Mr Drakeford said: âI'm here because
the real contest in this election is between a Labour progressive government
for Wales and handing Wales back to London with the Tories. âIn this constituency, that's exactly the argument that is
on the line.â Adam Price visited tightly-fought Llanelli, won by Labour in 2016 Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price
says ""every vote will count in constituencies right across Wales"",
telling BBC Wales the election was ""going to be won on small
margins"". He visited a food wholesaler and
processing company at Cross Hands, in the marginal Senedd seat of Llanelli, won
by Labour in 2016. ""Our message to people out
there is get out and vote tomorrow - every vote will count,"" he said. ""We have a historic opportunity
to elect the first Plaid Cymru government in our history. ""That will send headlines
across the world. ""It will electrify Wales
because we will have a government that will believe in the potential of Wales
to solve our problems, the problems that have been there for generations. ""We can put our country now
on a different path."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart is served chips by his chancellor, Rishi Sunak during a visit to Marine Holiday Park in Rhyl Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told BBC Wales the Conservatives could bring âchangeâ to Wales if voters backed them on Thursday. The party has said voting Tory would
ensure âtwo
governments working together to rebuild after the pandemic and level up Walesâ. Journalists, including BBC Wales, were limited to two
questions each for Mr Sunak, on the tightly controlled visit to Rhyl. Asked by the BBC's Daniel Davies if he was
telling the electorate that extra cash would not be available if they voted for
Labour, Mr Sunak said: âIf you want to see change that weâre bringing across
the United Kingdom, if you vote for a Conservative government here in Wales,
weâll be able to deliver that change here as well. âIt's about making sure that we've completed the vaccine
roll-out, and then we drive forward our economic recovery as we've protected
people's jobs and businesses over the past 12 months.â BBC Wales asked the chancellor if he could see why he was
criticised for a decision not to extend job support when the Welsh
government wanted to hold its firebreak lockdown last autumn. Furlough
was extended when England locked down later. Mr Sunak did not address the point directly but said: âI
think at every point during the past 12 months during this crisis I and the
government have acted to protect people in all parts of the United Kingdom. âIf you think about things like the furlough scheme, that's
protected almost half a million jobs here in Wales.  Fifty thousand businesses have
benefited from government-backed loans.â The chancellor said there had been Â£8bn âover two years of direct cash
support for the Welsh government to support its local economy as wellâ. âI know that we have stood behind people of Wales at this
difficult time over the past 12 months,â Mr Sunak added. Prof Laura McAllisterCardiff University These Senedd elections are not the ones we anticipated and there's a strange contradictory feel to them. It's been a low-key campaign which has scarcely dazzled, yet the results on Friday feel more significant than ever. The Members of the Senedd - or MSs - elected will serve in a proper parliament with law-making and tax setting powers. Added excitement comes from the very tight margins that will decide at least a quarter of the constituency seats and several regional list seats. Small shifts in votes could determine the distribution of seats to parties and therefore the shape of our next Welsh government. So, the final results are unpredictable, dependent as they are on several important unknowns. First, this is a Covid election - both practically and policy-wise. We are edging out of lockdown, but with gargantuan recovery problems ahead. Most of us had imagined a dramatically different political landscape for Senedd 2021, framed by post-Brexit adaptation - not a pandemic. Read more from Laura here. Neil Hamilton was elected to the Senedd in 2016 UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton will be in Torfaen on
Wednesday, the party has said. ""UKIP is presenting voters with a real alternative to
Labour who have failed communities like Torfaen,â a spokesman said. ""We are asking voters to put their trust in UKIP - as
they did in 2016 - to deliver a better future for the south Wales valleys. ""Just as UKIP led the charge in the last assembly term
to scrap the Severn Bridge tolls, we will champion the case for building the M4
relief road which will bring desperately needed investment to the valleys.â Ione Wells took over BBC Wales News' Instagram account to answer your questions Why do we vote on Thursdays? The answer seems to be there isn't really a good reason and it's just become a tradition. Theories offered include the idea that people are less likely to go to the pub than they are on Fridays, and that traditionally Thursday was market day, so people were more likely to be out and about anyway.

Indian delegates in UK for G7 talks self-isolate,"The entire Indian delegation in the UK for G7 talks must self-isolate after two Covid cases were detected. India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar pulled out of face-to-face talks, saying he was ""aware of exposure to possible Covid positive cases"". He met Home Secretary Priti Patel in person on Tuesday but joined the rest of the meetings virtually. India is not in the G7 group of nations but delegates from the country were invited as guests. The two cases were picked up by tests in advance and none of the party had attended the meeting venue, the Press Association said. Mr Jaishankar has not tested positive. India is currently on the UK's red list meaning travel from there is banned, but some jobs are exempt including representatives of a foreign country. There are also exemptions to the self-isolation rule ""if it is confirmed that you are travelling to the UK for official business that cannot be undertaken while self-isolating"",according to the government's rules.,external India's foreign minister, right, also spoke with the US delegation earlier this week The G7 group - the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. The official summit of G7 leaders is taking place in Cornwall next month, but ministers are currently in the UK for talks. The talks this week were the first face-to-face meetings the G7 powers have had in more than two years. India, Australia, South Korea and South Africa attended as guests. What is the G7 and what does it do? On Tuesday, Home Secretary Ms Patel met Mr Jaishankar andtweeted a picture,externalof them wearing masks as they handled folders, saying it was ""a pleasure"" to welcome him asnew trade and investment dealswere signed.

Themeeting on Wednesday was between foreign ministers,,externalwho were greeted by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with elbow and fist bumps in the courtyard of Lancaster House in London. Mr Raab greets his South Korean counterpart at the G7 foreign ministers meeting They then went to the summit room where the ministers were separated from one another by clear screens in order to minimise any risk from coronavirus. They discussed new ways to ensure fairer access to vaccine stockpiles and increase support for the global vaccine distribution scheme known as Covax. Also on the agenda on Wednesday was media freedom, arbitrary detentionand girls' education. On the news that positive cases had been found among the India delegation, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there were questions that needed to be raised ""about how this happened"". ""It is a reminder of how vigilant we need to be about our borders,"" he said, adding: ""Let's get to the bottom of how this happened - we cannot have a repeat."" Asked whether holding the G7 meeting in person was a mistake because of the risk of Covid variants, Boris Johnson said it was ""very important to try to continue as much business as you can as a government"". ""As I understand it, what has happened is the individuals concerned are all isolating now,"" the prime minister said. ""I will be seeing the Indian foreign minister later this afternoon but that will be a Zoom exchange."" At the end of their meeting, the ministersissued a lengthy communiquÃ©,external.

Goldman tells bankers to return to office in June,"Goldman boss David Solomon previously described working from home as ""an aberration"" Goldman Sachs has told its UK bankers they need to be ready to return to the office in June. That is the date on which the government hopes to lift legal limits on social contact in England. While for many working from home has become normal, Goldman boss David Solomon previously described it as ""an aberration"". But rival investment bank JP Morgan is planning for ""significantly"" less office space, it said in April. Goldman bankers have in large part already returned to the office in parts of the Asia-Pacific region. But, in India and Latin America ""the devastating rise in the number of infections and deaths is leading to new lockdowns and significant strain"", three Goldman top executives said in an internal memo on Tuesday. However, the bank is ""encouraged by the rollout of vaccines"" in many places, chief executive David Solomon, president John Waldron and chief financial officer Stephen Scherr said. Can I ask to keep working from home? Covid: 'People are tired of working from home' Coronavirus: 'Nine in 10 would continue working from home' US bankers should be ready to come back into the office on 14 June, and UK bankers should make plans to be back on 21 June, they said. Goldman Sachs employees will be encouraged to come back to London offices from 21 June ""We know from experience that our culture of collaboration, innovation and apprenticeship thrives when our people come together, and we look forward to having more of our colleagues back in the office so that they can experience that once again on a regular basis,"" they said. Staff who wish to continue to work from home should discuss this with their manager, they added. While some bank bosses have indicated that working from home may not be a long term option for some employees, others are planning for smaller offices. JP Morgan boss Jamie Dimon said in April that the investment bank will require ""significantly"" less office space in the coming years, needing just 60 seats per 100 people. Some traders have been working in Canary Wharf during the pandemic HSBC boss Noel Quinn said at the end of April that the bank plans to move to a hybrid model of working, with employees having a mixture of working in the office and from home. Some investment bank traders at Canary Wharfhave been working from the officeduring the pandemic. Barclays expects to keep a significant number of traders at Canary Wharf in the future.

Restrictions are returning in the Seychelles amid a rise in cases We're going to be bringing our coverage of the pandemic to an end soon. Before we go, here's a round up of today's stories. Tomorrow millions of people will able to vote in elections taking place across England, Scotland and Wales. Covid safety measures mean counting will last several days and the results will come out at different times. Some counts, including the Hartlepool by-election, will take place overnight on Thursday night/Friday morning. We will also know all the results for the Welsh Senedd on Friday. Scotland starts counting in some areas on Friday and the final results are expected on Saturday. English council votes will be spread over four days from Thursday night until Sunday. A dozen of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England won't count until Monday. We've answered some more of your questions about the local electionshere. India's opposition Congress party is calling for a full lockdown in order for the country to get on top of the current wave of coronavirus - saying it is the ""only option left"". Spokesman Pawan Khera tells BBC World News the government has ignored the warnings of experts and been too slow to react to the scale of the current epidemic. The national spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not rejected a lockdown but has decided to leave it to individual states to impose measures. You can watch Khera's comments below. This video can not be played A 12-year-old girl who sued her school in an attempt to prevent it from ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of masks has lost her court case. The pupil, known only as AB, sued the Tapton Academy School Trust in Sheffield, claiming mask-wearing risks causing âserious harmâ to childrenâs physical and mental health. The trust says its policy is to encourage mask-wearing, not to enforce it. More than 10% of staff across its schools have been infected since August, the trust had said, underlining the risk to health. Today, Judge Roger ter Haar QC has rejected the request for an injunction because of ""a fundamental defect"" - the pupil had already been given an exemption from wearing a mask, so the injunction was not necessary to protect her health and safety. He says he made âno conclusions whatsoever as to the safety or otherwise of requiring children to wear face masks at schoolâ, although he noted concerns were ""strongly held"" by people such as AB's father and those who crowdfunded the legal case. But the judge says evidence submitted on the physical and psychological risks of wearing masks âdo not represent universal scientific and medical views"". Visitors to Blackpool could be asked to take Covid tests at their hotels in a bid to keep outbreaks at bay once the seaside town fully reopens. The town's council is in talks with local hospitality businesses about rolling out the voluntary tests. Concerns about the impact of an influx of tourists on case numbers were raised at the authority's audit committee. The town has often suffered high infection rates throughout the pandemic. Read more. The UK has said its programme of booster vaccine shots could start in September, while a World Health Organization official isurging wealthy countries to delayuntil hard-hit nations are fully vaccinated. But why might booster jabs be needed? Countries are carefully monitoring coronavirus for mutations that might help it spread, make people sicker or overpower vaccines - so they can adjust their vaccination programmes and keep the virus under control. About 200 cases ofthe India variant(B.1.617) had been confirmed in the UK as of 28 April. It's the latest variant to come under scrutiny, but there's not yet enough evidence to make it an official ""variant of concern"" or to show it's directly responsible for India'srecent surge in Covid-19 cases. Current vaccines were designed for earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work, albeit potentially less well. Experts are confident existing vaccines can be redesigned to better tackle emerging mutations. The UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Read more on how the variants are tracked  Staff at Cardiff's biggest intensive care unit are creating a woodland to offset carbon emissions created by machines used to treat Covid patients in hospital. More than 1,000 trees have been planted near Crickhowell in Wales. One of those involved, Dr Jack Parry-Jones, describes the effort as ""a lasting memorial"" to staff and patients. Dr Craig Spencer, who has spent the past year working ""within four walls"" in hospital, says it was ""joyous"" being outside in nature and being able to look at his colleagues without them wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).

Liners have been using sheltered waters off Torbay to anchor during the pandemic, which saw cruises cancelled. It is understood 34 cruise workers from India arrived in Torquay last week to board the Marella Explorer as the industry prepares to restart fully.

A surge in traffic is expected this summer, as people seek UK getaways Traffic on Britain's roads at the weekend returned to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September. But Department of Transport figures show the traffic levels were driven by heavy and light goods vehicles. Those were at 112% and 118% of normal levels over Sunday 25 April and Saturday 1 May. The RAC Foundation suggests the higher levels of delivery vehicles were caused by the popularity of online shopping in the pandemic. Car use was at 95% and 96% of pre-pandemic levels on the same two days, while on weekdays usage was only at an average of 88%. AA president Edmund King says workers staying away from offices are largely responsible for the 10% of previous car travel no longer taking place. He says ""there is a growing feeling that coronavirus will continue to cast a shadow over travel even after June"" but ""a surge in car travel during the summer"" is expected as people celebrate the end of lockdown with a UK holiday. Demand for public transport is returning more slowly, with bus use at 54% of normal levels outside London and 60% within the capital. And people are only taking 34% of the usual number of journeys on the mainline rail network. India is grappling with a devastating second wave of Covid infections, which is overwhelming hospitals in major cities including Delhi. But Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, tells BBC World News there are even more cases in rural areas. ""70% of India's population lives in rural India, and there are no hospital facilities there,"" he says. ""You won't see long lines outside hospitals simply because there aren't very many at all to begin with."" He warns it may take several weeks before the situation in the country can ""turn around"".

Canada has become the first nationto approve the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 and over. Chief medical advisor of Health Canada Dr Supriya Sharma tells a press conference the decision is ""a significant milestone"" in the fight against Covid. ""The department determined that this vaccine is safe and
effective when used in this younger age group,"" she says. ""We are
starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel."" Critics have criticised what some see as the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in Canada. According to Our World in Data, the country has delivered 37.85 doses per 100 people - about half the rate in the US. More than 30% of UK adults have now received the second dose of a Covid vaccine, the official data shows. Another 257,486 people had their second jab on Tuesday, meaning 15,630,007 people, or 30.2% of all adults, have had both vaccinations. A total of 127,170 people received their first dose, the latest figures show, taking that measurement to 34,667,904 (66.1% of all adults). It means 50,682,567 first and second doses have been given across the UK. The UK has reported another 2,144 new Covid cases. Official data shows there were also a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This compares with 2,166 cases and 29 deaths a week ago. A nurse who has worked throughout the pandemic
is hoping to buy a home on a Caribbean island after winning Â£10,000 per month for a

Hobson, 62, hope the win will allow them to spend more time on the island of
Nevis, where Charlie's family are from. Teresa says she is proud of her work during the pandemic but feels she has now earned her retirement. ""I've
nursed all over the world in all sorts of conditions but never have I been tested

Leo Varadkar is the Republic of Ireland's deputy head of government Leo Varadkar, the Republic of Ireland's TÃ¡naiste or deputy head of government, has said he is hopeful most coronavirus restrictions will be gone by August. Speaking at the department of health in Dublin, Varadkar says he is looking at countries such as Israel and the UK where the vaccination programme is further ahead than in Ireland. ""They're welcoming tourists again and they're having not very large gatherings, but they are having mass gatherings,"" he says. He predicts outdoor dining could return by June, schools going back in September, and ""a pretty normal Christmas in terms of seeing our friends and relations"".  The number of coronavirus patients in Welsh hospitals is now the lowest it has been since the pandemic began. Across the country there were 204 patients with Covid-19 in hospital beds on Tuesday,according to NHS Wales,external.

Canada authorises Pfizer vaccine for ages 12 to 15,"Canada is the first country in the world to authorise the use of the vaccine for children aged 12 to 15 Canada has authorised the use of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine for children between the ages of 12 and 15. It is the first country to do so for that age group. The country's health ministry made the decision based on data from phase three clinical trials on children that age. ""The department determined that this vaccine is safe and effective when used in this younger age group,"" an adviser at the ministry said. Pfizer says its jab works well in the age group. Canada has already authorised the use of the Pfizer vaccine in people over 16. The province of Alberta, which has the highest rate of the virus in the country, said it would offer vaccines to those over 12 from Monday. Canada has recorded more than 1.2 million coronavirus cases and roughly 20% of those have been in people under the age of 19. The country's vaccine rollout has been relatively slow, caused by delivery delays. About 34% of people in the country have received at least one dose of the vaccinewhile the figure in the US stands at 44%,external, according to Our World in Data. Canada's vaccine rollout has been plagued by delays and supply issues The government has alsofaced criticism for drawing on a supply of Covid vaccines from the Covax inoculation-sharing scheme. Covax pools funds from wealthier countries to help buy vaccines for themselves and low-income nations. Children's risk of becoming very ill or dying with Covid-19 is tiny, and throughout the pandemic they have very rarely needed hospital treatment. US state offers free vaccines to Canadian truckers How will we know Covid vaccines are safe? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? As part of the vaccine's approval, Pfizer will have to continue providing information to Canada's health ministry on the safety, efficacy and quality of the vaccine in those aged 12 to 15. In March, Pfizer said initial results from trials of its vaccine in this age groupshowed 100% efficacy and a strong immune response. The US Food and Drug administration and the European Medicines Agency are currently reviewing whether they can authorise the jab for younger people, with decisions expected soon. US President Joe Biden this weeklaid out plans to roll out vaccines for 12- to 15-year-oldsas soon as possible. Pfizer is one of a number of vaccine manufacturers testing jabs on children. The aim of vaccinating them - particularly older children - would be to keep schools open, reduce the spread of coronavirus in the community and protect vulnerable children with conditions which put them at increased risk. Moderna and Johnson & Johnson are currently testing their vaccines on those aged 12-18, with Moderna's data expected soon. Moderna and Pfizer are also testing their jabs on younger children between six months and 11 years old. This video can not be played AtraZeneca's clinical trial on volunteers between six and 17 begin In the UK, AstraZeneca is testing its vaccine on 300 child volunteers. Researchers will assesswhether the jab produces a strong immune response in children aged between six and 17. On Wednesday, Mr Biden said he planned to back a World Trade Organisation waiver that would take away intellectual property rights from vaccine manufacturers. If approved, the waiver would allow production of vaccines to be ramped up and provide more affordable doses for less wealthier countries. World Health Organization (WHO) Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus described Mr Biden's backing as a""monumental moment in the fight against Covid"".,external By Rachel Schraer, BBC health reporter Children haven't generally been included in the first phase of most countries' vaccine programmes, because under-16s weren't included in the original trials. Drug companies are understandably wary to test products on children, especially when their risk from the disease the vaccine protects against is low. But for the families of children with certain health conditions that make them vulnerable to Covid, being sure the shot is safe takes on a whole different importance. Now we do have some trial data from Pfizer for 12- to 15-year-olds, suggesting the vaccine is both safe and effective. And Canada is the first country to act on this data. Although most children are not at high risk from Covid, if they can begin to be safely vaccinated it is believed this could help countries to achieve herd immunity, reducing the chances of disease outbreaks in the future. And with many countries struggling to vaccinate their most vulnerable populations - against a virus that doesn't respect borders - the Canadian move could raise questions about whether the vaccines could be prioritised better elsewhere.

Total doses may include booster doses in addition to those required for full vaccination. The definition of full vaccination varies by location and vaccine type and is subject to change over time. Full vaccination can refer to a person receiving all required doses of a specific vaccine or sometimes recovery from infection plus one dose of a vaccine. Definitions have not yet been updated to account for booster campaigns to control the spread of new variants. Some locations may reach vaccination rates over 100%, such as Gibraltar, due to population estimates that are lower than the number of people who have now been vaccinated in that place.

LiveLiveWelsh election: Last chance to win over the voters4 minutes ago,"Politicians have been making their last-ditch bids to win over the voters ahead of polling day on Thursday Chancellor Rishi Sunak joined the Conservative effort to repeat their general election gains in north Wales Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford visited the Vale of Glamorgan to defend another Tory target seat Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price campaigned in Carmarthenshire, hoping to capture Labour-held Llanelli Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds turned her focus to defending the party's Brecon and Radnorshire seat Rachel Flint, Natalie Grice and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the final day of campaigning in Wales for tomorrow's Senedd election. Polling stations will be open from 0700 to 2200 BST on Thursday. The results will take a little longer than usual to come, not least because counting in Wales will not start until Friday morning due to the pandemic. Click herefor details of results coverage from the BBC on TV, radio, online and social media. We hope you'll join us again soon. Polling stations will be open for tomorrow's Senedd and police and crime commissioner elections, but there will be rules to ensure voting is Covid safe. Full details are available,externalon the Welsh Government website. Covid measures were in place at the Russian Embassy in London last summer when ex-pat Russians used it as a polling station for a referendum Jenny Rathbone said Labour had allowed Plaid Cymru to appear the more radical party A Welsh Labour candidate has said she would have preferred âa
slightly more radical approachâ in her partyâs Senedd manifesto. Jenny Rathbone said she thought it was ""slightly over-cautious"", allowing Plaid Cymru to ""nibble away at people who want something more radicalâ. âItâs a cautious approach. I would have preferred us to have
a slightly more radical approach,"" she told theLabourList,externalwebsite. Ms Rathbone said she thought Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford was ""as radical"" as the party's former UK leader Jeremy Corbyn, but ""a much more cautious guy"". ""He doesnât promise anything he feels he canât
deliver, which I think is the right way to go about it,"" she said. âOverpromise and underdeliver? Not politically very sharp."" However, Ms Rathbone added: âI think Markâs objective was to ensure that
Plaid didnât appear to be more radical than us, and I donât think that heâs
managed to do it.â If you're going to the polls tomorrow in Wales you'll also be given a ballot paper to choose a police and crime commissioner.

Shavanah Taj of the Wales TUC said urgent action was needed to ""rebuild a fairer and more resilient Wales"" With just hours left before the polls open, trade unions are calling for the next Welsh government to ""fight for fairness"". The Wales TUC is calling for pay rises for all public sector workers, including NHS staff, porters and cleaners, with 85% of members backing pay increases for nurses. In its manifesto, ahead of Thursday's vote, the organisation said workers backed further devolution of powers from London to Cardiff Bay. Wales TUC General Secretary Shavanah Taj said people should elect a new government which would ""prioritise greater workplace equality and fight to make Wales a Fair Work nation"". âThe last year has shown the grim reality of our labour market for tens of thousands of workers across Wales,"" she said. ""Young workers, BAME workers, and people in insecure work have been disproportionately hit â losing jobs, income, skills and opportunities."" Ms Taj added that urgent action was needed to ""rebuild a fairer and more resilient Wales"". David DeansBBC Wales politics reporter More people have registered for
a postal vote in the 2021 Senedd election than in the last assembly election
five years ago. But the figures, which are not
complete, suggest there may not be a substantial increase on the numbers from
2016 despite the pandemic. Figures
obtained by BBC Wales show that at least 451,006 people have registered to vote by
post across Wales' 40 constituencies. That is at
least 14% more than the 395,878 postal voters in the Welsh Assembly election in
2016. However, the
overall number of people registered to vote has risen by 6%, from 2.2m to 2.3m. The postal vote figures do not
include the Monmouthshire part of Newport East, but without those figures it
amounts to at least 19% of the electorate. Thatâs compared to 17.62% in
2016. Many of the figures were
provided by the Association of Electoral Administrators, and by some individual
councils. BBC Wales correspondent Hywel Griffith is not the only one to note that visiting politicians seem inordinately keen on eating chips at the Welsh seaside.

Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent In a brief
interview with us here in the Vale of Clwyd, Rishi Sunak hit the Conservatives'
key message that the Tories offer change in this election. We didn't cover
much ground. His aides called time after two questions. The chancellor also
pointed to the billions in additional funding he's given the Welsh government
during the pandemic. Around Â£1bn is waiting to be allocated after the
election. But there is a
question about what happens when all that money has been spent. The clever people
at the Wales Governance Centre talk about the possible implications in their
fascinating analysis of the three main parties' manifestos.You can see it here,external. As far as the
Tories' manifesto is concerned, the analysis says paying for all its promises â
such as on NHS funding and a possible income-tax cut â will overshoot
pessimistic projections for the size of the budget. Like the Tories,
Plaid Cymru would also need a more generous settlement from Westminster.
Labour's plans are more modest. What they all have
in common is a âlack of detail on spending across the boardâ, the analysis team
says. By the way, it's
not surprising the chancellor chose to come to the Vale of Clwyd constituency,
the seat Sir Keir Starmer visited yesterday. It's a key
Labour-Tory battleground. If the Tories are heading for a good result â and a
poll out today will buoy their confidence â many would consider this seat the
most likely to turn blue. There aremore Steves and Daves running in Thursday's Senedd electionthan there are women candidates running in all but one of the 18 parties standing. Of the 469 candidates, 14 are called Steve, Stephen or Steven and there are 11 named David, Dave or Dai. The only party fielding more women than the combined number of candidates called Steve or Dave is Welsh Labour. The party's 50/50 gender split between its 60 candidates means it had 30 women standing. Plaid Cymru has put forward 19 women candidates (35%) and the Welsh Conservatives have 17 (30%). As might be expected, the most common candidate surname in Wales for Thursday's election is Jones with a total of 23 standing. That is followed by Davies (15), Williams (13) and Evans (11). At this election 16 and 17-year-olds can vote for the first time Tens of thousands of young people have not taken up the chance to vote for the first time at the Senedd election. On Thursday, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to vote in the Welsh Parliament election after the voting age was lowered. However,figures compiled by the BBC suggest 54% of young people have failed to register to votein Thursday's poll. The data compares numbers registered with population estimates for 21 of Wales' 22 council areas. Figures show 2,421,108 people in Wales - about 76.7% of the whole population - are registered. The finding comes despite the efforts of grime artists, fitness stars, and Instagram and TikTok influencers to engage young people in the election. However, campaigners have said they felt young people were not being listened to by politicians, and that parties had not done enough to reach potential new voters. Leader Jane Dodds takes to the streets on the final day of campaigning The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats has
acknowledged she is not going to be the next first minister of Wales. Jane Dodds is campaigning in the seat of Brecon and
Radnorshire on the final day before voters go to the polls. The seat was previously held by the Lib Demsâ only
MS in the last Senedd, Kirsty Williams. Speaking outside the Minersâ Institute in Ystradgynlais, Ms
Dodds said: âI would love to be first minister, but I'm going to be honest, I'm
not going to be the first minister of Wales this time. âI think, if I had a chance of being in government, the
first thing that I would be doing is looking at child poverty. I would want to
look at how we can address child poverty here in Wales."" Ms Dodds declined to rule out entering a coalition with
any of the other parties after the election, but said her primary concern was
winning more seats. âWe're very clear that right now we're going to fight for
every single vote,â she said. âWe're not taking anything for granted. We're not bargaining
with any votes. Let's see what happens tomorrow, and we'll take it from there. âCertainly we want to win Brecon and Radnorshire, but we are

is âbattling hard in north Walesâ. Labour lost four seats to the Conservatives in the north east at

hoping to gain from Labour. Asked if the fact he had chosen to go to the Vale of

Welsh election: Last bids to win over the votersAs it happened - parties battle to win hearts and minds on the last day of the campaign.,"Politicians have been making their last-ditch bids to win over the voters ahead of polling day on Thursday Chancellor Rishi Sunak joined the Conservative effort to repeat their general election gains in north Wales Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford visited the Vale of Glamorgan to defend another Tory target seat Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price campaigned in Carmarthenshire, hoping to capture Labour-held Llanelli Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds turned her focus to defending the party's Brecon and Radnorshire seat Rachel Flint, Natalie Grice and Andy Roberts Thanks for joining us for our live coverage of the final day of campaigning in Wales for tomorrow's Senedd election. Polling stations will be open from 0700 to 2200 BST on Thursday. The results will take a little longer than usual to come, not least because counting in Wales will not start until Friday morning due to the pandemic. Click herefor details of results coverage from the BBC on TV, radio, online and social media. We hope you'll join us again soon. Polling stations will be open for tomorrow's Senedd and police and crime commissioner elections, but there will be rules to ensure voting is Covid safe. Full details are available,externalon the Welsh Government website. Covid measures were in place at the Russian Embassy in London last summer when ex-pat Russians used it as a polling station for a referendum Jenny Rathbone said Labour had allowed Plaid Cymru to appear the more radical party A Welsh Labour candidate has said she would have preferred âa
slightly more radical approachâ in her partyâs Senedd manifesto. Jenny Rathbone said she thought it was ""slightly over-cautious"", allowing Plaid Cymru to ""nibble away at people who want something more radicalâ. âItâs a cautious approach. I would have preferred us to have
a slightly more radical approach,"" she told theLabourList,externalwebsite. Ms Rathbone said she thought Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford was ""as radical"" as the party's former UK leader Jeremy Corbyn, but ""a much more cautious guy"". ""He doesnât promise anything he feels he canât
deliver, which I think is the right way to go about it,"" she said. âOverpromise and underdeliver? Not politically very sharp."" However, Ms Rathbone added: âI think Markâs objective was to ensure that
Plaid didnât appear to be more radical than us, and I donât think that heâs
managed to do it.â If you're going to the polls tomorrow in Wales you'll also be given a ballot paper to choose a police and crime commissioner. The elected posts - one for each force area - were created by the UK government in 2012 with the aim of giving greater scrutiny and local public accountability to policing.

Shavanah Taj of the Wales TUC said urgent action was needed to ""rebuild a fairer and more resilient Wales"" With just hours left before the polls open, trade unions are calling for the next Welsh government to ""fight for fairness"". The Wales TUC is calling for pay rises for all public sector workers, including NHS staff, porters and cleaners, with 85% of members backing pay increases for nurses. In its manifesto, ahead of Thursday's vote, the organisation said workers backed further devolution of powers from London to Cardiff Bay. Wales TUC General Secretary Shavanah Taj said people should elect a new government which would ""prioritise greater workplace equality and fight to make Wales a Fair Work nation"". âThe last year has shown the grim reality of our labour market for tens of thousands of workers across Wales,"" she said. ""Young workers, BAME workers, and people in insecure work have been disproportionately hit â losing jobs, income, skills and opportunities."" Ms Taj added that urgent action was needed to ""rebuild a fairer and more resilient Wales"". David DeansBBC Wales politics reporter More people have registered for
a postal vote in the 2021 Senedd election than in the last assembly election
five years ago. But the figures, which are not
complete, suggest there may not be a substantial increase on the numbers from
2016 despite the pandemic. Figures
obtained by BBC Wales show that at least 451,006 people have registered to vote by
post across Wales' 40 constituencies. That is at
least 14% more than the 395,878 postal voters in the Welsh Assembly election in
2016. However, the
overall number of people registered to vote has risen by 6%, from 2.2m to 2.3m. The postal vote figures do not
include the Monmouthshire part of Newport East, but without those figures it
amounts to at least 19% of the electorate. Thatâs compared to 17.62% in
2016. Many of the figures were
provided by the Association of Electoral Administrators, and by some individual
councils. BBC Wales correspondent Hywel Griffith is not the only one to note that visiting politicians seem inordinately keen on eating chips at the Welsh seaside.

Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent In a brief
interview with us here in the Vale of Clwyd, Rishi Sunak hit the Conservatives'
key message that the Tories offer change in this election. We didn't cover
much ground. His aides called time after two questions. The chancellor also
pointed to the billions in additional funding he's given the Welsh government
during the pandemic. Around Â£1bn is waiting to be allocated after the
election. But there is a
question about what happens when all that money has been spent. The clever people
at the Wales Governance Centre talk about the possible implications in their
fascinating analysis of the three main parties' manifestos.You can see it here,external. As far as the
Tories' manifesto is concerned, the analysis says paying for all its promises â
such as on NHS funding and a possible income-tax cut â will overshoot
pessimistic projections for the size of the budget. Like the Tories,
Plaid Cymru would also need a more generous settlement from Westminster.
Labour's plans are more modest. What they all have
in common is a âlack of detail on spending across the boardâ, the analysis team
says. By the way, it's
not surprising the chancellor chose to come to the Vale of Clwyd constituency,
the seat Sir Keir Starmer visited yesterday. It's a key
Labour-Tory battleground. If the Tories are heading for a good result â and a
poll out today will buoy their confidence â many would consider this seat the
most likely to turn blue. There aremore Steves and Daves running in Thursday's Senedd electionthan there are women candidates running in all but one of the 18 parties standing. Of the 469 candidates, 14 are called Steve, Stephen or Steven and there are 11 named David, Dave or Dai. The only party fielding more women than the combined number of candidates called Steve or Dave is Welsh Labour. The party's 50/50 gender split between its 60 candidates means it had 30 women standing. Plaid Cymru has put forward 19 women candidates (35%) and the Welsh Conservatives have 17 (30%). As might be expected, the most common candidate surname in Wales for Thursday's election is Jones with a total of 23 standing. That is followed by Davies (15), Williams (13) and Evans (11). At this election 16 and 17-year-olds can vote for the first time Tens of thousands of young people have not taken up the chance to vote for the first time at the Senedd election. On Thursday, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to vote in the Welsh Parliament election after the voting age was lowered. However,figures compiled by the BBC suggest 54% of young people have failed to register to votein Thursday's poll. The data compares numbers registered with population estimates for 21 of Wales' 22 council areas. Figures show 2,421,108 people in Wales - about 76.7% of the whole population - are registered. The finding comes despite the efforts of grime artists, fitness stars, and Instagram and TikTok influencers to engage young people in the election. However, campaigners have said they felt young people were not being listened to by politicians, and that parties had not done enough to reach potential new voters. Leader Jane Dodds takes to the streets on the final day of campaigning The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats has
acknowledged she is not going to be the next first minister of Wales. Jane Dodds is campaigning in the seat of Brecon and
Radnorshire on the final day before voters go to the polls. The seat was previously held by the Lib Demsâ only
MS in the last Senedd, Kirsty Williams. Speaking outside the Minersâ Institute in Ystradgynlais, Ms
Dodds said: âI would love to be first minister, but I'm going to be honest, I'm
not going to be the first minister of Wales this time. âI think, if I had a chance of being in government, the
first thing that I would be doing is looking at child poverty. I would want to
look at how we can address child poverty here in Wales."" Ms Dodds declined to rule out entering a coalition with
any of the other parties after the election, but said her primary concern was
winning more seats. âWe're very clear that right now we're going to fight for
every single vote,â she said. âWe're not taking anything for granted. We're not bargaining
with any votes. Let's see what happens tomorrow, and we'll take it from there. âCertainly we want to win Brecon and Radnorshire, but we are
looking to get some places in the regional seats as well which we've always
done well in,"" she said. Asked whether her leadership was tenable if the party failed
to gain any representation in the Senedd, Ms Dodds said she would not stand
down regardless of the outcome. âMy position as leader will be that I will carry on. âI'm not here to talk
about my job, I'm here to talk about the jobs of others. That's what's most
important, that's what we're hearing on the doorstep - that people want us to

India's opposition Congress party is calling for a full lockdown in order for the country to get on top of the current wave of coronavirus - saying it is the ""only option left"". Spokesman Pawan Khera tells BBC World News the government has ignored the warnings of experts and been too slow to react to the scale of the current epidemic. The national spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not rejected a lockdown but has decided to leave it to individual states to impose measures. You can watch Khera's comments below. This video can not be played A 12-year-old girl who sued her school in an attempt to prevent it from ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of masks has lost her court case. The pupil, known only as AB, sued the Tapton Academy School Trust in Sheffield, claiming mask-wearing risks causing âserious harmâ to childrenâs physical and mental health. The trust says its policy is to encourage mask-wearing, not to enforce it. More than 10% of staff across its schools have been infected since August, the trust had said, underlining the risk to health. Today, Judge Roger ter Haar QC has rejected the request for an injunction because of ""a fundamental defect"" - the pupil had already been given an exemption from wearing a mask, so the injunction was not necessary to protect her health and safety. He says he made âno conclusions whatsoever as to the safety or otherwise of requiring children to wear face masks at schoolâ, although he noted concerns were ""strongly held"" by people such as AB's father and those who crowdfunded the legal case. But the judge says evidence submitted on the physical and psychological risks of wearing masks âdo not represent universal scientific and medical views"". Visitors to Blackpool could be asked to take Covid tests at their hotels in a bid to keep outbreaks at bay once the seaside town fully reopens. The town's council is in talks with local hospitality businesses about rolling out the voluntary tests. Concerns about the impact of an influx of tourists on case numbers were raised at the authority's audit committee. The town has often suffered high infection rates throughout the pandemic. Read more. The UK has said its programme of booster vaccine shots could start in September, while a World Health Organization official isurging wealthy countries to delayuntil hard-hit nations are fully vaccinated. But why might booster jabs be needed? Countries are carefully monitoring coronavirus for mutations that might help it spread, make people sicker or overpower vaccines - so they can adjust their vaccination programmes and keep the virus under control. About 200 cases ofthe India variant(B.1.617) had been confirmed in the UK as of 28 April. It's the latest variant to come under scrutiny, but there's not yet enough evidence to make it an official ""variant of concern"" or to show it's directly responsible for India'srecent surge in Covid-19 cases. Current vaccines were designed for earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work, albeit potentially less well. Experts are confident existing vaccines can be redesigned to better tackle emerging mutations. The UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Read more on how the variants are tracked  Staff at Cardiff's biggest intensive care unit are creating a woodland to offset carbon emissions created by machines used to treat Covid patients in hospital. More than 1,000 trees have been planted near Crickhowell in Wales. One of those involved, Dr Jack Parry-Jones, describes the effort as ""a lasting memorial"" to staff and patients.

It is understood 34 cruise workers from India arrived in Torquay last week to board the Marella Explorer as the industry prepares to restart fully.

A surge in traffic is expected this summer, as people seek UK getaways Traffic on Britain's roads at the weekend returned to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September. But Department of Transport figures show the traffic levels were driven by heavy and light goods vehicles. Those were at 112% and 118% of normal levels over Sunday 25 April and Saturday 1 May. The RAC Foundation suggests the higher levels of delivery vehicles were caused by the popularity of online shopping in the pandemic. Car use was at 95% and 96% of pre-pandemic levels on the same two days, while on weekdays usage was only at an average of 88%. AA president Edmund King says workers staying away from offices are largely responsible for the 10% of previous car travel no longer taking place. He says ""there is a growing feeling that coronavirus will continue to cast a shadow over travel even after June"" but ""a surge in car travel during the summer"" is expected as people celebrate the end of lockdown with a UK holiday. Demand for public transport is returning more slowly, with bus use at 54% of normal levels outside London and 60% within the capital. And people are only taking 34% of the usual number of journeys on the mainline rail network. India is grappling with a devastating second wave of Covid infections, which is overwhelming hospitals in major cities including Delhi.

""70% of India's population lives in rural India, and there are no hospital facilities there,"" he says.

The UK's current rules say you should stay 2m (6ft) away from anyone you don't live with, or are in a social bubble with. In England, if it's not possible to stay 2m apart, the ""one-metre plus"" guidance means you should be at least 1m (3ft) apartwith extra precautions in place,external, such as face coverings. In some pubs, restaurants and cafes in Scotland you can be1m apart from people you don't live with,external. If you meet friends for a meal, the venue must ensure there is enough space between you.

Canada has become the first nationto approve the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 and over. Chief medical advisor of Health Canada Dr Supriya Sharma tells a press conference the decision is ""a significant milestone"" in the fight against Covid. ""The department determined that this vaccine is safe and
effective when used in this younger age group,"" she says. ""We are
starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel."" Critics have criticised what some see as the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in Canada. According to Our World in Data, the country has delivered 37.85 doses per 100 people - about half the rate in the US. More than 30% of UK adults have now received the second dose of a Covid vaccine, the official data shows. Another 257,486 people had their second jab on Tuesday, meaning 15,630,007 people, or 30.2% of all adults, have had both vaccinations. A total of 127,170 people received their first dose, the latest figures show, taking that measurement to 34,667,904 (66.1% of all adults). It means 50,682,567 first and second doses have been given across the UK. The UK has reported another 2,144 new Covid cases. Official data shows there were also a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This compares with 2,166 cases and 29 deaths a week ago. A nurse who has worked throughout the pandemic

Can Labour strike lucky twice in Welsh election?Small numbers of votes could determine the outcome and the distribution of seats in the Senedd.Wales,"Three of Wales' four party leaders are challenging in their first Welsh election as a leader These Senedd elections are not the ones we anticipated and there's a strange contradictory feel to them. It's been a low-key campaign which has scarcely dazzled, yet the results on Friday feel more significant than ever. The Members of the Senedd - or MSs - elected will serve in a proper parliament with law-making and tax setting powers. Added excitement comes from the very tight margins that will decide at least a quarter of the constituency seats and several regional list seats. Final day of campaigning in Senedd election race Five things to find out from the Welsh election Who should I vote for in the Welsh election? Small shifts in votes could determine the distribution of seats to parties and therefore the shape of our next Welsh government. So, the final results are unpredictable, dependent as they are on several important unknowns. First, this is a Covid election - both practically and policy wise. How will Covid affect the outcome of the election? We are edging out of lockdown, but with gargantuan recovery problems ahead. Most of us had imagined a dramatically different political landscape for Senedd 2021, framed by post-Brexit adaptation not a pandemic. Then there's turnout: I called devolution Wales' 'dirty little secret' as no election has generated a turnout of above 50%, impacting on Senedd credibility and legitimacy. It should be higher this time, but who knows as we ease out of lockdown restrictions. It's also less about the raw percentage figure and more about who actually goes out to vote that matters - this time more than ever, with such small margins deciding many seats. This video can not be played Once the votes are cast and the polls close on 6 May, what's next? Tyler Edwards explains Whilst the overall votes are likely to be split relatively evenly between the three big parties, Wales's semi-hybrid - and increasingly dysfunctional - electoral system benefits the largest party whilst offering opportunities for the smaller parties on the regional list. Attention will be on whether Welsh Labour can win an overall majority (and no party's ever achieved this) or has to govern alongside Plaid Cymru, with or without a formal coalition. What about the other 'c's - credibility and the constitution? TheBBC Leaders' Debate last weekwas not a dial shifter, but it did expose parties on the campaigning front and back foot. Voters will also have been able to judge the credibility of the main contenders for first minister. What will the turnout be at this year's Senedd election? Welsh Labour's campaigning has been all about packing its defence and playing up its sure footed Covid handling. The party's had least need to adapt, keeping the push on its track record of delivery, competence and trust. Labour has been in power for all of devolution's 22 years and the most (small 'c') conservative and successful political party in Wales (there's a lesson there) is running on a platform of carrying on with what it's doing. This video can not be played James Williams looks at how many people have turned out to vote in the past It has been helped by the fact that Mark Drakeford has become an electoral asset, newly recognised and mostly popular, an avuncular ""safe pair of hands"". Amongst the Welsh-identifying, centre-left part of the electorate, Covid handling is not a particularly promising route to criticise the Labour government. Bluntly, this impacts Plaid Cymru most. Adam Price is hoping Plaid Cymru can win over Labour voters Plaid's intention to make the case for the removal of Mark Drakeford was wrecked by Covid. Voters appear ensconced in national identity ""tribes"" with limited crossover between them. Welsh Labour and Plaid currently share the same tribal identity - but Labour is clearly dominant. Plaid's planned presidential campaign had its charismatic leader, Adam Price front and centre but its hopes of replacing Welsh Labour Ã  la SNP were shattered by the way Welsh public opinion realigned over Covid. It's fair to say that Welsh Labour has ridden its luck in Senedd elections, not least in 2016 when it clung on to many seats in what became known as the 'Red Wall' - often by very small margins, a good way of describing this is as a very efficient votes to seats won ratio! This time, seats like Llanelli, Wrexham, Brecon and Radnorshire, Gower, Delyn, Rhondda, Vale of Clwyd, Caerphilly and Vale of Glamorgan are all interesting for different reasons. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been campaigning in Wales and the Tories hope the voters who backed them in the General Election will turn out Still, due to the inbuilt compensatory mechanism of our electoral system, Labour would have to lose several constituency seats in the south, including some in the valleys to Plaid, not to be the largest party on 7 May. The problem for the Tories is that it's not as straightforward as getting out the half a million Welsh voters who supported them in 2019. That was a UK election, all about getting Brexit done - and ""done"" it is in most people's minds. We know that many in the 'Red Wall' were not necessarily natural Tories and there's long been plenty of voter mobility in Wales. Campaign group Yes Cymru has organised a series of marches as it increases support for independence Andrew RT Davies' populist style might well capture some of UKIP's sizeable vote last time around, but that might be too dispersed to help the Welsh Conservatives win many of their targets. Before recent events at Downing Street, the Welsh Conservatives were in bullish mood. They will still likely make some seat gains but what currency will these have given Davies has effectively ruled out all feasible routes to governing? Still, winning some of its plausible Labour-held targets would probably seal the results day narrative and surely be noticed at UK level given the potential implications for both Johnson and Starmer. Despite plenty of interest in the topic from media far and wide, this is not an independence election. Nevertheless, strong support for independence amongst young voters - especially with 16- and 17-year-olds now on the electoral roll - and amongst Labour supporters might prove critical if a mandate for Indy Ref 2 is delivered in Scotland. If Plaid plays the long game, this could prove significant. Adam Price ruled out most realistic coalitions early doors, but his party's best hope now is for a last-minute surge in support in a couple of key constituencies, along with picking up a couple of extra regional list seats. If Labour doesn't manage to ride its luck twice - and its 2016 results represent a high bar after all- this would mean some fascinating negotiations over the shape of our next government.

Indian delegates in UK for G7 talks self-isolateThe foreign minister - who met Home Secretary Priti Patel on Tuesday - will carry out meetings virtually.UK,"The entire Indian delegation in the UK for G7 talks must self-isolate after two Covid cases were detected. India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar pulled out of face-to-face talks, saying he was ""aware of exposure to possible Covid positive cases"". He met Home Secretary Priti Patel in person on Tuesday but joined the rest of the meetings virtually. India is not in the G7 group of nations but delegates from the country were invited as guests. The two cases were picked up by tests in advance and none of the party had attended the meeting venue, the Press Association said. Mr Jaishankar has not tested positive. India is currently on the UK's red list meaning travel from there is banned, but some jobs are exempt including representatives of a foreign country. There are also exemptions to the self-isolation rule ""if it is confirmed that you are travelling to the UK for official business that cannot be undertaken while self-isolating"",according to the government's rules.,external India's foreign minister, right, also spoke with the US delegation earlier this week The G7 group - the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. The official summit of G7 leaders is taking place in Cornwall next month, but ministers are currently in the UK for talks. The talks this week were the first face-to-face meetings the G7 powers have had in more than two years. India, Australia, South Korea and South Africa attended as guests.

Themeeting on Wednesday was between foreign ministers,,externalwho were greeted by Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab with elbow and fist bumps in the courtyard of Lancaster House in London. Mr Raab greets his South Korean counterpart at the G7 foreign ministers meeting They then went to the summit room where the ministers were separated from one another by clear screens in order to minimise any risk from coronavirus. They discussed new ways to ensure fairer access to vaccine stockpiles and increase support for the global vaccine distribution scheme known as Covax. Also on the agenda on Wednesday was media freedom, arbitrary detentionand girls' education. On the news that positive cases had been found among the India delegation, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said there were questions that needed to be raised ""about how this happened"". ""It is a reminder of how vigilant we need to be about our borders,"" he said, adding: ""Let's get to the bottom of how this happened - we cannot have a repeat."" Asked whether holding the G7 meeting in person was a mistake because of the risk of Covid variants, Boris Johnson said it was ""very important to try to continue as much business as you can as a government"". ""As I understand it, what has happened is the individuals concerned are all isolating now,"" the prime minister said. ""I will be seeing the Indian foreign minister later this afternoon but that will be a Zoom exchange."" At the end of their meeting, the ministersissued a lengthy communiquÃ©,external.

Extra vaccines cash to future-proof UK - minister,"Extra funding to fast-track new vaccines will help ""future-proof"" the UK against new coronavirus variants, the vaccines minister has said. Existing vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps mutating. Nadhim Zahawi said the Â£29.3m funding increase would boost testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory. Separately, he said booster jabs would be ready to deploy from September. Asked about reports inthe Times,externalthat third jabs would be given to over-50s and those with underlying health conditions in the autumn, the vaccines minister said no decision had been made yet. Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the booster programme could begin in September ""or later in the year, or early next year"". He said clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme. Clinical trials will also be looking at the evidence on mixing different vaccines to see what will offer the most protection. Coronavirus variants: What you need to know about how Covid is changing What is the India Covid variant and will vaccines work? The vaccines minister also confirmed there would be an update from the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later this week about England restarting international travel. Meanwhile, the government said its extra funding - on top of Â£19.7m already promised - would also aid vaccine manufacture and allow scientists to accelerate the pace and scale of their work. The cash will allow scientists to test 3,000 blood samples a week, up from 700 at the moment, to measure the levels of protective antibodies against Covid-19 generated by different vaccines. Whether or not at-risk adults are offered a booster dose this autumn will depend on two key factors: whether immunity from the first two doses has waned so older adults are vulnerable to an autumn wave of infection; and whether a variant emerges which means the current vaccines can't prevent serious Covid disease. Until we know the answers, it would be wrong to assume a third booster dose is on the cards. But of course it is being planned for. All vaccine manufacturers are working on tweaked vaccines, which will aim to deal with so-called escape variants. And a key UK trial - which will offer people a third dose of a different vaccine to the one they initially received - is not yet under way. In January 2020, scientists across the world began work on vaccines against the novel coronavirus, long before the disease it caused even had a name. Had they waited until it was clear a vaccine was needed, the delay would have cost tens of millions of lives. The government is already making plans for a booster Covid-vaccine programme in the autumn, to protect the most vulnerable ahead of winter. Last week itordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters. And it may use new, updated vaccines that are a better match for emerging variants. But the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid, David Nabarro, said the global vaccine rollout should be prioritised over booster jabs in the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's the World At One, he said: ""What you do with a scarce preventive action like a vaccine is that you give it to the people who need it the most. You have to look at the issue as a world issue. ""Top ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries that should come a bit later,"" he said. Following the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years."" UK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: ""A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. ""This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants. ""While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops."" The government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Prof Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), saidnew variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic. ""In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,"" he told the BBC. ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Prof Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored ""carefully"", but the UK had gone from a ""terrible situation"" in January to a ""remarkably good situation now"". Covid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval. In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May.

India is a Covid disaster - it didn't have to be,"On Monday, a senior official from India's federal government told journalists that there was no shortage of oxygen in Delhi or anywhere else in the country. As he spoke, several small hospitals - only a few miles from where he stood in the capital - were sending out desperate messages about them running out of oxygen, putting patients' lives at risk. The chief doctor of one of the hospitals - a specialist paediatric facility - told the BBC that ""our hearts were in our mouths"" because of the risk of children dying. They got supplies just in time, after a local politician intervened. Delhi oxygen crisis deepens as more patients die Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituency A visual guide to the Covid crisis in India Barkha Dutt on her father's Covid-19 death And yet, the federal government has repeatedly insisted that there was no shortage. ""We are only facing problems in its transportation,"" Piyush Goyal, a senior official from India's home ministry, said. He also advised hospitals to ""ensure judicious use of oxygen as per the guidelines"". Several doctors who have spoken to the BBC say they are giving oxygen only to patients who need it, but there is not enough. But experts say that the shortage of oxygen is just one of the problems which shows both federal and state governments were not prepared, having failed to do enough to stop or minimise the damage of the second wave. A street in Delhi in early March, when, despite warnings, Indiaâs health minister said the country was in the âendgameâ of Covid-19 Warnings have in fact been repeatedly issued, including: In November, aparliamentary standing committee on health said there was an inadequate supply of oxygen,externaland ""grossly inadequate"" government hospital beds In February, several experts told the BBCthey feared an impending 'Covid tsunami' In early March, an expert group of scientists, set up by the government,warned officials about a more contagious variant of coronavirus spreading in the country,external- only for no significant containment measures to be taken, one scientist from the group told the BBC. The government has not made any comment on the allegations Despite this, on 8 March, the country's health minister announced thatIndia was in the ""endgame of the pandemic,external"". So, where did it go so wrong? In January and February, the national number of daily cases fell to under 20,000 from peaks of around 90,000 in September last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Covid beaten, andall places of public gathering opened. And soon, people were not adhering to Covid safety protocols, thanks in part to confused messaging from the top. While Mr Modi asked people to wear masks and follow social distancing in his public messages, he addressed large unmasked crowds during his election campaigns in five states. A number of his ministers were also seen addressing large public gatherings without wearing masks. The Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival - which attracts millions - was also allowed to go ahead. The Kumbh Mela religious festival in mid-April, which, like political rallies at the time, were attended unmasked ""There was complete disconnect between what they practised and what they preached,"" says public policy and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Prominent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says ""the government just did not see the second wave coming and started celebrating too early"". But there is more to the story: the devastation has also exposed the underfunding and neglect of the public healthcare system in India. The heart-breaking scenesthat have been witnessed outside hospitals - people dying without getting treatment - shows the grim reality of India's healthcare infrastructure. As one expert puts it, India's ""public health infrastructure was always broken, the rich and the middle class are just finding out"". Those who could afford it have always relied on private hospitals for treatment, while the poor struggle to get even a doctor's appointment. Recent schemes, like health insurance and subsidised medicines for the poor, are not helping because very little has been done in decades to increase the number of medical staff or hospitals. India's healthcare spending, including both private and public, has been around 3.6% of GDP for the past six years, the lowest percentage in the five Brics countries: Brazil spent the most at 9.2%, followed by South Africa at 8.1%, Russia at 5.3% and China at 5% in 2018. Developed nations spend a far higher proportion of their GDP on health.  In 2018, for instance, spending in the US was 16.9% and Germany 11.2%. Even smaller nations like Sri Lanka (3.76%) and Thailand (3.79%) spend more than India. And India has fewer than 10 doctors per 10,000 people, and in some states the figure is less than five. Several ""empowered committees"" were last year looking at the preparations needed to tackle the next coronavirus wave, so experts are baffled by the shortages of oxygen, beds and drugs. ""When the first wave was tapering, that's when they should have prepared for a second wave and assumed the worst. They should have taken an inventory of oxygen and [the drug] remdesivir and then ramped up manufacturing capacity,"" Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra state, told the BBC. Officials say India produces enough oxygen to meet the spike in demand but transportation was the problem. Experts say this should have been fixed much earlier. The government is now running special trains carrying oxygen from one state to another and stopping use of oxygen in industries - but only aftermany patients died because of a lack of oxygen. Very ill patients have been stuck outside hospitals as they wait for beds to become available ""The outcome has been that desperate family members are spending thousands of rupees to secure an oxygen cylinder on the black market and then stand for hours in a queue to get it filled,"" points out Dr Lahariya. Meanwhile, those who can afford itare also paying hefty amounts to procure drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab. An executive from a pharmaceutical company which manufactures remdesivir said ""demand had dried up"" in January and February.  ""If the government had placed an order, we would have stockpiled and there wouldn't have been any shortage. We have ramped up production but demand has grown significantly,"" he said. In contrast, the southern state of Kerala planned for the surge in advance. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of the state's Covid taskforce, says there was no shortage of oxygen in the state as necessary steps were taken in October last year. Relatives of patients have been refilling oxygen cylinders themselves ""We also procured sufficient stock of remdesivir and tocilizumab and other drugs well in advance. We also have a surge plan in place to tackle any exponential rise in the numbers in the coming weeks,"" he says. Mr Zagade says other states should have also taken similar steps ""to avoid the suffering"". ""Learning means someone else has done it and you can do it now, but that means it will take time,"" the former health secretary for Maharashtra said. But time is running out as the second wave is now spreading to villages where healthcare systems are not equipped to deal with the surge. Genome sequencing of the virus is an important step in identifying new variants that could be more infectious and deadly. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up last year and it brought together 10 labs in the country. But the group reportedly struggled to get funding initially,external. Virologist Dr Jameel says India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only ""properly started"" in mid-February 2021. India is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. ""In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,"" he said. However, India's main hope was always vaccination. This woman wanted to record the moment of vaccination ""Any public health specialist will tell you there is no practical way to strengthen an already broken public healthcare system in a matter of months,"" one woman, whose family runs a large private hospital in Delhi, told the BBC. ""The best and most effective alternative to battle Covid was to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible so the majority wouldn't need hospital care and hence not overburden the healthcare system."" India initially wanted 300 million people vaccinated by July, ""but it seems the government did not do enough planning to secure vaccine supply to run the programme"", Dr Lahariya says. ""On top of it, it has opened the vaccination for all adults without securing vaccine supplies."" So far, only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. India has millions more doses on order, but still far short of what it actually needs. The federal government needs 615 million doses to vaccinate everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. There are 622 million people between the age of 18 and 44, and 1.2 billion doses are required to vaccinate them. India's vaccine shortage: The wait gets longer What is the India Covid variant? The government has also cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. The government has enlisted other firms like Biological E and the state-run Haffkine Institute to produce vaccines. It has also given credit support of $609m to the Serum Institute of India, which produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab which is being made in India as Covishield, to ramp up production. But that funding should have come earlier, Dr Lahariya says, saving precious lives. ""It will take months before we have enough vaccines to speed up the programme. In the meantime, millions will continue to be at risk of getting Covid,"" he adds. Experts say it is ironic that India is known as the world's pharmacy and it is now facing shortages of vaccines and drugs. All of this, Dr Lahariya says, should serve as wake-up call for for both federal and state governments, which should invest drastically more in the healthcare sector because ""this definitely is not the last pandemic we will have to fight against"". ""The future pandemic may come earlier than any model can predict,"" he says.

Meghan wins remaining copyright claim over letter,"The Duchess of Sussex has won the remainder of her copyright claim against the Mail on Sunday over the publication of a letter to her estranged father. In February,Meghan won most of her claimfor misuse of private information and copyright infringement. But the newspaper had suggested she may not have been the sole copyright owner. The duchess won her case after her former communications secretary denied co-writing the letter. Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) - the publisher of the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline - had previously argued the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's former communications secretary Jason Knauf was a co-author of the letter, meaning its copyright belonged to the Crown. On Wednesday, the High Court heard that Mr Knauf has ""emphatically"" denied co-writing the letter to Thomas Markle. Through his lawyers, he said ""it was the duchess's letter alone"". Damage 'runs deep' says Meghan, after privacy win Meghan's Mail on Sunday statement on hold Ian Mill, representing the duchess, told the court that this ""gives the lie"" to the newspaper's suggestion that Meghan considered using the letter ""as part of a media strategy"". The court also heard that lawyers representing ""the Keeper of the Privy Purse, acting on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen"" told Meghan's solicitors they ""did not consider the Crown to be the copyright owner"". Launching their case against ANL in 2019, Prince Harry and Meghan said they were forced to take action against ""relentless propaganda"", with the duke saying he feared his wife would fall victim to ""the same powerful forces"" as his mother. In the High Court in February, Lord Justice Warby ruled the publication of Meghan's handwritten letter to her father by the Mail on Sunday and MailOnline was ""manifestly excessive and hence unlawful"". The judge said it was a ""a personal and private letter"" that dealt with the duchess's ""feelings of anguish about her father's behaviour, as she saw it, and the resulting rift between them"". On Wednesday, Mr Mill acknowledged that Meghan had ""shared a draft"" of the letter with Harry and Mr Knauf ""for support, as this was a deeply painful process that they had lived through with her"". ""Mr Knauf was responsible for keeping the senior members of the royal household apprised of any public-facing issues, the media spectacle surrounding Mr Markle being one such issue,"" the barrister said. The former communications secretary had ""suggested that a reference to Mr Markle's ill-health be included"", which Meghan added, but he ""did not suggest any specific wording"", the court heard. His lawyers said he did not draft any part of the letter and ""would never have asserted copyright over any of their content"". Prince Harry and Meghan had said the publication of the letter was part of a ""relentless propaganda"" campaign Mr Knauf, who is now chief executive of the Royal Foundation, set up by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, had said in a joint letter with other royal aides in January thathe did not want to ""take sides"" in the legal dispute. Andrew Caldecott, representing the publisher, said it was a ""matter of regret"" that Mr Knauf had not made clear he was not the author of the letter sooner. He said as soon as ANL heard his account, the publisher indicated it would not oppose summary judgment in this case - meaning it could be resolved without going to trial. But ANL isapplying to the Court of Appeal for permission to appealagainst the judge's February ruling on privacy and copyright, when the duchess won the bulk of her case. An order that it must print a statement on its front page and page three that it infringed Meghan's copyright ison hold until the Court of Appeal's decision.

Two men sought over killing of Londoner in Lahore,"Mayra Zulfiqar studied at Middlesex University and went to school in Twickenham Police in Pakistan are searching for two men following the fatal shooting of a British woman in Lahore. Mahira Zulfiqar, 24, was found in a pool of blood in her flat on Monday. Punjab Police, citing an initial post-mortem report, told English-language newspaper Dawn that Ms Zulfiqar had been shot in the neck and arm. The law graduate from London had been threatened by two men who both wanted to marry her, according to legal documents seen by the BBC. Mourners attended Ms Zulfiqar's funeral in Lahore, while a special memorial service has been held at a mosque in Hounslow, west London. Ms Zulifqar's brother Faizan Muhammad, who was among those who attended the mosque, said his father had left for Pakistan. Mourners paid their respects to Ms Zulfiqar at a funeral service in Lahore In Pakistan, the chief investigating officer in the murder inquiry told the BBC that police teams were targeting addresses in Islamabad and Lahore but that no arrests had yet been made. A police report said Ms Zulfiqar's uncle Mohammad Nazeer found her body after receiving a phone call from her father, who lives in Feltham in west London, to say she had been killed. Mr Nazeer also said Ms Zulfiqar had told him she had become embroiled in a dispute with two male friends after she had refused their marriage proposals, and that they had threatened her with ""dire consequences"". Sayyed Ali, an operations superintendent at Punjab Police, told Dawn that forensic experts had visited and cordoned off the scene. ""We are also after two suspects and will share further details at a later stage,"" he said, adding that Ms Zulfiqar's phone had been found near her body. He said the phone was being analysed and that CCTV footage was also being examined. In a statement, the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office said: ""We are supporting the family of a British woman who died in Pakistan and are urgently seeking more information from the local authorities.

Extra vaccines cash to future-proof UK - ministerAlmost Â£30m of government funding will fast-track vaccines that fight new variants of coronavirus.HealthComments,"Extra funding to fast-track new vaccines will help ""future-proof"" the UK against new coronavirus variants, the vaccines minister has said. Existing vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps mutating. Nadhim Zahawi said the Â£29.3m funding increase would boost testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory. Separately, he said booster jabs would be ready to deploy from September. Asked about reports inthe Times,externalthat third jabs would be given to over-50s and those with underlying health conditions in the autumn, the vaccines minister said no decision had been made yet. Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the booster programme could begin in September ""or later in the year, or early next year"". He said clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme. Clinical trials will also be looking at the evidence on mixing different vaccines to see what will offer the most protection. Coronavirus variants: What you need to know about how Covid is changing What is the India Covid variant and will vaccines work? The vaccines minister also confirmed there would be an update from the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later this week about England restarting international travel. Meanwhile, the government said its extra funding - on top of Â£19.7m already promised - would also aid vaccine manufacture and allow scientists to accelerate the pace and scale of their work. The cash will allow scientists to test 3,000 blood samples a week, up from 700 at the moment, to measure the levels of protective antibodies against Covid-19 generated by different vaccines. Whether or not at-risk adults are offered a booster dose this autumn will depend on two key factors: whether immunity from the first two doses has waned so older adults are vulnerable to an autumn wave of infection; and whether a variant emerges which means the current vaccines can't prevent serious Covid disease. Until we know the answers, it would be wrong to assume a third booster dose is on the cards. But of course it is being planned for. All vaccine manufacturers are working on tweaked vaccines, which will aim to deal with so-called escape variants. And a key UK trial - which will offer people a third dose of a different vaccine to the one they initially received - is not yet under way. In January 2020, scientists across the world began work on vaccines against the novel coronavirus, long before the disease it caused even had a name. Had they waited until it was clear a vaccine was needed, the delay would have cost tens of millions of lives. The government is already making plans for a booster Covid-vaccine programme in the autumn, to protect the most vulnerable ahead of winter. Last week itordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters. And it may use new, updated vaccines that are a better match for emerging variants. But the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid, David Nabarro, said the global vaccine rollout should be prioritised over booster jabs in the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's the World At One, he said: ""What you do with a scarce preventive action like a vaccine is that you give it to the people who need it the most. You have to look at the issue as a world issue. ""Top ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries that should come a bit later,"" he said. Following the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years."" UK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: ""A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. ""This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants. ""While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops."" The government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Prof Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), saidnew variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic. ""In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,"" he told the BBC. ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Prof Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored ""carefully"", but the UK had gone from a ""terrible situation"" in January to a ""remarkably good situation now"". Covid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval. In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May.

End of an era as final Debenhams shops to close,"Debenhams has announced it will shut its remaining stores by 15 May, closing the door on more than 200 years of trade on UK high streets. The move means 49 more shops will go, on top of the 52 due to close on 8 May. The Debenhams brand will continue online after being bought by retailer Boohoo for Â£55m in January. The company traces its roots back to 1778 when William Clark opened a shop in London's West End, selling fabrics, bonnets and parasols. In 1813, William Debenham invested in the firm and it was renamed Clark & Debenham. Debenhams: Over 200 years of history What went wrong at Debenhams? Debenhams has already announced that 52 shops will close on 8 May. The remaining sites will shut on either 12 May or 15 May. Some 12,000 workers will lose their jobs. Back in the day: Westlife switched on Oxford Street's Christmas lights from Debenhams in 2005 In 1950 Debenhams had the distinction of being the biggest department store in the UK with 110 stores. Over the years, Debenhams expanded at a rapid rate. In 2006 it announced plans to double its number of stores to 240 and was opening new shops as recently as 2017. However, the chain had struggled for years with falling profits and rising debts, as more shopping moved online. It called in administrators twice in two years, most recently in April 2020. But the coronavirus pandemic - which saw the enforced closure of non-essential retail outlets - proved to be the final blow for Debenhams and other rival retailers including Top Shop-owner Arcadia. Businessman Mike Ashley, who founded Sports Direct and also owns House of Fraser, had already made an offer for Debenhams after it was initially put up for sale in April of last year. However, the takeover offer, thought to be in the region of Â£125m, was rejected as being too low. Then in December final hopes of a rescue were crushed after the last remaining bidder JD Sports withdrew. Administrators announced they would start closing the remaining 124 stores, after the last ditch attempts at saving the business failed. Then in January Boohoo stepped in to buy the brand but not the shops, signalling the end of Debenhams on the High Street. Announcing the final closures, Debenhams said: ""Over the next 10 days, Debenhams will close its doors on the High Street for the final time in its 242 year history. ""We hope to see you all one last time in stores before we say a final goodbye to the UK High Street.""

India is a Covid disaster - it didn't have to beExperts tell the BBC that delays in decision-making worsened the crisis of India's second wave.India,"On Monday, a senior official from India's federal government told journalists that there was no shortage of oxygen in Delhi or anywhere else in the country. As he spoke, several small hospitals - only a few miles from where he stood in the capital - were sending out desperate messages about them running out of oxygen, putting patients' lives at risk. The chief doctor of one of the hospitals - a specialist paediatric facility - told the BBC that ""our hearts were in our mouths"" because of the risk of children dying. They got supplies just in time, after a local politician intervened. Delhi oxygen crisis deepens as more patients die Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituency A visual guide to the Covid crisis in India Barkha Dutt on her father's Covid-19 death And yet, the federal government has repeatedly insisted that there was no shortage. ""We are only facing problems in its transportation,"" Piyush Goyal, a senior official from India's home ministry, said. He also advised hospitals to ""ensure judicious use of oxygen as per the guidelines"". Several doctors who have spoken to the BBC say they are giving oxygen only to patients who need it, but there is not enough. But experts say that the shortage of oxygen is just one of the problems which shows both federal and state governments were not prepared, having failed to do enough to stop or minimise the damage of the second wave. A street in Delhi in early March, when, despite warnings, Indiaâs health minister said the country was in the âendgameâ of Covid-19 Warnings have in fact been repeatedly issued, including: In November, aparliamentary standing committee on health said there was an inadequate supply of oxygen,externaland ""grossly inadequate"" government hospital beds In February, several experts told the BBCthey feared an impending 'Covid tsunami' In early March, an expert group of scientists, set up by the government,warned officials about a more contagious variant of coronavirus spreading in the country,external- only for no significant containment measures to be taken, one scientist from the group told the BBC. The government has not made any comment on the allegations Despite this, on 8 March, the country's health minister announced thatIndia was in the ""endgame of the pandemic,external"". So, where did it go so wrong? In January and February, the national number of daily cases fell to under 20,000 from peaks of around 90,000 in September last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Covid beaten, andall places of public gathering opened. And soon, people were not adhering to Covid safety protocols, thanks in part to confused messaging from the top. While Mr Modi asked people to wear masks and follow social distancing in his public messages, he addressed large unmasked crowds during his election campaigns in five states. A number of his ministers were also seen addressing large public gatherings without wearing masks. The Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival - which attracts millions - was also allowed to go ahead. The Kumbh Mela religious festival in mid-April, which, like political rallies at the time, were attended unmasked ""There was complete disconnect between what they practised and what they preached,"" says public policy and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Prominent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says ""the government just did not see the second wave coming and started celebrating too early"". But there is more to the story: the devastation has also exposed the underfunding and neglect of the public healthcare system in India. The heart-breaking scenesthat have been witnessed outside hospitals - people dying without getting treatment - shows the grim reality of India's healthcare infrastructure. As one expert puts it, India's ""public health infrastructure was always broken, the rich and the middle class are just finding out"". Those who could afford it have always relied on private hospitals for treatment, while the poor struggle to get even a doctor's appointment. Recent schemes, like health insurance and subsidised medicines for the poor, are not helping because very little has been done in decades to increase the number of medical staff or hospitals. India's healthcare spending, including both private and public, has been around 3.6% of GDP for the past six years, the lowest percentage in the five Brics countries: Brazil spent the most at 9.2%, followed by South Africa at 8.1%, Russia at 5.3% and China at 5% in 2018. Developed nations spend a far higher proportion of their GDP on health.  In 2018, for instance, spending in the US was 16.9% and Germany 11.2%. Even smaller nations like Sri Lanka (3.76%) and Thailand (3.79%) spend more than India. And India has fewer than 10 doctors per 10,000 people, and in some states the figure is less than five. Several ""empowered committees"" were last year looking at the preparations needed to tackle the next coronavirus wave, so experts are baffled by the shortages of oxygen, beds and drugs. ""When the first wave was tapering, that's when they should have prepared for a second wave and assumed the worst. They should have taken an inventory of oxygen and [the drug] remdesivir and then ramped up manufacturing capacity,"" Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra state, told the BBC. Officials say India produces enough oxygen to meet the spike in demand but transportation was the problem. Experts say this should have been fixed much earlier. The government is now running special trains carrying oxygen from one state to another and stopping use of oxygen in industries - but only aftermany patients died because of a lack of oxygen. Very ill patients have been stuck outside hospitals as they wait for beds to become available ""The outcome has been that desperate family members are spending thousands of rupees to secure an oxygen cylinder on the black market and then stand for hours in a queue to get it filled,"" points out Dr Lahariya. Meanwhile, those who can afford itare also paying hefty amounts to procure drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab. An executive from a pharmaceutical company which manufactures remdesivir said ""demand had dried up"" in January and February.  ""If the government had placed an order, we would have stockpiled and there wouldn't have been any shortage. We have ramped up production but demand has grown significantly,"" he said. In contrast, the southern state of Kerala planned for the surge in advance. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of the state's Covid taskforce, says there was no shortage of oxygen in the state as necessary steps were taken in October last year. Relatives of patients have been refilling oxygen cylinders themselves ""We also procured sufficient stock of remdesivir and tocilizumab and other drugs well in advance. We also have a surge plan in place to tackle any exponential rise in the numbers in the coming weeks,"" he says. Mr Zagade says other states should have also taken similar steps ""to avoid the suffering"". ""Learning means someone else has done it and you can do it now, but that means it will take time,"" the former health secretary for Maharashtra said. But time is running out as the second wave is now spreading to villages where healthcare systems are not equipped to deal with the surge. Genome sequencing of the virus is an important step in identifying new variants that could be more infectious and deadly. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up last year and it brought together 10 labs in the country. But the group reportedly struggled to get funding initially,external. Virologist Dr Jameel says India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only ""properly started"" in mid-February 2021. India is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. ""In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,"" he said. However, India's main hope was always vaccination. This woman wanted to record the moment of vaccination ""Any public health specialist will tell you there is no practical way to strengthen an already broken public healthcare system in a matter of months,"" one woman, whose family runs a large private hospital in Delhi, told the BBC. ""The best and most effective alternative to battle Covid was to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible so the majority wouldn't need hospital care and hence not overburden the healthcare system."" India initially wanted 300 million people vaccinated by July, ""but it seems the government did not do enough planning to secure vaccine supply to run the programme"", Dr Lahariya says. ""On top of it, it has opened the vaccination for all adults without securing vaccine supplies."" So far, only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. India has millions more doses on order, but still far short of what it actually needs. The federal government needs 615 million doses to vaccinate everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. There are 622 million people between the age of 18 and 44, and 1.2 billion doses are required to vaccinate them. India's vaccine shortage: The wait gets longer What is the India Covid variant? The government has also cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. The government has enlisted other firms like Biological E and the state-run Haffkine Institute to produce vaccines. It has also given credit support of $609m to the Serum Institute of India, which produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab which is being made in India as Covishield, to ramp up production. But that funding should have come earlier, Dr Lahariya says, saving precious lives. ""It will take months before we have enough vaccines to speed up the programme. In the meantime, millions will continue to be at risk of getting Covid,"" he adds. Experts say it is ironic that India is known as the world's pharmacy and it is now facing shortages of vaccines and drugs. All of this, Dr Lahariya says, should serve as wake-up call for for both federal and state governments, which should invest drastically more in the healthcare sector because ""this definitely is not the last pandemic we will have to fight against"". ""The future pandemic may come earlier than any model can predict,"" he says.

Trump launches new 'communications' platform,"Donald Trump has launched a new ""communications"" website, which says it will publish content ""straight from the desk"" of the former US president. Mr Trump was banned by Twitter and suspended by Facebook and YouTube after the Capitol riots in January. The former president has since been releasing statements by press release - whichthe new website,externalwill now host. Users will be able to like posts - and also share them on Twitter and Facebook accounts. Screengrab from new website ""It is a blog,"" Kara Swisher, technology columnist for the New York Times told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""I was like '2002 is calling and it wants its blog back...' ""I don't know what the overall plan is because he does have some very sharp digital advisers. It is just the beginning of his attempts to try to re-establish a louder ability to participate in digital media."" Mr Trump's senior adviser, Jason Miller, had previously said a new social media platform was to be launched. ""This new platform is going to be big,"" he said in March. Screengrab from new website But Mr Miller tweeted on Tuesday that the new website was not the social media platform he had previously hyped. ""We'll have additional information coming on that front in the very near future,"" he said. The website is reportedly built by Campaign Nucleus, a digital services company created by Mr Trump's former campaign manager Brad Parscale. Several posts on the site repeat debunked claims that last year's presidential election was rigged. The new site arrived just beforea decision from Facebook's Oversight Board on whether Facebook was right to ban Mr Trump. The panel upheld the ban - but said Facebook must review whether it should be permanent, and apply consistent rules to all users. That could leave the door open to Mr Trump's return to Facebook and Instagram in the future. The former president used his new site to label Facebook - along with Twitter and Google - ""a total disgrace"". ""Free speech has been taken away from the President of the United States because the radical left lunatics are afraid of the truth,"" he said. ""The people of our country will not stand for it! These corrupt social media companies must pay a political price, and must never again be allowed to destroy and decimate our electoral process."" This video can not be played The woman who stitched Trump's tweets YouTube has said they will reactivate Mr Trump's account when the threat of ""real-world violence"" reduces.

Tomorrow millions of people will able to vote in elections taking place across England, Scotland and Wales. Covid safety measures mean counting will last several days and the results will come out at different times. Some counts, including the Hartlepool by-election, will take place overnight on Thursday night/Friday morning. We will also know all the results for the Welsh Senedd on Friday.

India's opposition Congress party is calling for a full lockdown in order for the country to get on top of the current wave of coronavirus - saying it is the ""only option left"". Spokesman Pawan Khera tells BBC World News the government has ignored the warnings of experts and been too slow to react to the scale of the current epidemic. The national spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not rejected a lockdown but has decided to leave it to individual states to impose measures. You can watch Khera's comments below. This video can not be played A 12-year-old girl who sued her school in an attempt to prevent it from ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of masks has lost her court case. The pupil, known only as AB, sued the Tapton Academy School Trust in Sheffield, claiming mask-wearing risks causing âserious harmâ to childrenâs physical and mental health. The trust says its policy is to encourage mask-wearing, not to enforce it. More than 10% of staff across its schools have been infected since August, the trust had said, underlining the risk to health. Today, Judge Roger ter Haar QC has rejected the request for an injunction because of ""a fundamental defect"" - the pupil had already been given an exemption from wearing a mask, so the injunction was not necessary to protect her health and safety. He says he made âno conclusions whatsoever as to the safety or otherwise of requiring children to wear face masks at schoolâ, although he noted concerns were ""strongly held"" by people such as AB's father and those who crowdfunded the legal case. But the judge says evidence submitted on the physical and psychological risks of wearing masks âdo not represent universal scientific and medical views"".

The UK has said its programme of booster vaccine shots could start in September, while a World Health Organization official isurging wealthy countries to delayuntil hard-hit nations are fully vaccinated. But why might booster jabs be needed? Countries are carefully monitoring coronavirus for mutations that might help it spread, make people sicker or overpower vaccines - so they can adjust their vaccination programmes and keep the virus under control. About 200 cases ofthe India variant(B.1.617) had been confirmed in the UK as of 28 April. It's the latest variant to come under scrutiny, but there's not yet enough evidence to make it an official ""variant of concern"" or to show it's directly responsible for India'srecent surge in Covid-19 cases. Current vaccines were designed for earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work, albeit potentially less well. Experts are confident existing vaccines can be redesigned to better tackle emerging mutations. The UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Read more on how the variants are tracked  Staff at Cardiff's biggest intensive care unit are creating a woodland to offset carbon emissions created by machines used to treat Covid patients in hospital. More than 1,000 trees have been planted near Crickhowell in Wales. One of those involved, Dr Jack Parry-Jones, describes the effort as ""a lasting memorial"" to staff and patients.

A surge in traffic is expected this summer, as people seek UK getaways Traffic on Britain's roads at the weekend returned to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September. But Department of Transport figures show the traffic levels were driven by heavy and light goods vehicles. Those were at 112% and 118% of normal levels over Sunday 25 April and Saturday 1 May. The RAC Foundation suggests the higher levels of delivery vehicles were caused by the popularity of online shopping in the pandemic. Car use was at 95% and 96% of pre-pandemic levels on the same two days, while on weekdays usage was only at an average of 88%. AA president Edmund King says workers staying away from offices are largely responsible for the 10% of previous car travel no longer taking place. He says ""there is a growing feeling that coronavirus will continue to cast a shadow over travel even after June"" but ""a surge in car travel during the summer"" is expected as people celebrate the end of lockdown with a UK holiday. Demand for public transport is returning more slowly, with bus use at 54% of normal levels outside London and 60% within the capital. And people are only taking 34% of the usual number of journeys on the mainline rail network. India is grappling with a devastating second wave of Covid infections, which is overwhelming hospitals in major cities including Delhi.

Canada has become the first nationto approve the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 and over. Chief medical advisor of Health Canada Dr Supriya Sharma tells a press conference the decision is ""a significant milestone"" in the fight against Covid. ""The department determined that this vaccine is safe and
effective when used in this younger age group,"" she says. ""We are
starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel."" Critics have criticised what some see as the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in Canada. According to Our World in Data, the country has delivered 37.85 doses per 100 people - about half the rate in the US. More than 30% of UK adults have now received the second dose of a Covid vaccine, the official data shows. Another 257,486 people had their second jab on Tuesday, meaning 15,630,007 people, or 30.2% of all adults, have had both vaccinations. A total of 127,170 people received their first dose, the latest figures show, taking that measurement to 34,667,904 (66.1% of all adults). It means 50,682,567 first and second doses have been given across the UK. The UK has reported another 2,144 new Covid cases. Official data shows there were also a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This compares with 2,166 cases and 29 deaths a week ago. A nurse who has worked throughout the pandemic

Extra vaccines cash to future-proof UK - ministerAlmost Â£30m of government funding will fast-track vaccines that fight new variants of coronavirus.,"Extra funding to fast-track new vaccines will help ""future-proof"" the UK against new coronavirus variants, the vaccines minister has said. Existing vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps mutating. Nadhim Zahawi said the Â£29.3m funding increase would boost testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory. Separately, he said booster jabs would be ready to deploy from September. Asked about reports inthe Times,externalthat third jabs would be given to over-50s and those with underlying health conditions in the autumn, the vaccines minister said no decision had been made yet. Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the booster programme could begin in September ""or later in the year, or early next year"". He said clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme. Clinical trials will also be looking at the evidence on mixing different vaccines to see what will offer the most protection. Coronavirus variants: What you need to know about how Covid is changing What is the India Covid variant and will vaccines work? The vaccines minister also confirmed there would be an update from the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later this week about England restarting international travel. Meanwhile, the government said its extra funding - on top of Â£19.7m already promised - would also aid vaccine manufacture and allow scientists to accelerate the pace and scale of their work. The cash will allow scientists to test 3,000 blood samples a week, up from 700 at the moment, to measure the levels of protective antibodies against Covid-19 generated by different vaccines. Whether or not at-risk adults are offered a booster dose this autumn will depend on two key factors: whether immunity from the first two doses has waned so older adults are vulnerable to an autumn wave of infection; and whether a variant emerges which means the current vaccines can't prevent serious Covid disease. Until we know the answers, it would be wrong to assume a third booster dose is on the cards. But of course it is being planned for. All vaccine manufacturers are working on tweaked vaccines, which will aim to deal with so-called escape variants. And a key UK trial - which will offer people a third dose of a different vaccine to the one they initially received - is not yet under way. In January 2020, scientists across the world began work on vaccines against the novel coronavirus, long before the disease it caused even had a name. Had they waited until it was clear a vaccine was needed, the delay would have cost tens of millions of lives. The government is already making plans for a booster Covid-vaccine programme in the autumn, to protect the most vulnerable ahead of winter. Last week itordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters. And it may use new, updated vaccines that are a better match for emerging variants. But the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid, David Nabarro, said the global vaccine rollout should be prioritised over booster jabs in the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's the World At One, he said: ""What you do with a scarce preventive action like a vaccine is that you give it to the people who need it the most. You have to look at the issue as a world issue. ""Top ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries that should come a bit later,"" he said. Following the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years."" UK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: ""A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. ""This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants. ""While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops."" The government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Prof Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), saidnew variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic. ""In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,"" he told the BBC. ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Prof Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored ""carefully"", but the UK had gone from a ""terrible situation"" in January to a ""remarkably good situation now"". Covid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval. In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May.

India's opposition Congress party is calling for a full lockdown in order for the country to get on top of the current wave of coronavirus - saying it is the ""only option left"". Spokesman Pawan Khera tells BBC World News the government has ignored the warnings of experts and been too slow to react to the scale of the current epidemic. The national spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not rejected a lockdown but has decided to leave it to individual states to impose measures. You can watch Khera's comments below. This video can not be played A 12-year-old girl who sued her school in an attempt to prevent it from ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of masks has lost her court case. The pupil, known only as AB, sued the Tapton Academy School Trust in Sheffield, claiming mask-wearing risks causing âserious harmâ to childrenâs physical and mental health. The trust says its policy is to encourage mask-wearing, not to enforce it. More than 10% of staff across its schools have been infected since August, the trust had said, underlining the risk to health. Today, Judge Roger ter Haar QC has rejected the request for an injunction because of ""a fundamental defect"" - the pupil had already been given an exemption from wearing a mask, so the injunction was not necessary to protect her health and safety. He says he made âno conclusions whatsoever as to the safety or otherwise of requiring children to wear face masks at schoolâ, although he noted concerns were ""strongly held"" by people such as AB's father and those who crowdfunded the legal case. But the judge says evidence submitted on the physical and psychological risks of wearing masks âdo not represent universal scientific and medical views"". Visitors to Blackpool could be asked to take Covid tests at their hotels in a bid to keep outbreaks at bay once the seaside town fully reopens. The town's council is in talks with local hospitality businesses about rolling out the voluntary tests.

The UK has said its programme of booster vaccine shots could start in September, while a World Health Organization official isurging wealthy countries to delayuntil hard-hit nations are fully vaccinated. But why might booster jabs be needed? Countries are carefully monitoring coronavirus for mutations that might help it spread, make people sicker or overpower vaccines - so they can adjust their vaccination programmes and keep the virus under control. About 200 cases ofthe India variant(B.1.617) had been confirmed in the UK as of 28 April. It's the latest variant to come under scrutiny, but there's not yet enough evidence to make it an official ""variant of concern"" or to show it's directly responsible for India'srecent surge in Covid-19 cases. Current vaccines were designed for earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work, albeit potentially less well. Experts are confident existing vaccines can be redesigned to better tackle emerging mutations. The UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Read more on how the variants are tracked  Staff at Cardiff's biggest intensive care unit are creating a woodland to offset carbon emissions created by machines used to treat Covid patients in hospital. More than 1,000 trees have been planted near Crickhowell in Wales. One of those involved, Dr Jack Parry-Jones, describes the effort as ""a lasting memorial"" to staff and patients. Dr Craig Spencer, who has spent the past year working ""within four walls"" in hospital, says it was ""joyous"" being outside in nature and being able to look at his colleagues without them wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).

It is understood 34 cruise workers from India arrived in Torquay last week to board the Marella Explorer as the industry prepares to restart fully.

A surge in traffic is expected this summer, as people seek UK getaways Traffic on Britain's roads at the weekend returned to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September. But Department of Transport figures show the traffic levels were driven by heavy and light goods vehicles. Those were at 112% and 118% of normal levels over Sunday 25 April and Saturday 1 May. The RAC Foundation suggests the higher levels of delivery vehicles were caused by the popularity of online shopping in the pandemic. Car use was at 95% and 96% of pre-pandemic levels on the same two days, while on weekdays usage was only at an average of 88%. AA president Edmund King says workers staying away from offices are largely responsible for the 10% of previous car travel no longer taking place. He says ""there is a growing feeling that coronavirus will continue to cast a shadow over travel even after June"" but ""a surge in car travel during the summer"" is expected as people celebrate the end of lockdown with a UK holiday. Demand for public transport is returning more slowly, with bus use at 54% of normal levels outside London and 60% within the capital. And people are only taking 34% of the usual number of journeys on the mainline rail network. India is grappling with a devastating second wave of Covid infections, which is overwhelming hospitals in major cities including Delhi. But Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, tells BBC World News there are even more cases in rural areas. ""70% of India's population lives in rural India, and there are no hospital facilities there,"" he says. ""You won't see long lines outside hospitals simply because there aren't very many at all to begin with."" He warns it may take several weeks before the situation in the country can ""turn around"".

Canada has become the first nationto approve the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 and over. Chief medical advisor of Health Canada Dr Supriya Sharma tells a press conference the decision is ""a significant milestone"" in the fight against Covid. ""The department determined that this vaccine is safe and
effective when used in this younger age group,"" she says. ""We are
starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel."" Critics have criticised what some see as the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in Canada. According to Our World in Data, the country has delivered 37.85 doses per 100 people - about half the rate in the US. More than 30% of UK adults have now received the second dose of a Covid vaccine, the official data shows. Another 257,486 people had their second jab on Tuesday, meaning 15,630,007 people, or 30.2% of all adults, have had both vaccinations. A total of 127,170 people received their first dose, the latest figures show, taking that measurement to 34,667,904 (66.1% of all adults). It means 50,682,567 first and second doses have been given across the UK. The UK has reported another 2,144 new Covid cases. Official data shows there were also a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This compares with 2,166 cases and 29 deaths a week ago. A nurse who has worked throughout the pandemic

Woman loses nearly Â£113k in romance fraud,"Rachel Elwell said police had told her she was a victim of romance fraud A woman says she is facing bankruptcy after losing just under Â£113,000 to a scammer she met on a dating site. Rachel Elwell, from the West Midlands, said the man, who claimed he lived nearby, told her he had gone abroad for an engineering contract in Ukraine. He convinced her with documents and pictures he needed money for issues that had cropped up and stated he had been taken captive by loan sharks. Ms Elwell, 50, said there was no guarantee of any money coming back. Asked why she had given money to a man she had never met, the export manager, of Brownhills, said: ""When he said to me his life was in danger and I didn't hear from him, I thought he'd been murdered. ""Can you imagine feeling you're responsible for whether someone lives or dies?"" Ms Elwell said after he had contacted her on 1 January claiming to live in Cannock, his ""picture looked nice"", he ""seemed to like the same things as me"" and ""seemed quite an open and genuine guy"". The man told her they would have to wait weeks to meet as he would need to stay in Ukraine, but later phoned claiming laws in that country had changed due to Covid and he now had to pay tax before any of the engineering work began, Ms Elwell said. Telling the story toBBC Radio WM, Ms Elwell said she had been told work had stopped on site and matters ""appeared very legitimate"", but later she had ""reluctantly"" sent him money. She stated at one point a supposed tax office had sent a letter to him, which she had a copy of, and added: ""They said... 'you need to pay 160 thousand'. So he cashed his pension in, sold his car, borrowed money and I helped him. ""I mean at this point I think it was about Â£45k I'd sent him to help him with the tax bill."" Action Fraud advises people who believe they have been a victim to contact their bank According toAction Fraud,external, romance or dating fraud is where criminals dupe people into sending them money by gaining their trust and convincing them they are in a genuine relationship. In order to stay safe from such scams, it advises people to: Be suspicious of any requests for money from someone they have never met in person, particularly if they have only recently met online Speak to family or friends to get advice Perform reverse image searches on profile pictures, as they may not be genuine. A reverse image search can find photos that have been taken from somewhere else Anyone who believes they have been a victim of romance fraud, it said, should report it to their bank immediately and to Action Fraud. Continuing the story, Ms Elwell said the man had claimed two ""heavies"" had turned up and he had been locked in a cellar. He sent her pictures purporting to show him there. She added he claimed to have been released after money had been sent, but he had told her he would not have his passport, which had been taken from him, until interest had been paid. On the day the man told Ms Elwell he was due to fly back, 16 March, she went to Heathrow airport and got an email from supposed airport officials saying he had been arrested.

Supermarkets warn Brazil over Amazon land bill,"Land is cleared either to graze cattle for beef exports or to grow soy Nearly 40 UK food businesses have threatened to stop sourcing products from Brazil over proposed land reforms. Anopen letter,externalfrom the group calls on Brazil's legislature to reject a bill which could legalise the private occupation of public land. The letter said the proposal could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon. The bill is being considered just months after Brazil pledged to end illegal logging. They are killing our forest, Brazilian tribe warns Celebs to Biden: Reject Amazon deal with Bolsonaro Brazil cuts environment budget despite pledge Sainsbury's, Aldi, Greggs, the Co-Op, the British Retail Consortium, and the Hilton Food Group are among the major organisations to sign the open letter. A vote in the Senate onthe bill,externalis expected within days. The companies say they ""consider the Amazon as a vital part of the earth system that's essential to the security of our planet, as well as being a critical part of a prosperous future for Brazilians and all of society."" Rainforests are critical to mitigating the effects of climate change, as they store vast amounts of carbon. An aerial view of logs illegally cut from the Amazon rainforest Under the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, the level of deforestation in the Amazon is reported as being the highest since 2008. This year alone around 430,000 acres of the Amazon have been logged or burned, according to theMonitoring of the Andean Amazon Project.,external The vast majority of land is cleared either to graze cattle for beef exports, or to grow soy, which goes in to animal feed around the world. At a summit in April hosted by US President Joe Biden, Mr Bolsonaro declared that Brazil would end illegal logging. The letter says these measures ""run counter"" to this ""narrative and rhetoric."" The new law would allow land that has been illegally occupied after 2014 to be put up for sale. This would potentially allow illegal occupants to buy it. Similar controversial measures were first put forward in a different bill last year, but were withdrawn after more than 40 organisations made the same threat over supply chain sourcing. A road runs through a tract of burnt Amazon jungle near Porto Velho, Rondonia State, Brazil, August 14, 2020 The group says the existing protections and land designations have been ""instrumental"" in their organisations having ""trust"" in Brazilian producers. The companies say that the ""door remains open to work with Brazilian partners"" to develop sustainable land management practice in Brazil. However, if this or other measures that undermine existing protections become law, they will have ""no choice but to reconsider our support and use of the Brazilian agricultural commodity supply chain."" This video can not be played Brazil's environmental police in battle to reduce deforestation in the Amazon Commenting on the imminent vote, Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF-UK, said: ""We cannot fight the climate crisis without the Amazon, yet its future hangs in the balance as deforestation pushes it closer to the point of collapse. ""If passed, this vote in the Brazilian Congress will fuel further destruction and place greater risk on the lives of the people and wildlife who call it home. ""As global efforts to protect the Amazon threaten to be undermined, it's encouraging to see major businesses sounding the alarm."" Cathryn Higgs, head of policy at the Co-op, said it was ""imperative"" the proposed legislation wasn't ""given any airtime by the Brazilian government."" Supporters of the bill say it would help small-scale farmers to clarify title deeds to land. The Brazilian government has been approached for comment.

The results will take a little longer than usual to come, not least because counting in Wales will not start until Friday morning due to the pandemic. Click herefor details of results coverage from the BBC on TV, radio, online and social media. We hope you'll join us again soon. Polling stations will be open for tomorrow's Senedd and police and crime commissioner elections, but there will be rules to ensure voting is Covid safe. Full details are available,externalon the Welsh Government website. Covid measures were in place at the Russian Embassy in London last summer when ex-pat Russians used it as a polling station for a referendum Jenny Rathbone said Labour had allowed Plaid Cymru to appear the more radical party A Welsh Labour candidate has said she would have preferred âa
slightly more radical approachâ in her partyâs Senedd manifesto. Jenny Rathbone said she thought it was ""slightly over-cautious"", allowing Plaid Cymru to ""nibble away at people who want something more radicalâ. âItâs a cautious approach. I would have preferred us to have
a slightly more radical approach,"" she told theLabourList,externalwebsite. Ms Rathbone said she thought Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford was ""as radical"" as the party's former UK leader Jeremy Corbyn, but ""a much more cautious guy"". ""He doesnât promise anything he feels he canât
deliver, which I think is the right way to go about it,"" she said. âOverpromise and underdeliver? Not politically very sharp."" However, Ms Rathbone added: âI think Markâs objective was to ensure that
Plaid didnât appear to be more radical than us, and I donât think that heâs
managed to do it.â If you're going to the polls tomorrow in Wales you'll also be given a ballot paper to choose a police and crime commissioner. The elected posts - one for each force area - were created by the UK government in 2012 with the aim of giving greater scrutiny and local public accountability to policing.

Shavanah Taj of the Wales TUC said urgent action was needed to ""rebuild a fairer and more resilient Wales"" With just hours left before the polls open, trade unions are calling for the next Welsh government to ""fight for fairness"". The Wales TUC is calling for pay rises for all public sector workers, including NHS staff, porters and cleaners, with 85% of members backing pay increases for nurses. In its manifesto, ahead of Thursday's vote, the organisation said workers backed further devolution of powers from London to Cardiff Bay. Wales TUC General Secretary Shavanah Taj said people should elect a new government which would ""prioritise greater workplace equality and fight to make Wales a Fair Work nation"". âThe last year has shown the grim reality of our labour market for tens of thousands of workers across Wales,"" she said. ""Young workers, BAME workers, and people in insecure work have been disproportionately hit â losing jobs, income, skills and opportunities."" Ms Taj added that urgent action was needed to ""rebuild a fairer and more resilient Wales"". David DeansBBC Wales politics reporter More people have registered for
a postal vote in the 2021 Senedd election than in the last assembly election
five years ago. But the figures, which are not
complete, suggest there may not be a substantial increase on the numbers from
2016 despite the pandemic. Figures
obtained by BBC Wales show that at least 451,006 people have registered to vote by
post across Wales' 40 constituencies. That is at
least 14% more than the 395,878 postal voters in the Welsh Assembly election in
2016. However, the
overall number of people registered to vote has risen by 6%, from 2.2m to 2.3m. The postal vote figures do not
include the Monmouthshire part of Newport East, but without those figures it
amounts to at least 19% of the electorate. Thatâs compared to 17.62% in
2016. Many of the figures were
provided by the Association of Electoral Administrators, and by some individual
councils. BBC Wales correspondent Hywel Griffith is not the only one to note that visiting politicians seem inordinately keen on eating chips at the Welsh seaside.

Daniel DaviesBBC Wales political correspondent In a brief
interview with us here in the Vale of Clwyd, Rishi Sunak hit the Conservatives'
key message that the Tories offer change in this election. We didn't cover
much ground. His aides called time after two questions. The chancellor also
pointed to the billions in additional funding he's given the Welsh government
during the pandemic. Around Â£1bn is waiting to be allocated after the
election. But there is a
question about what happens when all that money has been spent. The clever people
at the Wales Governance Centre talk about the possible implications in their
fascinating analysis of the three main parties' manifestos.You can see it here,external. As far as the
Tories' manifesto is concerned, the analysis says paying for all its promises â
such as on NHS funding and a possible income-tax cut â will overshoot
pessimistic projections for the size of the budget. Like the Tories,
Plaid Cymru would also need a more generous settlement from Westminster.
Labour's plans are more modest. What they all have
in common is a âlack of detail on spending across the boardâ, the analysis team
says. By the way, it's
not surprising the chancellor chose to come to the Vale of Clwyd constituency,
the seat Sir Keir Starmer visited yesterday. It's a key
Labour-Tory battleground. If the Tories are heading for a good result â and a
poll out today will buoy their confidence â many would consider this seat the
most likely to turn blue. There aremore Steves and Daves running in Thursday's Senedd electionthan there are women candidates running in all but one of the 18 parties standing. Of the 469 candidates, 14 are called Steve, Stephen or Steven and there are 11 named David, Dave or Dai. The only party fielding more women than the combined number of candidates called Steve or Dave is Welsh Labour. The party's 50/50 gender split between its 60 candidates means it had 30 women standing. Plaid Cymru has put forward 19 women candidates (35%) and the Welsh Conservatives have 17 (30%). As might be expected, the most common candidate surname in Wales for Thursday's election is Jones with a total of 23 standing. That is followed by Davies (15), Williams (13) and Evans (11). At this election 16 and 17-year-olds can vote for the first time Tens of thousands of young people have not taken up the chance to vote for the first time at the Senedd election. On Thursday, 16 and 17-year-olds will be able to vote in the Welsh Parliament election after the voting age was lowered. However,figures compiled by the BBC suggest 54% of young people have failed to register to votein Thursday's poll. The data compares numbers registered with population estimates for 21 of Wales' 22 council areas. Figures show 2,421,108 people in Wales - about 76.7% of the whole population - are registered. The finding comes despite the efforts of grime artists, fitness stars, and Instagram and TikTok influencers to engage young people in the election. However, campaigners have said they felt young people were not being listened to by politicians, and that parties had not done enough to reach potential new voters. Leader Jane Dodds takes to the streets on the final day of campaigning The leader of the Welsh Liberal Democrats has
acknowledged she is not going to be the next first minister of Wales. Jane Dodds is campaigning in the seat of Brecon and
Radnorshire on the final day before voters go to the polls. The seat was previously held by the Lib Demsâ only
MS in the last Senedd, Kirsty Williams. Speaking outside the Minersâ Institute in Ystradgynlais, Ms
Dodds said: âI would love to be first minister, but I'm going to be honest, I'm
not going to be the first minister of Wales this time. âI think, if I had a chance of being in government, the
first thing that I would be doing is looking at child poverty. I would want to
look at how we can address child poverty here in Wales."" Ms Dodds declined to rule out entering a coalition with
any of the other parties after the election, but said her primary concern was
winning more seats. âWe're very clear that right now we're going to fight for
every single vote,â she said. âWe're not taking anything for granted. We're not bargaining
with any votes. Let's see what happens tomorrow, and we'll take it from there. âCertainly we want to win Brecon and Radnorshire, but we are
looking to get some places in the regional seats as well which we've always
done well in,"" she said. Asked whether her leadership was tenable if the party failed
to gain any representation in the Senedd, Ms Dodds said she would not stand
down regardless of the outcome. âMy position as leader will be that I will carry on. âI'm not here to talk
about my job, I'm here to talk about the jobs of others. That's what's most
important, that's what we're hearing on the doorstep - that people want us to
talk about jobs, about mental health, and about the environment."" You could get into trouble depending what's in the background of your photo.

support them. Leader Anthony Slaughter said: ""We are hearing on the
doorstep from first-time Green voters they are lending us their regional ballot
because they like what we stand for and they want to vote to keep out Abolish. ""With Labour unable to
win on this ballot in much of Wales, it is vital people who want a progressive

Mark Drakeford went behind the scenes in a restaurant in Barry Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford has admitted his party
is âbattling hard in north Walesâ. Labour lost four seats to the Conservatives in the north east at
the Westminster election in 2019 â and the party is hoping to stop it happening in the Senedd. âWe have to restore our bargain with the people of north Wales,â Mr Drakeford said. He made the comments while visiting the Hangfire Southern Kitchen in Barry,
in the south Wales constituency of the Vale of Glamorgan. The seat is held by the Conservatives in the House of
Commons, but by Labour in the Senedd. It's another constituency the Tories are
hoping to gain from Labour. Asked if the fact he had chosen to go to the Vale of
Glamorgan suggested he was worried about the seat, Mr Drakeford said: âI'm here because
the real contest in this election is between a Labour progressive government
for Wales and handing Wales back to London with the Tories. âIn this constituency, that's exactly the argument that is
on the line.â Adam Price visited tightly-fought Llanelli, won by Labour in 2016 Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price
says ""every vote will count in constituencies right across Wales"",
telling BBC Wales the election was ""going to be won on small
margins"". He visited a food wholesaler and
processing company at Cross Hands, in the marginal Senedd seat of Llanelli, won
by Labour in 2016. ""Our message to people out
there is get out and vote tomorrow - every vote will count,"" he said. ""We have a historic opportunity
to elect the first Plaid Cymru government in our history. ""That will send headlines
across the world. ""It will electrify Wales
because we will have a government that will believe in the potential of Wales
to solve our problems, the problems that have been there for generations. ""We can put our country now
on a different path."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart is served chips by his chancellor, Rishi Sunak during a visit to Marine Holiday Park in Rhyl Chancellor Rishi Sunak has told BBC Wales the Conservatives could bring âchangeâ to Wales if voters backed them on Thursday. The party has said voting Tory would
ensure âtwo
governments working together to rebuild after the pandemic and level up Walesâ. Journalists, including BBC Wales, were limited to two
questions each for Mr Sunak, on the tightly controlled visit to Rhyl. Asked by the BBC's Daniel Davies if he was
telling the electorate that extra cash would not be available if they voted for
Labour, Mr Sunak said: âIf you want to see change that weâre bringing across
the United Kingdom, if you vote for a Conservative government here in Wales,
weâll be able to deliver that change here as well. âIt's about making sure that we've completed the vaccine
roll-out, and then we drive forward our economic recovery as we've protected
people's jobs and businesses over the past 12 months.â BBC Wales asked the chancellor if he could see why he was
criticised for a decision not to extend job support when the Welsh
government wanted to hold its firebreak lockdown last autumn. Furlough
was extended when England locked down later. Mr Sunak did not address the point directly but said: âI
think at every point during the past 12 months during this crisis I and the
government have acted to protect people in all parts of the United Kingdom. âIf you think about things like the furlough scheme, that's
protected almost half a million jobs here in Wales.  Fifty thousand businesses have
benefited from government-backed loans.â The chancellor said there had been Â£8bn âover two years of direct cash
support for the Welsh government to support its local economy as wellâ. âI know that we have stood behind people of Wales at this
difficult time over the past 12 months,â Mr Sunak added. Prof Laura McAllisterCardiff University These Senedd elections are not the ones we anticipated and there's a strange contradictory feel to them. It's been a low-key campaign which has scarcely dazzled, yet the results on Friday feel more significant than ever. The Members of the Senedd - or MSs - elected will serve in a proper parliament with law-making and tax setting powers. Added excitement comes from the very tight margins that will decide at least a quarter of the constituency seats and several regional list seats. Small shifts in votes could determine the distribution of seats to parties and therefore the shape of our next Welsh government. So, the final results are unpredictable, dependent as they are on several important unknowns. First, this is a Covid election - both practically and policy-wise. We are edging out of lockdown, but with gargantuan recovery problems ahead. Most of us had imagined a dramatically different political landscape for Senedd 2021, framed by post-Brexit adaptation - not a pandemic. Read more from Laura here. Neil Hamilton was elected to the Senedd in 2016 UKIP Wales leader Neil Hamilton will be in Torfaen on
Wednesday, the party has said. ""UKIP is presenting voters with a real alternative to
Labour who have failed communities like Torfaen,â a spokesman said. ""We are asking voters to put their trust in UKIP - as
they did in 2016 - to deliver a better future for the south Wales valleys. ""Just as UKIP led the charge in the last assembly term
to scrap the Severn Bridge tolls, we will champion the case for building the M4
relief road which will bring desperately needed investment to the valleys.â Ione Wells took over BBC Wales News' Instagram account to answer your questions Why do we vote on Thursdays? The answer seems to be there isn't really a good reason and it's just become a tradition. Theories offered include the idea that people are less likely to go to the pub than they are on Fridays, and that traditionally Thursday was market day, so people were more likely to be out and about anyway.

India minister in UK may have been exposed to CovidThe foreign minister - who met Home Secretary Priti Patel on Tuesday - will carry out meetings virtually.UK,"The entire Indian delegation in the UK for G7 talks must self-isolate after two Covid cases were detected. India's foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar pulled out of face-to-face talks, saying he was ""aware of exposure to possible Covid positive cases"". He met Home Secretary Priti Patel in person on Tuesday but joined the rest of the meetings virtually. India is not in the G7 group of nations but delegates from the country were invited as guests. The two cases were picked up by tests in advance and none of the party had attended the meeting venue, the Press Association said. Mr Jaishankar has not tested positive. India is currently on the UK's red list meaning travel from there is banned, but some jobs are exempt including representatives of a foreign country. There are also exemptions to the self-isolation rule ""if it is confirmed that you are travelling to the UK for official business that cannot be undertaken while self-isolating"",according to the government's rules.,external India's foreign minister, right, also spoke with the US delegation earlier this week The G7 group - the world's seven largest so-called advanced economies - is made up of the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the US. The official summit of G7 leaders is taking place in Cornwall next month, but ministers are currently in the UK for talks. The talks this week were the first face-to-face meetings the G7 powers have had in more than two years. India, Australia, South Korea and South Africa attended as guests.

They discussed new ways to ensure fairer access to vaccine stockpiles and increase support for the global vaccine distribution scheme known as Covax. Also on the agenda on Wednesday was media freedom, arbitrary detentionand girls' education.

India is a Covid disaster - it didn't have to beExperts tell the BBC that delays in decision-making worsened the crisis of India's second wave.IndiaCoronavirus: Morning updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Wednesday morning.UK,"On Monday, a senior official from India's federal government told journalists that there was no shortage of oxygen in Delhi or anywhere else in the country. As he spoke, several small hospitals - only a few miles from where he stood in the capital - were sending out desperate messages about them running out of oxygen, putting patients' lives at risk. The chief doctor of one of the hospitals - a specialist paediatric facility - told the BBC that ""our hearts were in our mouths"" because of the risk of children dying. They got supplies just in time, after a local politician intervened. Delhi oxygen crisis deepens as more patients die Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituency A visual guide to the Covid crisis in India Barkha Dutt on her father's Covid-19 death And yet, the federal government has repeatedly insisted that there was no shortage. ""We are only facing problems in its transportation,"" Piyush Goyal, a senior official from India's home ministry, said. He also advised hospitals to ""ensure judicious use of oxygen as per the guidelines"". Several doctors who have spoken to the BBC say they are giving oxygen only to patients who need it, but there is not enough. But experts say that the shortage of oxygen is just one of the problems which shows both federal and state governments were not prepared, having failed to do enough to stop or minimise the damage of the second wave. A street in Delhi in early March, when, despite warnings, Indiaâs health minister said the country was in the âendgameâ of Covid-19 Warnings have in fact been repeatedly issued, including: In November, aparliamentary standing committee on health said there was an inadequate supply of oxygen,externaland ""grossly inadequate"" government hospital beds In February, several experts told the BBCthey feared an impending 'Covid tsunami' In early March, an expert group of scientists, set up by the government,warned officials about a more contagious variant of coronavirus spreading in the country,external- only for no significant containment measures to be taken, one scientist from the group told the BBC. The government has not made any comment on the allegations Despite this, on 8 March, the country's health minister announced thatIndia was in the ""endgame of the pandemic,external"". So, where did it go so wrong? In January and February, the national number of daily cases fell to under 20,000 from peaks of around 90,000 in September last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Covid beaten, andall places of public gathering opened. And soon, people were not adhering to Covid safety protocols, thanks in part to confused messaging from the top. While Mr Modi asked people to wear masks and follow social distancing in his public messages, he addressed large unmasked crowds during his election campaigns in five states. A number of his ministers were also seen addressing large public gatherings without wearing masks. The Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival - which attracts millions - was also allowed to go ahead. The Kumbh Mela religious festival in mid-April, which, like political rallies at the time, were attended unmasked ""There was complete disconnect between what they practised and what they preached,"" says public policy and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Prominent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says ""the government just did not see the second wave coming and started celebrating too early"". But there is more to the story: the devastation has also exposed the underfunding and neglect of the public healthcare system in India. The heart-breaking scenesthat have been witnessed outside hospitals - people dying without getting treatment - shows the grim reality of India's healthcare infrastructure. As one expert puts it, India's ""public health infrastructure was always broken, the rich and the middle class are just finding out"". Those who could afford it have always relied on private hospitals for treatment, while the poor struggle to get even a doctor's appointment. Recent schemes, like health insurance and subsidised medicines for the poor, are not helping because very little has been done in decades to increase the number of medical staff or hospitals. India's healthcare spending, including both private and public, has been around 3.6% of GDP for the past six years, the lowest percentage in the five Brics countries: Brazil spent the most at 9.2%, followed by South Africa at 8.1%, Russia at 5.3% and China at 5% in 2018. Developed nations spend a far higher proportion of their GDP on health.  In 2018, for instance, spending in the US was 16.9% and Germany 11.2%. Even smaller nations like Sri Lanka (3.76%) and Thailand (3.79%) spend more than India. And India has fewer than 10 doctors per 10,000 people, and in some states the figure is less than five. Several ""empowered committees"" were last year looking at the preparations needed to tackle the next coronavirus wave, so experts are baffled by the shortages of oxygen, beds and drugs. ""When the first wave was tapering, that's when they should have prepared for a second wave and assumed the worst. They should have taken an inventory of oxygen and [the drug] remdesivir and then ramped up manufacturing capacity,"" Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra state, told the BBC. Officials say India produces enough oxygen to meet the spike in demand but transportation was the problem. Experts say this should have been fixed much earlier. The government is now running special trains carrying oxygen from one state to another and stopping use of oxygen in industries - but only aftermany patients died because of a lack of oxygen. Very ill patients have been stuck outside hospitals as they wait for beds to become available ""The outcome has been that desperate family members are spending thousands of rupees to secure an oxygen cylinder on the black market and then stand for hours in a queue to get it filled,"" points out Dr Lahariya. Meanwhile, those who can afford itare also paying hefty amounts to procure drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab. An executive from a pharmaceutical company which manufactures remdesivir said ""demand had dried up"" in January and February.  ""If the government had placed an order, we would have stockpiled and there wouldn't have been any shortage. We have ramped up production but demand has grown significantly,"" he said. In contrast, the southern state of Kerala planned for the surge in advance. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of the state's Covid taskforce, says there was no shortage of oxygen in the state as necessary steps were taken in October last year. Relatives of patients have been refilling oxygen cylinders themselves ""We also procured sufficient stock of remdesivir and tocilizumab and other drugs well in advance. We also have a surge plan in place to tackle any exponential rise in the numbers in the coming weeks,"" he says. Mr Zagade says other states should have also taken similar steps ""to avoid the suffering"". ""Learning means someone else has done it and you can do it now, but that means it will take time,"" the former health secretary for Maharashtra said. But time is running out as the second wave is now spreading to villages where healthcare systems are not equipped to deal with the surge. Genome sequencing of the virus is an important step in identifying new variants that could be more infectious and deadly. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up last year and it brought together 10 labs in the country. But the group reportedly struggled to get funding initially,external. Virologist Dr Jameel says India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only ""properly started"" in mid-February 2021. India is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. ""In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,"" he said. However, India's main hope was always vaccination. This woman wanted to record the moment of vaccination ""Any public health specialist will tell you there is no practical way to strengthen an already broken public healthcare system in a matter of months,"" one woman, whose family runs a large private hospital in Delhi, told the BBC. ""The best and most effective alternative to battle Covid was to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible so the majority wouldn't need hospital care and hence not overburden the healthcare system."" India initially wanted 300 million people vaccinated by July, ""but it seems the government did not do enough planning to secure vaccine supply to run the programme"", Dr Lahariya says. ""On top of it, it has opened the vaccination for all adults without securing vaccine supplies."" So far, only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. India has millions more doses on order, but still far short of what it actually needs. The federal government needs 615 million doses to vaccinate everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. There are 622 million people between the age of 18 and 44, and 1.2 billion doses are required to vaccinate them. India's vaccine shortage: The wait gets longer What is the India Covid variant? The government has also cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. The government has enlisted other firms like Biological E and the state-run Haffkine Institute to produce vaccines. It has also given credit support of $609m to the Serum Institute of India, which produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab which is being made in India as Covishield, to ramp up production. But that funding should have come earlier, Dr Lahariya says, saving precious lives. ""It will take months before we have enough vaccines to speed up the programme. In the meantime, millions will continue to be at risk of getting Covid,"" he adds. Experts say it is ironic that India is known as the world's pharmacy and it is now facing shortages of vaccines and drugs. All of this, Dr Lahariya says, should serve as wake-up call for for both federal and state governments, which should invest drastically more in the healthcare sector because ""this definitely is not the last pandemic we will have to fight against"".

India is a Covid disaster - it didn't have to beExperts tell the BBC that delays in decision-making worsened the crisis of India's second wave.,"On Monday, a senior official from India's federal government told journalists that there was no shortage of oxygen in Delhi or anywhere else in the country. As he spoke, several small hospitals - only a few miles from where he stood in the capital - were sending out desperate messages about them running out of oxygen, putting patients' lives at risk. The chief doctor of one of the hospitals - a specialist paediatric facility - told the BBC that ""our hearts were in our mouths"" because of the risk of children dying. They got supplies just in time, after a local politician intervened. Delhi oxygen crisis deepens as more patients die Anger rises as Covid rages in Modi's constituency A visual guide to the Covid crisis in India Barkha Dutt on her father's Covid-19 death And yet, the federal government has repeatedly insisted that there was no shortage. ""We are only facing problems in its transportation,"" Piyush Goyal, a senior official from India's home ministry, said. He also advised hospitals to ""ensure judicious use of oxygen as per the guidelines"". Several doctors who have spoken to the BBC say they are giving oxygen only to patients who need it, but there is not enough. But experts say that the shortage of oxygen is just one of the problems which shows both federal and state governments were not prepared, having failed to do enough to stop or minimise the damage of the second wave. A street in Delhi in early March, when, despite warnings, Indiaâs health minister said the country was in the âendgameâ of Covid-19 Warnings have in fact been repeatedly issued, including: In November, aparliamentary standing committee on health said there was an inadequate supply of oxygen,externaland ""grossly inadequate"" government hospital beds In February, several experts told the BBCthey feared an impending 'Covid tsunami' In early March, an expert group of scientists, set up by the government,warned officials about a more contagious variant of coronavirus spreading in the country,external- only for no significant containment measures to be taken, one scientist from the group told the BBC. The government has not made any comment on the allegations Despite this, on 8 March, the country's health minister announced thatIndia was in the ""endgame of the pandemic,external"". So, where did it go so wrong? In January and February, the national number of daily cases fell to under 20,000 from peaks of around 90,000 in September last year. Prime Minister Narendra Modi declared Covid beaten, andall places of public gathering opened. And soon, people were not adhering to Covid safety protocols, thanks in part to confused messaging from the top. While Mr Modi asked people to wear masks and follow social distancing in his public messages, he addressed large unmasked crowds during his election campaigns in five states. A number of his ministers were also seen addressing large public gatherings without wearing masks. The Kumbh Mela, a Hindu festival - which attracts millions - was also allowed to go ahead. The Kumbh Mela religious festival in mid-April, which, like political rallies at the time, were attended unmasked ""There was complete disconnect between what they practised and what they preached,"" says public policy and health systems expert Dr Chandrakant Lahariya. Prominent virologist Dr Shahid Jameel says ""the government just did not see the second wave coming and started celebrating too early"". But there is more to the story: the devastation has also exposed the underfunding and neglect of the public healthcare system in India. The heart-breaking scenesthat have been witnessed outside hospitals - people dying without getting treatment - shows the grim reality of India's healthcare infrastructure. As one expert puts it, India's ""public health infrastructure was always broken, the rich and the middle class are just finding out"". Those who could afford it have always relied on private hospitals for treatment, while the poor struggle to get even a doctor's appointment. Recent schemes, like health insurance and subsidised medicines for the poor, are not helping because very little has been done in decades to increase the number of medical staff or hospitals. India's healthcare spending, including both private and public, has been around 3.6% of GDP for the past six years, the lowest percentage in the five Brics countries: Brazil spent the most at 9.2%, followed by South Africa at 8.1%, Russia at 5.3% and China at 5% in 2018. Developed nations spend a far higher proportion of their GDP on health.  In 2018, for instance, spending in the US was 16.9% and Germany 11.2%. Even smaller nations like Sri Lanka (3.76%) and Thailand (3.79%) spend more than India. And India has fewer than 10 doctors per 10,000 people, and in some states the figure is less than five. Several ""empowered committees"" were last year looking at the preparations needed to tackle the next coronavirus wave, so experts are baffled by the shortages of oxygen, beds and drugs. ""When the first wave was tapering, that's when they should have prepared for a second wave and assumed the worst. They should have taken an inventory of oxygen and [the drug] remdesivir and then ramped up manufacturing capacity,"" Mahesh Zagade, former health secretary of Maharashtra state, told the BBC. Officials say India produces enough oxygen to meet the spike in demand but transportation was the problem. Experts say this should have been fixed much earlier. The government is now running special trains carrying oxygen from one state to another and stopping use of oxygen in industries - but only aftermany patients died because of a lack of oxygen. Very ill patients have been stuck outside hospitals as they wait for beds to become available ""The outcome has been that desperate family members are spending thousands of rupees to secure an oxygen cylinder on the black market and then stand for hours in a queue to get it filled,"" points out Dr Lahariya. Meanwhile, those who can afford itare also paying hefty amounts to procure drugs like remdesivir and tocilizumab. An executive from a pharmaceutical company which manufactures remdesivir said ""demand had dried up"" in January and February.  ""If the government had placed an order, we would have stockpiled and there wouldn't have been any shortage. We have ramped up production but demand has grown significantly,"" he said. In contrast, the southern state of Kerala planned for the surge in advance. Dr A Fathahudeen, who is part of the state's Covid taskforce, says there was no shortage of oxygen in the state as necessary steps were taken in October last year. Relatives of patients have been refilling oxygen cylinders themselves ""We also procured sufficient stock of remdesivir and tocilizumab and other drugs well in advance. We also have a surge plan in place to tackle any exponential rise in the numbers in the coming weeks,"" he says. Mr Zagade says other states should have also taken similar steps ""to avoid the suffering"". ""Learning means someone else has done it and you can do it now, but that means it will take time,"" the former health secretary for Maharashtra said. But time is running out as the second wave is now spreading to villages where healthcare systems are not equipped to deal with the surge. Genome sequencing of the virus is an important step in identifying new variants that could be more infectious and deadly. The Indian SARS-CoV-2 Genomic Consortia (INSACOG) was set up last year and it brought together 10 labs in the country. But the group reportedly struggled to get funding initially,external. Virologist Dr Jameel says India started seriously looking at mutations fairly late, with sequencing efforts only ""properly started"" in mid-February 2021. India is sequencing just over 1% of all samples at the moment. ""In comparison, the UK was sequencing at 5-6% at the peak of the pandemic. But you can't build such capacity overnight,"" he said. However, India's main hope was always vaccination. This woman wanted to record the moment of vaccination ""Any public health specialist will tell you there is no practical way to strengthen an already broken public healthcare system in a matter of months,"" one woman, whose family runs a large private hospital in Delhi, told the BBC. ""The best and most effective alternative to battle Covid was to vaccinate the population as quickly as possible so the majority wouldn't need hospital care and hence not overburden the healthcare system."" India initially wanted 300 million people vaccinated by July, ""but it seems the government did not do enough planning to secure vaccine supply to run the programme"", Dr Lahariya says. ""On top of it, it has opened the vaccination for all adults without securing vaccine supplies."" So far, only about 26 million people have been fully vaccinated out of a population of 1.4 billion, and about 124 million have received a single dose. India has millions more doses on order, but still far short of what it actually needs. The federal government needs 615 million doses to vaccinate everyone above the age of 45 - about 440 million people. There are 622 million people between the age of 18 and 44, and 1.2 billion doses are required to vaccinate them. India's vaccine shortage: The wait gets longer What is the India Covid variant? The government has also cancelled exports, reneging on international commitments. The government has enlisted other firms like Biological E and the state-run Haffkine Institute to produce vaccines. It has also given credit support of $609m to the Serum Institute of India, which produces the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab which is being made in India as Covishield, to ramp up production.

Ikea starts offering vouchers for old furniture,"The secondhand areas in Ikea stores will be called Circular Hubs Ikea has launched its long-awaited furniture buy-back and re-sale scheme, in an attempt to reduce the number of products going to landfill. The move is part of the retail giant's sustainability drive to become ""climate positive"" by 2030. Customers will get vouchers to spend in-store if items they no longer need are returned in good condition. Ikea admitted the scheme was a learning curve, but decided to launch it after successful trials in several cities. ""I'm not saying we have all the answers, but we learned enough from the pilots to tell us that this could be something of real value to us and our customers,"" Hege Saebjornsen, an environmental and sustainability expert at Ikea, told the BBC. The initiative, originally scheduled to launch in November but postponed because of the pandemic, is now available in Ikea stores across the UK. It is also being launched in the other 26 countries in which Ikea operates. Used products returned in as-new condition with no scratches will be bought for 50% of the original price, while items with minor scratches will be bought for 40%. Furniture that is well used with several scratches will be bought for 30%. The items will be sold in separate areas of the stores, although Ikea has also announced a new partnership with Gumtree to sell second-hand products via the online marketplace. Sustainability key to long-term corporate health Ikea France on trial for snooping on staff Ikea to start selling spare parts for products Products eligible for buy-back include dressers, cabinets, bookcases and shelf units, small tables, dining tables and desks. The Swedish company has already announced it wants to become fully ""circular"" - eliminate waste through the continual use of materials - by 2030. Ingka Group, Ikea's parent company, recently announced it was investing â¬4bn in renewable energy. Customers wanting to sell back furniture go to Ikea.co.uk to fill out an online form, which generates a preliminary offer, and then take items to a store. Ikea is trialling Pre-Loved Labels, giving customers information about an item's past. Ms Saebjornsen, a former sustainability manager at the retailer and now an Ikea adviser on the forthcoming COP26 climate summit, said that exactly what the consumer uptake will be is unknown. But she said the trials, including in Sydney, Lisbon, Edinburgh and Glasgow, ""were really successful. It taught us a lot about the appetite for this and how people behave"". The second-hand market generally - from clothing to homeware - is growing rapidly as shopping habits change, and Ikea hopes to tap into this, she said. One potential drawback was that furniture must be delivered fully-assembled, a possible impediment for people who have heavy and bulky items. ""We still found people are taking us up on it [the scheme],"" she said. Ikea is working on how to improve the disassembly of products. ""Some are better than others. Products can get damaged when taken apart, so we can only really accept assembled products. It maintains the security and quality of the item,"" she said. Although Ikea is offering vouchers, not cash, the scheme is not being introduced as a profit driver for the retailer, she said. Still, doesn't it reinforce a buy-new, disposable culture? ""We've taken all of that into account,"" Ms Saebjornsen said. ""It's really important to highlight that the voucher has no use-by date. They can be used to buy another second hand item, or food. ""The real consideration here is that it's about how we make sustainable and healthy living easy, accessible and affordable, and really mainstream. ""Ikea is such a large company with massive potential to reach millions of customers. ""We are not saying that we have all the answers. But small actions can make a difference."" The buy-back service is available in full-sized Ikea stores nationwide, excluding order and collection points in Tottenham Court Road, Norwich and Aberdeen. The service will launch in Reading and Belfast on 17 May.

India's opposition Congress party is calling for a full lockdown in order for the country to get on top of the current wave of coronavirus - saying it is the ""only option left"". Spokesman Pawan Khera tells BBC World News the government has ignored the warnings of experts and been too slow to react to the scale of the current epidemic. The national spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not rejected a lockdown but has decided to leave it to individual states to impose measures. You can watch Khera's comments below. This video can not be played A 12-year-old girl who sued her school in an attempt to prevent it from ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of masks has lost her court case. The pupil, known only as AB, sued the Tapton Academy School Trust in Sheffield, claiming mask-wearing risks causing âserious harmâ to childrenâs physical and mental health. The trust says its policy is to encourage mask-wearing, not to enforce it. More than 10% of staff across its schools have been infected since August, the trust had said, underlining the risk to health. Today, Judge Roger ter Haar QC has rejected the request for an injunction because of ""a fundamental defect"" - the pupil had already been given an exemption from wearing a mask, so the injunction was not necessary to protect her health and safety. He says he made âno conclusions whatsoever as to the safety or otherwise of requiring children to wear face masks at schoolâ, although he noted concerns were ""strongly held"" by people such as AB's father and those who crowdfunded the legal case. But the judge says evidence submitted on the physical and psychological risks of wearing masks âdo not represent universal scientific and medical views"". Visitors to Blackpool could be asked to take Covid tests at their hotels in a bid to keep outbreaks at bay once the seaside town fully reopens.

The UK has said its programme of booster vaccine shots could start in September, while a World Health Organization official isurging wealthy countries to delayuntil hard-hit nations are fully vaccinated. But why might booster jabs be needed? Countries are carefully monitoring coronavirus for mutations that might help it spread, make people sicker or overpower vaccines - so they can adjust their vaccination programmes and keep the virus under control. About 200 cases ofthe India variant(B.1.617) had been confirmed in the UK as of 28 April. It's the latest variant to come under scrutiny, but there's not yet enough evidence to make it an official ""variant of concern"" or to show it's directly responsible for India'srecent surge in Covid-19 cases. Current vaccines were designed for earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work, albeit potentially less well. Experts are confident existing vaccines can be redesigned to better tackle emerging mutations. The UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Read more on how the variants are tracked  Staff at Cardiff's biggest intensive care unit are creating a woodland to offset carbon emissions created by machines used to treat Covid patients in hospital. More than 1,000 trees have been planted near Crickhowell in Wales. One of those involved, Dr Jack Parry-Jones, describes the effort as ""a lasting memorial"" to staff and patients.

A surge in traffic is expected this summer, as people seek UK getaways Traffic on Britain's roads at the weekend returned to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September. But Department of Transport figures show the traffic levels were driven by heavy and light goods vehicles. Those were at 112% and 118% of normal levels over Sunday 25 April and Saturday 1 May. The RAC Foundation suggests the higher levels of delivery vehicles were caused by the popularity of online shopping in the pandemic. Car use was at 95% and 96% of pre-pandemic levels on the same two days, while on weekdays usage was only at an average of 88%. AA president Edmund King says workers staying away from offices are largely responsible for the 10% of previous car travel no longer taking place. He says ""there is a growing feeling that coronavirus will continue to cast a shadow over travel even after June"" but ""a surge in car travel during the summer"" is expected as people celebrate the end of lockdown with a UK holiday. Demand for public transport is returning more slowly, with bus use at 54% of normal levels outside London and 60% within the capital. And people are only taking 34% of the usual number of journeys on the mainline rail network. India is grappling with a devastating second wave of Covid infections, which is overwhelming hospitals in major cities including Delhi. But Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, tells BBC World News there are even more cases in rural areas. ""70% of India's population lives in rural India, and there are no hospital facilities there,"" he says. ""You won't see long lines outside hospitals simply because there aren't very many at all to begin with."" He warns it may take several weeks before the situation in the country can ""turn around"".

Canada has become the first nationto approve the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 and over. Chief medical advisor of Health Canada Dr Supriya Sharma tells a press conference the decision is ""a significant milestone"" in the fight against Covid. ""The department determined that this vaccine is safe and
effective when used in this younger age group,"" she says. ""We are
starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel."" Critics have criticised what some see as the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in Canada. According to Our World in Data, the country has delivered 37.85 doses per 100 people - about half the rate in the US. More than 30% of UK adults have now received the second dose of a Covid vaccine, the official data shows. Another 257,486 people had their second jab on Tuesday, meaning 15,630,007 people, or 30.2% of all adults, have had both vaccinations. A total of 127,170 people received their first dose, the latest figures show, taking that measurement to 34,667,904 (66.1% of all adults). It means 50,682,567 first and second doses have been given across the UK. The UK has reported another 2,144 new Covid cases. Official data shows there were also a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This compares with 2,166 cases and 29 deaths a week ago. A nurse who has worked throughout the pandemic

Tomorrow millions of people will able to vote in elections taking place across England, Scotland and Wales. Covid safety measures mean counting will last several days and the results will come out at different times. Some counts, including the Hartlepool by-election, will take place overnight on Thursday night/Friday morning. We will also know all the results for the Welsh Senedd on Friday. Scotland starts counting in some areas on Friday and the final results are expected on Saturday. English council votes will be spread over four days from Thursday night until Sunday.

India's opposition Congress party is calling for a full lockdown in order for the country to get on top of the current wave of coronavirus - saying it is the ""only option left"". Spokesman Pawan Khera tells BBC World News the government has ignored the warnings of experts and been too slow to react to the scale of the current epidemic. The national spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not rejected a lockdown but has decided to leave it to individual states to impose measures. You can watch Khera's comments below. This video can not be played A 12-year-old girl who sued her school in an attempt to prevent it from ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of masks has lost her court case. The pupil, known only as AB, sued the Tapton Academy School Trust in Sheffield, claiming mask-wearing risks causing âserious harmâ to childrenâs physical and mental health. The trust says its policy is to encourage mask-wearing, not to enforce it. More than 10% of staff across its schools have been infected since August, the trust had said, underlining the risk to health. Today, Judge Roger ter Haar QC has rejected the request for an injunction because of ""a fundamental defect"" - the pupil had already been given an exemption from wearing a mask, so the injunction was not necessary to protect her health and safety. He says he made âno conclusions whatsoever as to the safety or otherwise of requiring children to wear face masks at schoolâ, although he noted concerns were ""strongly held"" by people such as AB's father and those who crowdfunded the legal case. But the judge says evidence submitted on the physical and psychological risks of wearing masks âdo not represent universal scientific and medical views"". Visitors to Blackpool could be asked to take Covid tests at their hotels in a bid to keep outbreaks at bay once the seaside town fully reopens. The town's council is in talks with local hospitality businesses about rolling out the voluntary tests. Concerns about the impact of an influx of tourists on case numbers were raised at the authority's audit committee. The town has often suffered high infection rates throughout the pandemic. Read more. The UK has said its programme of booster vaccine shots could start in September, while a World Health Organization official isurging wealthy countries to delayuntil hard-hit nations are fully vaccinated. But why might booster jabs be needed? Countries are carefully monitoring coronavirus for mutations that might help it spread, make people sicker or overpower vaccines - so they can adjust their vaccination programmes and keep the virus under control. About 200 cases ofthe India variant(B.1.617) had been confirmed in the UK as of 28 April. It's the latest variant to come under scrutiny, but there's not yet enough evidence to make it an official ""variant of concern"" or to show it's directly responsible for India'srecent surge in Covid-19 cases. Current vaccines were designed for earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work, albeit potentially less well. Experts are confident existing vaccines can be redesigned to better tackle emerging mutations. The UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Read more on how the variants are tracked  Staff at Cardiff's biggest intensive care unit are creating a woodland to offset carbon emissions created by machines used to treat Covid patients in hospital. More than 1,000 trees have been planted near Crickhowell in Wales. One of those involved, Dr Jack Parry-Jones, describes the effort as ""a lasting memorial"" to staff and patients.

It is understood 34 cruise workers from India arrived in Torquay last week to board the Marella Explorer as the industry prepares to restart fully.

A surge in traffic is expected this summer, as people seek UK getaways Traffic on Britain's roads at the weekend returned to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September. But Department of Transport figures show the traffic levels were driven by heavy and light goods vehicles. Those were at 112% and 118% of normal levels over Sunday 25 April and Saturday 1 May. The RAC Foundation suggests the higher levels of delivery vehicles were caused by the popularity of online shopping in the pandemic. Car use was at 95% and 96% of pre-pandemic levels on the same two days, while on weekdays usage was only at an average of 88%. AA president Edmund King says workers staying away from offices are largely responsible for the 10% of previous car travel no longer taking place. He says ""there is a growing feeling that coronavirus will continue to cast a shadow over travel even after June"" but ""a surge in car travel during the summer"" is expected as people celebrate the end of lockdown with a UK holiday. Demand for public transport is returning more slowly, with bus use at 54% of normal levels outside London and 60% within the capital. And people are only taking 34% of the usual number of journeys on the mainline rail network. India is grappling with a devastating second wave of Covid infections, which is overwhelming hospitals in major cities including Delhi. But Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, tells BBC World News there are even more cases in rural areas. ""70% of India's population lives in rural India, and there are no hospital facilities there,"" he says. ""You won't see long lines outside hospitals simply because there aren't very many at all to begin with."" He warns it may take several weeks before the situation in the country can ""turn around"". This video can not be played âRural Indiaâs hidden coronavirus epidemicâ As coronavirus restrictions have begun to ease across the UK, the rules on social distancing and mixing with people you don't live with are being reviewed. The UK's current rules say you should stay 2m (6ft) away from anyone you don't live with, or are in a social bubble with. In England, if it's not possible to stay 2m apart, the ""one-metre plus"" guidance means you should be at least 1m (3ft) apartwith extra precautions in place,external, such as face coverings.

Canada has become the first nationto approve the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 and over. Chief medical advisor of Health Canada Dr Supriya Sharma tells a press conference the decision is ""a significant milestone"" in the fight against Covid. ""The department determined that this vaccine is safe and
effective when used in this younger age group,"" she says. ""We are
starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel."" Critics have criticised what some see as the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in Canada. According to Our World in Data, the country has delivered 37.85 doses per 100 people - about half the rate in the US. More than 30% of UK adults have now received the second dose of a Covid vaccine, the official data shows. Another 257,486 people had their second jab on Tuesday, meaning 15,630,007 people, or 30.2% of all adults, have had both vaccinations. A total of 127,170 people received their first dose, the latest figures show, taking that measurement to 34,667,904 (66.1% of all adults). It means 50,682,567 first and second doses have been given across the UK. The UK has reported another 2,144 new Covid cases. Official data shows there were also a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This compares with 2,166 cases and 29 deaths a week ago. A nurse who has worked throughout the pandemic
is hoping to buy a home on a Caribbean island after winning Â£10,000 per month for a

retire in June after 35 years in nursing. She and her partner, self-employed builder Charlie
Hobson, 62, hope the win will allow them to spend more time on the island of

Leo Varadkar is the Republic of Ireland's deputy head of government Leo Varadkar, the Republic of Ireland's TÃ¡naiste or deputy head of government, has said he is hopeful most coronavirus restrictions will be gone by August. Speaking at the department of health in Dublin, Varadkar says he is looking at countries such as Israel and the UK where the vaccination programme is further ahead than in Ireland. ""They're welcoming tourists again and they're having not very large gatherings, but they are having mass gatherings,"" he says. He predicts outdoor dining could return by June, schools going back in September, and ""a pretty normal Christmas in terms of seeing our friends and relations"".

Tomorrow millions of people will able to vote in elections taking place across England, Scotland and Wales. Covid safety measures mean counting will last several days and the results will come out at different times. Some counts, including the Hartlepool by-election, will take place overnight on Thursday night/Friday morning. We will also know all the results for the Welsh Senedd on Friday. Scotland starts counting in some areas on Friday and the final results are expected on Saturday. English council votes will be spread over four days from Thursday night until Sunday. A dozen of the Police and Crime Commissioner elections in England won't count until Monday. We've answered some more of your questions about the local electionshere. India's opposition Congress party is calling for a full lockdown in order for the country to get on top of the current wave of coronavirus - saying it is the ""only option left"". Spokesman Pawan Khera tells BBC World News the government has ignored the warnings of experts and been too slow to react to the scale of the current epidemic. The national spokesperson for the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party says Prime Minister Narendra Modi has not rejected a lockdown but has decided to leave it to individual states to impose measures. You can watch Khera's comments below. This video can not be played A 12-year-old girl who sued her school in an attempt to prevent it from ""requiring or encouraging"" the use of masks has lost her court case. The pupil, known only as AB, sued the Tapton Academy School Trust in Sheffield, claiming mask-wearing risks causing âserious harmâ to childrenâs physical and mental health. The trust says its policy is to encourage mask-wearing, not to enforce it. More than 10% of staff across its schools have been infected since August, the trust had said, underlining the risk to health. Today, Judge Roger ter Haar QC has rejected the request for an injunction because of ""a fundamental defect"" - the pupil had already been given an exemption from wearing a mask, so the injunction was not necessary to protect her health and safety. He says he made âno conclusions whatsoever as to the safety or otherwise of requiring children to wear face masks at schoolâ, although he noted concerns were ""strongly held"" by people such as AB's father and those who crowdfunded the legal case. But the judge says evidence submitted on the physical and psychological risks of wearing masks âdo not represent universal scientific and medical views"". Visitors to Blackpool could be asked to take Covid tests at their hotels in a bid to keep outbreaks at bay once the seaside town fully reopens. The town's council is in talks with local hospitality businesses about rolling out the voluntary tests. Concerns about the impact of an influx of tourists on case numbers were raised at the authority's audit committee. The town has often suffered high infection rates throughout the pandemic. Read more. The UK has said its programme of booster vaccine shots could start in September, while a World Health Organization official isurging wealthy countries to delayuntil hard-hit nations are fully vaccinated. But why might booster jabs be needed? Countries are carefully monitoring coronavirus for mutations that might help it spread, make people sicker or overpower vaccines - so they can adjust their vaccination programmes and keep the virus under control. About 200 cases ofthe India variant(B.1.617) had been confirmed in the UK as of 28 April. It's the latest variant to come under scrutiny, but there's not yet enough evidence to make it an official ""variant of concern"" or to show it's directly responsible for India'srecent surge in Covid-19 cases. Current vaccines were designed for earlier versions of coronavirus, but scientists believe they should still work, albeit potentially less well. Experts are confident existing vaccines can be redesigned to better tackle emerging mutations. The UK government hasa deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac,externalto develop vaccines against future variants, and has pre-ordered 50 million doses. Depending on how variants continue to develop, these could potentially be used to offer a booster vaccine to older or clinically vulnerable people later in the year. Read more on how the variants are tracked  Staff at Cardiff's biggest intensive care unit are creating a woodland to offset carbon emissions created by machines used to treat Covid patients in hospital. More than 1,000 trees have been planted near Crickhowell in Wales. One of those involved, Dr Jack Parry-Jones, describes the effort as ""a lasting memorial"" to staff and patients. Dr Craig Spencer, who has spent the past year working ""within four walls"" in hospital, says it was ""joyous"" being outside in nature and being able to look at his colleagues without them wearing personal protective equipment (PPE).

Liners have been using sheltered waters off Torbay to anchor during the pandemic, which saw cruises cancelled. It is understood 34 cruise workers from India arrived in Torquay last week to board the Marella Explorer as the industry prepares to restart fully. The two crew members were reported to have been sent to self-isolate at a hotel in Southampton, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service. Read more. A surge in traffic is expected this summer, as people seek UK getaways Traffic on Britain's roads at the weekend returned to pre-pandemic levels for the first time since September. But Department of Transport figures show the traffic levels were driven by heavy and light goods vehicles. Those were at 112% and 118% of normal levels over Sunday 25 April and Saturday 1 May. The RAC Foundation suggests the higher levels of delivery vehicles were caused by the popularity of online shopping in the pandemic. Car use was at 95% and 96% of pre-pandemic levels on the same two days, while on weekdays usage was only at an average of 88%. AA president Edmund King says workers staying away from offices are largely responsible for the 10% of previous car travel no longer taking place. He says ""there is a growing feeling that coronavirus will continue to cast a shadow over travel even after June"" but ""a surge in car travel during the summer"" is expected as people celebrate the end of lockdown with a UK holiday. Demand for public transport is returning more slowly, with bus use at 54% of normal levels outside London and 60% within the capital. And people are only taking 34% of the usual number of journeys on the mainline rail network. India is grappling with a devastating second wave of Covid infections, which is overwhelming hospitals in major cities including Delhi. But Dr Ramanan Laxminarayan, the director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy, tells BBC World News there are even more cases in rural areas. ""70% of India's population lives in rural India, and there are no hospital facilities there,"" he says. ""You won't see long lines outside hospitals simply because there aren't very many at all to begin with."" He warns it may take several weeks before the situation in the country can ""turn around"".

The UK's current rules say you should stay 2m (6ft) away from anyone you don't live with, or are in a social bubble with. In England, if it's not possible to stay 2m apart, the ""one-metre plus"" guidance means you should be at least 1m (3ft) apartwith extra precautions in place,external, such as face coverings.

Canada has become the first nationto approve the use of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine for children aged 12 and over. Chief medical advisor of Health Canada Dr Supriya Sharma tells a press conference the decision is ""a significant milestone"" in the fight against Covid. ""The department determined that this vaccine is safe and
effective when used in this younger age group,"" she says. ""We are
starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel."" Critics have criticised what some see as the slow pace of the vaccine rollout in Canada. According to Our World in Data, the country has delivered 37.85 doses per 100 people - about half the rate in the US. More than 30% of UK adults have now received the second dose of a Covid vaccine, the official data shows. Another 257,486 people had their second jab on Tuesday, meaning 15,630,007 people, or 30.2% of all adults, have had both vaccinations. A total of 127,170 people received their first dose, the latest figures show, taking that measurement to 34,667,904 (66.1% of all adults). It means 50,682,567 first and second doses have been given across the UK. The UK has reported another 2,144 new Covid cases. Official data shows there were also a further 27 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. This compares with 2,166 cases and 29 deaths a week ago. A nurse who has worked throughout the pandemic

Woman loses nearly Â£113k in romance fraudRachel Elwell says she is facing bankruptcy after losing money to a scammer.,"Rachel Elwell said police had told her she was a victim of romance fraud A woman says she is facing bankruptcy after losing just under Â£113,000 to a scammer she met on a dating site. Rachel Elwell, from the West Midlands, said the man, who claimed he lived nearby, told her he had gone abroad for an engineering contract in Ukraine. He convinced her with documents and pictures he needed money for issues that had cropped up and stated he had been taken captive by loan sharks. Ms Elwell, 50, said there was no guarantee of any money coming back. Asked why she had given money to a man she had never met, the export manager, of Brownhills, said: ""When he said to me his life was in danger and I didn't hear from him, I thought he'd been murdered. ""Can you imagine feeling you're responsible for whether someone lives or dies?"" Ms Elwell said after he had contacted her on 1 January claiming to live in Cannock, his ""picture looked nice"", he ""seemed to like the same things as me"" and ""seemed quite an open and genuine guy"". The man told her they would have to wait weeks to meet as he would need to stay in Ukraine, but later phoned claiming laws in that country had changed due to Covid and he now had to pay tax before any of the engineering work began, Ms Elwell said. Telling the story toBBC Radio WM, Ms Elwell said she had been told work had stopped on site and matters ""appeared very legitimate"", but later she had ""reluctantly"" sent him money. She stated at one point a supposed tax office had sent a letter to him, which she had a copy of, and added: ""They said... 'you need to pay 160 thousand'. So he cashed his pension in, sold his car, borrowed money and I helped him. ""I mean at this point I think it was about Â£45k I'd sent him to help him with the tax bill."" Action Fraud advises people who believe they have been a victim to contact their bank According toAction Fraud,external, romance or dating fraud is where criminals dupe people into sending them money by gaining their trust and convincing them they are in a genuine relationship. In order to stay safe from such scams, it advises people to: Be suspicious of any requests for money from someone they have never met in person, particularly if they have only recently met online Speak to family or friends to get advice Perform reverse image searches on profile pictures, as they may not be genuine. A reverse image search can find photos that have been taken from somewhere else Anyone who believes they have been a victim of romance fraud, it said, should report it to their bank immediately and to Action Fraud. Continuing the story, Ms Elwell said the man had claimed two ""heavies"" had turned up and he had been locked in a cellar. He sent her pictures purporting to show him there. She added he claimed to have been released after money had been sent, but he had told her he would not have his passport, which had been taken from him, until interest had been paid. On the day the man told Ms Elwell he was due to fly back, 16 March, she went to Heathrow airport and got an email from supposed airport officials saying he had been arrested. Romance fraud on rise in coronavirus lockdown Romance fraudsters 'preying on lonely' in lockdown Latest West Midlands news She said she had then approached Border Force officials who said, ""look, it's a scam"". She went to his supposed house in Coventry to meet his daughter and housekeeper/nanny, but ""no such people lived at that house"".

Four arrested in ex-Australia cricketer kidnap case,"Stuart MacGill (seen here in 2017) was released about an hour into the ordeal Former Australian star cricketer Stuart MacGill was abducted and released in an alleged kidnapping in Sydney last month, police say. Four people have been arrested in connection with the incident which took place on 14 April. Police said MacGill knew one of the men and the plot had been financially motivated. He sustained minor injuries in the incident but didn't require medical care, police said. MacGill, 50, was a Test spinner for the national team between 1998 and 2008. At one point, he was ranked the world's second-best bowler behind his team-mate Shane Warne. New South Wales Police said the arrests, which took place after raids were conducted across Sydney on Wednesday, were the result of a two-week long investigation. Police allege MacGill had been approached and confronted in the Sydney suburb of Cremorne one evening by a 46-year-old man he knew. Two other men then appeared and the group forced the ex-cricketer into a car. He was driven to a remote site in Bringelly, on the city's outskirts, where he was allegedly assaulted and threatened at gunpoint by the ""criminal gang"", police said. After about an hour, he was driven to the south-west suburb of Belmore and released, police said. Authorities said no money was handed over or obtained in the course of the attack, but the kidnapping attempt had been financially motivated. Police said MacGill reported the crime to authorities one week after it occurred, and that he had been worried about his and his family's safety. ""To be standing on a street, to be dragged into a car, driven a remote location, physically assaulted, threatened with a firearm, held for a period of time and then dumped, I think you would be pretty worried,"" said detective Anthony Holton. ""I know it is only an hour that he was held, but it would have been a horribly frightful hour to endure through,"" he added. He said MacGill's ordeal was ""not involved in any back story that leads to him having a personal debt to other people,"" and that he was solely being treated as a ""victim of a targeted kidnapping"". Police said the arrested group members - aged 27, 29, 42 and 46 - would be charged later on Wednesday. Australian media reported MacGill, who retired from cricket in 2008, works as the general manager of a restaurant in Sydney's northern suburbs. MacGill is yet to provide public comment on the incident.

UK pledges extra cash to target new Covid variants,"Extra funding to fast-track new vaccines will help ""future-proof"" the UK against new coronavirus variants, the vaccines minister has said. Existing vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps mutating. Nadhim Zahawi said the Â£29.3m funding increase would boost testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory. Separately, he said booster jabs would be ready to deploy from September. Asked about reports inthe Times,externalthat third jabs would be given to over-50s and those with underlying health conditions in the autumn, the vaccines minister said no decision had been made yet. Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the booster programme could begin in September ""or later in the year, or early next year"". He said clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme. Clinical trials will also be looking at the evidence on mixing different vaccines to see what will offer the most protection. Coronavirus variants: What you need to know about how Covid is changing What is the India Covid variant and will vaccines work? The vaccines minister also confirmed there would be an update from the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later this week about England restarting international travel. Meanwhile, the government said its extra funding - on top of Â£19.7m already promised - would also aid vaccine manufacture and allow scientists to accelerate the pace and scale of their work. The cash will allow scientists to test 3,000 blood samples a week, up from 700 at the moment, to measure the levels of protective antibodies against Covid-19 generated by different vaccines. Whether or not at-risk adults are offered a booster dose this autumn will depend on two key factors: whether immunity from the first two doses has waned so older adults are vulnerable to an autumn wave of infection; and whether a variant emerges which means the current vaccines can't prevent serious Covid disease. Until we know the answers, it would be wrong to assume a third booster dose is on the cards. But of course it is being planned for. All vaccine manufacturers are working on tweaked vaccines, which will aim to deal with so-called escape variants. And a key UK trial - which will offer people a third dose of a different vaccine to the one they initially received - is not yet under way. In January 2020, scientists across the world began work on vaccines against the novel coronavirus, long before the disease it caused even had a name. Had they waited until it was clear a vaccine was needed, the delay would have cost tens of millions of lives. The government is already making plans for a booster Covid-vaccine programme in the autumn, to protect the most vulnerable ahead of winter. Last week itordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters. And it may use new, updated vaccines that are a better match for emerging variants. But the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid, David Nabarro, said the global vaccine rollout should be prioritised over booster jabs in the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's the World At One, he said: ""What you do with a scarce preventive action like a vaccine is that you give it to the people who need it the most. You have to look at the issue as a world issue. ""Top ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries that should come a bit later,"" he said. Following the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years."" UK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: ""A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. ""This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants. ""While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops."" The government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Prof Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), saidnew variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic. ""In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,"" he told the BBC. ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Prof Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored ""carefully"", but the UK had gone from a ""terrible situation"" in January to a ""remarkably good situation now"". Covid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval. In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May.

Can Labour strike lucky twice in Welsh election?,"Three of Wales' four party leaders are challenging in their first Welsh election as a leader These Senedd elections are not the ones we anticipated and there's a strange contradictory feel to them. It's been a low-key campaign which has scarcely dazzled, yet the results on Friday feel more significant than ever. The Members of the Senedd - or MSs - elected will serve in a proper parliament with law-making and tax setting powers. Added excitement comes from the very tight margins that will decide at least a quarter of the constituency seats and several regional list seats. Final day of campaigning in Senedd election race Five things to find out from the Welsh election Who should I vote for in the Welsh election? Small shifts in votes could determine the distribution of seats to parties and therefore the shape of our next Welsh government. So, the final results are unpredictable, dependent as they are on several important unknowns. First, this is a Covid election - both practically and policy wise. How will Covid affect the outcome of the election? We are edging out of lockdown, but with gargantuan recovery problems ahead. Most of us had imagined a dramatically different political landscape for Senedd 2021, framed by post-Brexit adaptation not a pandemic. Then there's turnout: I called devolution Wales' 'dirty little secret' as no election has generated a turnout of above 50%, impacting on Senedd credibility and legitimacy. It should be higher this time, but who knows as we ease out of lockdown restrictions. It's also less about the raw percentage figure and more about who actually goes out to vote that matters - this time more than ever, with such small margins deciding many seats. This video can not be played Once the votes are cast and the polls close on 6 May, what's next? Tyler Edwards explains Whilst the overall votes are likely to be split relatively evenly between the three big parties, Wales's semi-hybrid - and increasingly dysfunctional - electoral system benefits the largest party whilst offering opportunities for the smaller parties on the regional list. Attention will be on whether Welsh Labour can win an overall majority (and no party's ever achieved this) or has to govern alongside Plaid Cymru, with or without a formal coalition. What about the other 'c's - credibility and the constitution? TheBBC Leaders' Debate last weekwas not a dial shifter, but it did expose parties on the campaigning front and back foot. Voters will also have been able to judge the credibility of the main contenders for first minister. What will the turnout be at this year's Senedd election? Welsh Labour's campaigning has been all about packing its defence and playing up its sure footed Covid handling. The party's had least need to adapt, keeping the push on its track record of delivery, competence and trust. Labour has been in power for all of devolution's 22 years and the most (small 'c') conservative and successful political party in Wales (there's a lesson there) is running on a platform of carrying on with what it's doing. This video can not be played James Williams looks at how many people have turned out to vote in the past It has been helped by the fact that Mark Drakeford has become an electoral asset, newly recognised and mostly popular, an avuncular ""safe pair of hands"". Amongst the Welsh-identifying, centre-left part of the electorate, Covid handling is not a particularly promising route to criticise the Labour government. Bluntly, this impacts Plaid Cymru most. Adam Price is hoping Plaid Cymru can win over Labour voters Plaid's intention to make the case for the removal of Mark Drakeford was wrecked by Covid. Voters appear ensconced in national identity ""tribes"" with limited crossover between them. Welsh Labour and Plaid currently share the same tribal identity - but Labour is clearly dominant. Plaid's planned presidential campaign had its charismatic leader, Adam Price front and centre but its hopes of replacing Welsh Labour Ã  la SNP were shattered by the way Welsh public opinion realigned over Covid. It's fair to say that Welsh Labour has ridden its luck in Senedd elections, not least in 2016 when it clung on to many seats in what became known as the 'Red Wall' - often by very small margins, a good way of describing this is as a very efficient votes to seats won ratio! This time, seats like Llanelli, Wrexham, Brecon and Radnorshire, Gower, Delyn, Rhondda, Vale of Clwyd, Caerphilly and Vale of Glamorgan are all interesting for different reasons. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been campaigning in Wales and the Tories hope the voters who backed them in the General Election will turn out Still, due to the inbuilt compensatory mechanism of our electoral system, Labour would have to lose several constituency seats in the south, including some in the valleys to Plaid, not to be the largest party on 7 May. The problem for the Tories is that it's not as straightforward as getting out the half a million Welsh voters who supported them in 2019. That was a UK election, all about getting Brexit done - and ""done"" it is in most people's minds. We know that many in the 'Red Wall' were not necessarily natural Tories and there's long been plenty of voter mobility in Wales. Campaign group Yes Cymru has organised a series of marches as it increases support for independence Andrew RT Davies' populist style might well capture some of UKIP's sizeable vote last time around, but that might be too dispersed to help the Welsh Conservatives win many of their targets. Before recent events at Downing Street, the Welsh Conservatives were in bullish mood. They will still likely make some seat gains but what currency will these have given Davies has effectively ruled out all feasible routes to governing? Still, winning some of its plausible Labour-held targets would probably seal the results day narrative and surely be noticed at UK level given the potential implications for both Johnson and Starmer. Despite plenty of interest in the topic from media far and wide, this is not an independence election. Nevertheless, strong support for independence amongst young voters - especially with 16- and 17-year-olds now on the electoral roll - and amongst Labour supporters might prove critical if a mandate for Indy Ref 2 is delivered in Scotland. If Plaid plays the long game, this could prove significant. Adam Price ruled out most realistic coalitions early doors, but his party's best hope now is for a last-minute surge in support in a couple of key constituencies, along with picking up a couple of extra regional list seats. If Labour doesn't manage to ride its luck twice - and its 2016 results represent a high bar after all- this would mean some fascinating negotiations over the shape of our next government.

Uni team wants to change 'lad culture' perceptions,"This video can not be played Stepping up: The university footballers offering to walk women home When Ben Marett saw a post on Facebook threatening women at a university with rape on a Saturday night, he felt scared and wanted to do something to help. Concerned about his friend Mia, as he knew she was off out that night, it got him thinking about other women who might be worried about their safety. So he messaged members of his university football team, asking if they would support him in chaperoning women in pairs late that night. After posting the offer on social media, about 30 women contacted them so they could walk home together. The issue of women's safety was brought into sharp focus across the country and across the world in March following thedisappearance of Sarah Everardon her walk home in London. The 33-year-old's body was found in woodland a week after she vanished and a man is charged with her murder. Ben hopes his and other initiatives being undertaken by the Cardiff University team will help their friends feel safe in university. They also hope it helps challenge perceptions about the sometimes ""laddish"" culture associated with men's sports teams. Extra security 'to tackle illegal student parties' Uni football suspended after 'initiation' claim Students: Depressed and living in a bubble of one ""People associate it with everyone out drinking, chasing girls, getting into fights and causing mischief, and that the lads aren't good members of society,"" he said. ""This laddish culture needs to change and not just in football, if what me and the boys are doing means people will start to look at sports societies differently and men act more responsibly then that's great."" The 22-year-old is president and club captain of the university football club and said that ultimately he just wanted to help after seeing the post - which turned out to be a hoax. ""We are not saying women need help but if someone was scared, I just wanted them to know that I would send one of the boys to walk you and make sure you are ok,"" he said. ""It's just horrible to think there are people out there that think it is ok - even as a hoax to scare women, and I think a lot of men get categorised into that men aren't safe, which isn't very fair. ""I just wanted to show that there are men out there that will help and aren't doing bad things."" Ben makes sure they all wear their red football tops and posted their faces on social media so they were easily identifiable to women who wanted a chaperone. ""My biggest worry was falling asleep and missing a text from someone, that would have been the worst thing in the world - to wake up and having a text from someone, not knowing if they got home safe of not,"" he said. Ben posted details of the chaperoning initiative on social media Ben's friend, Mia, said having members of the team available to walk her home made the ""world of difference"" and made her feel much more comfortable. ""It shouldn't be a thing where you have to have lads chaperone you but you don't really have a choice,"" she added. The football team were contacted by around 30 women Ryan Smith, who was one of the chaperones, said he was ""buzzing"" to have been able to help. ""I just remember this one girl who kept apologising for wasting our time,"" said Ryan. ""But when you put it down to basics, it's a 15 minute walk home and she felt so scared and then was so embarrassed about that and it is crazy to think that someone has to do that. It's an initiative which Cardiff University has welcomed, adding it was ""proud"" of the way the student community responded to the hoax. For the football team, chaperoning was not the first time they have focused on student wellbeing. Ben and the team's vice president, Jared Evitts, have also been working to encourage men to talk about mental health throughout the Covid pandemic. ""We wanted to provide something positive in a time where things were pretty bleak, it was a pretty dark time for all of us,"" Ben said. The pair started a podcast during lockdown talking about mental health in sport. Ben and Jared want their teammates to be able to talk about mental health issues ""The lads opened up and we just wanted to keep that conversation going,"" Jared, a third year student, added. ""It was the first time the boys were speaking to each other openly, we just thought we would be silly to leave this. ""All the boys got involved and then when the athletics union got in touch to ask us to talk about mental health in sport, and with us unable to play and we weren't able to see each other, we thought what's a way that we can kind of help. ""We hope that it isn't going to just make a difference to the boys now but also those joining in the future. ""But we have to realise that this needs to be happening for all sports though not just football and the laddish culture needs to change. ""Covid has meant we have more time, but seeing the whole committee open up and share their experiences shows how much this is needed. ""Societies can have an impact and alleviate the pressures on services and that's what we are showing, that we can support each other."" Ben has opened up about the mental health issues he has faced and hopes it helps others to do the same Ben and Jared say they hope they can help change the perception people have of university football societies and the culture. ""It's overwhelming really, knowing that this could potentially be the start of better things and people focusing on mental health,"" Ben added. ""I mean I have always had my own mental health problems within the sport, but have never opened up and just to be in this position and potentially be a role model is incredible.""

How Covid changed the Welsh election campaign,"The differences of devolution have been highlighted during the coronavirus pandemic The Covid-19 pandemic has turned our lives upside down over the last year and a bit - and it has done the same for this Senedd election campaign. Pre-Covid, Welsh Labour had been in power for more than two decades and faced a defensive election trying to hold on to a number of marginal seats against opposition parties with the wind in their sails. Before the pandemic struck, few ordinary voters could have picked the Welsh Labour leader, Mark Drakeford, out of a line up. SIGN UP FOR WALES ALERTS:Get extra updates on BBC election coverage Some of his own troops had misgivings about fighting an election under his understated, academic style of leadership, especially against the energetic and rhetorically gifted Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price. Can Adam Price outshine the incumbent first minister, Mark Drakeford? Plaid's plan was to centre their campaign around Mr Price, confident that the contrast between the two men would get many centre left voters leaning in their favour. The Welsh Conservatives were feeling bullish afterdismantling Labour's red wall in the north east of Wales in the 2019 General Election, but their leader, Paul Davies, was a quiet man struggling to make his mark. Final day of campaigning in Senedd election race A really simple guide to the Welsh elections Who should I vote for in the Welsh election? Fast forward to April 2021 and a very different political world. In this world, Mark Drakeford is a well-known figure. He has a better recognition than the UK Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer - an unprecedented event in a devolved election. Covid has shifted the focus onto Mark Drakeford, whose recognition has shot up during the pandemic This presents obvious problems for Plaid's campaign - how does Adam Price outshine an incumbent who, polls suggest, gets good approval ratings for his handling of the pandemic even among Plaid's own supporters? After the""drinking in the Senedd""episode the Welsh Conservatives now have Andrew RT Davies at the helm. He is better known than Paul Davies, but faces the same challenge - how to motivate those who voted Tory in 2019 to do the same again in 2021? Traditionally, Welsh Conservative supporters are less likely to vote in Senedd elections - but the party has deployed UK big hitters, most notably the prime minister to enthuse their base. Have they succeeded or have the allegations swirling around Boris Johnson had an impact? Senedd leader Andrew RT Davies is the Tories can mimic their 2019 UK General Election theme and win more seats in north Wales But some things haven't changed. The Welsh Liberal Democrats are still fighting to hold onto their one Senedd seat in Brecon and Radnorshire, while Welsh Labour's defensive challenge remains. The margins in some key seats are wafer thin and the ""time for change"" narrative employed by Plaid and the Tories could be a powerful one after 22 years of Labour in the post-devolution driving seat. This video can not be played What's different about heading off to the Welsh polls this year? So while none of the main parties are fighting the campaign they planned for, there is still a lot at stake. Even in this most unusual of election campaigns, it's still the voters who decide the result. How to follow the election results on the BBC Can Labour strike lucky twice in Welsh election?

Supermarkets warn Brazil over Amazon land reform,"Land is cleared either to graze cattle for beef exports or to grow soy Nearly 40 UK food businesses have threatened to stop sourcing products from Brazil over proposed land reforms. Anopen letter,externalfrom the group calls on Brazil's legislature to reject a bill which could legalise the private occupation of public land. The letter said the proposal could accelerate deforestation in the Amazon. The bill is being considered just months after Brazil pledged to end illegal logging. They are killing our forest, Brazilian tribe warns Celebs to Biden: Reject Amazon deal with Bolsonaro Brazil cuts environment budget despite pledge Sainsbury's, Aldi, Greggs, the Co-Op, the British Retail Consortium, and the Hilton Food Group are among the major organisations to sign the open letter. A vote in the Senate onthe bill,externalis expected within days. The companies say they ""consider the Amazon as a vital part of the earth system that's essential to the security of our planet, as well as being a critical part of a prosperous future for Brazilians and all of society."" Rainforests are critical to mitigating the effects of climate change, as they store vast amounts of carbon. An aerial view of logs illegally cut from the Amazon rainforest Under the leadership of right-wing President Jair Bolsonaro, the level of deforestation in the Amazon is reported as being the highest since 2008. This year alone around 430,000 acres of the Amazon have been logged or burned, according to theMonitoring of the Andean Amazon Project.,external The vast majority of land is cleared either to graze cattle for beef exports, or to grow soy, which goes in to animal feed around the world. At a summit in April hosted by US President Joe Biden, Mr Bolsonaro declared that Brazil would end illegal logging. The letter says these measures ""run counter"" to this ""narrative and rhetoric."" The new law would allow land that has been illegally occupied after 2014 to be put up for sale. This would potentially allow illegal occupants to buy it. Similar controversial measures were first put forward in a different bill last year, but were withdrawn after more than 40 organisations made the same threat over supply chain sourcing. A road runs through a tract of burnt Amazon jungle near Porto Velho, Rondonia State, Brazil, August 14, 2020 The group says the existing protections and land designations have been ""instrumental"" in their organisations having ""trust"" in Brazilian producers. The companies say that the ""door remains open to work with Brazilian partners"" to develop sustainable land management practice in Brazil. However, if this or other measures that undermine existing protections become law, they will have ""no choice but to reconsider our support and use of the Brazilian agricultural commodity supply chain."" This video can not be played Brazil's environmental police in battle to reduce deforestation in the Amazon Commenting on the imminent vote, Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at WWF-UK, said: ""We cannot fight the climate crisis without the Amazon, yet its future hangs in the balance as deforestation pushes it closer to the point of collapse. ""If passed, this vote in the Brazilian Congress will fuel further destruction and place greater risk on the lives of the people and wildlife who call it home. ""As global efforts to protect the Amazon threaten to be undermined, it's encouraging to see major businesses sounding the alarm."" Cathryn Higgs, head of policy at the Co-op, said it was ""imperative"" the proposed legislation wasn't ""given any airtime by the Brazilian government.""

Ikea starts buy-back scheme to tackle wasteThe service encourages customers to sell back furniture they no longer need in return for vouchers to spend in-store.Business,"The secondhand areas in Ikea stores will be called Circular Hubs Ikea has launched its long-awaited furniture buy-back and re-sale scheme, in an attempt to reduce the number of products going to landfill. The move is part of the retail giant's sustainability drive to become ""climate positive"" by 2030. Customers will get vouchers to spend in-store if items they no longer need are returned in good condition. Ikea admitted the scheme was a learning curve, but decided to launch it after successful trials in several cities. ""I'm not saying we have all the answers, but we learned enough from the pilots to tell us that this could be something of real value to us and our customers,"" Hege Saebjornsen, an environmental and sustainability expert at Ikea, told the BBC. The initiative, originally scheduled to launch in November but postponed because of the pandemic, is now available in Ikea stores across the UK. It is also being launched in the other 26 countries in which Ikea operates. Used products returned in as-new condition with no scratches will be bought for 50% of the original price, while items with minor scratches will be bought for 40%. Furniture that is well used with several scratches will be bought for 30%. The items will be sold in separate areas of the stores, although Ikea has also announced a new partnership with Gumtree to sell second-hand products via the online marketplace. Sustainability key to long-term corporate health Ikea France on trial for snooping on staff Ikea to start selling spare parts for products Products eligible for buy-back include dressers, cabinets, bookcases and shelf units, small tables, dining tables and desks. The Swedish company has already announced it wants to become fully ""circular"" - eliminate waste through the continual use of materials - by 2030. Ingka Group, Ikea's parent company, recently announced it was investing â¬4bn in renewable energy. Customers wanting to sell back furniture go to Ikea.co.uk to fill out an online form, which generates a preliminary offer, and then take items to a store. Ikea is trialling Pre-Loved Labels, giving customers information about an item's past. Ms Saebjornsen, a former sustainability manager at the retailer and now an Ikea adviser on the forthcoming COP26 climate summit, said that exactly what the consumer uptake will be is unknown. But she said the trials, including in Sydney, Lisbon, Edinburgh and Glasgow, ""were really successful. It taught us a lot about the appetite for this and how people behave"". The second-hand market generally - from clothing to homeware - is growing rapidly as shopping habits change, and Ikea hopes to tap into this, she said. One potential drawback was that furniture must be delivered fully-assembled, a possible impediment for people who have heavy and bulky items. ""We still found people are taking us up on it [the scheme],"" she said. Ikea is working on how to improve the disassembly of products. ""Some are better than others. Products can get damaged when taken apart, so we can only really accept assembled products. It maintains the security and quality of the item,"" she said. Although Ikea is offering vouchers, not cash, the scheme is not being introduced as a profit driver for the retailer, she said. Still, doesn't it reinforce a buy-new, disposable culture? ""We've taken all of that into account,"" Ms Saebjornsen said. ""It's really important to highlight that the voucher has no use-by date. They can be used to buy another second hand item, or food. ""The real consideration here is that it's about how we make sustainable and healthy living easy, accessible and affordable, and really mainstream. ""Ikea is such a large company with massive potential to reach millions of customers. ""We are not saying that we have all the answers. But small actions can make a difference."" The buy-back service is available in full-sized Ikea stores nationwide, excluding order and collection points in Tottenham Court Road, Norwich and Aberdeen. The service will launch in Reading and Belfast on 17 May.

Four arrested for kidnap of ex-Australia cricketer,"Stuart MacGill (seen here in 2017) was released about an hour into the ordeal Former Australian star cricketer Stuart MacGill was abducted and released in an alleged kidnapping in Sydney last month, police say. Four people have been arrested in connection with the incident which took place on 14 April. Police said MacGill knew one of the men and the plot had been financially motivated. He sustained minor injuries in the incident but didn't require medical care, police said. MacGill, 50, was a Test spinner for the national team between 1998 and 2008. At one point, he was ranked the world's second-best bowler behind his team-mate Shane Warne. New South Wales Police said the arrests, which took place after raids were conducted across Sydney on Wednesday, were the result of a two-week long investigation. Police allege MacGill had been approached and confronted in the Sydney suburb of Cremorne one evening by a 46-year-old man he knew. Two other men then appeared and the group forced the ex-cricketer into a car. He was driven to a remote site in Bringelly, on the city's outskirts, where he was allegedly assaulted and threatened at gunpoint by the ""criminal gang"", police said. After about an hour, he was driven to the south-west suburb of Belmore and released, police said. Authorities said no money was handed over or obtained in the course of the attack, but the kidnapping attempt had been financially motivated. Police said MacGill reported the crime to authorities one week after it occurred, and that he had been worried about his and his family's safety. ""To be standing on a street, to be dragged into a car, driven a remote location, physically assaulted, threatened with a firearm, held for a period of time and then dumped, I think you would be pretty worried,"" said detective Anthony Holton. ""I know it is only an hour that he was held, but it would have been a horribly frightful hour to endure through,"" he added. He said MacGill's ordeal was ""not involved in any back story that leads to him having a personal debt to other people,"" and that he was solely being treated as a ""victim of a targeted kidnapping"". Police said the arrested group members - aged 27, 29, 42 and 46 - would be charged later on Wednesday. Australian media reported MacGill, who retired from cricket in 2008, works as the general manager of a restaurant in Sydney's northern suburbs. MacGill is yet to provide public comment on the incident.

Covid-variant vaccines being fast-tracked,"Extra funding to fast-track new vaccines will help ""future-proof"" the UK against new coronavirus variants, the vaccines minister has said. Existing vaccines protect against variants such as the one found in Kent, but experts say the UK needs to be prepared as the virus keeps mutating. Nadhim Zahawi said the Â£29.3m funding increase would boost testing facilities at Porton Down research laboratory. Separately, he said booster jabs would be ready to deploy from September. Asked about reports inthe Times,externalthat third jabs would be given to over-50s and those with underlying health conditions in the autumn, the vaccines minister said no decision had been made yet. Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast the booster programme could begin in September ""or later in the year, or early next year"". He said clinicians would consider how well the protection from vaccines had lasted when deciding when to begin rolling out the programme. Clinical trials will also be looking at the evidence on mixing different vaccines to see what will offer the most protection. Coronavirus variants: What you need to know about how Covid is changing What is the India Covid variant and will vaccines work? The vaccines minister also confirmed there would be an update from the Transport Secretary Grant Shapps later this week about England restarting international travel. Meanwhile, the government said its extra funding - on top of Â£19.7m already promised - would also aid vaccine manufacture and allow scientists to accelerate the pace and scale of their work. The cash will allow scientists to test 3,000 blood samples a week, up from 700 at the moment, to measure the levels of protective antibodies against Covid-19 generated by different vaccines. Whether or not at-risk adults are offered a booster dose this autumn will depend on two key factors: whether immunity from the first two doses has waned so older adults are vulnerable to an autumn wave of infection; and whether a variant emerges which means the current vaccines can't prevent serious Covid disease. Until we know the answers, it would be wrong to assume a third booster dose is on the cards. But of course it is being planned for. All vaccine manufacturers are working on tweaked vaccines, which will aim to deal with so-called escape variants. And a key UK trial - which will offer people a third dose of a different vaccine to the one they initially received - is not yet under way. In January 2020, scientists across the world began work on vaccines against the novel coronavirus, long before the disease it caused even had a name. Had they waited until it was clear a vaccine was needed, the delay would have cost tens of millions of lives. The government is already making plans for a booster Covid-vaccine programme in the autumn, to protect the most vulnerable ahead of winter. Last week itordered an extra 60 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine,which it said would be used alongside other vaccines for the boosters. And it may use new, updated vaccines that are a better match for emerging variants. But the World Health Organization's special envoy on Covid, David Nabarro, said the global vaccine rollout should be prioritised over booster jabs in the UK. Speaking to Radio 4's the World At One, he said: ""What you do with a scarce preventive action like a vaccine is that you give it to the people who need it the most. You have to look at the issue as a world issue. ""Top ups and other extra things and extra protection for people in the wealthy countries that should come a bit later,"" he said. Following the funding announcement, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""We are committed to supporting the UK's flourishing life-sciences industry - and this announcement is yet another critical way we will build back better to protect the country over the coming months and years."" UK Health Security Agency chief executive Dr Jenny Harries said: ""A new variant that can escape the current vaccines is the greatest risk of a third wave. ""This new investment will help us stay one step ahead of the virus by doubling our capacity to test vaccine effectiveness against emerging variants. ""While we expect the existing vaccines to offer protection against new variants, particularly preventing serious illness and death, it is important that we continue to monitor the picture as it develops."" The government has already announced a deal with biopharmaceutical company CureVac to develop vaccines against future variants, with 50 million doses pre-ordered. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains Prof Neil Ferguson, an expert on the spread of infectious diseases who sits on the government's New and Emerging Respiratory Virus Threats Advisory Group (Nervtag), saidnew variants emerging posed the biggest risk to the UK's progress in the pandemic. ""In the worst case scenario, if we have a new variant pop up which does manage to evade the vaccines, say late summer or early autumn, there may be a need to roll back on some of these measures (being eased) at least temporarily until we can boost people's immunity,"" he told the BBC. ""Do I think it's likely to happen? No, I don't. I think we are much more likely to be on a steady course now out of this pandemic, at least in this country."" Prof Ferguson said variants would need to be monitored ""carefully"", but the UK had gone from a ""terrible situation"" in January to a ""remarkably good situation now"". Covid restrictions are expected to be further eased on 17 May in England, Scotland and Wales, subject to government approval. In Northern Ireland, more restrictions may be lifted on 24 May.
