Meghan and Harry's TV interview to air in US,"The chat show host, who attended the couple's wedding in 2018, has said there will be ""nothing off limits"" The Duke and Duchess of Sussex's highly-anticipated TV interview with Oprah Winfrey is set to air in the US. It marks the first sit-down interview with the couple since they quit their roles as senior working royals in 2020. They are expected to discuss their new life in the US and their experiences in the UK. Hours before the programme, the Queen stressed the importance of ""closeness and community"" in her Commonwealth Day message - broadcast on BBC One. She did not comment on the upcoming interview, focusing instead on the global impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Senior royals including the Prince of Wales and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge also joined forces to appear in the special programme on Sunday to celebrate Commonwealth Day. In a clip released earlier this week, Meghan told Oprah it was""really liberating""to now feel ""able to speak for yourself"". The interview with will air in the US on CBS on Sunday (01:00 GMT, Monday) and in the UK on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday. It comes as Buckingham Palace is investigatingclaims the duchess bullied royal staff. The report about the allegations of bullying levelled at Meghan were first published in the Times after the interview with Oprah was recorded. Meghan has called it the ""latest attack on her character"". Profile: Duchess of Sussex Royal Family tree and line of succession Meghan accuses palace of 'perpetuating falsehoods' The duke and duchess announced they were stepping down as working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. Prince Harry recently said he had to step back from royal duties to protect himself and his family from the ""toxic"" situation created by the UK press, as it was ""destroying my mental health"". Deals have been struck in more than 17 countries across the world for the rights to screen Oprah's interview. The chat show host, who attended the couple's wedding in 2018 and is thought to live near them in California, has promised it will be ""shocking"" with ""nothing off limits"". Meghan will be interviewed about marriage, motherhood, life as a royal and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"", CBS has said. The couple will also discuss their move to the US and their future plans. Several clips have already been released by CBS and have racked up millions of views. In a clip shown on CBS's This Morning show earlier this week, Meghan was asked why she has decided to give an interview now. She said it was the result of ""so many things"", including that ""we're on the other side of a lot of life experience that's happened and also that we have the ability to make our own choices in a way that I couldn't have said yes to then"". In two earlier clips released by CBS, Meghan said Buckingham Palace could not expect her and Prince Harry to be silentif it was ""perpetuating falsehoods about us"", while Prince Harrydrew parallels between the treatment of his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, and Meghan. Why is Harry and Meghan's interview controversial? Who's in the UK Royal Family and how does it work? After these two clips were released, the Times published its report saying Meghan faced a complaint of bullying from her staff while she was a working royal at Kensington Palace. The palace said it was ""concerned"" about the accusations and an HR team would look at the circumstances outlined in the article. On the reported allegations of bullying, the duchess has said in a statement through her spokesman she was ""saddened"" by the ""attack on her character"". The timing of the broadcast has come during a tumultuous period for the Royal Family. While the interview was recorded before the Duke of Edinburgh, Harry's grandfather and the Queen's husband, went into hospital, it will air as the prince continues his recovery in hospitalfollowing a procedure for a heart condition. It also comes on the back of a more light-hearted interview Prince Harry gave to James Corden on The Late Late Show, which aired last week - again while Prince Philip was in hospital. In her Commonwealth day address, the Queen spoke about staying in touch with family and friends during ""testing times"", and how there had been a ""deeper appreciation"" of the need to connect to others during the Covid-19 crisis. ""The testing times experienced by so many have led to a deeper appreciation of the mutual support and spiritual sustenance we enjoy by being connected to others,"" she said. As footage was played of the Queen's numerous official video calls, the 94-year-old acknowledged, ""we have had to become more accustomed to connecting and communicating by our innovative technology"" to stay in touch with friends, family, colleagues, and others during the pandemic. She added: ""Increasingly, we have found ourselves able to enjoy such communication, as it offers an immediacy that transcends boundaries or division, helping any sense of distance to disappear."" ""We have all continued to appreciate the support, breadth of experiences and knowledge that working together brings. ""And I hope we shall maintain this renewed sense of closeness and community."" And she praised the ""selfless dedication to duty"" of medical staff and other key workers. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:Crouchy and the boys discuss a footballerâs entourage...

Celebrating Rangers fans urged to return home,"Crowds gathered in George Square to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership Police say arrests were made and fines issued after crowds of fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership. Large numbers of supporters made their way to Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square to mark the achievement despite warnings to stay at home. Nicola Sturgeon said the crowds were ""infuriating and disgraceful"" and could delay the end of the Covid lockdown. Rangerstook the title after Celtic failed to beat Dundee United. The result gave Rangers an unassailable 20-point lead and the title for the first time in 10 years. Under current guidance, public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. However, following Sunday's game, crowds of fans took to the streets, as some let off flares while others chanted and waved flags outside the club ground. In Glasgow city centre fans flocked to George Square to celebrate being crowned Scottish champions. In a tweet, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Rangers on the title win, but added: ""Gathering in crowds just now risks lives, and could delay exit from lockdown for everyone else."" ""If those gathering care at all about the safety of others & the country, they will go home,"" she said. In a later tweet she said: ""I share folks' anger at this."" She added it was ""infuriating and disgraceful"" to see the crowds ""risk our progress"" after everyone complying with lockdown rules has made ""so many sacrifices"". Allow Twitter content?

Ch Supt Mark Sutherland said officers attended gatherings at both George Square and outside Ibrox stadium. Arrests were made and fixed penalty notices issued for breaches of the Covid restrictions, disorder incidents and the use of pyrotechnic devices, he added. In a statement published shortly before 21:00, he urged fans to make their way home. The PA news agency reported that by 21:30 police officers had encircled a depleting group of fans at the base of the Scott Monument in George Square. Last Maythousands of Liverpool fans flouted social distancing guidelinesand gathered outside Anfield to celebrate the club's first Premier league title in 30 years. And in Novemberhundreds of Celtic supporters defied the level four restrictions and converged on Celtic Park to call for the removal of the club's then manager Neil Lennon. David Hamilton, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said he was ""appalled"" by the scenes. He also told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that officers, many of whom have not been vaccinated, were put in ""jeopardy"" by the supporters' actions. Mr Hamilton said he understood why people were frustrated by the Police Scotland response but said that was an operational matter for the force, which would have considered factors such as wider public order issues and road safety. He highlighted that it can take up to 20 minutes to issue a fixed penalty fine for breaches of the Covid restrictions. Mr Hamilton said: ""If we were to ticket everybody in George Square yesterday we would still be doing it just now."" But he also criticised the club for being ""silent"" and failing to address the mass gatherings on its social media accounts. He added: ""There is a responsibility to the club here. It should not take the government to have to ask the club to tell people to go home. ""That should have been something the club should have taken on themselves proactively."" The club tweeted or retweeted more than 50 times in the hours after they were crowned champions but did not address the mass gathering of fans. Social psychology expert Prof Stephen Reicher said the celebrations were ""completely predictable"" and ""in some ways encouraged"". The St Andrews University academic said it was ""disappointing that the club did not have a dialogue with the fans about how one can celebrate but in ways that are safe, in ways that don't endanger the public, that don't endanger and, indeed, don't endanger Scottish football"". He warned that it undermined the argument for safely reopening mass events including the Euros championship in Scotland. Glasgow Kelvin MSP Sandra White described the celebrations as ""absolute chaos"" and questioned what plans were in place to prevent mass gatherings. She told Good Morning Scotland: ""They [the fans] should never have been allowed to leave Ibrox and march into the city centre in large numbers. It could have been stopped there and then. ""People have lost loved ones and people can't visit loved ones and yet this is being facilitated."" Rangers fans in Northern Ireland also breached lockdown rules, with a large crowd gathering on Belfast's Shankill Road to celebrate on Sunday evening. Police Service Northern Ireland urged people to celebrate""at home safely and within the current health regulations"",external. Earlier on Sunday Scotland's justice secretary urged fans not to put lives at risk by flouting lockdown rules. Humza Yousaf also warned that Uefa would be paying ""close attention"" in anticipation of theEuropean Championships coming to Scotland. This video can not be played 'From 10 years of misery to this... bouncing' - Rangers fans celebrate at Ibrox Following their win, some Rangers players made their way to the fence to celebrate in sight of fans outside. Speaking onBBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called the actions of fans outside Ibrox ""completely wrong"". He added: ""We've all done so much to get the virus rates down. ""I understand passions run high with football fans, but it clearly didn't match what we expect people to do during a Covid period, while many people still can't even leave their homes.""

"Pay-rise protest organiser fined Â£10,000","A 65-year-old NHS worker attending the demonstration was briefly arrested The organiser of a protest against the government's controversial 1% pay rise plan for NHS staff in England has been fined Â£10,000 by police. About 40 people attended a rally in Manchester city centre at midday, officers said. Public gatherings are banned by coronavirus rules and police said most demonstrators dispersed after officers asked them to leave. A woman who works for the NHS, aged 61, was fined for organising the protest. Another NHS worker, aged 65, was arrested for failing to provide details after initially refusing to leave. She was de-arrested and fined Â£200 after complying, police said. The government's plan has been widely criticised Supt Caroline Hemingway said that ""regardless of one's sympathies for a protest's cause, we would ask the public to maintain social distancing and follow legislation"". ""We sought to engage with and peaceably disperse those attending this afternoon's protest, explaining that the gathering was in contravention of government lockdown rules,"" she added. ""Unfortunately officers were met with a degree of non-compliance and it was therefore necessary to enforce issue fixed penalty notices."" A protest was also held outside Downing Street on Sunday The government has faced a backlashafter giving evidence on Thursday to the NHS pay-review body, which looks at nearly 1.5 million people, including nurses and health assistants - but not doctors, dentists and some senior staff, who have their own pay bodies or agreements. It suggested a1% pay risefor 2021-22, citing the ""uncertain"" financial situation. However inflation forecasts for this year indicate the proposed figure could be a real-terms cut. The pay-review body will take evidence from other groups, including unions and NHS bodies, before making its recommendation around May.

"Longer school day, shorter summer being considered","This video can not be played Williamson: We intend for schools reopening to be 'irreversible' Longer school days and shorter holidays are among the measures the government is considering to help pupils in England catch up on lost learning, the education secretary has said. Gavin Williamson told the BBC ministers were looking at ""how the school year runs"" after the disruption of Covid. He also told Sky News a five-term year and changes to summer holidays were under consideration. Schools in England are reopening to all pupils on Monday. It marks thefirst step of the ""road map"" out of the national lockdown,which has been in place since the beginning of January and has seen most children learning from home since before Christmas. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether the government was going to extend the school day, Mr Williamson said: ""I think we should be evidence-based and we're looking at that, we're looking at how the school year runs."" Mr Williamson also told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that ministers were considering ""a whole range of proposals"". How will testing work in schools? Is school mask and testing policy flawed? How fresh air makes school safer The education secretary was asked whether schools would remain open if theR numberrose above one, which means the number of cases is continuing to increase. ""We are very much factoring in as part of the road map that actually schools will be staying open,"" Mr Williamson told the BBC. ""That is why we are taking a cautious approach because we intend for it to be an irreversible approach and that schools will continue to remain open."" He also gave a guarantee that schools would return after the Easter holidays. Secondary pupils in England are being asked to take regular Covid tests when schools reopen Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England, said she did not think the reopening of schools should be paused if the R number rose above one. With three weeks before the Easter holiday, she told the BBC there would be time to look at the data ""very carefully"". She said the relationship between the number of cases and the number of deaths and hospitalisations would also change in the next phase of the pandemic because of the impact of vaccinations. ""Then we will be able to accept some cases in the community without needing further restrictions,"" she added. Dr Hopkins said measures such as the testing of pupils to find asymptomatic cases would also help to keep R ""at the lowest level possible"". Attendance at school will be mandatory for all pupils when they reopen in England - meaning they should not miss lessons without a valid reason. However, pupils who are shielding have been asked to remain at home for a bit longer. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very hopeful"" the reopening of schools would go to plan. ""I think the risk is actually in not going back to school tomorrow, given all the suffering, all the loss of learning we have seen,"" he added. It is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers areat no higher risk of infection than other working-age people. But what role schools will play in the wider spread of the virus remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. Government advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. But this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggestedreopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one,external, which would lead to a growing epidemic. Ministers have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. Only such high infection rates that risk a surge in hospitalisations that threatens the NHS is seen as a problem. Secondary schools have been told that year groups can return on different days over the first week to allow for Covid testing. Secondary pupils will be tested three times in the first two weeks of school and will then be given two tests each week to use at home. These will be lateral flow tests, which involve taking a swab of the nose and throat and give a result within 30 minutes. All primary and secondary school staff are also being offered twice-weekly rapid tests, and parents and carers can also get a twice-weekly test. However, concerns have been raised that false positive results could mean pupils and their families being forced to self-isolate unnecessarily. Tests done at home require a confirmatory PCR test - which are more accurate - but Dr Hopkins said those taken at school would not because they are done in a ""specialised environment and individuals are trained to deliver it"". She added that evidence from lateral flow tests taken over the last eight weeks in real-life scenarios suggested the false positive rate was ""extremely low"" - less than one in 1,000. Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) has warned that secondary schools have struggled to get parental consent for testing of pupils, and said there needed to be a bigger ministerial push to encourage take-up. Mr Williamson said the rollout of testing in schools over the last few weeks suggested they had the ""highest take-up of any employment setting around the country"". The NEU has called for a phased return to schools in England - similar to the process in Scotland and Wales, where whole year groups are returning separated by several weeks. The union also accused the government of failing to put adequate safety measures in place ahead of schools reopening. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said schools should reopen but safety measures including adequate ventilation should have been put in place. He added that it was also ""disappointing"" that teachers had not been prioritised for the coronavirus vaccine LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? As well as undergoing testing, secondary school and college students are also being asked to wear face coverings in classrooms, where social distancing cannot be maintained, with the measure to be reviewed at Easter. But this is not mandatory, and in primary schools pupils are not being required to wear face coverings when they return to face-to-face lessons. Nor will they be tested. Mr Williamson said he hoped mask-wearing would be a ""temporary measure"". Meanwhile, a survey has shown that the majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school. But two-thirdsare concerned about the amount of learning lost,with some parents worried their child will never catch up. The Department for Educationhas announced a Â£700m package to help pupils catch up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools. There are different rules on schools across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions. The youngest pupils have already returned to school inScotlandandWales, while some primary school pupils inNorthern Irelandalso return to school on Monday.

UK must prepare for 'hard winter' of flu - expert,"This video can not be played Dr Hopkins: important we're prepared for 'hard winter' The UK must prepare for a ""hard winter"" because the population immunity to respiratory viruses other than Covid could be lower than usual, one of England's top medics has warned. Dr Susan Hopkins said the NHS must be ""ready"" for surges in flu and other similar illnesses. It comes ahead of England's first step towards easing lockdown, with all pupils returning to school on Monday. Most pupils have been learning from home since Christmas. Dr Hopkins, who is in charge of Public Health England's Covid strategy, said the UK needed to be ""better prepared"" than it was last autumn, when new, faster-spreading variants of the virus emerged. These drove infection rates up and forced further lockdown measures over the winter. Dr Hopkins told the BBC'sThe Andrew Marr Show: ""I think we have to prepare for a hard winter, not only with coronavirus, but we've had a year of almost no respiratory viruses of any other type. And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less. ""So we could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens."" Dr Hopkins said her role as a government advisor was to ""prepare for worst-case scenarios"". ""It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,"" she said. Why goal is to live with Covid, not fight it Hancock: We could live with Covid 'like we do flu' How will lockdown begin to be lifted? During last year's winter, some 30 million people - more than ever before - were invited to get a free flu jab asministers feared the dual threat it posed alongside coronavirus. Flu can be a serious condition - it kills around 11,000 people in England each year and many more people receive hospital treatment for it. People at high risk from flu are also most at risk from Covid-19. Flu poses additional threats during the Covid pandemic because: There issome evidencea double infection with coronavirus and flu is more deadly than either alone A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals Responding to an influx of patients will be harder if lots of NHS or care-home staff also get sick with flu Prime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap out of national lockdown aims for all coronavirus restrictions to be lifted by 21 June at the earliest. But top scientists and medics have warned that restrictions to curb Covid infections could continue into next winter. Mask-wearing and working from home could be among ""baseline"" measures expected to continue until then, the government's chief scientific adviserSir Patrick Vallance has said.

Minister accuses EU of 'ill will' over Brexit deal,"The UK's lead Brexit minister has called on the EU to ""shake off any remaining ill will"" over the UK's decision to leave the organisation. Lord Frost said the EU's previous threat to block vaccine exports had ""significantly undermined"" post-Brexit measures in Northern Ireland. He insisted the UK's unilateral move to extend grace periods on border checks was legal under the Brexit trade deal. The EU disputes this, and is preparing to launch a legal challenge. The UK has said it will delay new checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, agreed as part of the UK's withdrawal deal. EU Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has called it a ""violation"" of the part of the deal relating to Northern Ireland and said legal action was imminent. EU legal action imminent over UK extensions EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI Lord Frost to join cabinet in Brexit role Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Lord Frost insisted the delayed border checks was a ""temporary"" measure justified to implement the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol. The Cabinet Office minister added that the measures were justified by the ""fragile"" situation in Northern Ireland. New checks under the UK's Brexit deal have led to disruption at Northern Irish ports ""They are about protecting the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland, making sure they can receive parcels and buy the usual groceries from the supermarket. ""Without this threat of disruption, we can continue our discussions with the EU to resolve difficulties arising from the Protocol constructively,"" he added. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods, so products arriving from Great Britain have to undergo EU import procedures. Both sides agreed the arrangement as part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, to avoid the need for border checks between NI and the Republic of Ireland. But it has led to disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, increasing tensions with the EU. Earlier this week, the UK extended a grace period on new checks on food products from the end of March to October, without the prior agreement of the EU. It then delayed the introduction of similar checks on parcels, which had been due to come in on 1 April, until the same month. The logistics industry had said it was not ready to deal with that volume of new administration. The grace periods mean procedures will not yet be fully applied. Lord Frost, who negotiated the UK's Brexit trade deal with the EU, said he wanted to work with the EU towards ""common goals"" after the UK formally cut legal ties at the end of the Brexit transition earlier this year. ""I hope they will shake off any remaining ill will towards us for leaving, and instead build a friendly relationship, between sovereign equals,"" he added. But Labour has said the UK's actions risk ""plunging Northern Ireland into further instability"". The party's shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh said it could mark out the region as ""the arena for wider UK-EU conflict for years to come"". And Lord Frost has been accused by a former senior civil servant of ""burning trust"" with the EU by ""playing hard ball"" over the protocol. Philip Rycroft, who led the Department for Exiting the EU between 2017 and 2019, told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour while there were issues around the protocol it was the ""least-worst option"" and had to be made to work. ""Traders simply aren't ready to do the things that are required on the protocol, not least because the government spent the best part of last year saying to them they wouldn't have to do anything, despite knowing full well that all of these checks would have to come in,"" he said. ""Extending those grace periods is not an unreasonable thing to ask for,"" he added. ""But the way that David Frost has gone about this, to tell the Commission he was unilaterally extending without doing his opposite number in the Commission the courtesy of picking up the phone, suggests that they're still playing games around Brexit. ""It is so important to the peace process in Northern Ireland that this protocol is able to work and that's going to require a huge amount of goodwill and trust on both sides.""

Tories push for Swinney 'no confidence' vote,"This video can not be played Douglas Ross said key gaps in the evidence to the Holyrood inquiry still needed to be filled The Scottish Conservatives say they will push for a vote of no confidence in John Swinney ""on Tuesday or Wednesday"". Leader Douglas Ross said he also wanted to see a similar vote against Nicola Sturgeon unless further legal advice in the Alex Salmond case was released. The Scottish government published legal advice related to its court battle with Mr Salmond last week. Mr Swinney had previously argued such advice should remain confidential. But the deputy first minister then said he had taken the ""exceptional step"" to rebut ""false allegations"" made about the Scottish government's legal advice over the judicial review brought by Mr Salmond. The move came after all opposition parties indicated they would back a motion of no confidence in Mr Swinney last week if he did not comply, with the SNP government facing defeat. But Mr Ross said that threat had only resulted in a ""partial"" release of ""vital evidence"", adding that the deputy first minister's position had now become ""untenable"". Lawyers had 'reservations' about Salmond case Swinney agrees to publish Salmond row legal advice What is the Sturgeon and Salmond row all about? The Scottish Conservatives said they planned to hold a vote of no confidence in Mr Swinney on Tuesday or Wednesday, with a similar vote in Ms Sturgeon ""shortly afterwards"". Holyrood's other opposition parties could back the move if further documents are not released, they said. John Swinney had previously argued the government's legal advice should remain confidential A spokesperson for the Scottish government said all formal written advice from external counsel during the judicial review had now been disclosed. But speaking on BBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Mr Ross said the Holyrood inquiry still needed to fill in the gaps in what happened at key meetings about the case involving the Scottish government. ""The [no confidence] vote is not off the table because after an eight-hour evidence session - where the first minister said she'd answered all the questions which clearly she hadn't - the Scottish government issued more evidence that we'd been calling for. ""Why was that evidence not made available before the first minister came in front of the committee?"" Nicola Sturgeon appeared in front of MSPs on the committee last week Mr Ross said there was still a ""blank"" to fill regarding a meeting between the first minister and her permanent secretary on the case.

A spokesman added: ""We have now disclosed all of the formal written advice notes received from external counsel during the judicial review, as well as a number of other relevant previously legally privileged documents.

"Pay-rise protest organiser fined Â£10,000Forty people protested against the controversial plan in Manchester and an NHS worker was arrested.Manchester","A 65-year-old NHS worker attending the demonstration was briefly arrested The organiser of a protest against the government's controversial 1% pay rise plan for NHS staff in England has been fined Â£10,000 by police. About 40 people attended a rally in Manchester city centre at midday, officers said. Public gatherings are banned by coronavirus rules and police said most demonstrators dispersed after officers asked them to leave. A woman who works for the NHS, aged 61, was fined for organising the protest. Another NHS worker, aged 65, was arrested for failing to provide details after initially refusing to leave. She was de-arrested and fined Â£200 after complying, police said. The government's plan has been widely criticised Supt Caroline Hemingway said that ""regardless of one's sympathies for a protest's cause, we would ask the public to maintain social distancing and follow legislation"". ""We sought to engage with and peaceably disperse those attending this afternoon's protest, explaining that the gathering was in contravention of government lockdown rules,"" she added. ""Unfortunately officers were met with a degree of non-compliance and it was therefore necessary to enforce issue fixed penalty notices."" A protest was also held outside Downing Street on Sunday The government has faced a backlashafter giving evidence on Thursday to the NHS pay-review body, which looks at nearly 1.5 million people, including nurses and health assistants - but not doctors, dentists and some senior staff, who have their own pay bodies or agreements. It suggested a1% pay risefor 2021-22, citing the ""uncertain"" financial situation. However inflation forecasts for this year indicate the proposed figure could be a real-terms cut. The pay-review body will take evidence from other groups, including unions and NHS bodies, before making its recommendation around May.

Rangers fans descend on Ibrox after title win,"Crowds gathered in George Square to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership Police say arrests were made and fines issued after crowds of fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership. Large numbers of supporters made their way to Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square to mark the achievement despite warnings to stay at home. Nicola Sturgeon said the crowds were ""infuriating and disgraceful"" and could delay the end of the Covid lockdown. Rangerstook the title after Celtic failed to beat Dundee United. The result gave Rangers an unassailable 20-point lead and the title for the first time in 10 years. Under current guidance, public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. However, following Sunday's game, crowds of fans took to the streets, as some let off flares while others chanted and waved flags outside the club ground. In Glasgow city centre fans flocked to George Square to celebrate being crowned Scottish champions. In a tweet, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Rangers on the title win, but added: ""Gathering in crowds just now risks lives, and could delay exit from lockdown for everyone else."" ""If those gathering care at all about the safety of others & the country, they will go home,"" she said. In a later tweet she said: ""I share folks' anger at this."" She added it was ""infuriating and disgraceful"" to see the crowds ""risk our progress"" after everyone complying with lockdown rules has made ""so many sacrifices"". Allow Twitter content?

Ch Supt Mark Sutherland said officers attended gatherings at both George Square and outside Ibrox stadium. Arrests were made and fixed penalty notices issued for breaches of the Covid restrictions, disorder incidents and the use of pyrotechnic devices, he added. In a statement published shortly before 21:00, he urged fans to make their way home. The PA news agency reported that by 21:30 police officers had encircled a depleting group of fans at the base of the Scott Monument in George Square. Last Maythousands of Liverpool fans flouted social distancing guidelinesand gathered outside Anfield to celebrate the club's first Premier league title in 30 years. And in Novemberhundreds of Celtic supporters defied the level four restrictions and converged on Celtic Park to call for the removal of the club's then manager Neil Lennon. David Hamilton, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said he was ""appalled"" by the scenes. He also told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that officers, many of whom have not been vaccinated, were put in ""jeopardy"" by the supporters' actions. Mr Hamilton said he understood why people were frustrated by the Police Scotland response but said that was an operational matter for the force, which would have considered factors such as wider public order issues and road safety. He highlighted that it can take up to 20 minutes to issue a fixed penalty fine for breaches of the Covid restrictions. Mr Hamilton said: ""If we were to ticket everybody in George Square yesterday we would still be doing it just now."" But he also criticised the club for being ""silent"" and failing to address the mass gatherings on its social media accounts. He added: ""There is a responsibility to the club here. It should not take the government to have to ask the club to tell people to go home. ""That should have been something the club should have taken on themselves proactively."" The club tweeted or retweeted more than 50 times in the hours after they were crowned champions but did not address the mass gathering of fans. Social psychology expert Prof Stephen Reicher said the celebrations were ""completely predictable"" and ""in some ways encouraged"". The St Andrews University academic said it was ""disappointing that the club did not have a dialogue with the fans about how one can celebrate but in ways that are safe, in ways that don't endanger the public, that don't endanger and, indeed, don't endanger Scottish football"". He warned that it undermined the argument for safely reopening mass events including the Euros championship in Scotland. Glasgow Kelvin MSP Sandra White described the celebrations as ""absolute chaos"" and questioned what plans were in place to prevent mass gatherings. She told Good Morning Scotland: ""They [the fans] should never have been allowed to leave Ibrox and march into the city centre in large numbers. It could have been stopped there and then. ""People have lost loved ones and people can't visit loved ones and yet this is being facilitated."" Rangers fans in Northern Ireland also breached lockdown rules, with a large crowd gathering on Belfast's Shankill Road to celebrate on Sunday evening. Police Service Northern Ireland urged people to celebrate""at home safely and within the current health regulations"",external. Earlier on Sunday Scotland's justice secretary urged fans not to put lives at risk by flouting lockdown rules. Humza Yousaf also warned that Uefa would be paying ""close attention"" in anticipation of theEuropean Championships coming to Scotland. This video can not be played 'From 10 years of misery to this... bouncing' - Rangers fans celebrate at Ibrox Following their win, some Rangers players made their way to the fence to celebrate in sight of fans outside. Speaking onBBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called the actions of fans outside Ibrox ""completely wrong"". He added: ""We've all done so much to get the virus rates down. ""I understand passions run high with football fans, but it clearly didn't match what we expect people to do during a Covid period, while many people still can't even leave their homes.""

LiveLiveSchools reopening 'intended to be irreversible'14 minutes ago,"UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson tells the BBC's Andrew Marr the reopening of schools in England on Monday is intended to be irreversible He says longer school days and shorter holidays could be among measures to help pupils in England catch up on lost learning Two-thirds of parents are worried about lost learning, but most are happy to see their children go back to the classroom, a survey suggests Boris Johnson says schools are ready to reopen, calling it a ""big step"" on the roadmap to ending lockdown Of a proposed 1% pay rise for nurses in England, he says the government has tried to give them ""as much as we possibly can"" Meanwhile, nurses are calling for updated guidance on protective equipment, arguing current recommendations are out of date People aged 56 to 59 are being invited to make vaccination appointments this week in England as the rollout continues The US Senate has approved a $1.9tn Covid relief package, including payments of $1,400 (Â£1,012) for most Americans Edited by Marie Jackson That's all from us this evening but we'll be back again on Monday morning with all the very latest developments and updates. Today's coverage was the work of Joseph Lee, Adrian Dalingwater, Julian Joyce and Marie Jackson. As we near the end of today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and elsewhere, here's a summary of some of today's main events: Calls for the fans of Glasgow football club Rangers to stay at home and not gather to celebrate their team clinching the Scottish Premiership title for the first time in 10 years appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Hundreds of supporters descended on the team's home ground, Ibrox Stadium, and the city's George Square to celebrate. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged the fans to delay their celebrations and go home. Rangers won the title after Glasgow rivalsCeltic failed to beat Dundee United. Under current guidance, public gatherings in Scotland are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. You can read more on this storyhere. On a lighter note, residents of an English village have been receiving anonymous gifts of good-luck charms in the dead of night. Locals in Water Orton, Warwickshire, think someone on every street in the village has received a package from the unknown sender. An accompanying poem describes the sender's intention to ""brighten up your day"" in times which ""are hard to bear and often can be sad"". Local man Graham Smallburn said the gifts were delivering a ""feel-good factor"" during lockdown. ""They lift your spirit a bit,"" he added. You can read more about the mystery gift-giverhere.  The total number of coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Sunday is not yet available due to issues processing the data for England. The government's coronavirus dashboard is currently displaying the number of deaths as zero, which is not accurate. A little earlier, we put up a post with the zero figure, but have now taken that down. Sorry for any confusion. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson expressed his gratitude for the work of NHS staff - but said he was giving the health service as much as he could. This was not, however, the last word on pay. An independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff,  it could say that pay should rise above 1%. The government would then have a dilemma -  either to ignore this,  or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase. But the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition. While the shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned  a  1% rise  as ""a  disgrace"", he said Labour would ""honour whatever that review body recommends"". But during the years of austerity, it wasnât uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government. So if it were to back a  1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its  position or face a backlash from the unions. Government data shows there were 5,177 new coronavirus cases in the UK reported on Sunday, down from 6,040 on Saturday. According to data up to 6 March, 23,335,514 jabs have been given in the UK so far. Of those, 22,213,112 were first doses - a rise of 416,834 on the previous day. Some 1,122,402 were second doses, an increase of 31,562. Demonstrators shouted ""freedom"" as they protested the lockdown in Prague A few hundred demonstrators shouting ""freedom"" and carrying signs reading ""we don't want benefits, we want to work"" marched through Prague to oppose the Czech Republic's lockdown. Police used coronavirus regulations to turn away people who live outside the capital city because, while a right to protest is still guaranteed under the country's constitution, people are banned from travelling outside their local area. Riot police confronted the crowd of anti-lockdown protesters Several buses of demonstrators from Moravia were turned around and sent home. Demonstrators later marched through the city centre and - while the protest began without unrest - photographs later showed several people being arrested and riot police confronting the crowds. A person in a plague doctor mask, who travelled by Metro, was among the crowd of demonstrators The metal sculptures were mistakenly taken away as rubbish They were intended as a tribute to NHS heroes as they worked to save lives in the pandemic. But a Somerset man's sculptures werethrown away after his local council mistook them for fly-tipped rubbish. Martin Feeney, a former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer, placed the metal silhouette of a nurse holding a heart and a key inscribed with the words ""thank you"" on a roundabout in Radstock - with permission. But the message didn't get through to one team of council workers who cleared them away with the rubbish. The council said that while clearing fly-tipped items from the roundabout, workers ""took the sculptures away too in error"". But one worker salvaged the artworks and kept them at home until they could be restored to their rightful place. About 30,000 jobs are expected to be created by the Commonwealth Games Hosting the Commonwealth Games next year should bea ""catalyst"" for Birmingham's recovery from the pandemic, the chief executive of the games has said. Ian Reid said the Games would provide up to 30,000 jobs as well as volunteer roles. The West Midlands has been hard hit when it comes to unemployment, with anestimated 100,000 jobs lost since the start of the pandemic. Plans for a Â£500m athletes' villagewere abandoned last year due to delays in constructioncaused by Covid-19. Instead, athletes will be housed in student accommodation and at the National Exhibition Centre. But Reid said the estimated Â£800m cost of the games would be a ""real opportunity for the region"".  Scotland has recorded its second lowest number of infections this year, with 390 new confirmed cases. On Monday, 386 cases were reported, the lowest total since November. The nation has also reported zero deaths, although days without any reported deaths have been relatively common at the weekends. It means the total number of deaths by the daily reported measure still stands at 7,421. Meanwhile, NHS England said 90 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. In Wales, 18 more deaths were reported and 152 new confirmed cases - bringing the average infection rate over seven days to its lowest point since 18 September. A further three people have died in Northern Ireland, while 138 people have tested positive in the last 24 hours. UK-wide figures are due to be published at about 16:00 GMT, but they may not match the totals of the four nations as they use different reporting periods. Earlier the prime minister visited  a vaccination centre in north London where he was asked if he stood behind his decision to offer a 1% pay rise to NHS workers. You can hear what he said here.  This video can not be played The PM insisted he was ""grateful"" for the work of NHS staff in the pandemic After months of home-schooling, children in England are returning to their classrooms on Monday. But it won't be lessons as usual, as they will face major changes to the normal school experience. A key difference will be the coronavirus testing regime. Want to know more about this?

I have so much respect for teachers,â she says. ""I've got no doubt that once he goes back to his friends and a proper teacher - because I am no teacher - he'll be loving it."" Antonio, whose wife is six months' pregnant, says he would be distraught if his son brought the virus home But Londoner Antonio says he's ""disappointed"" there isn't a more cautious, phased return - he and his 10-year-old son both have asthma and his wife is six months' pregnant. ""I'm not trying to live in fear,"" he says, but adds he would be ""distraught"" if his son brought the virus home. ""I don't think necessary precautions are being put in place to make me feel safe."" Read more from parents on the return to school here. Dr Susan Hopkins said her job is to prepare for worst-case scenarios The UK may facea ""hard winter"" for flu at the end of this year because population immunity to respiratory viruses will be lowafter months of social distancing, a Public Health England expert has said. Dr Susan Hopkins said the NHS will need to be ready for surges in flu or other illnesses. ""I think we have to prepare for a hard winter, not only with coronavirus, but we've had a year of almost no respiratory viruses of any other type. And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Hopkins, who leads PHE's Covid response, said her role as a government adviser was to ""prepare for worst-case scenarios"". ""It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,"" she said. Relaxed rules on outdoor drinking spaces are ""here to stay"" this summer, ministers say Pubs are expected to be able to convert areas such as car parks into beer gardens to make more space for drinkers when outdoor hospitality reopens this spring. UK Hospitality has already saidpubs have been deluged with bookings for beer gardensin anticipation of reopening on 12 April - the earliest date in the government's roadmap. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said rules introduced last June to make it easier to open up more outdoor space were ""here to stay"" for summer 2021. Outdoor socialising is believed to be considerably safer than meeting indoors during the pandemic. It means pubs, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to serve customers in car parks or terraces using their existing seating licenses, and there will be a cheaper, quicker route to obtain a pavement licence. The need for a planning application to put up outdoor marquees will also be removed. Ministers are considering far-reaching plans for schools to catch up on missed learning If you've just joined us, here's a look back at some of the main stories this lunchtime: Israel has led the world in terms of the speed and scale of its vaccination programme, and now the country has eased border controls and reopened more of its economy as it continues to re-emerge from a third coronavirus lockdown. From now on it will be much easier for Israelis to come home following the relaxing of what were very tight border controls. And amid growing confidence that the virus is being brought under control, bars, restaurants and cultural venues are being allowed to open their doors once again. But there will still be limits on the number of people allowed to enter these places, as well as social-distancing measures - and it will usually be necessary to show a pass that proves youâve been vaccinated. More than 3.7 million Israelis - about 40% of the population - have received the recommended two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly five million have received one shot. Israel has recorded 799,727 Covid infections and 5,856 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Child pyschologist Dr Sarah Mundy has been exploring how parents can help their children to adjust to the return to school. She told BBC News that first of all, parents needed to acknowledge their own feelings, ""because our feelings are contagious, and if we're very anxious about it then we're going to be passing that on to our children"". Next, Dr Mundy said, parents needed to ask: ""How can I show my child that I trust it's going to be ok, that I trust the school to look after them?"" She said there were three main ways to support your child:  The prime minister was also asked about England's nurses' proposed 1% pay rise, which, as we're been reporting, has not gone down well with unions, nor Labour. He told reporters at the vaccination centre: ""What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time."" He pointed out that the independent pay review body would look at the proposals, and come back. ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times,"" he added. ""We've tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can and that means, in addition to the Â£140bn of annual money, we've got another Â£62bn we've found to help support the NHS throughout the crisis,"" he said. ""My gratitude is overwhelming and I'm so grateful particularly to the nurses, and thankfully we are seeing more nurses now in our amazing NHS - there are 10,000 more nurses this year than there were last year.""

Rangers champions of Scotland after Celtic slip-up,"This video can not be played Watch: Goals from Rangers' Scottish Premiership title win Manager Steven Gerrard says ""there is more to come"" after Rangers were crowned champions of Scotland for the first time in 10 years. Gerrard's side, who beat St Mirren 3-0 on Saturday, have a 20-point lead with six games remaining and have denied Celtic a 10th title in a row. It is the former Liverpool and England captain's first trophy as a manager, in his third season at Ibrox. ""It is very difficult to put into words right now,""the Rangers boss said.,external ""I'm on a real, emotional high and it has been a journey that is not finished. 'Sweeter win than anyone could fathom' How Gerrard went from fanfare to glory Rangers clinch title - as it happened The seven games that won the title ""There is more to come and the next thing for me, when you win, it is always about what is next, and I am so proud of the players first and foremost - they are the most important people inside the club. ""But they are not as important as the supporters - they are what makes this club and it is for them and we have been down at times, really low at times, but this is an incredible high."" Ryan Jack leads the celebrations as the Rangers players celebrate at their training ground It is the earliest Scottish title win in chronological terms, and ends Celtic's bid for an unprecedented 10th successive crown. Rangers have dropped just eight points in an unbeaten Scottish Premiership campaign so far, with their victory on Saturday their 28th win in 32 matches. They have scored 77 goals and conceded just nine - only two of which have been at Ibrox. The Glasgow club were in the bottom tier of Scottish football as recently as 2012 after their financial collapse, and returned to the top flight five years ago. Rangers' first game as champions will be the third Old Firm game of the campaign at Celtic Park on March 21. BBC Scotland's chief sportswriter Tom English When Gerrard took control as manager he didn't just have a team to rebuild, he had an entire club to fix. Recruitment and scouting and attitude - he had to strip it down and start again. For a rookie boss in the white heat of Glasgow football up against the red hot Brendan Rodgers it was an Everestian challenge, but Gerrard put the building blocks in place, slowly - too slowly for many - but surely. He got backed by his board, bought wisely and grew. Gerrard has turned a 39-point deficit on Celtic in the season before he arrived into a 20-point advantage. A difference of 59 points. This is nirvana stuff to every Rangers fan. Former Rangers player & manager Graeme Souness:""Delighted for Steven Gerrard and all his team. Celtic have had a period of dominance, which has been, I'll say, uncomfortable for us Rangers supporters. They thoroughly deserve it. They've been fantastic all season and I just wish I was in Glasgow right now."" Former Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher:""They must have been terrified for years that record [nine straight titles] would have been beaten by Celtic. When Gerrard came in, that was the name of the game to stop Celtic achieving that. They've come a long way, but they'll be hoping the glory days are back."" Rangers captain James Tavernier:""There's no words that can describe it. I'm absolutely delighted for the club, the players, and especially the fans.

NHS 1% pay rise is 'as much as we can give' - PMBoris Johnson defends his pay rise proposals after a warning nurses may quit for feeling undervalued.UK,"This video can not be played Prime Minister defends NHS 1% pay rise recommendation Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a 1% pay rise, amid warnings that ""undervalued"" nurses could quit. The government is giving workers ""as much as we can"" in the ""tough times"" of the Covid pandemic, Mr Johnson said. The rise, which is being considered by an independent panel, would cover most hospital staff. Labour says the proposal goes against a government ""promise"" made last year to give NHS workers a 2.1% pay rise. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had been ""cowardly"" when he ""sneaked"" out the announcement a day after his Budget. The Department of Health and Social Care has been under pressure to reconsider its pay proposal since last week, when it officially recommended the 1% rise to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. Nurses have described the proposed pay rise as ""insulting"", with unions threatening strike action and warning that the ""pitiful"" rise may lead staff to quit their jobs - worsening staffing issues in the health service. 'Undervalued' nurses may quit over 1% rise - union Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise Ministers will make their final decision in May after the independent panel makes its own pay recommendations. Asked about the proposed pay rise on a visit to a coronavirus vaccination centre in Brent in north London, Mr Johnson said: ""What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time. ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times."" He added he was ""massively grateful"" to ""heroic"" health and social care workers during the pandemic. But the Royal College of Nursing reiterated its calls for the government to make a U-turn on the 1% offer. The union's general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, said: ""More of these warm words for nurses are not going to cut it."" The PM's comments are not the last word on pay. An independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff, it could say that pay should rise above 1%. The government would then have a dilemma - either to ignore the recommendation, or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase. But the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition. The shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned a 1% rise as ""a  disgrace"" but said Labour would ""honour whatever that review body recommends"". During the years of austerity, it wasn't uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government. So if the independent panel were to support a 1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its position, or face a backlash from the unions. Labour's Mr Jonathan Ashworth said Conservative MPs had already voted for a pay rise of 2.1% for NHS workers when a long-term spending plan for the health service passed through the House of Commons in January 2020. ""Not only was it promised, it was budgeted for and it was legislated for - this is the law of the land,"" he said. ""That should be the basis for which negotiations and discussions are now entered into with the trade unions."" The Department of Health maintains that the assumption of a 2.1% pay rise was not enshrined in law, and the financial pressures from the pandemic could not have been foreseen. The Royal College of Nursing has centred its response to the pay proposals on the idea the rise would mean Â£3.50 more per week in take-home pay for experienced nurses The prime minister said the government had ""tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can"" to tackle Covid, and had provided Â£62bn to the health service on top of its usual annual allocation of Â£140bn. Pressed by the BBC's Andrew Marr on whether there could be a rethink on the pay rise, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""What the government has put forward has been passed to an independent review. ""We've put forward what we believe we can afford and [it] is part of a process and that [is] what will be looked at,"" he added. ""But really, our focus is on making sure we recover from this pandemic."" The lowest minimum full-time salary - for newly-employed drivers, housekeeping assistants, nursery assistants and domestic support workers - is Â£18,005 per year The starting salary for most newly-qualified nurses is Â£24,907 Staff in ""high-cost areas"", such as London, get extra payments A government spokesperson has previously said a 1% pay rise would be a ""real-terms increase"", as the latest official inflation figurewas 0.9%,external. Dame Donna has warned the rise would mean just Â£3.50 more per week in take-home pay for an experienced nurse. At least 1.3 million other public sector staff - including teachers, the armed forces, firefighters and police officers -are about to have their pay frozen for a year.

The NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations. The Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will bedelayed until the summer,externalbecause of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an ""interim"" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement. NHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised aone-off Â£500 ""special recognition"" paymentin January, following a similar announcement in Scotland. The Welsh government has said it will not set a ""ceiling"" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:Crouchy and the boys discuss a footballerâs entourage...

"Minister accuses EU of 'ill will' over Brexit dealLord Frost says the EU has ""significantly undermined"" post-Brexit arrangements for Northern Ireland.UK Politics","The UK's lead Brexit minister has called on the EU to ""shake off any remaining ill will"" over the UK's decision to leave the organisation. Lord Frost said the EU's previous threat to block vaccine exports had ""significantly undermined"" post-Brexit measures in Northern Ireland. He insisted the UK's unilateral move to extend grace periods on border checks was legal under the Brexit trade deal. The EU disputes this, and is preparing to launch a legal challenge. The UK has said it will delay new checks on goods arriving into Northern Ireland from Great Britain, agreed as part of the UK's withdrawal deal. EU Commission Vice-President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has called it a ""violation"" of the part of the deal relating to Northern Ireland and said legal action was imminent. EU legal action imminent over UK extensions EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI Lord Frost to join cabinet in Brexit role Writing in the Sunday Telegraph,external, Lord Frost insisted the delayed border checks was a ""temporary"" measure justified to implement the so-called Northern Ireland Protocol. The Cabinet Office minister added that the measures were justified by the ""fragile"" situation in Northern Ireland. New checks under the UK's Brexit deal have led to disruption at Northern Irish ports ""They are about protecting the everyday lives of people in Northern Ireland, making sure they can receive parcels and buy the usual groceries from the supermarket. ""Without this threat of disruption, we can continue our discussions with the EU to resolve difficulties arising from the Protocol constructively,"" he added. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods, so products arriving from Great Britain have to undergo EU import procedures. Both sides agreed the arrangement as part of the Brexit withdrawal deal, to avoid the need for border checks between NI and the Republic of Ireland. But it has led to disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries from Great Britain to Northern Ireland, increasing tensions with the EU. Earlier this week, the UK extended a grace period on new checks on food products from the end of March to October, without the prior agreement of the EU. It then delayed the introduction of similar checks on parcels, which had been due to come in on 1 April, until the same month. The logistics industry had said it was not ready to deal with that volume of new administration. The grace periods mean procedures will not yet be fully applied. Lord Frost, who negotiated the UK's Brexit trade deal with the EU, said he wanted to work with the EU towards ""common goals"" after the UK formally cut legal ties at the end of the Brexit transition earlier this year. ""I hope they will shake off any remaining ill will towards us for leaving, and instead build a friendly relationship, between sovereign equals,"" he added. But Labour has said the UK's actions risk ""plunging Northern Ireland into further instability"". The party's shadow Northern Ireland secretary Louise Haigh said it could mark out the region as ""the arena for wider UK-EU conflict for years to come"". And Lord Frost has been accused by a former senior civil servant of ""burning trust"" with the EU by ""playing hard ball"" over the protocol. Philip Rycroft, who led the Department for Exiting the EU between 2017 and 2019, told BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour while there were issues around the protocol it was the ""least-worst option"" and had to be made to work. ""Traders simply aren't ready to do the things that are required on the protocol, not least because the government spent the best part of last year saying to them they wouldn't have to do anything, despite knowing full well that all of these checks would have to come in,"" he said. ""Extending those grace periods is not an unreasonable thing to ask for,"" he added. ""But the way that David Frost has gone about this, to tell the Commission he was unilaterally extending without doing his opposite number in the Commission the courtesy of picking up the phone, suggests that they're still playing games around Brexit. ""It is so important to the peace process in Northern Ireland that this protocol is able to work and that's going to require a huge amount of goodwill and trust on both sides.""

"Deliveroo to hand riders up to Â£10,000 in UK floatThe food delivery firm, set to be valued at $7bn (Â£5bn), will also offer shares to takeaway customers.","Deliveroo will reward its busiest riders with bonuses of up to Â£10,000 when the food delivery firm lists its shares on the London Stock Exchange. Riders who have delivered the most orders will share in a Â£16m fund, the company said. Deliveroo will also open the flotation to its customers who can buy up to Â£1,000 worth of shares in the firm. The company is expected to be valued at around $7bn (Â£5bn) when it floats but it is yet to make a profit. In its most recent financial results for the year to 31 December 2019, sales rose by 62% to Â£771.7m. However, pre-tax losses also grew from Â£243.3m to Â£317.7m. Demand for takeaway meals has soared during the coronavirus pandemic, after lockdown measures were first implemented a year ago and restaurants have been forced to close. ""A year of various lockdowns has fuelled demand for companies like Deliveroo,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. Deliveroo's chief executive, Will Shu, founded the business in 2013 Restrictions on hospitality businesses will start to ease on 12 April. But Mr Mould said: ""There is an expectation that habits formed during the pandemic will remain long into the recovery. Deliveroo, which was founded in 2013, confirmed that it will list its shares in London. As part of the flotation, riders in its 12 markets who have worked with the firm for at least a year will be paid a bonus of either Â£10,000, Â£1,000, Â£500 and Â£200 depending on the number of orders they have delivered. Deliveroo also said it would make Â£50m worth of shares available to customers who would be able to register their interest via the company's app. It said that if demand for shares was high, Deliveroo would prioritise existing ""loyal customers"". But it added that it would ""make sure a mixture of new and existing customers benefit"". Deliveroo founder and chief executive Will Shu, said: ""Far too often normal people are locked out of initial public offerings and the only participants are the institutional investors. ""I wanted to give as many customers as possible the chance to become shareholders.""

NHS 1% pay rise is 'as much as we can give' - PM,"This video can not be played Prime Minister defends NHS 1% pay rise recommendation Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended plans to give some NHS staff in England a 1% pay rise, amid warnings that ""undervalued"" nurses could quit. The government is giving workers ""as much as we can"" in the ""tough times"" of the Covid pandemic, Mr Johnson said. The rise, which is being considered by an independent panel, would cover most hospital staff. Labour says the proposal goes against a government ""promise"" made last year to give NHS workers a 2.1% pay rise. Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said Chancellor Rishi Sunak had been ""cowardly"" when he ""sneaked"" out the announcement a day after his Budget. The Department of Health and Social Care has been under pressure to reconsider its pay proposal since last week, when it officially recommended the 1% rise to the independent panel that advises the government on NHS salaries. Nurses have described the proposed pay rise as ""insulting"", with unions threatening strike action and warning that the ""pitiful"" rise may lead staff to quit their jobs - worsening staffing issues in the health service. 'Undervalued' nurses may quit over 1% rise - union Nurses prepare for strikes over 1% NHS pay rise Ministers will make their final decision in May after the independent panel makes its own pay recommendations. Asked about the proposed pay rise on a visit to a coronavirus vaccination centre in Brent in north London, Mr Johnson said: ""What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time. ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times."" He added he was ""massively grateful"" to ""heroic"" health and social care workers during the pandemic. But the Royal College of Nursing reiterated its calls for the government to make a U-turn on the 1% offer. The union's general secretary, Dame Donna Kinnair, said: ""More of these warm words for nurses are not going to cut it."" The PM's comments are not the last word on pay. An independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff, it could say that pay should rise above 1%. The government would then have a dilemma - either to ignore the recommendation, or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase. But the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition. The shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned a 1% rise as ""a  disgrace"" but said Labour would ""honour whatever that review body recommends"". During the years of austerity, it wasn't uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government. So if the independent panel were to support a 1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its position, or face a backlash from the unions. Labour's Mr Jonathan Ashworth said Conservative MPs had already voted for a pay rise of 2.1% for NHS workers when a long-term spending plan for the health service passed through the House of Commons in January 2020. ""Not only was it promised, it was budgeted for and it was legislated for - this is the law of the land,"" he said. ""That should be the basis for which negotiations and discussions are now entered into with the trade unions."" The Department of Health maintains that the assumption of a 2.1% pay rise was not enshrined in law, and the financial pressures from the pandemic could not have been foreseen. The Royal College of Nursing has centred its response to the pay proposals on the idea the rise would mean Â£3.50 more per week in take-home pay for experienced nurses The prime minister said the government had ""tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can"" to tackle Covid, and had provided Â£62bn to the health service on top of its usual annual allocation of Â£140bn. Pressed by the BBC's Andrew Marr on whether there could be a rethink on the pay rise, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said: ""What the government has put forward has been passed to an independent review. ""We've put forward what we believe we can afford and [it] is part of a process and that [is] what will be looked at,"" he added. ""But really, our focus is on making sure we recover from this pandemic."" The lowest minimum full-time salary - for newly-employed drivers, housekeeping assistants, nursery assistants and domestic support workers - is Â£18,005 per year The starting salary for most newly-qualified nurses is Â£24,907 Staff in ""high-cost areas"", such as London, get extra payments A government spokesperson has previously said a 1% pay rise would be a ""real-terms increase"", as the latest official inflation figurewas 0.9%,external. Dame Donna has warned the rise would mean just Â£3.50 more per week in take-home pay for an experienced nurse. At least 1.3 million other public sector staff - including teachers, the armed forces, firefighters and police officers -are about to have their pay frozen for a year. SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? The NHS in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is run by the devolved administrations. The Scottish government has announced that 2021-22 pay negotiations will bedelayed until the summer,externalbecause of the disruption caused by Covid. Staff have been given an ""interim"" pay rise of 1%, which will form part of the new settlement. NHS workers in Northern Ireland were promised aone-off Â£500 ""special recognition"" paymentin January, following a similar announcement in Scotland. The Welsh government has said it will not set a ""ceiling"" of 1% on NHS pay rises for 2021-22. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:Crouchy and the boys discuss a footballerâs entourage...

LiveLiveSchools reopening 'intended to be irreversible'4 minutes ago,"UK Education Secretary Gavin Williamson tells the BBC's Andrew Marr the reopening of schools in England on Monday is intended to be irreversible He says longer school days and shorter holidays could be among measures to help pupils in England catch up on lost learning Two-thirds of parents are worried about lost learning, but most are happy to see their children go back to the classroom, a survey suggests Boris Johnson says schools are ready to reopen, calling it a ""big step"" on the roadmap to ending lockdown Of a proposed 1% pay rise for nurses in England, he says the government has tried to give them ""as much as we possibly can"" Meanwhile, nurses are calling for updated guidance on protective equipment, arguing current recommendations are out of date People aged 56 to 59 are being invited to make vaccination appointments this week in England as the rollout continues The US Senate has approved a $1.9tn Covid relief package, including payments of $1,400 (Â£1,012) for most Americans Edited by Marie Jackson That's all from us this evening but we'll be back again on Monday morning with all the very latest developments and updates. Today's coverage was the work of Joseph Lee, Adrian Dalingwater, Julian Joyce and Marie Jackson. As we near the end of today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and elsewhere, here's a summary of some of today's main events: Calls for the fans of Glasgow football club Rangers to stay at home and not gather to celebrate their team clinching the Scottish Premiership title for the first time in 10 years appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Hundreds of supporters descended on the team's home ground, Ibrox Stadium, and the city's George Square to celebrate. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged the fans to delay their celebrations and go home. Rangers won the title after Glasgow rivalsCeltic failed to beat Dundee United. Under current guidance, public gatherings in Scotland are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. You can read more on this storyhere. On a lighter note, residents of an English village have been receiving anonymous gifts of good-luck charms in the dead of night. Locals in Water Orton, Warwickshire, think someone on every street in the village has received a package from the unknown sender. An accompanying poem describes the sender's intention to ""brighten up your day"" in times which ""are hard to bear and often can be sad"". Local man Graham Smallburn said the gifts were delivering a ""feel-good factor"" during lockdown. ""They lift your spirit a bit,"" he added. You can read more about the mystery gift-giverhere.  The total number of coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Sunday is not yet available due to issues processing the data for England. The government's coronavirus dashboard is currently displaying the number of deaths as zero, which is not accurate. A little earlier, we put up a post with the zero figure, but have now taken that down. Sorry for any confusion. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson expressed his gratitude for the work of NHS staff - but said he was giving the health service as much as he could. This was not, however, the last word on pay. An independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff,  it could say that pay should rise above 1%. The government would then have a dilemma -  either to ignore this,  or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase. But the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition. While the shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned  a  1% rise  as ""a  disgrace"", he said Labour would ""honour whatever that review body recommends"". But during the years of austerity, it wasnât uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government. So if it were to back a  1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its  position or face a backlash from the unions. Government data shows there were 5,177 new coronavirus cases in the UK reported on Sunday, down from 6,040 on Saturday. According to data up to 6 March, 23,335,514 jabs have been given in the UK so far. Of those, 22,213,112 were first doses - a rise of 416,834 on the previous day. Some 1,122,402 were second doses, an increase of 31,562. Demonstrators shouted ""freedom"" as they protested the lockdown in Prague A few hundred demonstrators shouting ""freedom"" and carrying signs reading ""we don't want benefits, we want to work"" marched through Prague to oppose the Czech Republic's lockdown. Police used coronavirus regulations to turn away people who live outside the capital city because, while a right to protest is still guaranteed under the country's constitution, people are banned from travelling outside their local area. Riot police confronted the crowd of anti-lockdown protesters Several buses of demonstrators from Moravia were turned around and sent home. Demonstrators later marched through the city centre and - while the protest began without unrest - photographs later showed several people being arrested and riot police confronting the crowds. A person in a plague doctor mask, who travelled by Metro, was among the crowd of demonstrators The metal sculptures were mistakenly taken away as rubbish They were intended as a tribute to NHS heroes as they worked to save lives in the pandemic. But a Somerset man's sculptures werethrown away after his local council mistook them for fly-tipped rubbish. Martin Feeney, a former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer, placed the metal silhouette of a nurse holding a heart and a key inscribed with the words ""thank you"" on a roundabout in Radstock - with permission. But the message didn't get through to one team of council workers who cleared them away with the rubbish. The council said that while clearing fly-tipped items from the roundabout, workers ""took the sculptures away too in error"". But one worker salvaged the artworks and kept them at home until they could be restored to their rightful place. About 30,000 jobs are expected to be created by the Commonwealth Games Hosting the Commonwealth Games next year should bea ""catalyst"" for Birmingham's recovery from the pandemic, the chief executive of the games has said. Ian Reid said the Games would provide up to 30,000 jobs as well as volunteer roles. The West Midlands has been hard hit when it comes to unemployment, with anestimated 100,000 jobs lost since the start of the pandemic. Plans for a Â£500m athletes' villagewere abandoned last year due to delays in constructioncaused by Covid-19. Instead, athletes will be housed in student accommodation and at the National Exhibition Centre. But Reid said the estimated Â£800m cost of the games would be a ""real opportunity for the region"".  Scotland has recorded its second lowest number of infections this year, with 390 new confirmed cases. On Monday, 386 cases were reported, the lowest total since November. The nation has also reported zero deaths, although days without any reported deaths have been relatively common at the weekends. It means the total number of deaths by the daily reported measure still stands at 7,421. Meanwhile, NHS England said 90 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. In Wales, 18 more deaths were reported and 152 new confirmed cases - bringing the average infection rate over seven days to its lowest point since 18 September. A further three people have died in Northern Ireland, while 138 people have tested positive in the last 24 hours. UK-wide figures are due to be published at about 16:00 GMT, but they may not match the totals of the four nations as they use different reporting periods. Earlier the prime minister visited  a vaccination centre in north London where he was asked if he stood behind his decision to offer a 1% pay rise to NHS workers. You can hear what he said here.  This video can not be played The PM insisted he was ""grateful"" for the work of NHS staff in the pandemic After months of home-schooling, children in England are returning to their classrooms on Monday. But it won't be lessons as usual, as they will face major changes to the normal school experience. A key difference will be the coronavirus testing regime. Want to know more about this? Here's ourexplainer. Stacie is looking forward to some peace when the stresses of home school are over Across England, families are packing pencil cases and polishing shoes ready for the return to school tomorrow. But how are they feeling about their kids getting back into the classroom? Stacie, from Devon, says she is ""excited"" for her nine-year-old son to return to school - and she's ready for five minutes' peace. ""It's been so hard - there's been tears and tantrums. I have so much respect for teachers,â she says. ""I've got no doubt that once he goes back to his friends and a proper teacher - because I am no teacher - he'll be loving it."" Antonio, whose wife is six months' pregnant, says he would be distraught if his son brought the virus home But Londoner Antonio says he's ""disappointed"" there isn't a more cautious, phased return - he and his 10-year-old son both have asthma and his wife is six months' pregnant. ""I'm not trying to live in fear,"" he says, but adds he would be ""distraught"" if his son brought the virus home. ""I don't think necessary precautions are being put in place to make me feel safe."" Read more from parents on the return to school here. Dr Susan Hopkins said her job is to prepare for worst-case scenarios The UK may facea ""hard winter"" for flu at the end of this year because population immunity to respiratory viruses will be lowafter months of social distancing, a Public Health England expert has said. Dr Susan Hopkins said the NHS will need to be ready for surges in flu or other illnesses. ""I think we have to prepare for a hard winter, not only with coronavirus, but we've had a year of almost no respiratory viruses of any other type. And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Hopkins, who leads PHE's Covid response, said her role as a government adviser was to ""prepare for worst-case scenarios"". ""It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,"" she said. Relaxed rules on outdoor drinking spaces are ""here to stay"" this summer, ministers say Pubs are expected to be able to convert areas such as car parks into beer gardens to make more space for drinkers when outdoor hospitality reopens this spring. UK Hospitality has already saidpubs have been deluged with bookings for beer gardensin anticipation of reopening on 12 April - the earliest date in the government's roadmap. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said rules introduced last June to make it easier to open up more outdoor space were ""here to stay"" for summer 2021. Outdoor socialising is believed to be considerably safer than meeting indoors during the pandemic. It means pubs, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to serve customers in car parks or terraces using their existing seating licenses, and there will be a cheaper, quicker route to obtain a pavement licence. The need for a planning application to put up outdoor marquees will also be removed. Ministers are considering far-reaching plans for schools to catch up on missed learning If you've just joined us, here's a look back at some of the main stories this lunchtime: Israel has led the world in terms of the speed and scale of its vaccination programme, and now the country has eased border controls and reopened more of its economy as it continues to re-emerge from a third coronavirus lockdown. From now on it will be much easier for Israelis to come home following the relaxing of what were very tight border controls. And amid growing confidence that the virus is being brought under control, bars, restaurants and cultural venues are being allowed to open their doors once again. But there will still be limits on the number of people allowed to enter these places, as well as social-distancing measures - and it will usually be necessary to show a pass that proves youâve been vaccinated. More than 3.7 million Israelis - about 40% of the population - have received the recommended two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly five million have received one shot. Israel has recorded 799,727 Covid infections and 5,856 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Child pyschologist Dr Sarah Mundy has been exploring how parents can help their children to adjust to the return to school. She told BBC News that first of all, parents needed to acknowledge their own feelings, ""because our feelings are contagious, and if we're very anxious about it then we're going to be passing that on to our children"". Next, Dr Mundy said, parents needed to ask: ""How can I show my child that I trust it's going to be ok, that I trust the school to look after them?"" She said there were three main ways to support your child:  The prime minister was also asked about England's nurses' proposed 1% pay rise, which, as we're been reporting, has not gone down well with unions, nor Labour. He told reporters at the vaccination centre: ""What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time."" He pointed out that the independent pay review body would look at the proposals, and come back. ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times,"" he added. ""We've tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can and that means, in addition to the Â£140bn of annual money, we've got another Â£62bn we've found to help support the NHS throughout the crisis,"" he said. ""My gratitude is overwhelming and I'm so grateful particularly to the nurses, and thankfully we are seeing more nurses now in our amazing NHS - there are 10,000 more nurses this year than there were last year."" Our Reality Check colleagues have been looking at nurses' pay in a lot more depthhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Longer school day, shorter summer being consideredA range of measures are being looked at to help pupils in England catch up, Gavin Williamson says.","This video can not be played Williamson: We intend for schools reopening to be 'irreversible' Longer school days and shorter holidays are among the measures the government is considering to help pupils in England catch up on lost learning, the education secretary has said. Gavin Williamson told the BBC ministers were looking at ""how the school year runs"" after the disruption of Covid. He also told Sky News a five-term year and changes to summer holidays were under consideration. Schools in England are reopening to all pupils on Monday. It marks thefirst step of the ""road map"" out of the national lockdown,which has been in place since the beginning of January and has seen most children learning from home since before Christmas. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether the government was going to extend the school day, Mr Williamson said: ""I think we should be evidence-based and we're looking at that, we're looking at how the school year runs."" Mr Williamson also told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that ministers were considering ""a whole range of proposals"". How will testing work in schools? Is school mask and testing policy flawed? How fresh air makes school safer The education secretary was asked whether schools would remain open if theR numberrose above one, which means the number of cases is continuing to increase. ""We are very much factoring in as part of the road map that actually schools will be staying open,"" Mr Williamson told the BBC. ""That is why we are taking a cautious approach because we intend for it to be an irreversible approach and that schools will continue to remain open."" He also gave a guarantee that schools would return after the Easter holidays. Secondary pupils in England are being asked to take regular Covid tests when schools reopen Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England, said she did not think the reopening of schools should be paused if the R number rose above one. With three weeks before the Easter holiday, she told the BBC there would be time to look at the data ""very carefully"". She said the relationship between the number of cases and the number of deaths and hospitalisations would also change in the next phase of the pandemic because of the impact of vaccinations. ""Then we will be able to accept some cases in the community without needing further restrictions,"" she added. Dr Hopkins said measures such as the testing of pupils to find asymptomatic cases would also help to keep R ""at the lowest level possible"". Attendance at school will be mandatory for all pupils when they reopen in England - meaning they should not miss lessons without a valid reason. However, pupils who are shielding have been asked to remain at home for a bit longer. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very hopeful"" the reopening of schools would go to plan. ""I think the risk is actually in not going back to school tomorrow, given all the suffering, all the loss of learning we have seen,"" he added. It is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers areat no higher risk of infection than other working-age people. But what role schools will play in the wider spread of the virus remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. Government advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. But this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggestedreopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one,external, which would lead to a growing epidemic. Ministers have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. Only such high infection rates that risk a surge in hospitalisations that threatens the NHS is seen as a problem. Secondary schools have been told that year groups can return on different days over the first week to allow for Covid testing. Secondary pupils will be tested three times in the first two weeks of school and will then be given two tests each week to use at home. These will be lateral flow tests, which involve taking a swab of the nose and throat and give a result within 30 minutes. All primary and secondary school staff are also being offered twice-weekly rapid tests, and parents and carers can also get a twice-weekly test. However, concerns have been raised that false positive results could mean pupils and their families being forced to self-isolate unnecessarily. Tests done at home require a confirmatory PCR test - which are more accurate - but Dr Hopkins said those taken at school would not because they are done in a ""specialised environment and individuals are trained to deliver it"". She added that evidence from lateral flow tests taken over the last eight weeks in real-life scenarios suggested the false positive rate was ""extremely low"" - less than one in 1,000. Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) has warned that secondary schools have struggled to get parental consent for testing of pupils, and said there needed to be a bigger ministerial push to encourage take-up. Mr Williamson said the rollout of testing in schools over the last few weeks suggested they had the ""highest take-up of any employment setting around the country"". The NEU has called for a phased return to schools in England - similar to the process in Scotland and Wales, where whole year groups are returning separated by several weeks. The union also accused the government of failing to put adequate safety measures in place ahead of schools reopening. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said schools should reopen but safety measures including adequate ventilation should have been put in place. He added that it was also ""disappointing"" that teachers had not been prioritised for the coronavirus vaccine LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? As well as undergoing testing, secondary school and college students are also being asked to wear face coverings in classrooms, where social distancing cannot be maintained, with the measure to be reviewed at Easter. But this is not mandatory, and in primary schools pupils are not being required to wear face coverings when they return to face-to-face lessons. Nor will they be tested. Mr Williamson said he hoped mask-wearing would be a ""temporary measure"". Meanwhile, a survey has shown that the majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school. But two-thirdsare concerned about the amount of learning lost,with some parents worried their child will never catch up. The Department for Educationhas announced a Â£700m package to help pupils catch up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools. There are different rules on schools across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions. The youngest pupils have already returned to school inScotlandandWales, while some primary school pupils inNorthern Irelandalso return to school on Monday.

Rangers fans urged to stay home amid title hopes,"Crowds gathered in George Square to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership Police say arrests were made and fines issued after crowds of fans gathered to celebrate Rangers winning the Scottish Premiership. Large numbers of supporters made their way to Ibrox Stadium and Glasgow's George Square to mark the achievement despite warnings to stay at home. Nicola Sturgeon said the crowds were ""infuriating and disgraceful"" and could delay the end of the Covid lockdown. Rangerstook the title after Celtic failed to beat Dundee United. The result gave Rangers an unassailable 20-point lead and the title for the first time in 10 years. Under current guidance, public gatherings are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. Football games are taking place behind closed doors with no fans in the stadium. However, following Sunday's game, crowds of fans took to the streets, as some let off flares while others chanted and waved flags outside the club ground. In Glasgow city centre fans flocked to George Square to celebrate being crowned Scottish champions. In a tweet, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon congratulated Rangers on the title win, but added: ""Gathering in crowds just now risks lives, and could delay exit from lockdown for everyone else."" ""If those gathering care at all about the safety of others & the country, they will go home,"" she said. In a later tweet she said: ""I share folks' anger at this."" She added it was ""infuriating and disgraceful"" to see the crowds ""risk our progress"" after everyone complying with lockdown rules has made ""so many sacrifices"". Allow Twitter content?

Ch Supt Mark Sutherland said officers attended gatherings at both George Square and outside Ibrox stadium. Arrests were made and fixed penalty notices issued for breaches of the Covid restrictions, disorder incidents and the use of pyrotechnic devices, he added. In a statement published shortly before 21:00, he urged fans to make their way home. The PA news agency reported that by 21:30 police officers had encircled a depleting group of fans at the base of the Scott Monument in George Square. Last Maythousands of Liverpool fans flouted social distancing guidelinesand gathered outside Anfield to celebrate the club's first Premier league title in 30 years. And in Novemberhundreds of Celtic supporters defied the level four restrictions and converged on Celtic Park to call for the removal of the club's then manager Neil Lennon. David Hamilton, chairman of the Scottish Police Federation, said he was ""appalled"" by the scenes. He also told the BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that officers, many of whom have not been vaccinated, were put in ""jeopardy"" by the supporters' actions. Mr Hamilton said he understood why people were frustrated by the Police Scotland response but said that was an operational matter for the force, which would have considered factors such as wider public order issues and road safety. He highlighted that it can take up to 20 minutes to issue a fixed penalty fine for breaches of the Covid restrictions. Mr Hamilton said: ""If we were to ticket everybody in George Square yesterday we would still be doing it just now."" But he also criticised the club for being ""silent"" and failing to address the mass gatherings on its social media accounts. He added: ""There is a responsibility to the club here. It should not take the government to have to ask the club to tell people to go home. ""That should have been something the club should have taken on themselves proactively."" The club tweeted or retweeted more than 50 times in the hours after they were crowned champions but did not address the mass gathering of fans. Social psychology expert Prof Stephen Reicher said the celebrations were ""completely predictable"" and ""in some ways encouraged"". The St Andrews University academic said it was ""disappointing that the club did not have a dialogue with the fans about how one can celebrate but in ways that are safe, in ways that don't endanger the public, that don't endanger and, indeed, don't endanger Scottish football"". He warned that it undermined the argument for safely reopening mass events including the Euros championship in Scotland. Glasgow Kelvin MSP Sandra White described the celebrations as ""absolute chaos"" and questioned what plans were in place to prevent mass gatherings. She told Good Morning Scotland: ""They [the fans] should never have been allowed to leave Ibrox and march into the city centre in large numbers. It could have been stopped there and then. ""People have lost loved ones and people can't visit loved ones and yet this is being facilitated."" Rangers fans in Northern Ireland also breached lockdown rules, with a large crowd gathering on Belfast's Shankill Road to celebrate on Sunday evening. Police Service Northern Ireland urged people to celebrate""at home safely and within the current health regulations"",external. Earlier on Sunday Scotland's justice secretary urged fans not to put lives at risk by flouting lockdown rules. Humza Yousaf also warned that Uefa would be paying ""close attention"" in anticipation of theEuropean Championships coming to Scotland. This video can not be played 'From 10 years of misery to this... bouncing' - Rangers fans celebrate at Ibrox Following their win, some Rangers players made their way to the fence to celebrate in sight of fans outside. Speaking onBBC Scotland's Sunday Show, Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross called the actions of fans outside Ibrox ""completely wrong"". He added: ""We've all done so much to get the virus rates down. ""I understand passions run high with football fans, but it clearly didn't match what we expect people to do during a Covid period, while many people still can't even leave their homes.""

UK must prepare for 'hard winter' of flu â expert,"This video can not be played Dr Hopkins: important we're prepared for 'hard winter' The UK must prepare for a ""hard winter"" because the population immunity to respiratory viruses other than Covid could be lower than usual, one of England's top medics has warned. Dr Susan Hopkins said the NHS must be ""ready"" for surges in flu and other similar illnesses. It comes ahead of England's first step towards easing lockdown, with all pupils returning to school on Monday. Most pupils have been learning from home since Christmas. Dr Hopkins, who is in charge of Public Health England's Covid strategy, said the UK needed to be ""better prepared"" than it was last autumn, when new, faster-spreading variants of the virus emerged. These drove infection rates up and forced further lockdown measures over the winter. Dr Hopkins told the BBC'sThe Andrew Marr Show: ""I think we have to prepare for a hard winter, not only with coronavirus, but we've had a year of almost no respiratory viruses of any other type. And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less. ""So we could see surges in flu. We could see surges in other respiratory viruses and other respiratory pathogens."" Dr Hopkins said her role as a government advisor was to ""prepare for worst-case scenarios"". ""It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,"" she said. Why goal is to live with Covid, not fight it Hancock: We could live with Covid 'like we do flu' How will lockdown begin to be lifted? During last year's winter, some 30 million people - more than ever before - were invited to get a free flu jab asministers feared the dual threat it posed alongside coronavirus. Flu can be a serious condition - it kills around 11,000 people in England each year and many more people receive hospital treatment for it. People at high risk from flu are also most at risk from Covid-19. Flu poses additional threats during the Covid pandemic because: There issome evidencea double infection with coronavirus and flu is more deadly than either alone A big flu season combined with coronavirus could overwhelm hospitals Responding to an influx of patients will be harder if lots of NHS or care-home staff also get sick with flu Prime Minister Boris Johnson's roadmap out of national lockdown aims for all coronavirus restrictions to be lifted by 21 June at the earliest. But top scientists and medics have warned that restrictions to curb Covid infections could continue into next winter. Mask-wearing and working from home could be among ""baseline"" measures expected to continue until then, the government's chief scientific adviserSir Patrick Vallance has said.

How fresh air makes school safer,"As children across England prepare to return to school, the focus is on testing, masks and the familiar routines of social distancing and hand washing. But on top of all those measures, there's something that until recently hasn't had much attention: a good supply of fresh air. Air matters because if someone is infected they'll release tiny virus particles called aerosols, which can accumulate and then be inhaled by others. Computer simulations by engineers in Germany,externalshow how easily the air in a poorly ventilated room can become hazardous. But there are strategies to reduce the risks of this happening. The first and most obvious move is to make sure that the windows are used. In some schools, they may be jammed with old paint but, wherever possible, getting them open will make a difference. When can children go back to school? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors For Dr Shaun Fitzgerald, one of the government's scientific advisers, this is ""the most important step"". One of the authors ofa recent study of indoor infection risks,external, he says fresh air is key. In cold weather, this doesn't mean throwing everything wide open and leaving everyone to freeze, but thinking about how to get enough air in. In many buildings, that will mean reaching up for the highest windows - those nearest the ceiling, he says. ""If you can crack open all the high-level windows a small amount, then you'll be able to get fresh air into the space without causing you or the children to suffer from cold draughts."" Dr Fitzgerald says that will help flush out potentially infected air. And in schools with mechanical ventilation and sealed windows, the best option is to maximise the flow of fresh air through the system. Timing is crucial because the longer people are together in one room, the more likely it is that infectious aerosols will build up. Dr Shelly Miller, a specialist in air quality at the University of Colorado in Boulder, suggests that lessons should be kept short. It's better to have five classes of just 30 minutes than three sessions lasting 50 minutes, she says. That reduces not only the chances of the air becoming contaminated but also the amount of time staff and pupils may be exposed to that risk. It also creates more opportunities to refresh a room when no one's in it. Dr Miller was part of a team investigatinga major Covid outbreak at a choir in the US,externalthat came up with a very revealing conclusion. ""If you cut the time indoors from two-and-half-hours to 30 minutes you would drop the risk of exposure to transmission from 87% to 10%."" We've all sensed when eyelids start drooping in an airless room. That's because there's a growing amount of carbon dioxide, as everyone's exhaled breaths keep adding more of the gas and it has nowhere to go. This tells you that there's not enough of a fresh supply coming in and that means that there's a greater risk of the increasingly stale air being infected. So one option is to use carbon dioxide monitors - devices costing between Â£50-Â£200 that keep track of the gas and tell you how much of it there is. They can't detect infectious aerosols, but they can act as a warning that there may be a problem. Last year Douglas Booker of National Air Quality Testing Services, a consultancy based at Lancaster University, deployed CO2 monitors in 20 different classrooms. He says they are ""a great indicator of how well ventilation is working"". If attention wanes, it could be a sign the room is getting stuffy ""We can make sure that airborne particulates aren't lingering in the classroom, they're being moved to the outdoor air and that should reduce the likelihood of any infection."" For many schools, investing in monitors for every classroom might not be possible at a time of tight budgets. In that case, Dr Fitzgerald suggests a zero-cost alternative. ""If there isn't a gauge on the wall telling me about the carbon dioxide, I'm going to use the sensor I was born with: my nose. ""If the air smells stuffy and feels stuffy then it probably is stuffy, and I'm going to take action to ventilate that space and crack open the windows.""

Parents worry about lost learning,"The majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school, but two-thirds are concerned about the amount of learning lost. A survey by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals some parents think that their child will never catch-up. It shows parents want policies to promote children's wellbeing as well as their academic learning. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has promised no child's prospects should be ""blighted by the pandemic."" As schools in England prepare to reopen to all pupils on Monday for the first time since early January, 90% of parents say they would send their children back, even if it was not compulsory. Parents are much more confident about children going back to school this time than they were last summer, says the financial think thank, when only two thirds of parents supported the idea of going back into the classroom. Among parents who are still reluctant, health concerns about the pandemic continue to be the most important reason - with nearly half of these parents saying the Covid-19 case rate is the key factor. Nearly 6,000 parents across England were asked their views in the last week of February, as the full reopening of schools was approaching. How will testing work in schools? Schools back 8 March with Covid tests taken at home Summer schools in England part of catch-up plan The youngest pupils have already returned to school in Scotland and Wales. Some primary school pupils in Northern Ireland also return to school on Monday. The survey provides evidence on how parents view the the impact of so much lost time in school. Overall, 65% of primary school parents and 68% of those with secondary school children are concerned that their child has lost out on learning. Among these worried secondary school parents, 9% believe their child's education will never be able to fully recover from the adverse effects the pandemic. The Department for Education recently announced a further Â£700m package to help pupils catch-up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools. Support for catch-up plans is very high among parents, the IFS survey suggests, with over 90% in favour, with tutoring the most popular policy. There is much less support among parents for a longer school day, an extended term or repeating school years, with disadvantaged families less likely to be keen. A large majority of parents (83%) are also in favour of policies to promote children's wellbeing. Most believed that in-class activities - such as arts, creative writing or spending time outdoors - would make the biggest difference. Around a quarter of parents prioritised greater access to mental health services. Christine Farquharson, IFS senior research economist, said: ""While close to half of those concerned think that the damage will be relatively short-lived, one in 10 secondary school parents think their child will never catch up. ""While the tutoring programmes that the government has emphasised are hugely popular with parents, it is hard to believe that the Â£1.7bn currently allocated to the recovery is anywhere near enough to meet the scale of this challenge."" A DfE spokeswoman said: ""We know the pandemic has had a significant impact on children and young people, which is why it's been our priority to get pupils back to face-to-face education. ""Our new Mental Health in Education Action Group will look at how we best support children and young people's mental wellbeing as they return to education settings, in addition to the mental health training we have funded for teachers to help them respond to emotional and mental health pressures.""

Today's coverage was the work of Joseph Lee, Adrian Dalingwater, Julian Joyce and Marie Jackson. As we near the end of today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and elsewhere, here's a summary of some of today's main events: Calls for the fans of Glasgow football club Rangers to stay at home and not gather to celebrate their team clinching the Scottish Premiership title for the first time in 10 years appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Hundreds of supporters descended on the team's home ground, Ibrox Stadium, and the city's George Square to celebrate. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged the fans to delay their celebrations and go home. Rangers won the title after Glasgow rivalsCeltic failed to beat Dundee United. Under current guidance, public gatherings in Scotland are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. You can read more on this storyhere. On a lighter note, residents of an English village have been receiving anonymous gifts of good-luck charms in the dead of night. Locals in Water Orton, Warwickshire, think someone on every street in the village has received a package from the unknown sender. An accompanying poem describes the sender's intention to ""brighten up your day"" in times which ""are hard to bear and often can be sad"". Local man Graham Smallburn said the gifts were delivering a ""feel-good factor"" during lockdown. ""They lift your spirit a bit,"" he added. You can read more about the mystery gift-giverhere.  The total number of coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Sunday is not yet available due to issues processing the data for England. The government's coronavirus dashboard is currently displaying the number of deaths as zero, which is not accurate. A little earlier, we put up a post with the zero figure, but have now taken that down. Sorry for any confusion. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson expressed his gratitude for the work of NHS staff - but said he was giving the health service as much as he could. This was not, however, the last word on pay. An independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff,  it could say that pay should rise above 1%. The government would then have a dilemma -  either to ignore this,  or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase. But the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition. While the shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned  a  1% rise  as ""a  disgrace"", he said Labour would ""honour whatever that review body recommends"". But during the years of austerity, it wasnât uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government. So if it were to back a  1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its  position or face a backlash from the unions. Government data shows there were 5,177 new coronavirus cases in the UK reported on Sunday, down from 6,040 on Saturday. According to data up to 6 March, 23,335,514 jabs have been given in the UK so far. Of those, 22,213,112 were first doses - a rise of 416,834 on the previous day. Some 1,122,402 were second doses, an increase of 31,562. Demonstrators shouted ""freedom"" as they protested the lockdown in Prague A few hundred demonstrators shouting ""freedom"" and carrying signs reading ""we don't want benefits, we want to work"" marched through Prague to oppose the Czech Republic's lockdown. Police used coronavirus regulations to turn away people who live outside the capital city because, while a right to protest is still guaranteed under the country's constitution, people are banned from travelling outside their local area. Riot police confronted the crowd of anti-lockdown protesters Several buses of demonstrators from Moravia were turned around and sent home. Demonstrators later marched through the city centre and - while the protest began without unrest - photographs later showed several people being arrested and riot police confronting the crowds. A person in a plague doctor mask, who travelled by Metro, was among the crowd of demonstrators The metal sculptures were mistakenly taken away as rubbish They were intended as a tribute to NHS heroes as they worked to save lives in the pandemic. But a Somerset man's sculptures werethrown away after his local council mistook them for fly-tipped rubbish. Martin Feeney, a former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer, placed the metal silhouette of a nurse holding a heart and a key inscribed with the words ""thank you"" on a roundabout in Radstock - with permission. But the message didn't get through to one team of council workers who cleared them away with the rubbish. The council said that while clearing fly-tipped items from the roundabout, workers ""took the sculptures away too in error"". But one worker salvaged the artworks and kept them at home until they could be restored to their rightful place. About 30,000 jobs are expected to be created by the Commonwealth Games Hosting the Commonwealth Games next year should bea ""catalyst"" for Birmingham's recovery from the pandemic, the chief executive of the games has said. Ian Reid said the Games would provide up to 30,000 jobs as well as volunteer roles. The West Midlands has been hard hit when it comes to unemployment, with anestimated 100,000 jobs lost since the start of the pandemic. Plans for a Â£500m athletes' villagewere abandoned last year due to delays in constructioncaused by Covid-19. Instead, athletes will be housed in student accommodation and at the National Exhibition Centre. But Reid said the estimated Â£800m cost of the games would be a ""real opportunity for the region"".  Scotland has recorded its second lowest number of infections this year, with 390 new confirmed cases. On Monday, 386 cases were reported, the lowest total since November. The nation has also reported zero deaths, although days without any reported deaths have been relatively common at the weekends. It means the total number of deaths by the daily reported measure still stands at 7,421. Meanwhile, NHS England said 90 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. In Wales, 18 more deaths were reported and 152 new confirmed cases - bringing the average infection rate over seven days to its lowest point since 18 September. A further three people have died in Northern Ireland, while 138 people have tested positive in the last 24 hours. UK-wide figures are due to be published at about 16:00 GMT, but they may not match the totals of the four nations as they use different reporting periods. Earlier the prime minister visited  a vaccination centre in north London where he was asked if he stood behind his decision to offer a 1% pay rise to NHS workers. You can hear what he said here.  This video can not be played The PM insisted he was ""grateful"" for the work of NHS staff in the pandemic After months of home-schooling, children in England are returning to their classrooms on Monday. But it won't be lessons as usual, as they will face major changes to the normal school experience. A key difference will be the coronavirus testing regime. Want to know more about this? Here's ourexplainer. Stacie is looking forward to some peace when the stresses of home school are over Across England, families are packing pencil cases and polishing shoes ready for the return to school tomorrow. But how are they feeling about their kids getting back into the classroom? Stacie, from Devon, says she is ""excited"" for her nine-year-old son to return to school - and she's ready for five minutes' peace. ""It's been so hard - there's been tears and tantrums.

Antonio, whose wife is six months' pregnant, says he would be distraught if his son brought the virus home But Londoner Antonio says he's ""disappointed"" there isn't a more cautious, phased return - he and his 10-year-old son both have asthma and his wife is six months' pregnant.

Dr Susan Hopkins said her job is to prepare for worst-case scenarios The UK may facea ""hard winter"" for flu at the end of this year because population immunity to respiratory viruses will be lowafter months of social distancing, a Public Health England expert has said. Dr Susan Hopkins said the NHS will need to be ready for surges in flu or other illnesses. ""I think we have to prepare for a hard winter, not only with coronavirus, but we've had a year of almost no respiratory viruses of any other type. And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Hopkins, who leads PHE's Covid response, said her role as a government adviser was to ""prepare for worst-case scenarios"". ""It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,"" she said. Relaxed rules on outdoor drinking spaces are ""here to stay"" this summer, ministers say Pubs are expected to be able to convert areas such as car parks into beer gardens to make more space for drinkers when outdoor hospitality reopens this spring. UK Hospitality has already saidpubs have been deluged with bookings for beer gardensin anticipation of reopening on 12 April - the earliest date in the government's roadmap. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said rules introduced last June to make it easier to open up more outdoor space were ""here to stay"" for summer 2021. Outdoor socialising is believed to be considerably safer than meeting indoors during the pandemic. It means pubs, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to serve customers in car parks or terraces using their existing seating licenses, and there will be a cheaper, quicker route to obtain a pavement licence. The need for a planning application to put up outdoor marquees will also be removed. Ministers are considering far-reaching plans for schools to catch up on missed learning If you've just joined us, here's a look back at some of the main stories this lunchtime: Israel has led the world in terms of the speed and scale of its vaccination programme, and now the country has eased border controls and reopened more of its economy as it continues to re-emerge from a third coronavirus lockdown. From now on it will be much easier for Israelis to come home following the relaxing of what were very tight border controls. And amid growing confidence that the virus is being brought under control, bars, restaurants and cultural venues are being allowed to open their doors once again. But there will still be limits on the number of people allowed to enter these places, as well as social-distancing measures - and it will usually be necessary to show a pass that proves youâve been vaccinated. More than 3.7 million Israelis - about 40% of the population - have received the recommended two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly five million have received one shot. Israel has recorded 799,727 Covid infections and 5,856 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Child pyschologist Dr Sarah Mundy has been exploring how parents can help their children to adjust to the return to school. She told BBC News that first of all, parents needed to acknowledge their own feelings, ""because our feelings are contagious, and if we're very anxious about it then we're going to be passing that on to our children"". Next, Dr Mundy said, parents needed to ask: ""How can I show my child that I trust it's going to be ok, that I trust the school to look after them?"" She said there were three main ways to support your child:  The prime minister was also asked about England's nurses' proposed 1% pay rise, which, as we're been reporting, has not gone down well with unions, nor Labour. He told reporters at the vaccination centre: ""What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time."" He pointed out that the independent pay review body would look at the proposals, and come back. ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times,"" he added. ""We've tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can and that means, in addition to the Â£140bn of annual money, we've got another Â£62bn we've found to help support the NHS throughout the crisis,"" he said. ""My gratitude is overwhelming and I'm so grateful particularly to the nurses, and thankfully we are seeing more nurses now in our amazing NHS - there are 10,000 more nurses this year than there were last year.""

Summer schools part of catch-up plan,"Secondary schools in England will be asked to consider delivering face-to-face summer schools as part of efforts to help pupils catch up. An extra Â£400m in funding has been announced, along with Â£300m announced for catch-up projects in January. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the money will help ensure ""no child is left behind"" due to the pandemic. Teachers, experts and unions called the money a ""good start"" - but warned about overwhelming pupils and teachers. The prime minister has confirmed all pupils will return to classrooms from 8 March as part of the first step ofa roadmap,externalfor easing England's lockdown. With secondary school pupils being asked to take three Covid-19 tests in school when they come back, it is likely that secondary schools will have to stagger the return over a few days. 5 ways children could make up for lost school time Telling children to catch up 'adds huge pressure' Heads warn against 'grinding out hours' in summer As part of the latest announcements, schools will have the option to run summer classes for pupils who need it most, potentially starting with those who will be moving up to Year 7 at secondary school this year. The government says it will be up to schools to decide how and if they run summer schools, how long they will be, and which pupils will be invited to attend. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said ""we're giving schools the option to be able to draw down on this funding"". He said the average primary school will also receive around Â£6,000 in extra money, with the average secondary school getting around Â£22,000 extra in recovery premium payments. It would be up to head teachers to decide how to use the money - it could be used, for example to pay teachers for overtime to do extra teaching. The government's Â£700m education support package for England includes: A one-off Â£302m ""recovery premium"" for state primary and secondary schools to boost summer schooling, clubs and activities Â£200m to fund face-to-face secondary summer schools, with teachers in charge of deciding which pupils benefit An expanded national tutoring programme for primary and secondary pupils and an extended tuition fund for 16 to 19-year-olds - also worth Â£200m That includes Â£18m funding to support early-years language development This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Last year, Mr Johnson announced a Â£1bn catch-up fund for England, and later appointed Sir Kevan Collins as education recovery commissioner. In Scotland, the administration has promised Â£140m in funding to help disadvantaged pupils. Tens of millions of pounds have also been put into catch-up schemes in Wales and Northern Ireland. The announcement comes as the Treasury has said its levelling-up fund will be extended to the whole of the UK to ""help boost growth"" in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Chief secretary to the Treasury, Stephen Barclay, said communities in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland would now all benefit from at least Â£800m of investment for town centre and high street regeneration, local transport, cultural and heritage projects. On the subject of masks in schools, Mr Williamson said the policy of secondary pupils in England having to wear face coverings in classrooms would be reviewed over the Easter holiays. Most pupils will have to wear face coverings indoors, including in classrooms where social distancing isn't possible. He did not rule out that the policy could remain in place until 21 June, which is the final date in plans to ease lockdown. The government had considered a variety of options for pupils - including extended school days and shorter summer holidays - but neither of these proposals form part of the plan set out on Wednesday. Asked whether extending the school day could be among future measures, Mr Williamson told Sky News: ""We'll be looking at how we can boost and support children in a whole range of different manners. ""But it's not just about time in school it's about supporting teachers in terms of the quality of teaching and how we can help them."" Exams this year have already been cancelled in England, but Mr Williamson said more detail on how grades will be calculated is expected on Thursday. Mother-of-three Emily Ellarby says her children are ""jaded"" by online learning and are ready to be back at school. But she says it would be ""hard to get them motivated"" for more school over the summer. ""They're looking forward to the summer holidays and having a proper break."" She says ultimately children just want to get back to school and normal life. ""They're quite keen to go back, they're looking forward to seeing their friends, they want that normality."" Father-of-two Nick Lee says children and teachers need a proper summer break, not more schooling. ""My children have suffered enough with this pandemic and they will not attend any summer camps. ""We have all struggled to cope in these hard times, and stealing my children's summer is not the way to go."" Nick Lee says he won't be sending his children to summer schools Sarah Baker, who has two children and a stepchild, says she is ""torn"" over the idea of catch-up lessons in the summer. ""They're all at really critical stages in their education, but they're also at critical stages in their personal development. So, I'm completely torn. Yes, of course, they need to catch up, but they also need to regroup."" And Sarah Webb, who has three children aged 11, eight and five, said children need time to recover from the past year, rather than more academic pressure. ""These children have missed out on social interaction and now need time to help readjust and come to terms with their experiences, not being given more time and pressure to bring them back up to academic standards that can simply no longer apply to them."" Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the new funding ""will not make up for the learning and time with friends that children have lost"". ""There is no specific mention of supporting children's mental health or wellbeing, which is fundamental to enabling their recovery from this pandemic,"" she said. Labour also calculated the new package was worth less than the Â£840m spent on the Eat Out to Help Out scheme last year, and would be worth 43p per pupil per day, if the money was split across a normal school year. School leaders' unions welcomed the funding but also warned of a long road ahead. Paul Whiteman, general secretary of the NAHT - which represents head teachers - said summer schools ""will be of value for some pupils but it will be important not to overwhelm students"". Chris Zarraga, director of Schools North East, said any provision needed to focus on children's ""physical wellbeing, and social and emotional development"", but he also expressed concern about teacher morale. He said asking teachers, who were ""facilitating both in-class teaching and remote learning"", to work over the summer break was likely to ""exacerbate low morale"". By Dan Johnson, BBC News Just working out how to measure what each child has missed during the pandemic is tricky, let alone agreeing on the best way to address it and make sure they all achieve their potential. Many teachers are wary of talking about ""catching-up"" and pupils being ""left behind"" - they do not want to discourage young people. But there is widespread recognition that home learning could never fully replace classroom teaching and some pupils will need significant extra support when they get back to classrooms. The government is backing one-to-one and small group tuition, alongside summer school activities. Suggestions of a longer school day or a shorter summer holiday have not materialised. Many teachers feel they can best assess what their pupils need, but after a relentless year, they are tired and need help in some form. How that help is given and whether it reaches the right pupils will determine the lasting impact on the lives of children who've been through the most difficult school year.

Is school testing policy flawed?,"Schools reopen to all pupils next week in England - the first part of the UK where this will happen. It is a crucial step for children and wider society in the route out of lockdown. Masks are to be worn by secondary school children in classes, while mass testing is being introduced. But will these steps be a help? And does it even matter if infection rates go up? To reduce the risk of spread of the virus, the government has introduced mass testing. All secondary school pupils will be offered three tests on their return before being asked to carry them out twice a week at home. These will be rapid lateral flow tests that provide a quick result on the spot, unlike the ones that are carried out in official testing centres - known as PCR tests - that are sent off to labs. The rapid tests are less accurate - they may pick up only between half to three-quarters of positive cases, but given they are being used to spot cases before people develop symptoms or for those who do not develop symptoms, the government is adamant they have an important role. This video can not be played What does Covid testing in schools look like? The problem is they can result in a false positive, telling people they are infected when they are not. Research suggests this happens one to three times for every 1,000 tests carried out. One safeguard would be to get anyone who tests positive to then take a PCR test to confirm it. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school. Assuming most pupils take up the option of the tests, that could result in thousands of pupils and their close contacts being asked to isolate unnecessarily. That may be a price worth paying if it was spotting many more positives, but the testing done in schools in recent weeks, of pupils and staff who have been attending, shows the number testing positive is now at the lower estimate for the false positivity rate. Birmingham University biostatistician Prof Jon Deeks says given the low detection rates that are being seen it is ""absolutely clear"" many of those getting positive test results next week will be false positives. ""Any testing system is a trade-off between benefits and harms,"" he says. ""My concern is that it will actually cause more harm than good."" Concerns have been raised by the Royal Statistical Society, too. Prof Sheila Bird, a member of the society's Covid-19 Task Force, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme false positives were ""very likely"" and that every positive lateral flow test should have a PCR test to confirm it. How fresh air makes school safer 'No evidence' schools spread lots of Covid The devastating toll of the pandemic on children The second key change - and the most controversial - is the recommendation of masks in classes for secondary age schoolchildren. Previously pupils were just expected to wear them in communal areas, like corridors. Critics say it will harm learning and is unfair to expect children to wear masks for hours on end. But others have argued it is an absolute necessity and should have been introduced in primary schools too. The problem is the benefit of mask-wearing is difficult to quantify.Recent evidence from the government advisory group Sage,externalacknowledges this, although it says there is evidence that worn correctly they will have a ""small but significant"" impact on transmission by preventing the wearer from spreading the virus if they are unknowingly infected. This is mainly derived from lab experiments though, and much will depend on how they are used, it says. Will teenagers adhere to the best practice on mask-wearing for hours on end? It is for this reason some experts say they would have liked to see a proper trial in schools to measure the impact. ""We always do this for a medical intervention - there are lots of things that work in the lab but not in the real world,"" says Prof Jonathan Ball, a virologist at Nottingham University. ""But for some reason we don't do this with non-medical interventions. It would be complicated, but this would be the ideal opportunity to do it - and help us decide if they are useful or make matters worse."" Without a trial, the fear is it will be difficult for the government to stop the practice. If cases remain low, it could be argued masks have made the difference and if they creep up, the case could be made they would have gone up more without mask-wearing. The move could, in other words, open a can of worms. But it is a risk ministers seem happy to tackle. The government insists the use of masks is ""temporary and precautionary"" - and  will be reviewed at Easter. Or, in the words of one scientific adviser: ""We know it's not going to make much difference, but if it helps us get schools back, it's worth the hassle when it's dropped."" It is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers areat no higher risk of infection than other working-age people. What role will schools play in the wider spread of the virus though remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. Government advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. But this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggestedreopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one,external, which would lead to a growing epidemic. Ministers have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. Dr Muge Cevik, an infectious disease expert at the University of St Andrews, says it is impossible to disentangle exactly what impact schools have - although she says all the evidence suggests the school outbreaks that have happened have mainly been small. ""The evidence of harms of closing schools is clear. They should be open as default unless there is very strong evidence that closing them will have a significant impact on hospitalisations and mortality.""

Parents worry about lost learning as schools return,"The majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school, but two-thirds are concerned about the amount of learning lost. A survey by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals some parents think that their child will never catch-up. It shows parents want policies to promote children's wellbeing as well as their academic learning. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has promised no child's prospects should be ""blighted by the pandemic."" As schools in England prepare to reopen to all pupils on Monday for the first time since early January, 90% of parents say they would send their children back, even if it was not compulsory. Parents are much more confident about children going back to school this time than they were last summer, says the financial think thank, when only two thirds of parents supported the idea of going back into the classroom. Among parents who are still reluctant, health concerns about the pandemic continue to be the most important reason - with nearly half of these parents saying the Covid-19 case rate is the key factor. Nearly 6,000 parents across England were asked their views in the last week of February, as the full reopening of schools was approaching. How will testing work in schools? Schools back 8 March with Covid tests taken at home Summer schools in England part of catch-up plan The youngest pupils have already returned to school in Scotland and Wales. Some primary school pupils in Northern Ireland also return to school on Monday. The survey provides evidence on how parents view the the impact of so much lost time in school. Overall, 65% of primary school parents and 68% of those with secondary school children are concerned that their child has lost out on learning. Among these worried secondary school parents, 9% believe their child's education will never be able to fully recover from the adverse effects the pandemic. The Department for Education recently announced a further Â£700m package to help pupils catch-up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools. Support for catch-up plans is very high among parents, the IFS survey suggests, with over 90% in favour, with tutoring the most popular policy. There is much less support among parents for a longer school day, an extended term or repeating school years, with disadvantaged families less likely to be keen. A large majority of parents (83%) are also in favour of policies to promote children's wellbeing. Most believed that in-class activities - such as arts, creative writing or spending time outdoors - would make the biggest difference. Around a quarter of parents prioritised greater access to mental health services. Christine Farquharson, IFS senior research economist, said: ""While close to half of those concerned think that the damage will be relatively short-lived, one in 10 secondary school parents think their child will never catch up. ""While the tutoring programmes that the government has emphasised are hugely popular with parents, it is hard to believe that the Â£1.7bn currently allocated to the recovery is anywhere near enough to meet the scale of this challenge."" A DfE spokeswoman said: ""We know the pandemic has had a significant impact on children and young people, which is why it's been our priority to get pupils back to face-to-face education. ""Our new Mental Health in Education Action Group will look at how we best support children and young people's mental wellbeing as they return to education settings, in addition to the mental health training we have funded for teachers to help them respond to emotional and mental health pressures.""

Johnson urges caution as England schools to reopen,"Boris Johnson has said the country is starting to move towards a sense of ""normality"" as schools in England get ready to open to more pupils on Monday. The PM has urged the public to stick to the rules as the government follows a ""cautious"" approach to easing lockdown. Monday marks the first step of the ""roadmap"" out of national restrictions. But the UK's largest education union has accused the government of failing to put adequate safety measures in place ahead of schools reopening. All pupils in all years can return to schools and colleges in England on Monday, and attendance will be mandatory - meaning they should not miss school without a valid reason. However, secondary schools have been told that year groups can return on different days over the first week to allow for Covid testing. And pupils who are shielding have been asked to remain at home for a bit longer. How will testing work in schools? Is school mask and testing policy flawed? How fresh air makes school safer Earlier this week, a survey of more than 930 head teachers found 76% of secondary schoolshave planned a staggered return next weekin order to facilitate Covid tests. In 7% of schools, it suggested, this will stretch into a second week. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said secondary and post-16 education leaders have struggled to get parental consent for the testing of pupils and said there needed to be a bigger ministerial push to encourage take up. ""Ministers had two months to make schools and colleges safer but failed to put the necessary measures in place to achieve this,"" she said. The NEU has called for a phased return to schools in England - similar to the process in Scotland and Wales, where whole year groups are returning separated by several weeks. Implementing the testing system was resulting in a ""de facto phased return"" which should be allowed to continue ""beyond the period necessary"", Dr Bousted said. Ges Smith, head teacher of Jo Richardson Community School in east London, told BBC Breakfast that testing its 1,600 students would be a ""military-style operation"". The school tested its sixth form pupils on Friday and will begin a phased return over the next week, with 6,000 tests carried out over the next fortnight. He added that some children ""haven't been out the house since January"" and would have high levels of anxiety about returning, ""so that transition back to school is enormously important"". Students in England are being asked to take regular Covid tests According tothe PM's roadmap, the second part of stage one - which will allow outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households - is due on 29 March. Further lifting of the rules will then happen if certain conditions are met, with shops possibly allowed to open by 12 April and all restrictions potentially lifted by 21 June. Mr Johnson stressed the government was being careful ""so that we do not undo the progress we have made so far"" and urged people to take up the vaccine and get tested when necessary. The PM said it was due to the ""determination"" of everyone in the country ""that we can start moving closer to a sense of normality"", praising the ""truly national effort"" against Covid. His comments come amid concerns that pupils may be forced to self-isolate unnecessarily because of inaccurate Covid test results. Downing Street said nearly 57 million lateral flow test kits have already been delivered to schools and colleges as part of the rollout. The tests involve taking a swab of the nose and throat. The sample is then inserted into a tube of liquid and gives a result within 30 minutes. Students will be tested for the virus three times in the first two weeks of school. After that they will be given two tests each week to use at home. Research suggests that the lateral flow devices can offer a false positive result between one and three times for every 1,000 tests carried out. Professor Sheila Bird, a member of the Royal Statistical Society, said it was ""very likely"" a lateral flow test could give a false positive reading. She said every positive lateral flow test of a pupil should be checked with a more reliable PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to ensure it is accurate. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school. Meanwhile,a survey has shownthat the majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school. But two-thirds are concerned about the amount of learning lost. The research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals some parents think that their child will never catch up. The Department for Education has announceda Â£700m package to help pupils catch up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools. But Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the funding does ""not make up for the learning and time with friends that children have lost"", adding there is no specific mention of supporting children's mental health or wellbeing. Asked by Sky News' Sophy Ridge whether plans to help pupils catch up could include shortening summer holidays, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government was looking at ""a whole range of different proposals"", including a five-term year, changes to holidays and lengthening the school day. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Secondary school and college students are also being asked to wear face coverings in classrooms, where social distancing cannot be maintained, as an additional safety measure set for review at Easter. But the measure is not mandatory, and in primary schools pupils are not being required to wear face coverings when they return to face-to-face lessons. Nor will they be tested. England's chief inspector of schools Amanda Spielman said she hoped mask wearing would only be needed for ""a short time"" so children could return for the summer term able to see everyone's faces fully. There are different rules on schools across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions. The youngest pupils have already returned to school in Scotland and Wales, while some primary school pupils in Northern Ireland also return to school on Monday. All secondary school pupils in Scotlandwill return to the classroom part-time from 15 March. In Wales, some secondary school pupilswill return on 15 March, with all secondary-age pupils back in the classroom full-time from 12 April. Some older pupils in Northern Irelandwill return on 22 March. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:Crouchy and the boys discuss a footballerâs entourage...

"Longer school day, shorter summer being consideredA range of measures are being looked at to help pupils in England catch up, the education secretary says.UK","This video can not be played Williamson: We intend for schools reopening to be 'irreversible' Longer school days and shorter holidays are among the measures the government is considering to help pupils in England catch up on lost learning, the education secretary has said. Gavin Williamson told the BBC ministers were looking at ""how the school year runs"" after the disruption of Covid. He also told Sky News a five-term year and changes to summer holidays were under consideration. Schools in England are reopening to all pupils on Monday. It marks thefirst step of the ""road map"" out of the national lockdown,which has been in place since the beginning of January and has seen most children learning from home since before Christmas. Asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether the government was going to extend the school day, Mr Williamson said: ""I think we should be evidence-based and we're looking at that, we're looking at how the school year runs."" Mr Williamson also told Sky News' Sophy Ridge that ministers were considering ""a whole range of proposals"". How will testing work in schools? Is school mask and testing policy flawed? How fresh air makes school safer The education secretary was asked whether schools would remain open if theR numberrose above one, which means the number of cases is continuing to increase. ""We are very much factoring in as part of the road map that actually schools will be staying open,"" Mr Williamson told the BBC. ""That is why we are taking a cautious approach because we intend for it to be an irreversible approach and that schools will continue to remain open."" He also gave a guarantee that schools would return after the Easter holidays. Secondary pupils in England are being asked to take regular Covid tests when schools reopen Dr Susan Hopkins, deputy director of Public Health England, said she did not think the reopening of schools should be paused if the R number rose above one. With three weeks before the Easter holiday, she told the BBC there would be time to look at the data ""very carefully"". She said the relationship between the number of cases and the number of deaths and hospitalisations would also change in the next phase of the pandemic because of the impact of vaccinations. ""Then we will be able to accept some cases in the community without needing further restrictions,"" she added. Dr Hopkins said measures such as the testing of pupils to find asymptomatic cases would also help to keep R ""at the lowest level possible"". Attendance at school will be mandatory for all pupils when they reopen in England - meaning they should not miss lessons without a valid reason. However, pupils who are shielding have been asked to remain at home for a bit longer. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he was ""very hopeful"" the reopening of schools would go to plan. ""I think the risk is actually in not going back to school tomorrow, given all the suffering, all the loss of learning we have seen,"" he added. It is well-established that children are at incredibly low risk from the virus, while research by the Office for National Statistics has shown that teachers areat no higher risk of infection than other working-age people. But what role schools will play in the wider spread of the virus remains more open for debate. Children, after all, come home and mix with their families. Government advisers say schools have not been a key driver of infections so far. This much can be seen from the impact of the second national lockdown in England in November when infection levels fell despite schools being open. But this was before the new UK variant became dominant. Modelling has suggestedreopening schools now could be enough to drive the R number above one,external, which would lead to a growing epidemic. Ministers have already indicated this matters less than it used to because the vaccination programme has begun to break the link between infection rates and serious illness and death - the R number is not one of their tests for slowing the pace of lifting lockdown. Only such high infection rates that risk a surge in hospitalisations that threatens the NHS is seen as a problem. Secondary schools have been told that year groups can return on different days over the first week to allow for Covid testing. Secondary pupils will be tested three times in the first two weeks of school and will then be given two tests each week to use at home. These will be lateral flow tests, which involve taking a swab of the nose and throat and give a result within 30 minutes. All primary and secondary school staff are also being offered twice-weekly rapid tests, and parents and carers can also get a twice-weekly test. However, concerns have been raised that false positive results could mean pupils and their families being forced to self-isolate unnecessarily. Tests done at home require a confirmatory PCR test - which are more accurate - but Dr Hopkins said those taken at school would not because they are done in a ""specialised environment and individuals are trained to deliver it"". She added that evidence from lateral flow tests taken over the last eight weeks in real-life scenarios suggested the false positive rate was ""extremely low"" - less than one in 1,000. Meanwhile, the National Education Union (NEU) has warned that secondary schools have struggled to get parental consent for testing of pupils, and said there needed to be a bigger ministerial push to encourage take-up. Mr Williamson said the rollout of testing in schools over the last few weeks suggested they had the ""highest take-up of any employment setting around the country"". The NEU has called for a phased return to schools in England - similar to the process in Scotland and Wales, where whole year groups are returning separated by several weeks. The union also accused the government of failing to put adequate safety measures in place ahead of schools reopening. Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth said schools should reopen but safety measures including adequate ventilation should have been put in place. He added that it was also ""disappointing"" that teachers had not been prioritised for the coronavirus vaccine LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? As well as undergoing testing, secondary school and college students are also being asked to wear face coverings in classrooms, where social distancing cannot be maintained, with the measure to be reviewed at Easter. But this is not mandatory, and in primary schools pupils are not being required to wear face coverings when they return to face-to-face lessons. Nor will they be tested. Mr Williamson said he hoped mask-wearing would be a ""temporary measure"". Meanwhile, a survey has shown that the majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school. But two-thirdsare concerned about the amount of learning lost,with some parents worried their child will never catch up. The Department for Educationhas announced a Â£700m package to help pupils catch up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools. There are different rules on schools across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions. The youngest pupils have already returned to school inScotlandandWales, while some primary school pupils inNorthern Irelandalso return to school on Monday.

Today's coverage was the work of Joseph Lee, Adrian Dalingwater, Julian Joyce and Marie Jackson. As we near the end of today's live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic in the UK and elsewhere, here's a summary of some of today's main events: Calls for the fans of Glasgow football club Rangers to stay at home and not gather to celebrate their team clinching the Scottish Premiership title for the first time in 10 years appear to have fallen on deaf ears. Hundreds of supporters descended on the team's home ground, Ibrox Stadium, and the city's George Square to celebrate. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has urged the fans to delay their celebrations and go home. Rangers won the title after Glasgow rivalsCeltic failed to beat Dundee United. Under current guidance, public gatherings in Scotland are banned and a maximum of two people from two households are allowed to meet outdoors. You can read more on this storyhere. On a lighter note, residents of an English village have been receiving anonymous gifts of good-luck charms in the dead of night. Locals in Water Orton, Warwickshire, think someone on every street in the village has received a package from the unknown sender. An accompanying poem describes the sender's intention to ""brighten up your day"" in times which ""are hard to bear and often can be sad"". Local man Graham Smallburn said the gifts were delivering a ""feel-good factor"" during lockdown. ""They lift your spirit a bit,"" he added. You can read more about the mystery gift-giverhere.  The total number of coronavirus deaths reported in the UK on Sunday is not yet available due to issues processing the data for England. The government's coronavirus dashboard is currently displaying the number of deaths as zero, which is not accurate. A little earlier, we put up a post with the zero figure, but have now taken that down. Sorry for any confusion. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson expressed his gratitude for the work of NHS staff - but said he was giving the health service as much as he could. This was not, however, the last word on pay. An independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff,  it could say that pay should rise above 1%. The government would then have a dilemma -  either to ignore this,  or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase. But the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition. While the shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned  a  1% rise  as ""a  disgrace"", he said Labour would ""honour whatever that review body recommends"". But during the years of austerity, it wasnât uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government. So if it were to back a  1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its  position or face a backlash from the unions. Government data shows there were 5,177 new coronavirus cases in the UK reported on Sunday, down from 6,040 on Saturday. According to data up to 6 March, 23,335,514 jabs have been given in the UK so far. Of those, 22,213,112 were first doses - a rise of 416,834 on the previous day. Some 1,122,402 were second doses, an increase of 31,562. Demonstrators shouted ""freedom"" as they protested the lockdown in Prague A few hundred demonstrators shouting ""freedom"" and carrying signs reading ""we don't want benefits, we want to work"" marched through Prague to oppose the Czech Republic's lockdown. Police used coronavirus regulations to turn away people who live outside the capital city because, while a right to protest is still guaranteed under the country's constitution, people are banned from travelling outside their local area. Riot police confronted the crowd of anti-lockdown protesters Several buses of demonstrators from Moravia were turned around and sent home. Demonstrators later marched through the city centre and - while the protest began without unrest - photographs later showed several people being arrested and riot police confronting the crowds. A person in a plague doctor mask, who travelled by Metro, was among the crowd of demonstrators The metal sculptures were mistakenly taken away as rubbish They were intended as a tribute to NHS heroes as they worked to save lives in the pandemic. But a Somerset man's sculptures werethrown away after his local council mistook them for fly-tipped rubbish. Martin Feeney, a former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer, placed the metal silhouette of a nurse holding a heart and a key inscribed with the words ""thank you"" on a roundabout in Radstock - with permission. But the message didn't get through to one team of council workers who cleared them away with the rubbish. The council said that while clearing fly-tipped items from the roundabout, workers ""took the sculptures away too in error"". But one worker salvaged the artworks and kept them at home until they could be restored to their rightful place. About 30,000 jobs are expected to be created by the Commonwealth Games Hosting the Commonwealth Games next year should bea ""catalyst"" for Birmingham's recovery from the pandemic, the chief executive of the games has said. Ian Reid said the Games would provide up to 30,000 jobs as well as volunteer roles. The West Midlands has been hard hit when it comes to unemployment, with anestimated 100,000 jobs lost since the start of the pandemic. Plans for a Â£500m athletes' villagewere abandoned last year due to delays in constructioncaused by Covid-19. Instead, athletes will be housed in student accommodation and at the National Exhibition Centre. But Reid said the estimated Â£800m cost of the games would be a ""real opportunity for the region"".  Scotland has recorded its second lowest number of infections this year, with 390 new confirmed cases. On Monday, 386 cases were reported, the lowest total since November. The nation has also reported zero deaths, although days without any reported deaths have been relatively common at the weekends. It means the total number of deaths by the daily reported measure still stands at 7,421. Meanwhile, NHS England said 90 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. In Wales, 18 more deaths were reported and 152 new confirmed cases - bringing the average infection rate over seven days to its lowest point since 18 September. A further three people have died in Northern Ireland, while 138 people have tested positive in the last 24 hours. UK-wide figures are due to be published at about 16:00 GMT, but they may not match the totals of the four nations as they use different reporting periods. Earlier the prime minister visited  a vaccination centre in north London where he was asked if he stood behind his decision to offer a 1% pay rise to NHS workers. You can hear what he said here.  This video can not be played The PM insisted he was ""grateful"" for the work of NHS staff in the pandemic After months of home-schooling, children in England are returning to their classrooms on Monday. But it won't be lessons as usual, as they will face major changes to the normal school experience. A key difference will be the coronavirus testing regime. Want to know more about this? Here's ourexplainer. Stacie is looking forward to some peace when the stresses of home school are over Across England, families are packing pencil cases and polishing shoes ready for the return to school tomorrow. But how are they feeling about their kids getting back into the classroom? Stacie, from Devon, says she is ""excited"" for her nine-year-old son to return to school - and she's ready for five minutes' peace. ""It's been so hard - there's been tears and tantrums. I have so much respect for teachers,â she says. ""I've got no doubt that once he goes back to his friends and a proper teacher - because I am no teacher - he'll be loving it."" Antonio, whose wife is six months' pregnant, says he would be distraught if his son brought the virus home But Londoner Antonio says he's ""disappointed"" there isn't a more cautious, phased return - he and his 10-year-old son both have asthma and his wife is six months' pregnant. ""I'm not trying to live in fear,"" he says, but adds he would be ""distraught"" if his son brought the virus home. ""I don't think necessary precautions are being put in place to make me feel safe."" Read more from parents on the return to school here. Dr Susan Hopkins said her job is to prepare for worst-case scenarios The UK may facea ""hard winter"" for flu at the end of this year because population immunity to respiratory viruses will be lowafter months of social distancing, a Public Health England expert has said. Dr Susan Hopkins said the NHS will need to be ready for surges in flu or other illnesses. ""I think we have to prepare for a hard winter, not only with coronavirus, but we've had a year of almost no respiratory viruses of any other type. And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Hopkins, who leads PHE's Covid response, said her role as a government adviser was to ""prepare for worst-case scenarios"". ""It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,"" she said. Relaxed rules on outdoor drinking spaces are ""here to stay"" this summer, ministers say Pubs are expected to be able to convert areas such as car parks into beer gardens to make more space for drinkers when outdoor hospitality reopens this spring. UK Hospitality has already saidpubs have been deluged with bookings for beer gardensin anticipation of reopening on 12 April - the earliest date in the government's roadmap. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said rules introduced last June to make it easier to open up more outdoor space were ""here to stay"" for summer 2021. Outdoor socialising is believed to be considerably safer than meeting indoors during the pandemic. It means pubs, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to serve customers in car parks or terraces using their existing seating licenses, and there will be a cheaper, quicker route to obtain a pavement licence. The need for a planning application to put up outdoor marquees will also be removed. Ministers are considering far-reaching plans for schools to catch up on missed learning If you've just joined us, here's a look back at some of the main stories this lunchtime: Israel has led the world in terms of the speed and scale of its vaccination programme, and now the country has eased border controls and reopened more of its economy as it continues to re-emerge from a third coronavirus lockdown. From now on it will be much easier for Israelis to come home following the relaxing of what were very tight border controls. And amid growing confidence that the virus is being brought under control, bars, restaurants and cultural venues are being allowed to open their doors once again. But there will still be limits on the number of people allowed to enter these places, as well as social-distancing measures - and it will usually be necessary to show a pass that proves youâve been vaccinated. More than 3.7 million Israelis - about 40% of the population - have received the recommended two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly five million have received one shot. Israel has recorded 799,727 Covid infections and 5,856 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Child pyschologist Dr Sarah Mundy has been exploring how parents can help their children to adjust to the return to school. She told BBC News that first of all, parents needed to acknowledge their own feelings, ""because our feelings are contagious, and if we're very anxious about it then we're going to be passing that on to our children"". Next, Dr Mundy said, parents needed to ask: ""How can I show my child that I trust it's going to be ok, that I trust the school to look after them?"" She said there were three main ways to support your child:  The prime minister was also asked about England's nurses' proposed 1% pay rise, which, as we're been reporting, has not gone down well with unions, nor Labour. He told reporters at the vaccination centre: ""What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time."" He pointed out that the independent pay review body would look at the proposals, and come back. ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times,"" he added. ""We've tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can and that means, in addition to the Â£140bn of annual money, we've got another Â£62bn we've found to help support the NHS throughout the crisis,"" he said. ""My gratitude is overwhelming and I'm so grateful particularly to the nurses, and thankfully we are seeing more nurses now in our amazing NHS - there are 10,000 more nurses this year than there were last year."" Our Reality Check colleagues have been looking at nurses' pay in a lot more depthhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"'Mummy, have they found the red boat yet?'","The Nicola Faith has been missing for five weeks ""Mummy, have they found the red boat yet?"" A small boy and his mother walk past Conwy's medieval castle, the child looking down towards the quayside and a gap in the line of fishing boats anchored there. It is a gap which would normally have been filled by the Nicola Faith, a ten metre vessel that was a familiar sight to Conwy residents. Her distinctive red colour scheme caught children's eyes. People on a late-night dog walk would exchange hellos with her owner and skipper Carl McGrath as he unloaded his catch of whelks. Alan Minard, Ross Ballantine and Carl McGrath were all aboard the Nicola Faith went it went missing Down on the quayside, Nathania Minard is also looking at the space where the Nicola Faith would be. Her son Alan was one of the three men on board when the boat set sail on 27 January -and never returned. ""He was 20, and quite a bit younger than the other two lads on board"", she says, ""but he always felt like everyone's big brother."" Alan has three siblings, Poppy, 16, Jessica, 6, and two-year-old Percy. Alan Minard was the eldest of four siblings ""He had waited 18 years to have a little brother. He's just got one and it's devastating that he's not going to be here to see him grow,"" she added. ""Every day the other children ask if the policeman is bringing Alan home today. It's heart-breaking. Missing fishing vessel's life raft recovered Families bid for private sea search for fishermen 'We need to know what happened to our boys' ""Jessica keeps asking if I can try ringing his phone again. It makes you feel like a failure as a mother."" A fundraising page has been set up to help look for Alan Minard and the other crewmen This is one of the reasons why Nathania and her wife Rebekah have joined with families of the other two missing men to set up a fundraising page on the internet site JustGiving. Relatives of 39-year-old Ross Ballantine and 34-year-old Carl McGrath have formed close links with the Minard family to offer support, share information and co-ordinate fund-raising. The families want to hire additional deep sea search expertise to help look for the Nicola Faith and her three crew, working alongside the official investigation currently being run by the Marine Accident Investigation Branch (MAIB). In less than a week, the appeal had raised Â£27,000. The families say it's an impressive total, but they still need to raise more. ""Everything raised is a great comfort to us at the moment. There's so much love towards the boys. It shows how much people care and that they haven't forgotten,"" added Nathania. ""They deserve better than for the case to remain open for years, we can't do that. ""Alan had his whole future ahead of him. He was a natural engineer and kept our ancient vacuum cleaner going for years by constantly repairing it. Skipper Carl McGrath with girlfriend Amy Lamb ""We bought him a games console for Christmas one year and he took it to bits within six months, then forgot how to put it back together again! ""He's one of those people who will always have work. He'd got a marine engineering apprenticeship in Devon, but when work dried up because of the pandemic, he headed back to north Wales and landed a job on board the Nicola Faith. ""He's a grafter. Over the last year, he'd turned from a boy into a man and we were so proud of him. ""He got on really well with Carl on board the Nicola Faith. Carl appreciated Alan because he was a hard worker - they really hit it off. It's hard to believe Alan had only been on the crew two weeks."" Alan was not the only man new to the crew. Ross had come on board the when his work as a carpet fitter also slowed down because of the coronavirus pandemic. Ross Ballantine joined the Nicola Faith to be spend more time with his sons His sister Lowri Taylor said: ""He's a devoted dad. Working on a fishing boat isn't easy, but he loved it. ""The job meant he could see his two boys more often. He could stay local for them rather than having to work away during the week."" The mother of those two boys is one of the many people around the Conwy area helping the families begin their private search. Zoey Walker runs Dollybirds Beauty Parlour in Llandudno and is co-ordinating a fundraising auction. She said: ""My boys feel we are doing something to help after a horrendous month of not knowing and such a devastating time for them."" This video can not be played Missing fishermen are ""out there somewhere"" Singer Tom Stockdale is toshave his head live,externalonline over the weekend. Another local supporter is running laps of the Great Orme headland in Llandudno to raise funds. Others are organising raffles. It reflects the warmth felt towards all three crewmen on the quayside in Conwy and in the wider community. One boat owner mentions how he and Carl would lend each other engine spares. Others speak of the energy he brought to the local fishing industry and the time and effort he spent maintaining and upgrading the boat. The boat's empty life raft was found on Friday off the coast of Scotland Nathania added: ""We've been overwhelmed at the support we've had from our own community and from further afield. ""We're not going to give up, we need to know where they are, we need to know what happened. ""It's not just to answer our questions today but as the children get older, there'll be questions that they'll ask and I don't want years to go by without us knowing."" David Mearns found the plane which was carrying Argentine footballer Emiliano Sala The expert who is advising the families about their private search isDavid Mearns, who successfully found the wreckage of the plane carrying footballer Emiliano Sala and pilot David Ibbotson when it crashed into the English Channel in 2019. He is confident that the Nicola Faith can be located. The families say more sonar surveys will take place this weekend on behalf of the MAIB. On land they continue to raise money and awareness, while pausing to reflect by the vigil candles and tributes that have been placed on Conwy quayside. But for the moment, the answer to the little boy's question of whether the red boat has been found remains a painful ""no"".

A little earlier, we put up a post with the zero figure, but have now taken that down. Sorry for any confusion. Iain WatsonPolitical correspondent Boris Johnson expressed his gratitude for the work of NHS staff - but said he was giving the health service as much as he could. This was not, however, the last word on pay. An independent review body will make its recommendations on NHS salaries in May. If it's worried about retention and recruitment of staff,  it could say that pay should rise above 1%. The government would then have a dilemma -  either to ignore this,  or make cuts elsewhere to fund a bigger increase. But the review body could equally present a challenge to the opposition. While the shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth condemned  a  1% rise  as ""a  disgrace"", he said Labour would ""honour whatever that review body recommends"". But during the years of austerity, it wasnât uncommon for pay review bodies to act within constraints set by government. So if it were to back a  1% rise after all, the Labour leadership would need to rethink its  position or face a backlash from the unions. Government data shows there were 5,177 new coronavirus cases in the UK reported on Sunday, down from 6,040 on Saturday. According to data up to 6 March, 23,335,514 jabs have been given in the UK so far. Of those, 22,213,112 were first doses - a rise of 416,834 on the previous day. Some 1,122,402 were second doses, an increase of 31,562. Demonstrators shouted ""freedom"" as they protested the lockdown in Prague A few hundred demonstrators shouting ""freedom"" and carrying signs reading ""we don't want benefits, we want to work"" marched through Prague to oppose the Czech Republic's lockdown. Police used coronavirus regulations to turn away people who live outside the capital city because, while a right to protest is still guaranteed under the country's constitution, people are banned from travelling outside their local area. Riot police confronted the crowd of anti-lockdown protesters Several buses of demonstrators from Moravia were turned around and sent home. Demonstrators later marched through the city centre and - while the protest began without unrest - photographs later showed several people being arrested and riot police confronting the crowds. A person in a plague doctor mask, who travelled by Metro, was among the crowd of demonstrators The metal sculptures were mistakenly taken away as rubbish They were intended as a tribute to NHS heroes as they worked to save lives in the pandemic. But a Somerset man's sculptures werethrown away after his local council mistook them for fly-tipped rubbish. Martin Feeney, a former Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineer, placed the metal silhouette of a nurse holding a heart and a key inscribed with the words ""thank you"" on a roundabout in Radstock - with permission. But the message didn't get through to one team of council workers who cleared them away with the rubbish. The council said that while clearing fly-tipped items from the roundabout, workers ""took the sculptures away too in error"". But one worker salvaged the artworks and kept them at home until they could be restored to their rightful place. About 30,000 jobs are expected to be created by the Commonwealth Games Hosting the Commonwealth Games next year should bea ""catalyst"" for Birmingham's recovery from the pandemic, the chief executive of the games has said. Ian Reid said the Games would provide up to 30,000 jobs as well as volunteer roles. The West Midlands has been hard hit when it comes to unemployment, with anestimated 100,000 jobs lost since the start of the pandemic. Plans for a Â£500m athletes' villagewere abandoned last year due to delays in constructioncaused by Covid-19. Instead, athletes will be housed in student accommodation and at the National Exhibition Centre. But Reid said the estimated Â£800m cost of the games would be a ""real opportunity for the region"".  Scotland has recorded its second lowest number of infections this year, with 390 new confirmed cases. On Monday, 386 cases were reported, the lowest total since November. The nation has also reported zero deaths, although days without any reported deaths have been relatively common at the weekends. It means the total number of deaths by the daily reported measure still stands at 7,421. Meanwhile, NHS England said 90 more people have died within 28 days of a positive test. In Wales, 18 more deaths were reported and 152 new confirmed cases - bringing the average infection rate over seven days to its lowest point since 18 September. A further three people have died in Northern Ireland, while 138 people have tested positive in the last 24 hours. UK-wide figures are due to be published at about 16:00 GMT, but they may not match the totals of the four nations as they use different reporting periods. Earlier the prime minister visited  a vaccination centre in north London where he was asked if he stood behind his decision to offer a 1% pay rise to NHS workers. You can hear what he said here.  This video can not be played The PM insisted he was ""grateful"" for the work of NHS staff in the pandemic After months of home-schooling, children in England are returning to their classrooms on Monday. But it won't be lessons as usual, as they will face major changes to the normal school experience. A key difference will be the coronavirus testing regime. Want to know more about this? Here's ourexplainer. Stacie is looking forward to some peace when the stresses of home school are over Across England, families are packing pencil cases and polishing shoes ready for the return to school tomorrow. But how are they feeling about their kids getting back into the classroom? Stacie, from Devon, says she is ""excited"" for her nine-year-old son to return to school - and she's ready for five minutes' peace. ""It's been so hard - there's been tears and tantrums. I have so much respect for teachers,â she says. ""I've got no doubt that once he goes back to his friends and a proper teacher - because I am no teacher - he'll be loving it."" Antonio, whose wife is six months' pregnant, says he would be distraught if his son brought the virus home But Londoner Antonio says he's ""disappointed"" there isn't a more cautious, phased return - he and his 10-year-old son both have asthma and his wife is six months' pregnant. ""I'm not trying to live in fear,"" he says, but adds he would be ""distraught"" if his son brought the virus home. ""I don't think necessary precautions are being put in place to make me feel safe."" Read more from parents on the return to school here. Dr Susan Hopkins said her job is to prepare for worst-case scenarios The UK may facea ""hard winter"" for flu at the end of this year because population immunity to respiratory viruses will be lowafter months of social distancing, a Public Health England expert has said. Dr Susan Hopkins said the NHS will need to be ready for surges in flu or other illnesses. ""I think we have to prepare for a hard winter, not only with coronavirus, but we've had a year of almost no respiratory viruses of any other type. And that means, potentially the population immunity to that is less,"" she told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show. Hopkins, who leads PHE's Covid response, said her role as a government adviser was to ""prepare for worst-case scenarios"". ""It doesn't mean that they'll necessarily happen, but my job is to make sure that we have options available for the country in case things are not as satisfactory as we'd all like them to be,"" she said. Relaxed rules on outdoor drinking spaces are ""here to stay"" this summer, ministers say Pubs are expected to be able to convert areas such as car parks into beer gardens to make more space for drinkers when outdoor hospitality reopens this spring. UK Hospitality has already saidpubs have been deluged with bookings for beer gardensin anticipation of reopening on 12 April - the earliest date in the government's roadmap. Local Government Secretary Robert Jenrick said rules introduced last June to make it easier to open up more outdoor space were ""here to stay"" for summer 2021. Outdoor socialising is believed to be considerably safer than meeting indoors during the pandemic. It means pubs, restaurants and cafes will be allowed to serve customers in car parks or terraces using their existing seating licenses, and there will be a cheaper, quicker route to obtain a pavement licence. The need for a planning application to put up outdoor marquees will also be removed. Ministers are considering far-reaching plans for schools to catch up on missed learning If you've just joined us, here's a look back at some of the main stories this lunchtime: Israel has led the world in terms of the speed and scale of its vaccination programme, and now the country has eased border controls and reopened more of its economy as it continues to re-emerge from a third coronavirus lockdown. From now on it will be much easier for Israelis to come home following the relaxing of what were very tight border controls. And amid growing confidence that the virus is being brought under control, bars, restaurants and cultural venues are being allowed to open their doors once again. But there will still be limits on the number of people allowed to enter these places, as well as social-distancing measures - and it will usually be necessary to show a pass that proves youâve been vaccinated. More than 3.7 million Israelis - about 40% of the population - have received the recommended two jabs of the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine. Nearly five million have received one shot. Israel has recorded 799,727 Covid infections and 5,856 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University. Child pyschologist Dr Sarah Mundy has been exploring how parents can help their children to adjust to the return to school. She told BBC News that first of all, parents needed to acknowledge their own feelings, ""because our feelings are contagious, and if we're very anxious about it then we're going to be passing that on to our children"". Next, Dr Mundy said, parents needed to ask: ""How can I show my child that I trust it's going to be ok, that I trust the school to look after them?"" She said there were three main ways to support your child:  The prime minister was also asked about England's nurses' proposed 1% pay rise, which, as we're been reporting, has not gone down well with unions, nor Labour. He told reporters at the vaccination centre: ""What we have done is try to give them as much as we can at the present time."" He pointed out that the independent pay review body would look at the proposals, and come back. ""Don't forget that there has been a public sector pay freeze, we're in pretty tough times,"" he added. ""We've tried to give the NHS as much as we possibly can and that means, in addition to the Â£140bn of annual money, we've got another Â£62bn we've found to help support the NHS throughout the crisis,"" he said. ""My gratitude is overwhelming and I'm so grateful particularly to the nurses, and thankfully we are seeing more nurses now in our amazing NHS - there are 10,000 more nurses this year than there were last year."" Our Reality Check colleagues have been looking at nurses' pay in a lot more depthhere. Â© 2025 BBC.

What happened to George Floyd?,"A year has passed since George Floyd - an unarmed African American man - was murdered during an arrest by white officer Derek Chauvin. Videos of the incident - which showed Chauvin kneeling on Mr Floyd's neck for several minutes - triggered protests across the US and around the world over police brutality and racism in law enforcement. The 46-year-old bought a pack of cigarettes at a convenience store in South Minneapolis on the evening of 25 May 2020. A shop assistant believed he had used a counterfeit $20 bill and called the police after Mr Floyd refused to return the cigarettes or pay again. Officers arrived and handcuffed him but when they tried to put him into the squad car, he resisted. A struggle ended with Mr Floyd face down on the street. That's when onlookers began filming. The final moments of George Floyd The murder that drove America to the brink Chauvin, 44, placed his left knee on Mr Floyd's neck and shoulder, and kept it there for more than nine minutes, according to prosecutors. Two other officers helped pin him down, while another prevented witnesses from intervening. More than 20 times Mr Floyd said he could not breathe. The video shows him going limp and being carried away by police. He was pronounced dead in hospital an hour later. Chauvin was the most senior officer involved in Mr Floyd's arrest and faced the most serious charges of the four. The 19-year Minneapolis Police Department veteran's record of policing included both commendations and complaints about conduct. In 2006, Chauvin was recommended for a medal of valour for his role in the shooting of a man who aimed a shotgun at officers. There were at least 15 conduct complaints against him prior to the killing of Mr Floyd. Most were closed without discipline. The day after his arrest, a lawyer for his wife Kellie said she had filed for divorce. The highly-charged trial, which began on 29 March, lasted three weeks and left Minneapolis on edge. A twelve-member jury heard from 45 witnesses and saw several hours of video footage. Five key moments from the Derek Chauvin trial Several eyewitnesses broke down in tears as they watched graphic footage of the incident and described feeling ""helpless"" as events unfolded. Mr Floyd's girlfriend of three years and his younger sibling also took the stand. Expert witnesses on behalf of the state testified that Mr Floyd died from a lack of oxygen due to the manner of restraint employed by Chauvin and his colleagues. Chauvin himself chose not to testify, invoking his right to not incriminate himself with his responses. Jurors took less than a day to reach their unanimous verdict, finding Chauvin guilty on all three charges: second-degree murder, third-degree murder and manslaughter. Derek Chauvin was convicted on murder and manslaughter charges Sentencing will take place in June, and Mr Chauvin could spend decades in jail. His lawyers have requested a new trial, but the motion is not likely to be granted. The other three police officers will come before the courts in August. The four police officers at the scene were fired the following day, as crowds took to the streets of Minneapolis to protest. The station where they worked was set ablaze and demonstrations quickly spread to other cities. By the sixth night, there were protests in 75 cities across the US - some violent - and a national debate about police brutality against African-Americans was reignited. An anti-racism movement created in 2013 after the killing of teenager Trayvon Martin, Black Lives Matter, was re-energised. Timeline of protests What is Black Lives Matter? Even very white, small towns in rural parts of the US held protests to remember Mr Floyd and take a stand against racial injustice. Reforms were introduced by lawmakers to change the way some police forces make arrests and detain suspects. But the conversation soon widened from policing to issues such as workplace equality, unconscious bias and the legacy of slavery. June 2020: Protesters in Washington DC march against police brutality After the verdict, the Floyd family's lawyer, Ben Crump, said the conviction marked a ""turning point in history"" for the US. It is rare that police officers in the US are charged, let alone convicted, for use of lethal force. President Joe Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris called the Floyd family after the verdict. Mr Biden was heard saying that ""at least now there is some justice"". In nationally televised remarks shortly afterwards, Mr Biden said: ""Systemic racism is a stain on the whole nation's soul."" This video can not be played Racism in the US: Is there a single step that can bring equality? Anti-racism protests were held in countries across the world in response to the death. Many focused on their own victims of alleged police violence. Why protests went global In Australia, the focus was on the indigenous community, while in the UK, a statue of a 17th Century slave trader was torn down and thrown into Bristol harbour. Many corporate brands also expressed support for Black Lives Matter, while many athletes now ""take the knee"" in solidarity before events.

"Ikea boss warns tariffs will lead to higher pricesJesper Brodin, who heads the firm, says he fears global trade tensions will mean customers must pay more.","Ikea boss Jesper Brodin is concerned trade tensions will increase product prices The boss of Ikea has told the BBC he fears that global trade tensions will lead to higher prices for customers. Jesper Brodin, chief executive of Ingka Group, which is the furniture giant's holding company, said imposing restrictions such as tariffs ""normally doesn't benefit the ordinary people"". Many countries have imposed new tariffs and other restrictions on imports in recent years. The trend was accentuated by the US under former President Donald Trump. And the World Trade Organization says even before the pandemic,trade restrictions were on the rise,external. What is a trade war and why should I worry? ""Normally it leads to cost increases on the product in the end of the day. And there are some concerns about that going on, not only in India but globally,"" Mr Brodin said in a BBC interview. Ikea has invested billions of dollars in India inambitious expansion plans, but it imports the majority of the products it sells in the country, from furniture to kitchenware. That means it has fallen foul of higher import taxes imposed last year by Narendra Modi's government as part of hisself-reliant Indiadrive, putting it at a disadvantage when competing with domestic rivals. As in other countries, pricing is crucial and Mr Brodin suggests buying stock locally could help. ""We are on the move to drive optimal sourcing and find ways with governments and within the company to try to mitigate that."" More locally sourced products, for stores including this new one on the outskirts of Mumbai, could mitigate the impact of tariffs Wherever those products come from, Mr Brodin is forthright about the need to make them in a way that addresses the challenges of climate change and sustainability. ""I actually think Covid is teaching us to take the collective human challenges in a more serious way and a more responsible way,"" he says. He explains that recycling will become ever more important in minimising the impact consumption has on the planet. ""Ikea's mattresses in the future cannot be based on virgin material. We need to find smarter ways. ""We will be more people to share the resources on the planet. So it's both the right thing to do, morally, ethically, but also from a business perspective."" Ikea will not be the only company adhering to these values, he predicts: ""This is not charity, this is the new economy 2.0, the new business model of the world."" Ikea says it is trying to cut the use of raw materials in its products Another headache for many multinationals is how to ensure forced labour is kept out of their supply chains. Arecent BBC investigationraised questions about cotton from China's Xinjiang region, although not that used by Ikea. China's government denies there is any forced labour. The US is among those governments trying to tackle the issue. This week, the Biden administration raised theprospect of new laws,externalto ""enhance corporate accountability"". Mr Brodin agrees with the need for companies to take responsibility: ""Here is an area where we need to work with common standards in the world."" Most Ikea stores around the world have faced a period of closure ""There need to be verifiable methods"" to check supply chains, he adds. Ikea works with external companies to review its own checks and Mr Brodin says the Swedish company is quick to act if necessary. ""Can we guarantee that there is never an accident or a breach in that? No, but if it happens, we will catch it normally ourselves before anybody else does. And we are able to correct it."" Store closures have been another burden for Ikea's boss. In all, 80% of the 445 outlets worldwide have been closed at some point over the last year, but Mr Brodin doesn't think the coronavirus pandemic will change everything about retail forever. Customers like to try before they buy, says Jesper Brodin He says customers still value seeing products for themselves and getting in-store advice. ""Most people still want to sit on the sofa before they buy it."" Mr Brodin is grateful that the company invested heavily in selling online before the pandemic: ""Literally we didn't know how much we would need it. ""Even with that, at the start of the pandemic, there was a period where we thought we would be in the red for the first time in our 75-year history."" In the end, profits fell 29% to $1.7bn (Â£1.2bn) in the year to the end of August. Ikea set to relaunch delayed 'Buy Back' scheme Ikea scraps 'beloved catalogue' after 70 years How Ikea's Billy took over the world The strength of those online sales, Mr Brodin says, led to a ""very interesting discussion. Is it morally right for us to accept furlough [payments for staff wages] when we are actually going to head towards some sort of a profit?"" ""In the end of the day, we decided it was wrong,"" he says, and money was returned to governments in several countries. Mr Brodin senses governments will need to support their economies for a while yet. Large socially-distanced queues formed at Ikea in Nottingham, central England, when it reopened in June ""We are hopeful that autumn will be some sort of return to the new normal,"" Mr Brodin says, but he cautions: ""We need to be prepared for the worst."" However, plans to expand with50 new stores worldwideare not on hold, even though ""Covid-19 has amplified the whole change process"". Those changes include new in-store safety measures, and they may be paying off. In a signal of hope for retailers who have struggled through the pandemic, Mr Brodin says that where government restrictions have been lifted and shops could reopen, ""we were actually surprised by the interest of coming back to stores."" He says: ""In most of our countries, we have more people after Corona visiting us than before.""

Parents worry about lost learning as schools reopen,"The majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school, but two-thirds are concerned about the amount of learning lost. A survey by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals some parents think that their child will never catch-up. It shows parents want policies to promote children's wellbeing as well as their academic learning. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has promised no child's prospects should be ""blighted by the pandemic."" As schools in England prepare to reopen to all pupils on Monday for the first time since early January, 90% of parents say they would send their children back, even if it was not compulsory. Parents are much more confident about children going back to school this time than they were last summer, says the financial think thank, when only two thirds of parents supported the idea of going back into the classroom. Among parents who are still reluctant, health concerns about the pandemic continue to be the most important reason - with nearly half of these parents saying the Covid-19 case rate is the key factor. Nearly 6,000 parents across England were asked their views in the last week of February, as the full reopening of schools was approaching. How will testing work in schools? Schools back 8 March with Covid tests taken at home Summer schools in England part of catch-up plan The youngest pupils have already returned to school in Scotland and Wales. Some primary school pupils in Northern Ireland also return to school on Monday. The survey provides evidence on how parents view the the impact of so much lost time in school. Overall, 65% of primary school parents and 68% of those with secondary school children are concerned that their child has lost out on learning. Among these worried secondary school parents, 9% believe their child's education will never be able to fully recover from the adverse effects the pandemic. The Department for Education recently announced a further Â£700m package to help pupils catch-up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools. Support for catch-up plans is very high among parents, the IFS survey suggests, with over 90% in favour, with tutoring the most popular policy. There is much less support among parents for a longer school day, an extended term or repeating school years, with disadvantaged families less likely to be keen. A large majority of parents (83%) are also in favour of policies to promote children's wellbeing. Most believed that in-class activities - such as arts, creative writing or spending time outdoors - would make the biggest difference. Around a quarter of parents prioritised greater access to mental health services. Christine Farquharson, IFS senior research economist, said: ""While close to half of those concerned think that the damage will be relatively short-lived, one in 10 secondary school parents think their child will never catch up. ""While the tutoring programmes that the government has emphasised are hugely popular with parents, it is hard to believe that the Â£1.7bn currently allocated to the recovery is anywhere near enough to meet the scale of this challenge."" A DfE spokeswoman said: ""We know the pandemic has had a significant impact on children and young people, which is why it's been our priority to get pupils back to face-to-face education. ""Our new Mental Health in Education Action Group will look at how we best support children and young people's mental wellbeing as they return to education settings, in addition to the mental health training we have funded for teachers to help them respond to emotional and mental health pressures.""

Is it morally right for us to accept furlough [payments for staff wages] when we are actually going to head towards some sort of a profit?"" ""In the end of the day, we decided it was wrong,"" he says, and money was returned to governments in several countries. Mr Brodin senses governments will need to support their economies for a while yet. Large socially-distanced queues formed at Ikea in Nottingham, central England, when it reopened in June ""We are hopeful that autumn will be some sort of return to the new normal,"" Mr Brodin says, but he cautions: ""We need to be prepared for the worst."" However, plans to expand with50 new stores worldwideare not on hold, even though ""Covid-19 has amplified the whole change process"". Those changes include new in-store safety measures, and they may be paying off. In a signal of hope for retailers who have struggled through the pandemic, Mr Brodin says that where government restrictions have been lifted and shops could reopen, ""we were actually surprised by the interest of coming back to stores."" He says: ""In most of our countries, we have more people after Corona visiting us than before.""

'How being a delivery man helps my autistic son',"Cal Carr was given a bespoke lanyard by people living in his village A mother has thanked her ""wonderful"" community for giving her autistic son a focus during the coronavirus lockdown. Cal Carr feels he has ""changed"" since starting to deliver groceries and prescriptions to people living in the Vale of Glamorgan village of St Athan. His mother Sarah said gifts and support from neighbours had made him feel needed and hismeltdowns, which had worsened in lockdown, have ""stopped"". ""It's changed me so much, it is so wonderful,"" said Cal, 31. One neighbour gave Cal a hoody printed with 'Cal's Delivery Service' after hearing he wanted to wear a uniform like his siblings. Food delivery driver paying back doctors who saved him 'Without the deliveries my children would starve' 'Why my son and I are still walking to the market even though it's shut' Sarah said for Cal, who also has a severe learning disability, it meant the world. ""Callum likes to feel he's the same as everybody else,"" she said. A neighbour has made Cal leaflets to advertise his service ""His siblings used to wear a uniform [to school] but they didn't have a uniform for his [special] school so for photographs I used to get him a sweatshirt the same colour as his siblings to make him feel the same. ""He wants to be accepted, he wants to be the same as his brothers and his sister, he wants to go out and be working but with his disabilities he's unable to get paid work."" Other neighbours have made Cal a lanyard, ID cards, leaflets and given him a shopping trolley - and he's been given a new trike to help him make deliveries. Cal made his first delivery on 10 January Sarah said life at home with Cal had become very difficult as she said he ""wasn't coping with the lockdown"". ""He got very depressed and didn't want to do anything so we came up with the idea of Cal's Collection to get him out and about really,"" she said. ""To get him away from the four walls."" ""Since Callum started this delivery service it has had a positive impact 100-fold on family life."" A neighbour gave Cal a brand new trike to help him on his deliveries The family, who moved to south Wales from the Midlands two years ago, said they were very grateful for the ""very strong community spirit in St Athan."" ""They've really have taken Callum and ourselves to their hearts,"" Sarah said. ""Callum feels valued and that he has a purpose now, he's happier, he's more positive in mood, he's more helpful, he wants to go out and do the deliveries and prescriptions."" Cal has said the support of his village has made him ""really, really happy"". ""I was really, really fed up,"" he said. ""I needed to get out to do things - I have meltdowns most of the time. I get really, really frustrated and angry. ""I can't understand why changes are happening, different things are happeningâ¦ I can't understand why Covid is here, why it is still going on. I don't understand what I can and can't do."" Autistic people like Callum have brains that works in a different way from others but it is not an illness Cal's customers have been thanking him on his Facebook page. ""Thank you Callum for supporting us through isolation,"" one posted. ""You've been invaluable, you're doing a fantastic job."" Another wrote: ""You are a star."" His family have now set up a second service - Cal's Collection Homeless Service, where he collects unwanted clothes, bedding and shoes and distributes them to people who are homeless or in need.

PM urges caution as first roadmap date approaches,"Boris Johnson has said the country is starting to move towards a sense of ""normality"" as schools in England get ready to open to more pupils on Monday. The PM has urged the public to stick to the rules as the government follows a ""cautious"" approach to easing lockdown. Monday marks the first step of the ""roadmap"" out of national restrictions. But the UK's largest education union has accused the government of failing to put adequate safety measures in place ahead of schools reopening. All pupils in all years can return to schools and colleges in England on Monday, and attendance will be mandatory - meaning they should not miss school without a valid reason. However, secondary schools have been told that year groups can return on different days over the first week to allow for Covid testing. And pupils who are shielding have been asked to remain at home for a bit longer. How will testing work in schools? Is school mask and testing policy flawed? How fresh air makes school safer Earlier this week, a survey of more than 930 head teachers found 76% of secondary schoolshave planned a staggered return next weekin order to facilitate Covid tests. In 7% of schools, it suggested, this will stretch into a second week. Dr Mary Bousted, joint general secretary of the National Education Union (NEU), said secondary and post-16 education leaders have struggled to get parental consent for the testing of pupils and said there needed to be a bigger ministerial push to encourage take up. ""Ministers had two months to make schools and colleges safer but failed to put the necessary measures in place to achieve this,"" she said. The NEU has called for a phased return to schools in England - similar to the process in Scotland and Wales, where whole year groups are returning separated by several weeks. Implementing the testing system was resulting in a ""de facto phased return"" which should be allowed to continue ""beyond the period necessary"", Dr Bousted said. Ges Smith, head teacher of Jo Richardson Community School in east London, told BBC Breakfast that testing its 1,600 students would be a ""military-style operation"". The school tested its sixth form pupils on Friday and will begin a phased return over the next week, with 6,000 tests carried out over the next fortnight. He added that some children ""haven't been out the house since January"" and would have high levels of anxiety about returning, ""so that transition back to school is enormously important"". Students in England are being asked to take regular Covid tests According tothe PM's roadmap, the second part of stage one - which will allow outdoor gatherings of either six people or two households - is due on 29 March. Further lifting of the rules will then happen if certain conditions are met, with shops possibly allowed to open by 12 April and all restrictions potentially lifted by 21 June. Mr Johnson stressed the government was being careful ""so that we do not undo the progress we have made so far"" and urged people to take up the vaccine and get tested when necessary. The PM said it was due to the ""determination"" of everyone in the country ""that we can start moving closer to a sense of normality"", praising the ""truly national effort"" against Covid. His comments come amid concerns that pupils may be forced to self-isolate unnecessarily because of inaccurate Covid test results. Downing Street said nearly 57 million lateral flow test kits have already been delivered to schools and colleges as part of the rollout. The tests involve taking a swab of the nose and throat. The sample is then inserted into a tube of liquid and gives a result within 30 minutes. Students will be tested for the virus three times in the first two weeks of school. After that they will be given two tests each week to use at home. Research suggests that the lateral flow devices can offer a false positive result between one and three times for every 1,000 tests carried out. Professor Sheila Bird, a member of the Royal Statistical Society, said it was ""very likely"" a lateral flow test could give a false positive reading. She said every positive lateral flow test of a pupil should be checked with a more reliable PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test to ensure it is accurate. This is being done for tests that are done in people's homes, but not for those carried out in school. Meanwhile,a survey has shownthat the majority of parents in England will be happy to send their children back to school. But two-thirds are concerned about the amount of learning lost. The research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies reveals some parents think that their child will never catch up. The Department for Education has announceda Â£700m package to help pupils catch up on lost learning, including tutoring and summer schools. But Kate Green, Labour's shadow education secretary, said the funding does ""not make up for the learning and time with friends that children have lost"", adding there is no specific mention of supporting children's mental health or wellbeing. Asked by Sky News' Sophy Ridge whether plans to help pupils catch up could include shortening summer holidays, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the government was looking at ""a whole range of different proposals"", including a five-term year, changes to holidays and lengthening the school day. LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Secondary school and college students are also being asked to wear face coverings in classrooms, where social distancing cannot be maintained, as an additional safety measure set for review at Easter. But the measure is not mandatory, and in primary schools pupils are not being required to wear face coverings when they return to face-to-face lessons. Nor will they be tested. England's chief inspector of schools Amanda Spielman said she hoped mask wearing would only be needed for ""a short time"" so children could return for the summer term able to see everyone's faces fully. There are different rules on schools across England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, as the UK's devolved nations have the power to set their own coronavirus restrictions. The youngest pupils have already returned to school in Scotland and Wales, while some primary school pupils in Northern Ireland also return to school on Monday. All secondary school pupils in Scotlandwill return to the classroom part-time from 15 March. In Wales, some secondary school pupilswill return on 15 March, with all secondary-age pupils back in the classroom full-time from 12 April. Some older pupils in Northern Irelandwill return on 22 March. THAT PETER CROUCH PODCAST:Crouchy and the boys discuss a footballerâs entourage...
