"Double capital gains tax, urges government review","The amount of tax levied on capital gains could be raised by billions of pounds, according to a new report. About Â£14bn could be raised by cutting exemptions and doubling rates, according to the review, which was commissioned by Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The main losers would wealthy people who own second homes or assets not shielded from tax. It comes as Chancellor Rishi Sunak looks for ways to cover the enormous costs of the coronavirus pandemic. In September, he reassured recently-elected Tory MPs there would not be a ""horror show of tax rises with no end in sight"". The Office for Tax Simplification (OTS), however, found that many current features of capital gains tax ""can distort behaviour"" as people try to lower their bills. No tax rise 'horror show', Sunak tells Tory MPs Capital gains tax review âstandard practiceâ The government-run body says the tax, levied at 10% for basic-rate taxpayers and 20% for higher-rate taxpayers, could be doubled if it were brought in line with income tax. Capital gains tax is the levy you pay on the profits - or gain - that you make when you sell, give away or dispose of something you own. For residential property, for example, it is charged at 18% or 28% for basic-rate taxpayers and higher-rate taxpayers respectively. The report also suggests the amount raised could also be boosted by cutting exemptions. At the moment, the first Â£12,300 of capital gains is exempt. About 50,000 taxpayers reported profits narrowly under that threshold last year. On Wednesday, the body said that the current rules were ""counter-intuitive"" and created ""odd incentives"".""The disparity in rates between capital gains tax and income tax can distort business and family decision-making and creates an incentive for taxpayers to arrange their affairs in ways that effectively re-characterise income as capital gains,"" the report said. Before dropping your jaw in horror that the Office of Tax Simplification is suggesting capital gains tax could be brought more in line with income tax - or doubled - pause for a second. In most years, most of us won't pay it. In fact, even if the number of people paying it trebled, it probably still wouldn't be you. More than 31 million people pay tax on their income, raising Â£180bn in 2017/18. By contrast, only 265,000 pay tax on capital gains - the profits they make when they sell assets such as shares or bonds. The first Â£12,300 is exempt; and because you can control when you sell an asset and realise a gain, many - some 50,000 - can arrange their affairs so any gain they made comes just in under the threshold. And when they do pay capital gains tax, it's at half the rate of income tax. The OTS report says most gains are concentrated among relatively few taxpayers, who are paying ""proportionately less"" tax than everyone else. In other words, the light capital gains tax regime aggravates the already yawning inequality of wealth between the few who can actually make capital gains and the many - who will rarely or never do so. The independent tax adviser also suggested scrapping the rule which allows capital gains tax to be wiped on inherited assets, as well as removing relief for investors selling shares in unlisted companies who have had them for a minimum of three years. If the recommendations are taken on by the government, thousands of taxpayers may face higher rates on the profits made on selling second homes or investments. Mr Sunak commissioned the report in July, but does not have to accept its findings. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""The government's priority right now is supporting jobs and the economy. ""We thank the OTS for their independent report which will be considered in due course.""

"Northerners prefer football to ballet, MP says","Blackburn or ballet? Jake Berry's remarks have come under fire People in the south of England enjoy opera and ballet but football clubs are what matter to those living further north, a Conservative MP has said. Former minister Jake Berry made the comparison as he warned ""northern culture"" is being hit by Covid-19. He pressed the government to intervene to ""save"" football clubs. But his comments were criticised by the Northern Ballet as it perpetuates ""tropes that culture in the north is of less value than that in London"". The former northern powerhouse minister compared Accrington Stanley to the Royal Ballet as he insisted action is required from Westminster to help protect clubs that are the ""cornerstone"" of communities. The former minister said ""northern culture"" was being hit by Covid-19 Mr Berry, who made the comment as MPs debated support for the economy in the north of England, said: ""First of all is the hit that northern culture has taken from this Covid crisis. ""For many people who live in London and the south of England, things like the opera house and ballet will be at the heart of their culture. ""But for many of us in the north it is our local football club - our Glyndebourne or Royal Ballet or Royal Opera House or Royal Shakespeare Company will be Blackburn Rovers, Accrington Stanley, Barrow, Carlisle or Sunderland. He added the ""time has come where the government must seek to intervene to unblock this to save local football clubs across the north of England, many of which are the cornerstone of our communities and at the heart of our culture"". Treasury minister Kemi Badenoch did not address Mr Berry's football plea in her reply to the debate, acknowledging the north of England has been a ""hotbed"" of energy, ideas and creativity for centuries. Responding on Twitter, Northern Ballet said it was ""disappointed"" by the MP's comments while other social media users criticised Mr Berry for his remarks. Allow Twitter content?

New Yorker reporter fired for exposing himself on Zoom,"Mr Toobin has apologised to his wife, friends and colleagues A star reporter has been fired by the New Yorker magazine after he exposed himself on a staff Zoom call. Jeffrey Toobin, 60, who is also senior legal analyst for CNN, confirmed in a tweet that he had been sacked. The New Yorker's parent company Conde Nast wrote in an email to staff: ""I want to assure everyone that we take workplace matters seriously."" After he was suspended last month Mr Toobin said he had believed himself to be off-camera during the incident. Vice News, which broke the initial story, reported that senior colleagues had seen Mr Toobin masturbating while apparently on a separate video call. Allow Twitter content?

CondÃ© Nast's chief people officer, Stan Duncan, wrote in a note to staff quoted by US media that as a result of their internal investigation Mr Toobin was ""no longer affiliated with our company"". He added: ""We are committed to fostering an environment where everyone feels respected and upholds our standards of conduct."" The incident happened on 15 October during an election simulation involving the New Yorker and WNYC radio. Mr Toobin was immediately suspended. In a statement to Vice last month, he said: ""I made an embarrassingly stupid mistake, believing I was off-camera."" He apologised to his family, friends and colleagues. ""I believed I was not visible on Zoom,"" he told Vice. ""I thought no-one on the Zoom call could see me. I thought I had muted the Zoom video."" Vice quoted two anonymous sources who were at the meeting as saying they had witnessed the incident. The election simulation involved prominent New Yorker figures playing politicians, such as President Donald Trump and his Democratic rival Joe Biden. Mr Toobin was representing the courts. During a break in proceedings, according to Vice's sources, Mr Toobin appeared to be on a different video call but was seen moments later on camera touching his penis.

New York imposes 'last chance' virus restrictionsUS hospital admissions hit record levels as New York City warns it is on the cusp of a second wave.US & Canada,"Late-night gatherings have been identified as a key source of infection spread in New York New York has introduced new restrictions aimed at curbing coronavirus, with Mayor Bill de Blasio warning it was the city's ""last chance"" to stop a second wave. Bars, restaurants and gyms must close by 22:00 and people can only meet in groups of 10 or less. The US is seeing a surge in coronavirus - a record 65,368 Americans were in hospital on Wednesday. The Covid Tracking Project also reported a record 144,270 new cases. An average of over 900 people a day are now dying with the disease. More than a million new cases in November pushed the total confirmed cases to over 10 million nationally, with 233,080 deaths so far. The US has been seeing more than 100,000 new cases per day over the last eight days in what experts say may be a worse outbreak than those seen in the spring and summer. Tracking the global pandemic: Where has been hit hardest? How will this endless US election end? How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Experts warn hospitals across the country could soon be overwhelmed. On Wednesday a member of President-elect Joe Biden's Covid-19 advisory panel said a four to six week lockdown could bring the pandemic under control. This video can not be played Fauci: ""We have got to double down"" to fight Covid Dr Michael Osterholm said that the government could borrow enough money to cover lost income for businesses during a shutdown. ""We're seeing a national and global Covid surge, and New York is a ship on the Covid tide,"" state Governor Andrew Cuomo said on Wednesday. New measures come into effect on Friday affecting hospitality after Mr Cuomo said contact tracing identified late-night gatherings as key virus spreaders in the state. Allow Twitter content?

If the rate of spread of infection continued to rise, Mayor Blasio said the New York City's public school system would close and children would begin online classes. ""This is our last chance to stop a second wave. We can do it, but we have to act now,"" Mr de Blasio tweeted. New York City was badly hit by the virus earlier this year when nearly 18,000 people died with Covid-19 in March, April and May,according to the city's Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.,external States across the US have broken new case records this week with Texas becoming the first state to hit one million total cases on Tuesday. If Texas were a separate country, it would rank 11th in the world for most cases. Other states, including Illinois, Wisconsin, Minnesota, California and Florida, have also seen numbers rise. CBS News reports 15 states saw the numbers of patients in hospital due to the virus double in the last month. Some hospitals, such as in Idaho and Missouri, have had to turn patients away because they ran out of room. A queue for testing in California State leaders have been re-imposing pandemic restrictions as a result. Residents of Wisconsin and Nevada have been urged to stay at home for two weeks and in Minnesota, bars and restaurants must shut by 22:00. On Tuesday, Mr Osterholm warned of a ""perfect storm"". Speaking to CBS This Morning, Mr Osterholm said there was ""no question that our hospitals are about to be overrun"". He noted ""the darkest days of this pandemic between now and next spring"", before the vaccine arrives. Mr Osterholm, who heads the infectious disease research centre at the University of Minnesota, said during the summer spike after the Labour Day national holiday, new cases rose to 32,000 a day. ""Now we're running in the 120- to 130,000 cases a day,"" he said. ""Do not be at all surprised when we hit 200,000 cases a day."" The same day, US infectious disease chief Dr Anthony Fauci offered some hopeful news. He said the new Covid vaccine by Pfizer was expected to go through an emergency authorisation process in the next week or so. Human trials suggest it is 90% effective. This video can not be played How close are we to Covid immunisation? Dr Fauci told MSNBC: ""I'm going to look at the data, but I trust Pfizer, I trust the [Food and Drug Administration]. These are colleagues of mine for decades, the career scientists."" Amid the ongoing outbreak, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has updated its research around masks, saying that wearing one not only protects others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. The CDC referenced several studies, including one case where two Covid-positive hair stylists interacted with 139 clients - but of the 67 clients researchers tested, none developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. Another study looking into the outbreak aboard the USS Theodore Roosevelt aircraft carrier found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said.

Students to go home in evacuation-style operationThey are being asked to travel in the seven days after the national lockdown in England ends.Family & Education,"This video can not be played The BBC's Dan Johnson takes a look at one of the first university testing facilities at De Montfort University in Leicester An evacuation-style plan will aim to get students home safely for Christmas. Students in England are to be allocated departure dates during a ""student travel window"" between 3 and 9 December, to minimise the risk of them spreading Covid-19. In Wales, they are being asked totravel by 9 December at the latest. Many will be offered rapid result tests, while teaching will move online from 3 December in Wales and 9 December in England. The Scottish government wants as many as possible of the 80,000 or so students going home for Christmas to be offered voluntary tests before they travel. Northern Ireland is expected to publish plans for students' return in the coming days. One union said the plan for a week-long travel window in England ""leaves little room for error"". Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said the government chose the week after the four-week national lockdown in England ends on 2 December because ""students will pose a much reduced risk to their loved ones and their community"". How will students go home for Christmas? I am desperate to go home, says worried student She told BBC Breakfast the timing means that anyone who develops symptoms on 9 December will still ""have enough time to isolate and then return home for Christmas"". Ms Donelan confirmed that students will not need to have a negative test result before travelling home. Students are strongly advised to travel during the travel window. ""This is a choice. If they choose to leave after [9 December] they will run the risk of potentially not getting home for Christmas with that isolation window,"" Ms Donelan said. Jiya Saggu, 20, istorn between desperately wanting to go homeand wanting to keep her medically vulnerable family safe. Her 15-year-old sister had a kidney transplant some years ago and still has a weakened immune system, as does her mother who has rheumatoid arthritis. Also her uncle, one of the earliest cases of Covid in England, spent weeks on a ventilator before finally recovering. She says: ""That really brought home the fact that if any of my family get this virus, it would be devastating."" Reading the plans in the news to test students, before helping them get home, brought the third year University of Durham student ""a great sense of relief because it is a possible way out"". ""I think having designated days for people to leave may be a little difficult, especially within a week,"" she says. ""But if it means I can get home safely then that's all that matters."" Dr Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said allowing one week for around one million students to travel in England ""leaves little room for error"". ""If the government instead told universities to move online now it would provide much more time to stagger the movement of students and better protect the health of staff, students and their wider communities,"" she said. The Department for Education said universities in England would now start working with their local public health teams and local transport operators to manage the mass movement in a staggered fashion. They should soon begin contacting students with allocated travel days, and some may hire coaches to help with the transportation. UK coach operator National Express said it was talking to universities about putting on extra services to help get students home. The Department for Education insisted there was enough capacity on the nation's public transport system for the evacuation-style plan to take place safely, adding that many students would have their own transport or be collected by parents. Ms Donelan described the roll-out of rapid result tests to as many students as possible in England as a ""complementary element"" to the travel window. She said the government wants to ""facilitate as much testing as possible"", but will target universities in areas with higher infection rates and proportions of vulnerable students. The distribution is set to begin at the end of November. Any student who tests positive will be required to self-isolate for 10 days under current guidelines. Scottish higher education minister Richard Lochhead confirmed Scotland would be part of the UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. He said students would be advised to only go out for essential reasons, including exercise, for two weeks before going home for Christmas and added there would be ""staggered and early departures"" home. He also said Scottish universities would be asked to make adjustments to in-person teaching and assessments to allow students time to get home at the end of term. The Welsh Government said students in Wales will be offered new rapid turnaroundtests 24 hours before they go. De Montfort and Durham universitieshave been running pilot projects for rapid Covid testing, including identifying those who might be infectious but have no symptoms. The""lateral flow tests"" give results in about 20 minutes, without the need for a lab. Where will mass testing be available? Wales asks students going home to travel by 9 Dec Prof Jacqui Ramagge, executive dean of the science faculty at Durham University, said students who receive a positive test result from these then undertake a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test - the type you get in NHS centres -  to confirm their status. That is because the PCR tests are ""the ones that are legally required,"" she added. She said mass testing of students is ""absolutely essential"". ""So many people in the age group that our students are in are asymptomatic carriers of the virus, and so if we only test those who are symptomatic, we miss a large number of people,"" she said. An estimated 40,000 students have become infected with coronavirus whilst in their university towns. This sparked concerns about infected students bringing the virus back home with them, thus accelerating the spread of the disease. There were suggestions that students might have to remain at university for an extra two-week period, so they could isolate, before returning home. But this was criticised by the National Union of Students (NUS) as likely to have a negative effect on student mental health. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: ""The mass movement of students across the country at the end of term presents a really significant challenge."" University lecturers and the NUS had warned of the risks of bringing 1.2 million students back to universities since the summer, and urged ministers to move courses online as the default. But the government had defended the continued use of face-to-face teaching. NUS president Larissa Kennedy welcomed the plans for voluntary tests and urged students to get one. ""We are glad to see this concession from government and we really do think students will be seeking to take these tests and to do this safely,"" she told the BBC. TESTING:What tests are available?

Wales asks students going home to travel by 9 Dec Prof Jacqui Ramagge, executive dean of the science faculty at Durham University, said students who receive a positive test result from these then undertake a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test - the type you get in NHS centres -  to confirm their status. That is because the PCR tests are ""the ones that are legally required,"" she added. She said mass testing of students is ""absolutely essential"". ""So many people in the age group that our students are in are asymptomatic carriers of the virus, and so if we only test those who are symptomatic, we miss a large number of people,"" she said. An estimated 40,000 students have become infected with coronavirus whilst in their university towns. This sparked concerns about infected students bringing the virus back home with them, thus accelerating the spread of the disease. There were suggestions that students might have to remain at university for an extra two-week period, so they could isolate, before returning home. But this was criticised by the National Union of Students (NUS) as likely to have a negative effect on student mental health. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: ""The mass movement of students across the country at the end of term presents a really significant challenge."" University lecturers and the NUS had warned of the risks of bringing 1.2 million students back to universities since the summer, and urged ministers to move courses online as the default. But the government had defended the continued use of face-to-face teaching. NUS president Larissa Kennedy welcomed the plans for voluntary tests and urged students to get one. ""We are glad to see this concession from government and we really do think students will be seeking to take these tests and to do this safely,"" she told the BBC. TESTING:What tests are available?

"Three members of one NI family die with Covid-19A man in his 50s, who worked for the Belfast Trust, was one of those who died in the past week.Northern Ireland","Three members of one family in Northern Ireland have died with Covid-19 in the past two weeks, the BBC has learned. They include a man in his early 50s, who worked for the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Staff at the trust have paid tribute to him, saying he was a dedicated member of the health service. Belfast Trust senior manager Dr Paul Glover said his colleague, who died on Wednesday, was ""a very valued member of staff"". ""I'd like to offer my condolences to the family one of our members of staff who sadly passed away with Covid-19 today. ""I am sure all of his colleagues and those who have worked with him will feel this right at this moment in time."" SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly also offered condolences to the family of  those who died. ""It is just unimaginable,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I cannot begin to imagine how the surviving members of the family come to terms with it and I do hope and pray that they get the help and support that they need."" Mrs Kelly appealed to the executive to ""take account of the families who are suffering, who have suffered, those that are in hospital and the staff who are trying their best to actually keep people safe and to save their lives"". News of the health care worker's death comes as hospitals across Northern Ireland continue to report pressures. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, with 791 more people testing positive for the virus. The number of hospital inpatients with the virus has increased from 420 to 441. In the Republic of Ireland, there have been two Covid-19 related deaths and 362 new cases of the disease reported in the past 24 hours. It brings the total number of deaths there to 1,965. Forty-seven men and women are in ICU in Northern Ireland and 35 of them are on a ventilator. Dr Glover, who specialises in critical care, said there must be a ""sustained and ongoing"" decrease in community transmission rates before any relaxation of restrictions is considered. Stormont in deadlock over NI Covid restrictions DUP blocks 14-day NI Covid restrictions extension ""Our healthcare system is very much under pressure and is being stretched at this moment,"" he said. ""What we absolutely need is a sustained and ongoing decrease in transmission rates to stop the hospitals being overwhelmed, to take the pressure off staff and to allow us to be able to treat other conditions. ""We are not at the stage yet where community transmission is at such a low level as is safe to release restrictions."" Dr Glover added that ""everyone has a role to play"" to ensure that Covid-19 numbers are ""stamped down"" and ""kept down"". ""This is not just about government guidelines. It's also about public behaviours,"" he said. Health unions are also asking why restrictions would be relaxed, given the number of deaths in recent weeks. Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, Dr Tom Black, said: ""You need restrictions to reduce the transmission of the infection, to reduce the demands on hospitals."" Dr Black said demands on NI hospitals ""are nearly overwhelming hospital services"". Meanwhile, cases in care homes have also increased, with 143 facilities dealing with outbreaks - over 100 more than this time last month. Robin Swann told MLAs that staff, through no fault of their own, were carrying the virus - another reason, he said, for maintaining restrictions.

"Stormont in deadlock over NI Covid restrictionsThe executive adjourns without any announcement, as the clock ticks towards the expiration of NI's laws.Northern IrelandComments","Pubs and restaurants were among businesses forced to close in Northern Ireland on 16 October The Stormont executive remains deadlocked over what to do when the coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland end, in just over a day's time. Ministers met on Wednesday night to try to resolve differences, but the meeting was adjourned shortly before 20:30 GMT without any announcement. The regulations saw much of NI's economy placed under tight measures on 16 October. Ministers will meet on Thursday morning, hours before the laws expire. The Department of Health reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, with 791 more people testing positive for the virus. Earlier, a proposal from the health minister to extend all measures for one more week was blocked by the DUP. The DUP supports a partial reopening of hospitality and close contact services from Friday. It put forward a separate proposal suggesting this, but it was also voted down at the executive. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, has suggested a compromise proposal which would have kept the restrictions in place for one more week and this will be discussed by ministers on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, Health Minister Robin Swann warned his ministerial colleagues that doing nothing ""needs to be avoided"" at all costs, and that some mitigations must be retained. But the proposal fell after the DUP triggered a cross-community vote, effectively giving them a veto over the plan. Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? This can be deployed by any three ministers to require cross-community support on a particular matter, effectively giving a party with enough ministers in the power-sharing executive a veto. Mr Swann's original proposal calling for a two-week extension wasblocked by the DUP on Tuesday. Late-night talks resulting in stalemate at Stormont aren't exactly a rare occurrence. If past experience is anything to go by, usually the longer discussions go on, the more time there is for opposing positions to become entrenched. History seems to be repeating itself except unlike with previous deadlocks, this time ministers are grappling with the ongoing challenge of a global pandemic. Both lives and livelihoods are immediately on the line. Throughout the crisis, the executive has consisted of five political parties in the power-sharing coalition, where reaching consensus has required a delicate balance of competing party interests and conflicting policy decisions. Read more here. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance had previously said they would support a two-week extension of all restrictions. Mr Weir claimed Sinn FÃ©in had changed its stance over relaxing restrictions and claimed inter-party agreement could have been reached earlier. ""I think people want certainty and I hope there can be a sensible compromise that can be reached,"" he added. ""It's important to stress that poverty can kill as well as Covid-19."" Michelle O'Neill says her party will be guided by public health advice On Sunday, Ms O'Neill had suggesteda partial and graduated reopening of some sectors was being considered by ministers. In a statement on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said: ""Last night, Sinn FÃ©in, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party voted in favour of the health minister's proposals to extend restrictions. The DUP blocked those proposals."" First Minister Arlene Foster told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that any decision on the restrictions must be balanced and protect both hospitals and livelihoods. Northern Ireland was facing a ""mental health tsunami"" if the economy was not considered, as well as health advice, she said. ""There will be excess deaths if we continue with the restrictions or if we take no decisions at all,"" the DUP leader said. Arlene Foster said that she would have liked a decision much sooner ""but we are in a five-party coalition and that brings challenges with it"" ""Poverty has its own health outcomes... we are facing a mental health tsunami in relation to the pressure that we are putting on families as they come up to Christmas."" BBC News NI has seen the latest advice from Health Minister Robin Swann, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young, issued to ministers on Wednesday. It is understood Mr Swann stated that a ""do nothing"" approach, allowing the regulations to expire, is the worst possible scenario and should be avoided at all costs. Modelling data from health officials to the executive says that reopening some sectors, or allowing the regulations to expire, mean it is ""more likely than not"" that further interventions may be required before Christmas. The Â£400m figure presented by Mrs Dodds comes from a study by Stormont's Department for the Economywhich looks at lost output,external. It includes direct and indirect losses along with the costs of a potential delay to economic recovery, and comes with a significant margin of error. The department has also produced a second estimate using an economic model built by the Fraser of Allander Institute, which estimates the lost output to be about Â£430m. Restaurateur Martin Murphy is not hopeful that his businesses will open this weekend. He said he felt ""left in limbo"". Hair and beauty salons closed on Friday 16 October - it is thought they could reopen with some mitigations ""We were supposed to open on Friday but as yet, there's no planning. There's no way we could open on Friday - regardless of what the executive decides, it's still off the table for us,"" said Mr Murphy. ""We've been closed now for coming up to four weeks, there's been no grants in our bank account whatsoever."" One of the proposals brought by Mrs Dodds would allow close contact businesses to re-open on a ""one in, one out"" basis by appointment only. Hairdresser Lynette Murray already operates on that policy and asked why she was forced to close in the first place. ""I would have assumed there would have been some sort of risk assessment, but everyone was put in the same category,"" she said. ""I think it's really unfair. We are in the position where we don't have the luxury of getting paid if we don't go to work. ""We have applied for grants but nothing has gone into our bank accounts.""

"More 'murder hornet' nests likely to be found in USAround 200 queen hornets were found in a nest extracted in Washington in October, scientists say.","Asian giant hornets are not native to the Pacific North-West and kill honeybees Washington is unlikely to have seen its last Asian giant hornets, the state's agricultural department has said, after scientists found 200 queens in one nest. The nest - the first in the US - of the so-called murder hornetswas captured with a vacuum from a tree in October. Researchers believe more queens - which are responsible for establishing colonies - could remain at large. But they are confident the population can be brought under control. Asian giant hornets are an invasive species in the Pacific North-West. They target honeybees, which pollinate crops. The insect, which is native to Japan and South Korea, can slaughter a bee colony in a matter of hours. They can also spit venom and inflict numerous powerful stings on humans. Scientists in Washington extracted the US's first nest of Asian giant hornets in October ""We believe there are additional nests. There is no way to be certain we got them all,"" Sven-Erik Spichiger, who researches insects with the Washington State Department of Agriculture, said in a press conference on Tuesday. The nest was extracted from a tree in the city of Blaine, close to the Canadian border, on 24 October. Scientists then quarantined the 22cm (9 in) diameter nest and after 24 hours were able to open it to examine the contents. Inside they found evidence of almost 500 insects at various stages of life including 112 worker hornets and close to 200 queens. ""It's possible some [queens] emerged before we did the extraction. There is no way of knowing how many more,"" Mr Spichiger said, explaining that three queens were found in the local area after scientists had removed the nest. But he said they had arrived ""in the nick of time"" to prevent the majority of queens from leaving the nest and mating. ""Frankly we are encouraged because of the number of queens we were able to count and kill,"" he said. Queen hornets go on to establish new colonies when they mate with a male and successfully hibernate over the winter season. When they wake up in spring, a small portion go on to establish nests. Mr Spichiger said it was likely that the insects arrived in the Pacific North-West as part of international commerce. ""We will never know how they got here...but it could have been a vehicle, wood chips, hay bales,"" he explained. A nest was destroyed in Vancouver Island in Canada in December last year.,external The Washington State Department of Agriculture is committed to eradicating the invasive species from the region, he added. Asian giant hornets ""are not going to hunt you down and murder you"", Mr Spichiger explained, but that if a person were to walk into a nest, their life would be ""probably in danger"". Around 40 people are killed annually by the hornets in Asia,according to the Smithsonian museum in Washington DC,external.

Testing plan to allow students home for ChristmasUniversity students will be allowed to travel home if they return two negative tests for Covid-19.Scotland,"Students could be allowed home for Christmas if they test negative twice University students are to be allowed to return home for Christmas in Scotland if they return two negative Covid-19 tests before travelling. Universities minister Richard Lochhead said up to 80,000 students are expected to travel home at the end of term. Dates for courses ending are due to be staggered to make sure there is not a ""great surge of movement"" in December. And a testing system is being set up UK-wide to ensure students do not carry the virus across the country. People will be given two tests, five days apart, and those who test negative on both occasions will be allowed to travel. Those who return a positive result would have to self-isolate, although it is hoped this would end in time for them to go home before the festive period. Once students are home, they will need to abide by the same restrictions on household gatherings and meetings as everyone else - but there will be no special rules for students at home. How will university students go home for Christmas 'Staggered return' for students after Christmas Student Covid tests for Christmas from 30 November Mr Lochhead told MSPs that students would be advised to ""voluntarily reduce their social mixing"" for two weeks before going home, only going out for essential reasons. He said tests ""cannot tell us with certainty that someone is Covid-free"" because people may be incubating the disease, saying it was ""vital for students to continue to follow all of the other measures in place"". And he added that work was ongoing to work out how students should return to universities after Christmas, saying lessons must be learned from outbreaks at the start of term in August. He said: ""It is clear that the return after the new year will not be normal and we will work with the sector to offer as much clarity for students and staff as we can in the coming weeks."" Under the plans students will be tested twice five days apart Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, said the testing programme would involve up to 65,000 students living in halls and student accommodation. He told BBC radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that lessons had been learned from thespike in casesat the start of the academic year. He said: ""If you are a student who is going home for Christmas it gives that extra assurance to you, and to the people that you are going home to, that you are not bringing the virus home with you."" Mr Sim added that some in-person teaching on campuses would end early on 30 November to ensure there was no ""surge of movement"" of students. Many universities are, however, anticipating more students than usual will remain in university accommodation over the holidays. In particular, they are aware many overseas students may be unable to return home or may be reluctant to risk travelling in case they need to quarantine once they return to the UK. In recent weeks, some students have claimed they could have remained at home as their lectures and tutorials are mostly taking place online. However, universities have argued students still have access to certain facilities which they could not use from home. Matt Crilly, NUS Scotland president, said students deserved the right to return home for the winter break and he wanted to see a coherent strategy from the Scottish government that allowed students to return home safely, while avoiding mass outbreaks. ""Many students rely on the support networks offered by their friends and families and going home to see them over the Christmas period can be critical for their mental health and wellbeing,"" Mr Crilly said. ""NUS Scotland is calling for a clear plan that has ample lead time, with a strategy including the use of mass testing, staggered departure dates and compassion. ""However, there will also be many students whose halls are their only home and others who will choose not to return home this festive period. We want to see the Scottish government offering additional support to student associations to ensure all students have access to facilities including catering (even if they are in non-catered halls), access to post rooms and mental health support.""

"Students going home should travel by 9 DecemberStudents should take Covid tests 24 hours before traveling, with new testing facilities set up.Wales politics","Students in Wales returning home for Christmas are being asked to travel by 9 December at the latest. They will be offered new rapid turnaround tests 24 hours before leaving, the Welsh Government said. Travelling home later than 9 December will be allowed if they need to self-isolate following a positive test. It follows asimilar announcement in England, where students are being given a week to travel home after lockdown there ends. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Many students will wish to return home for the Christmas break and I'm pleased to confirm arrangements to enable that."" She warned that no-one should travel if they have symptoms, a positive test or if they have been asked to self-isolate by a contact tracer. The timing means students can complete quarantine and be home by Christmas Eve, the minister said, but she asked students to ""stay put"" and not return home until the first week of December. How will students go home for Christmas? Covid tests for Christmas from 30 November Students tear down 'prison-like' halls fencing The Welsh Government said new Covid-19 lateral flow tests will be provided to students who are travelling home. Universities have seen a number of outbreaks since students returned in the autumn though Ms Williams said there had been a ""steady decline"" in recent days. Opposition parties broadly welcomed the announcement, although the Welsh Conservatives said testing should be for ""university life, not just for Christmas"". Plaid Cymru called for ""comprehensive guidance"" for the return of students in New Year, to include remote and blended learning to ""ensure their safety"". Lily Scourfield says she wants to keep her mum safe at Christmas Lily Scourfield, 22, a Cardiff University medical student, said she wants to keep her mother safe ahead of what could be ""one of our last Christmases together"". ""My home is in Cardiff but I live in a student house, my mum's got cancer so she's in the most vulnerable category,"" she said. ""Therefore for me, I need to 100% know that I'm safe, perhaps with access to two tests before I even go home. ""[Mum is] sort of torn about it really because she wants me to be home for Christmas - that's her opinion, but I just want to keep her safe more than anything."" She said students ""obviously"" want to be with their families. ""I think there's a sort of common sentiment,"" he said ""I think they [students] don't want to bring any Covid or anything nasty to their families but they really want - from a sort of compassionate point of view - want to be with their families for Christmas."" Students at Welsh universities planning to travel home for the holidays are being asked to: Minimise their social contacts before the end of term Get a test, ""ideally within 24 hours"" before they travel Plan to travel no later than 9 December Familiarise themselves with university plans for ending in-person teaching and arrangements to ensure they can leave campus safely New facilities that can test people without symptoms will be available at ""participating universities in Wales"" within the next few weeks, the Welsh Government said. A spokesman said ministers are aiming for ""all universities to participate"". Ms Williams said it is hoped the new testing programme will begin in the next couple of weeks. Kirsty Williams said there had been a ""steady decline"" in Covid cases at university Discussions are still going on with universities and other governments on allowing students to return to universities after Christmas, a Welsh Government press conference heard. ""Those talks continue, but we're very much looking, not only to sending students home safely before Christmas, but welcoming them back to university, after the holidays,"" said Ms Williams. The minister again rejected calls for students to get a refund after a Covid-disrupted term. ""I appreciate that the experience this term has been a challenging one in many, many ways, but at this stage we don't have plans to ask universities to do either of those things."" The four governments of the UK have worked together on the issue, the Welsh Government said, adding it would contact Welsh students at universities elsewhere in the UK. Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said it will ""no doubt be welcome news for students who will want to be home for Christmas and for families who will be glad to see them return home after a difficult term"". But she added: ""Wales needs not just a clear plan for allowing students home for Christmas but also comprehensive guidance on their return to university in the New Year - including ensuring remote and blended learning to ensure their safety."" Suzy Davies of the Welsh Conservatives said she was ""pleased to see that Wales will broadly follow suit"" with the announcement in England ""and introduce a similar plan here giving similar reassurance to students and their families"". ""A wholly online experience is also a deterrent and raises questions about 'value for money', which Welsh Conservatives have raised before, and so testing should be for university life, not just for Christmas."" Rhian Thomas tested positive for coronavirus while at university in Exeter Rhian Thomas, 20, a third year history student from Swansea, is studying at Exeter University and lives in a six-bed house. ""This news has been a long time coming,"" she said. ""We were really glad to hear it because there was a lot of 'what do we do, what don't we do' because there's a lot of people at who are arguably more vulnerable than we are as students. ""There were many conversations as a house... there were even conversations on the possibility of us staying here for Christmas."" But she said there was a lack of guidance on how the mass testing will take place and how they should travel home. Ellie Cooper (L) and Caitlin Allen were both planning to go home early First year Cardiff University students Ellie Cooper and Caitlin Allen were already planning to return to their respective homes before the ""reassuring"" announcement was made. ""My plan was always to leave early in December, but I was going to take a test first because I've been so paranoid about bringing anything back,"" said 19-year-old Ellie, from Taunton in Somerset. ""I think it's a good idea what the government are putting forward. The only issue is a test is only as good as the day you take it."" Caitlin is returning to Abu Dhabi early as she has provide a negative test to travel and then quarantine on arrival. She said: ""It [testing] has its pros and cons but it is what it is, and if it means we can go home, be with our families and keep as many people safe as possible, then as students we have that responsibility and we'll do that."" How are students travelling home for Christmas? Testing plan to allow students home for Christmas Universities and colleges 'face cash shortfalls' Students told not to rush home for lockdown Where are people being asked to do surge testing?

Park knife attacker admits murdering three men,"Khairi Saadallah was charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A man has admitted murdering three men during a knife rampage in a park in Reading. Khairi Saadallah killed friends James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, during the two-minute attack in Forbury Gardens in June. At the Old Bailey, Saadallah, 26, also admitted three charges of attempted murder ahead of a scheduled trial. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the murders merited a whole-life sentence. The prosecution case is that the murders were a terror attack. But judge Mr Justice Sweeney said Saadallah had submitted a basis of plea, denying substantial preparation or planning and saying he was not motivated by an ideological cause. He said a Newton hearing, which will start in the week of 7 December, was ""essential"" to decide whether Saadallah was motivated by a religious or ideological cause. This video can not be played Friend Michael Main said: ""they were always happy"" Members of the victims' families sat in court for the hearing as Saadallah, of Basingstoke Road in Reading, entered his guilty pleas while wearing a face mask. The defendant, who is originally from Libya, launched his attack as people enjoyed a summer Saturday evening in Forbury Gardens on 20 June. Eyewitnesses said he walked along a footpath when he suddenly ran towards a group of men sitting on the grass. The attack was ""without warning or provocation and in rapid succession"", according to the case summary, History teacher Mr Furlong and Mr Ritchie-Bennett, a US citizen, were both stabbed once in the neck, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed in the back. All three were pronounced dead at the scene. 'Reading weeps' as town mourns stab deaths Victims of Reading stabbings 'died of neck wounds' Reading attack suspect 'known to MI5' Three others - their friend Stephen Young, as well as Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were sitting in a nearby group - were also injured by Saadallah. Mr Young was stabbed in the head, Mr Edwards was stabbed in the back and Mr Nisudan suffered injuries to his face and hand. The defendant then discarded the knife and ran out of the park before he was caught by police. Witnesses were said to have heard him shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) and ""victory on infidels"". Mr Furlong, who was head of history and government and politics at The Holt School in Wokingham, was described as by his parents as ""beautiful, intelligent, honest and fun"". Mr Ritchie-Bennett's father Robert told US TV network CBS his son, who was originally from Philadelphia, was ""brilliant and loving"". Mr Wails was described as ""always happy"" and a person who ""always made people smile"". In the aftermath of the attack, security sources told the BBC that Saadallah was known to MI5 after coming to its attention in 2019. But when the information was further investigated, no genuine threat or immediate risk was identified and no case file was opened.

More 'murder hornet' nests likely to be found in US,"Asian giant hornets are not native to the Pacific North-West and kill honeybees Washington is unlikely to have seen its last Asian giant hornets, the state's agricultural department has said, after scientists found 200 queens in one nest. The nest - the first in the US - of the so-called murder hornetswas captured with a vacuum from a tree in October. Researchers believe more queens - which are responsible for establishing colonies - could remain at large. But they are confident the population can be brought under control. Asian giant hornets are an invasive species in the Pacific North-West. They target honeybees, which pollinate crops. The insect, which is native to Japan and South Korea, can slaughter a bee colony in a matter of hours. They can also spit venom and inflict numerous powerful stings on humans. Scientists in Washington extracted the US's first nest of Asian giant hornets in October ""We believe there are additional nests. There is no way to be certain we got them all,"" Sven-Erik Spichiger, who researches insects with the Washington State Department of Agriculture, said in a press conference on Tuesday. The nest was extracted from a tree in the city of Blaine, close to the Canadian border, on 24 October. Scientists then quarantined the 22cm (9 in) diameter nest and after 24 hours were able to open it to examine the contents. Inside they found evidence of almost 500 insects at various stages of life including 112 worker hornets and close to 200 queens. ""It's possible some [queens] emerged before we did the extraction. There is no way of knowing how many more,"" Mr Spichiger said, explaining that three queens were found in the local area after scientists had removed the nest. But he said they had arrived ""in the nick of time"" to prevent the majority of queens from leaving the nest and mating. ""Frankly we are encouraged because of the number of queens we were able to count and kill,"" he said. Queen hornets go on to establish new colonies when they mate with a male and successfully hibernate over the winter season. When they wake up in spring, a small portion go on to establish nests. Mr Spichiger said it was likely that the insects arrived in the Pacific North-West as part of international commerce. ""We will never know how they got here...but it could have been a vehicle, wood chips, hay bales,"" he explained. A nest was destroyed in Vancouver Island in Canada in December last year.,external The Washington State Department of Agriculture is committed to eradicating the invasive species from the region, he added. Asian giant hornets ""are not going to hunt you down and murder you"", Mr Spichiger explained, but that if a person were to walk into a nest, their life would be ""probably in danger"". Around 40 people are killed annually by the hornets in Asia,according to the Smithsonian museum in Washington DC,external.

Footage, posted on social media, showed a vehicle partially embedded in the entrance of the building. A man, aged 45, has been arrested on suspicion of arson, affray and criminal damage. He remains in custody. The Met Police said the incident was not being treated as terror-related. Both the London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade were called to the crash on Fore Street.

Students in England are to be allocated departure dates during a ""student travel window"" between 3 and 9 December, to minimise the risk of them spreading Covid-19. In Wales, they are being asked totravel by 9 December at the latest. Many will be offered rapid result tests, while teaching will move online from 3 December in Wales and 9 December in England. The Scottish government wants as many as possible of the 80,000 or so students going home for Christmas to be offered voluntary tests before they travel. Northern Ireland is expected to publish plans for students' return in the coming days. One union said the plan for a week-long travel window in England ""leaves little room for error"". Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said the government chose the week after the four-week national lockdown in England ends on 2 December because ""students will pose a much reduced risk to their loved ones and their community"". How will students go home for Christmas? I am desperate to go home, says worried student She told BBC Breakfast the timing means that anyone who develops symptoms on 9 December will still ""have enough time to isolate and then return home for Christmas"". Ms Donelan confirmed that students will not need to have a negative test result before travelling home. Students are strongly advised to travel during the travel window. ""This is a choice. If they choose to leave after [9 December] they will run the risk of potentially not getting home for Christmas with that isolation window,"" Ms Donelan said. Jiya Saggu, 20, istorn between desperately wanting to go homeand wanting to keep her medically vulnerable family safe. Her 15-year-old sister had a kidney transplant some years ago and still has a weakened immune system, as does her mother who has rheumatoid arthritis. Also her uncle, one of the earliest cases of Covid in England, spent weeks on a ventilator before finally recovering. She says: ""That really brought home the fact that if any of my family get this virus, it would be devastating."" Reading the plans in the news to test students, before helping them get home, brought the third year University of Durham student ""a great sense of relief because it is a possible way out"". ""I think having designated days for people to leave may be a little difficult, especially within a week,"" she says. ""But if it means I can get home safely then that's all that matters."" Dr Jo Grady, general secretary of the University and College Union, said allowing one week for around one million students to travel in England ""leaves little room for error"". ""If the government instead told universities to move online now it would provide much more time to stagger the movement of students and better protect the health of staff, students and their wider communities,"" she said. The Department for Education said universities in England would now start working with their local public health teams and local transport operators to manage the mass movement in a staggered fashion. They should soon begin contacting students with allocated travel days, and some may hire coaches to help with the transportation. UK coach operator National Express said it was talking to universities about putting on extra services to help get students home. The Department for Education insisted there was enough capacity on the nation's public transport system for the evacuation-style plan to take place safely, adding that many students would have their own transport or be collected by parents. Ms Donelan described the roll-out of rapid result tests to as many students as possible in England as a ""complementary element"" to the travel window. She said the government wants to ""facilitate as much testing as possible"", but will target universities in areas with higher infection rates and proportions of vulnerable students. The distribution is set to begin at the end of November. Any student who tests positive will be required to self-isolate for 10 days under current guidelines. Scottish higher education minister Richard Lochhead confirmed Scotland would be part of the UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. He said students would be advised to only go out for essential reasons, including exercise, for two weeks before going home for Christmas and added there would be ""staggered and early departures"" home. He also said Scottish universities would be asked to make adjustments to in-person teaching and assessments to allow students time to get home at the end of term. The Welsh Government said students in Wales will be offered new rapid turnaroundtests 24 hours before they go. De Montfort and Durham universitieshave been running pilot projects for rapid Covid testing, including identifying those who might be infectious but have no symptoms. The""lateral flow tests"" give results in about 20 minutes, without the need for a lab. Where will mass testing be available? Wales asks students going home to travel by 9 Dec Prof Jacqui Ramagge, executive dean of the science faculty at Durham University, said students who receive a positive test result from these then undertake a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test - the type you get in NHS centres -  to confirm their status. That is because the PCR tests are ""the ones that are legally required,"" she added. She said mass testing of students is ""absolutely essential"". ""So many people in the age group that our students are in are asymptomatic carriers of the virus, and so if we only test those who are symptomatic, we miss a large number of people,"" she said. An estimated 40,000 students have become infected with coronavirus whilst in their university towns. This sparked concerns about infected students bringing the virus back home with them, thus accelerating the spread of the disease. There were suggestions that students might have to remain at university for an extra two-week period, so they could isolate, before returning home. But this was criticised by the National Union of Students (NUS) as likely to have a negative effect on student mental health. Deputy chief medical officer Dr Jenny Harries said: ""The mass movement of students across the country at the end of term presents a really significant challenge."" University lecturers and the NUS had warned of the risks of bringing 1.2 million students back to universities since the summer, and urged ministers to move courses online as the default. But the government had defended the continued use of face-to-face teaching. NUS president Larissa Kennedy welcomed the plans for voluntary tests and urged students to get one. ""We are glad to see this concession from government and we really do think students will be seeking to take these tests and to do this safely,"" she told the BBC. TESTING:What tests are available?

Cash-strapped Croydon Council bans spending,"Croydon Council announced in the summer it wanted to cut staff numbers by 15% - about 410 roles Cash-strapped Labour-run Croydon Council has imposed emergency spending restrictions with ""immediate effect"", the BBC has learned. The Section 114 notice bans all new expenditure at Croydon Council, with the exception of statutory services for protecting vulnerable people. A document seen by the BBC said ""Croydon's financial pressures are not all related to the pandemic"". It is under a government review amid claims of ""irresponsible spending"". Section 114 notices are issued when a council cannot achieve a balanced budget. In June, the BBC found many large councils in England feared going effectively bankrupt because of the Covid-19 pandemic. To cope with coronavirus, councils revealed they were planning a mix of responses including using up cash reserves, reducing services and cancelling or postponing spending on big projects. Cash-strapped council under new government review Councils could spend Â£1.7bn over budget by March Croydon 'cannot guarantee' avoiding bankruptcy The Section 114 letter, which was sent by Croydon's director of finance Lisa Taylor, said she was not confident the council ""can make the level of savings required to deliver a balanced budget"". ""Despite the council having put in place spending controls over the summer 2020, non-essential cost have continued to be incurred,"" she said. ""I am still not seeing an organisation that is taking the necessary radical decisions to stop all but essential expenditure."" Last month Government minister Robert Jenrick announced a rapid non-statutory review into Croydon Council The document also says Â£17.7m of the Â£27.9m of the ""new savings"" presented to Croydon's cabinet on 21 September and the full council meeting on 28 September were ""incorrectly identified as new savings"". As a result it forecasted that overspend ""had not reduced by as much as previously reported"". Croydon is the first council to declare aSection 114 order since Northamptonshire County Council in 2018. Last month, Croydon's cabinet member for finance Simon Hall resigned from his role, while former council leader Tony Newman announced his departure a few days later. Both resignations came two weeks after the pair survived a vote of no confidence proposed by the Conservative opposition. Councillor Hamida Ali, who took over as leader, accepted that the council ""had made mistakes"" in addition to the impact of coronavirus. ""While we continue to work hard to find savings, we must focus our spending on essential services and protecting our vulnerable residents,"" she said. ""We're not going to fix these problems overnight and there will be difficult decisions ahead but I want to reassure local people that the council will still be here to support you."" Croydon's chief executive Jo Negrini also announced in August that she would be stepping down. The council's Conservative opposition leader Cllr Jason Cummings said the report was ""scathing"" and he had fears local residents ""would suffer most"". He added: ""Labour were warned repeatedly over the last few years but ploughed on anyway, they must take full responsibility for the damage they have caused."" Construction of the Â£1.4bn Croydon Westfield shopping project has been repeatedly delayed since it was approved in 2017 The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said Croydon's decision was ""necessary"" for it to manage its own finances. A spokesman said: ""We're aware of serious concerns around the council's governance and risk management andthe recent Public Interest Report was damning about the governancewithin Croydon Council, which has been entirely irresponsible with their spending and investments. ""The council has decided to issue a section 114 notice and we will consider the findings of the review which concludes later this month."" By BBC London's political correspondent Tim Donovan It's not often a council needs to issue a Section 114 - but the pressures of coping with coronavirus have combined with at least questionable previous investment strategies to push Croydon over the edge. It was heading for an overspend of Â£60m at the end of the year from dealing with the pandemic and government support didn't look like covering it. Croydon went into the coronavirus health crisis in a vulnerable state - with depleted reserves and Â£1.5bn debts. It's a financial position partially reached through buying up property including a hotel and a shopping centre. In good times, it's easy to see how that might have paid dividends but with weeks of lockdown, it left the council seriously exposed. The latest development means new spending must be stopped immediately except for on statutory services like social care. Now the council's administration has 21 days to come up with a strategy which looks likely to mean more job losses to add to at least 400 already being cut.

"Northerners prefer football to ballet, MP saysConservative Jake Berry made the comparison as he warned ""northern culture"" is being hit by Covid.","Blackburn or ballet? Jake Berry's remarks have come under fire People in the south of England enjoy opera and ballet but football clubs are what matter to those living further north, a Conservative MP has said. Former minister Jake Berry made the comparison as he warned ""northern culture"" is being hit by Covid-19. He pressed the government to intervene to ""save"" football clubs. But his comments were criticised by the Northern Ballet as it perpetuates ""tropes that culture in the north is of less value than that in London"". The former northern powerhouse minister compared Accrington Stanley to the Royal Ballet as he insisted action is required from Westminster to help protect clubs that are the ""cornerstone"" of communities. The former minister said ""northern culture"" was being hit by Covid-19 Mr Berry, who made the comment as MPs debated support for the economy in the north of England, said: ""First of all is the hit that northern culture has taken from this Covid crisis. ""For many people who live in London and the south of England, things like the opera house and ballet will be at the heart of their culture. ""But for many of us in the north it is our local football club - our Glyndebourne or Royal Ballet or Royal Opera House or Royal Shakespeare Company will be Blackburn Rovers, Accrington Stanley, Barrow, Carlisle or Sunderland. He added the ""time has come where the government must seek to intervene to unblock this to save local football clubs across the north of England, many of which are the cornerstone of our communities and at the heart of our culture"". Treasury minister Kemi Badenoch did not address Mr Berry's football plea in her reply to the debate, acknowledging the north of England has been a ""hotbed"" of energy, ideas and creativity for centuries. Responding on Twitter, Northern Ballet said it was ""disappointed"" by the MP's comments while other social media users criticised Mr Berry for his remarks. Allow Twitter content?

Students going home should travel by 9 December,"Students in Wales returning home for Christmas are being asked to travel by 9 December at the latest. They will be offered new rapid turnaround tests 24 hours before leaving, the Welsh Government said. Travelling home later than 9 December will be allowed if they need to self-isolate following a positive test. It follows asimilar announcement in England, where students are being given a week to travel home after lockdown there ends. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Many students will wish to return home for the Christmas break and I'm pleased to confirm arrangements to enable that."" She warned that no-one should travel if they have symptoms, a positive test or if they have been asked to self-isolate by a contact tracer. The timing means students can complete quarantine and be home by Christmas Eve, the minister said, but she asked students to ""stay put"" and not return home until the first week of December. How will students go home for Christmas? Covid tests for Christmas from 30 November Students tear down 'prison-like' halls fencing The Welsh Government said new Covid-19 lateral flow tests will be provided to students who are travelling home. Universities have seen a number of outbreaks since students returned in the autumn though Ms Williams said there had been a ""steady decline"" in recent days. Opposition parties broadly welcomed the announcement, although the Welsh Conservatives said testing should be for ""university life, not just for Christmas"". Plaid Cymru called for ""comprehensive guidance"" for the return of students in New Year, to include remote and blended learning to ""ensure their safety"". Lily Scourfield says she wants to keep her mum safe at Christmas Lily Scourfield, 22, a Cardiff University medical student, said she wants to keep her mother safe ahead of what could be ""one of our last Christmases together"". ""My home is in Cardiff but I live in a student house, my mum's got cancer so she's in the most vulnerable category,"" she said. ""Therefore for me, I need to 100% know that I'm safe, perhaps with access to two tests before I even go home. ""[Mum is] sort of torn about it really because she wants me to be home for Christmas - that's her opinion, but I just want to keep her safe more than anything."" She said students ""obviously"" want to be with their families. ""I think there's a sort of common sentiment,"" he said ""I think they [students] don't want to bring any Covid or anything nasty to their families but they really want - from a sort of compassionate point of view - want to be with their families for Christmas."" Students at Welsh universities planning to travel home for the holidays are being asked to: Minimise their social contacts before the end of term Get a test, ""ideally within 24 hours"" before they travel Plan to travel no later than 9 December Familiarise themselves with university plans for ending in-person teaching and arrangements to ensure they can leave campus safely New facilities that can test people without symptoms will be available at ""participating universities in Wales"" within the next few weeks, the Welsh Government said. A spokesman said ministers are aiming for ""all universities to participate"". Ms Williams said it is hoped the new testing programme will begin in the next couple of weeks. Kirsty Williams said there had been a ""steady decline"" in Covid cases at university Discussions are still going on with universities and other governments on allowing students to return to universities after Christmas, a Welsh Government press conference heard. ""Those talks continue, but we're very much looking, not only to sending students home safely before Christmas, but welcoming them back to university, after the holidays,"" said Ms Williams. The minister again rejected calls for students to get a refund after a Covid-disrupted term. ""I appreciate that the experience this term has been a challenging one in many, many ways, but at this stage we don't have plans to ask universities to do either of those things."" The four governments of the UK have worked together on the issue, the Welsh Government said, adding it would contact Welsh students at universities elsewhere in the UK. Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said it will ""no doubt be welcome news for students who will want to be home for Christmas and for families who will be glad to see them return home after a difficult term"". But she added: ""Wales needs not just a clear plan for allowing students home for Christmas but also comprehensive guidance on their return to university in the New Year - including ensuring remote and blended learning to ensure their safety."" Suzy Davies of the Welsh Conservatives said she was ""pleased to see that Wales will broadly follow suit"" with the announcement in England ""and introduce a similar plan here giving similar reassurance to students and their families"". ""A wholly online experience is also a deterrent and raises questions about 'value for money', which Welsh Conservatives have raised before, and so testing should be for university life, not just for Christmas."" Rhian Thomas tested positive for coronavirus while at university in Exeter Rhian Thomas, 20, a third year history student from Swansea, is studying at Exeter University and lives in a six-bed house. ""This news has been a long time coming,"" she said. ""We were really glad to hear it because there was a lot of 'what do we do, what don't we do' because there's a lot of people at who are arguably more vulnerable than we are as students. ""There were many conversations as a house... there were even conversations on the possibility of us staying here for Christmas."" But she said there was a lack of guidance on how the mass testing will take place and how they should travel home. Ellie Cooper (L) and Caitlin Allen were both planning to go home early First year Cardiff University students Ellie Cooper and Caitlin Allen were already planning to return to their respective homes before the ""reassuring"" announcement was made. ""My plan was always to leave early in December, but I was going to take a test first because I've been so paranoid about bringing anything back,"" said 19-year-old Ellie, from Taunton in Somerset. ""I think it's a good idea what the government are putting forward. The only issue is a test is only as good as the day you take it."" Caitlin is returning to Abu Dhabi early as she has provide a negative test to travel and then quarantine on arrival. She said: ""It [testing] has its pros and cons but it is what it is, and if it means we can go home, be with our families and keep as many people safe as possible, then as students we have that responsibility and we'll do that.""

Four UK nations discuss joint Christmas Covid plan,"Discussions have taken place about the four nations of the UK taking a joint approach to Covid rules over Christmas. The Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish first ministers held a virtual meeting with Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and other senior UK officials. It was the first of what UK ministers hope will be weekly meetings. UK government sources said topics including international travel, mass testing and the priority list for vaccinations were also discussed. Nicola Sturgeon, Mark Drakeford and Arlene Foster took part in the meeting, as did Scottish Secretary Alister Jack, Welsh Secretary Simon Hart and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. Mr Gove said they all recognised families across the UK ""want to be able to see their loved ones this Christmas"". Students to go home in evacuation-style operation 'Too early to say' what Christmas rules will be He added: ""Today my ministerial colleagues and I met with the devolved administrations to work towards that shared aim and to help ensure that our collective response delivers for the public in every part of the UK"". It is understood government officials will now be considering how to put the desire for a ""joint approach to Christmas"" into action. A Scottish government spokesperson said: ""The four nations call had an initial discussion about a co-ordinated approach to issues such as travel over the Christmas period and discussed recent developments in testing, including the use of lateral flow testing to enable students to return home, and initial lessons from the Liverpool pilot."" Senior UK ministers have warned the situation remains highly volatile, with different levels of restrictions in different parts of the country and high rates of transmissions across the UK. Environment Secretary George Eustice said recently that people may not be able to gather like normal in large groups while Ms Sturgeon's most senior public health adviser, Jason Leitch, said last month that people should prepare themselves for a ""digital Christmas"". Earlier on Wednesday, a plan was announced to get students in England home safely for Christmas. Students are to be allocated departure dates during a ""student travel window"" between 3 and 9 December, to minimise the risk of them spreading Covid-19. In Wales, they are being asked to travel by 9 December at the latest. The Scottish government wants as many as possible of the 80,000 or so students going home for Christmas to be offered voluntary tests before they travel. Northern Ireland is expected to publish plans for students' return in the coming days. TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme?

Man detained as car crashes into police stationThe Met Police say the building in north London has been evacuated while the car is examined.,"This video can not be played Eyewitness footage shows a man pouring petrol on the ground and setting light to it A police station in north London had to be evacuated after a car crashed into the building. The crash happened in Edmonton shortly before 19:00 GMT on Wednesday. The man then left the car and tried to set fire to the road using petrol, police said. Footage, posted on social media, showed a vehicle partially embedded in the entrance of the building. A man, aged 45, has been arrested on suspicion of arson, affray and criminal damage. He remains in custody. The Met Police said the incident was not being treated as terror-related. Both the London Ambulance Service and London Fire Brigade were called to the crash on Fore Street. Police said officers had been able to return to the station and nearby residents, who had been initially evacuated, were allowed home. No injuries have been reported. Police officers extinguished a fire on Fore Street Enfield Council leader Nesil Caliskan had earlier described the crash as a ""major incident"" and urged people to avoid the area. Store manager Ogur Mazlum, 34, witnessed the moment the car crashed into the building. His wife Serife Mazlum said: ""He literally just walked out [of his shop] to just call me and see if everything's okay at home.

Park knife attacker admits murdering three menKhairi Saadallah pleads guilty to killing the men during a two-minute stabbing spree in Reading.Berkshire,"Khairi Saadallah was charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder A man has admitted murdering three men during a knife rampage in a park in Reading. Khairi Saadallah killed friends James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, during the two-minute attack in Forbury Gardens in June. At the Old Bailey, Saadallah, 26, also admitted three charges of attempted murder ahead of a scheduled trial. Prosecutor Alison Morgan said the murders merited a whole-life sentence. The prosecution case is that the murders were a terror attack. But judge Mr Justice Sweeney said Saadallah had submitted a basis of plea, denying substantial preparation or planning and saying he was not motivated by an ideological cause. He said a Newton hearing, which will start in the week of 7 December, was ""essential"" to decide whether Saadallah was motivated by a religious or ideological cause. This video can not be played Friend Michael Main said: ""they were always happy"" Members of the victims' families sat in court for the hearing as Saadallah, of Basingstoke Road in Reading, entered his guilty pleas while wearing a face mask. The defendant, who is originally from Libya, launched his attack as people enjoyed a summer Saturday evening in Forbury Gardens on 20 June. Eyewitnesses said he walked along a footpath when he suddenly ran towards a group of men sitting on the grass. The attack was ""without warning or provocation and in rapid succession"", according to the case summary, History teacher Mr Furlong and Mr Ritchie-Bennett, a US citizen, were both stabbed once in the neck, while scientist Mr Wails was stabbed in the back. All three were pronounced dead at the scene. 'Reading weeps' as town mourns stab deaths Victims of Reading stabbings 'died of neck wounds' Reading attack suspect 'known to MI5' Three others - their friend Stephen Young, as well as Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan, who were sitting in a nearby group - were also injured by Saadallah. Mr Young was stabbed in the head, Mr Edwards was stabbed in the back and Mr Nisudan suffered injuries to his face and hand. The defendant then discarded the knife and ran out of the park before he was caught by police. Witnesses were said to have heard him shouting ""Allahu Akbar"" (God is greatest) and ""victory on infidels"". Mr Furlong, who was head of history and government and politics at The Holt School in Wokingham, was described as by his parents as ""beautiful, intelligent, honest and fun"". Mr Ritchie-Bennett's father Robert told US TV network CBS his son, who was originally from Philadelphia, was ""brilliant and loving"". Mr Wails was described as ""always happy"" and a person who ""always made people smile"". In the aftermath of the attack, security sources told the BBC that Saadallah was known to MI5 after coming to its attention in 2019. But when the information was further investigated, no genuine threat or immediate risk was identified and no case file was opened.

Publish Patel bullying claims report - PM adviser,"A report into allegations Home Secretary Priti Patel bullied staff should be made public, the prime minister's adviser on standards in public life has said. Former MI5 chief Lord Evans warned that unresolved inquiries into ministers' conduct undermined public trust. A Cabinet Office investigation into allegations about Ms Patel's behaviour was launched in March. She has always strongly denied claims that she bullied staff. In FebruarySir Philip Rutnam, the top civil servant in the Home Office, resignedsaying he had been the target of a ""vicious and orchestrated briefing campaign"". He is pursuing an employment tribunal claim. Patel bullying inquiry must be published - Labour What has happened to the report into Priti Patel? The Committee on Standards in Public Life advises the prime minister on ethical standards across public life in England and is chaired by ex-MI5 boss Lord Evans of Weardale. The Timesfirst reported that Lord Evans wanted the Patel report to be made public.,external He told the BBC he was not in a position to judge the accuracy of the complaints about the home secretary but said the public needed to know that allegations are ""properly and independently investigated"". ""We want to make sure the system we have in place can resolve those issues so that people can have confidence the standards are being upheld in the right places and by everybody involved,"" he told Radio 4's The World at One. Lord Evans was appointed Chair of the Committee on Standards in Public life in October 2018 Asked specifically about Ms Patel's case he said there may be ""good reasons"" why some findings are not published but argued that any causes for delay should be explained. ""I think because they are left hanging in the air people are worried about it and that tends to reduce people's trust."" He also said that the process of investigating ministers should be more independent and transparent - and he suggested taking the responsibility for triggering such inquiries away from the prime minister. In an interview with the Times, he said because the report on Ms Patel had not been published ""it is very difficult to know whether there was something here or whether there wasn't"". Responding to Lord Evans' comments, Labour's shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said: ""It is a disgrace that the report into allegations of bullying against the home secretary is being suppressed. ""Continuing to refuse to release the report not only makes clear that the Tories have something to hide, it also undermines trust in politics at a crucial time - the report must be published without further delay."" A government spokesperson said: ""The process is ongoing and the prime minister will make any decision on the matter public once the process has concluded.""

"Russian Covid vaccine shows encouraging resultsThe full trial results have not yet been published, but scientists welcomed the positive news.Health","Early results from trials of a Covid vaccine developed in Russia suggest it could be 92% effective. The data is based on 20 cases of Covid-19 from 16,000 volunteers given the Sputnik V vaccine or a dummy injection. While some scientists welcomed the news, others said the data had been rushed out too early. It comes afterPfizer and BioNTech said their vaccine could prevent 90% of people getting Covid-19, based on a study of 43,500 people. Although the Sputnik data is based on fewer people being vaccinated and fewer cases of Covid developing during the trial, it does confirmpromising results from earlier research. The Sputnik V vaccine, developed at the National Research Centre for Epidemiology and Microbiology in Moscow, is currently going through phase III clinical trials in Belarus, UAE, Venezuela and India. So far there are no safety issues, with Russian researchers saying there were ""no unexpected adverse events"" 21 days after volunteers received their first of two injections. But there's still a long way to go - this is interim data and, like the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine trial, the data is still being collected and the full results have not yet been published or scrutinised. There are questions that still need answering for both vaccines - for example, how well does it protect older people who are most at risk and how long does protection from the vaccine last? Will vaccines be compulsory? And other questions 'Milestone' vaccine offers 90% Covid protection Which vaccines are most likely to succeed? The Russian researchers say their data will be published ""in one of the leading international peer-reviewed medical journals"". If it's positive, it means there will almost certainly be more than one way of protecting people against the virus. Hundreds of vaccines are in development and around a dozen are in the final stages of testing - the Sputnik, Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are three of those. This video can not be played How close are we to Covid immunisation? The Pfizer vaccine injects part of the genetic code of the virus into the body to train the immune system. The other two use a harmless virus that has been genetically modified to resemble the coronavirus. Two doses are also required, but one advantage of Sputnik is that it doesn't need to be stored at very low temperatures, around -80C, unlike Pfizer's. Alexander Gintsburg, director of Moscow's Gamaleya Research Centre, said Sputnik V would soon be available for a wider population and ""lead to an eventual decrease in Covid-19 infection rates, first in Russia, then globally"". Prof Charles Bangham, chair of immunology at Imperial College London, said the results ""provide further reassurance that it should be possible to produce an effective vaccine against Covid-19"". However, he added that proper evaluation of the safety and efficacy of both the Russian and Pfizer/BioNTech vaccines was needed when the full data on the trials is published. Prof Eleanor Riley, from University of Edinburgh, worried the data had been rushed out too soon. ""This is not a competition. We need all trials to be a carried out to the highest possible standards,"" she said. The researchers say there have been requests for more than 1.2 billion doses of the Sputnik vaccine from more than 50 countries. They claim it's possible to produce 500 million doses every year for the global market. Russia Covid-19 vaccine 'triggers immune response' How does the Pfizer vaccine work?

Three members of one NI family die with Covid-19,"Three members of one family in Northern Ireland have died with Covid-19 in the past two weeks, the BBC has learned. They include a man in his early 50s, who worked for the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Staff at the trust have paid tribute to him, saying he was a dedicated member of the health service. Belfast Trust senior manager Dr Paul Glover said his colleague, who died on Wednesday, was ""a very valued member of staff"". ""I'd like to offer my condolences to the family one of our members of staff who sadly passed away with Covid-19 today. ""I am sure all of his colleagues and those who have worked with him will feel this right at this moment in time."" SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly also offered condolences to the family of  those who died. ""It is just unimaginable,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I cannot begin to imagine how the surviving members of the family come to terms with it and I do hope and pray that they get the help and support that they need."" Mrs Kelly appealed to the executive to ""take account of the families who are suffering, who have suffered, those that are in hospital and the staff who are trying their best to actually keep people safe and to save their lives"". News of the health care worker's death comes as hospitals across Northern Ireland continue to report pressures. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, with 791 more people testing positive for the virus. The number of hospital inpatients with the virus has increased from 420 to 441. In the Republic of Ireland, there have been two Covid-19 related deaths and 362 new cases of the disease reported in the past 24 hours. It brings the total number of deaths there to 1,965. Forty-seven men and women are in ICU in Northern Ireland and 35 of them are on a ventilator. Dr Glover, who specialises in critical care, said there must be a ""sustained and ongoing"" decrease in community transmission rates before any relaxation of restrictions is considered. Stormont in deadlock over NI Covid restrictions DUP blocks 14-day NI Covid restrictions extension ""Our healthcare system is very much under pressure and is being stretched at this moment,"" he said. ""What we absolutely need is a sustained and ongoing decrease in transmission rates to stop the hospitals being overwhelmed, to take the pressure off staff and to allow us to be able to treat other conditions. ""We are not at the stage yet where community transmission is at such a low level as is safe to release restrictions."" Dr Glover added that ""everyone has a role to play"" to ensure that Covid-19 numbers are ""stamped down"" and ""kept down"". ""This is not just about government guidelines. It's also about public behaviours,"" he said. Health unions are also asking why restrictions would be relaxed, given the number of deaths in recent weeks. Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, Dr Tom Black, said: ""You need restrictions to reduce the transmission of the infection, to reduce the demands on hospitals."" Dr Black said demands on NI hospitals ""are nearly overwhelming hospital services"". Meanwhile, cases in care homes have also increased, with 143 facilities dealing with outbreaks - over 100 more than this time last month. Robin Swann told MLAs that staff, through no fault of their own, were carrying the virus - another reason, he said, for maintaining restrictions.

The congregation - and millions around the UK - commemorated those who died with a two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT. Armistice Day marks the day World War One ended in 1918. The grave of the Unknown Warrior represents those who died in the war and whose place of death is not known or whose remains are unidentified.

Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules Prince Charles wore a face mask throughout the service It included an address from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who paid tribute to the many millions who had died ""unnamed and unclaimed, except by God"". He went on to refer to the thousands, even millions, who were making sacrifices today, whose names may never be known. ""They may be anonymous but their actions are glorious,"" he told the congregation, all seated two metres apart. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage read his poem The Bed about a fallen soldier transported from being ""broken and sleeping rough in a dirt grave"" to being buried ""among drowsing poets and dozing saints"" in Westminster Abbey. Afterwards, former Catatonia singer now BBC radio presenter, Cerys Matthews, read the words of a World War One widow convinced the Unknown Warrior was her own husband. Ruby Turner, accompanied by Jools Holland, sang the hymn Abide with Me, which was sung at the burial 100 years ago. Commemorations have also been held at the Edinburgh Gardens Of Remembrance, Cardiff National War Memorial, Belfast City Hall and National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The public and veterans observed the two-minute silence away from the Cenotaph Police removed a climate change banner from the Cenotaph Before the scheduled events, an Extinction Rebellion activist staged a protest at the Cenotaph in central London. Private Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, placed a banner in front of the war memorial that read 'Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War'. He also laid a wreath of poppies with the slogan 'Act Now' at the site, saying ""unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war"". Both the banner and the wreath were later taken down by police. Boris Johnson's spokesman said their removal was ""an operational matter"" for officers and condemned the protest as ""profoundly disrespectful"". Ahead of the commemorations, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke to military families who have lost loved ones, telling them they should be ""proud"" of their achievements and ""the sacrifice and the bravery that they've shown"". The duchess marked Remembrance week by speaking via video call on Monday to three women about how they had been supported by the Royal British Legion. The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to three women who mourned the loss of partners or close family The Queen visited the Unknown Warrior's grave last week It comes after theQueen led the nation in marking Remembrance Sundayat a scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed to the public for the first time. Days before, the Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time when she made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior. The concept of the grave of the Unknown Warrior was inspired by Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. After the conflict he wrote to the then-Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, about his proposal which was later supported by King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The body was chosen from four unknown British servicemen - exhumed from four battle areas - by Brig Gen Louis Wyatt, commander of British forces in France and Flanders, and transported back to Britain. On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a union jack and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. The King - and nearly 1,000 widows and mothers of men killed in World War One - were present as the warrior was buried at the Abbey. A handful of earth from France was then dropped by the king onto his coffin during the service.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The UK government has defended its approach to rough sleeping as ""world leading"" amid criticism from Labour that it is providing ""neither the leadership nor the funding"" to tackle the problem. Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said that after the ""extraordinary effort"" to house rough sleepers early on in the pandemic the government had now ""lowered its ambition"". Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year. Ms Debbonaire said that thousands of people had become homeless since then and that the minister's words would ""ring hollow"" for those without a home. Homeless charities havewarned that lives will be at risk over winterwithout support and called for a repeat of the scheme from the first wave of the pandemic. During the spring somehotelstook in rough sleepers to help reduce the spread of the virus. The small Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu has reported its first Covid-19 case. It had been one of the few remaining areas of the world that was free of the coronavirus. A 23-year-old man
returning from the United States was diagnosed with the virus, health officials
said. He is in quarantine and contact tracing is under way. Prime Minister
Bob Loughman reassured the nation of 300,000 people that the situation was ""under controlâ. He said that while some domestic travel would be restricted
there were no plans to limit social gatherings. Most Pacific island nations closed their borders in the early days of
the pandemic, amid concerns that their weak healthcare systems would not be able to
cope with a serious outbreak. Cases were recorded in the Marshall Islandsand the Solomon
Islands last month but Kiribati,
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are believed to still be
free of the virus. A further 361 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in England, NHS England has said. It brings the total number of people who have died by this measure to 35,324. NHS England said the dates of deaths reported ranged from 13 October to 10 November. The patients were aged between 43 and 102 years old and all except 20 had known underlying health conditions. Â© 2025 BBC.

Afterwards, former Catatonia singer now BBC radio presenter, Cerys Matthews, read the words of a World War One widow convinced the Unknown Warrior was her own husband. Ruby Turner, accompanied by Jools Holland, sang the hymn Abide with Me, which was sung at the burial 100 years ago. Commemorations have also been held at the Edinburgh Gardens Of Remembrance, Cardiff National War Memorial, Belfast City Hall and National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The public and veterans observed the two-minute silence away from the Cenotaph Police removed a climate change banner from the Cenotaph Before the scheduled events, an Extinction Rebellion activist staged a protest at the Cenotaph in central London. Private Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, placed a banner in front of the war memorial that read 'Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War'. He also laid a wreath of poppies with the slogan 'Act Now' at the site, saying ""unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war"". Both the banner and the wreath were later taken down by police. Boris Johnson's spokesman said their removal was ""an operational matter"" for officers and condemned the protest as ""profoundly disrespectful"". Ahead of the commemorations, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke to military families who have lost loved ones, telling them they should be ""proud"" of their achievements and ""the sacrifice and the bravery that they've shown"". The duchess marked Remembrance week by speaking via video call on Monday to three women about how they had been supported by the Royal British Legion. The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to three women who mourned the loss of partners or close family The Queen visited the Unknown Warrior's grave last week It comes after theQueen led the nation in marking Remembrance Sundayat a scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed to the public for the first time. Days before, the Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time when she made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior. The concept of the grave of the Unknown Warrior was inspired by Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. After the conflict he wrote to the then-Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, about his proposal which was later supported by King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The body was chosen from four unknown British servicemen - exhumed from four battle areas - by Brig Gen Louis Wyatt, commander of British forces in France and Flanders, and transported back to Britain. On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a union jack and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. The King - and nearly 1,000 widows and mothers of men killed in World War One - were present as the warrior was buried at the Abbey. A handful of earth from France was then dropped by the king onto his coffin during the service.

"Three members of one NI family die with Covid-19A man in his 50s, who worked for the Belfast Trust, was one of those who died in the past week.","Three members of one family in Northern Ireland have died with Covid-19 in the past two weeks, the BBC has learned. They include a man in his early 50s, who worked for the Belfast Health and Social Care Trust. Staff at the trust have paid tribute to him, saying he was a dedicated member of the health service. Belfast Trust senior manager Dr Paul Glover said his colleague, who died on Wednesday, was ""a very valued member of staff"". ""I'd like to offer my condolences to the family one of our members of staff who sadly passed away with Covid-19 today. ""I am sure all of his colleagues and those who have worked with him will feel this right at this moment in time."" SDLP MLA Dolores Kelly also offered condolences to the family of  those who died. ""It is just unimaginable,"" she told BBC Radio Ulster's Evening Extra programme. ""I cannot begin to imagine how the surviving members of the family come to terms with it and I do hope and pray that they get the help and support that they need."" Mrs Kelly appealed to the executive to ""take account of the families who are suffering, who have suffered, those that are in hospital and the staff who are trying their best to actually keep people safe and to save their lives"". News of the health care worker's death comes as hospitals across Northern Ireland continue to report pressures. The Department of Health in Northern Ireland reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, with 791 more people testing positive for the virus. The number of hospital inpatients with the virus has increased from 420 to 441. In the Republic of Ireland, there have been two Covid-19 related deaths and 362 new cases of the disease reported in the past 24 hours. It brings the total number of deaths there to 1,965. Forty-seven men and women are in ICU in Northern Ireland and 35 of them are on a ventilator. Dr Glover, who specialises in critical care, said there must be a ""sustained and ongoing"" decrease in community transmission rates before any relaxation of restrictions is considered. Stormont in deadlock over NI Covid restrictions DUP blocks 14-day NI Covid restrictions extension ""Our healthcare system is very much under pressure and is being stretched at this moment,"" he said. ""What we absolutely need is a sustained and ongoing decrease in transmission rates to stop the hospitals being overwhelmed, to take the pressure off staff and to allow us to be able to treat other conditions. ""We are not at the stage yet where community transmission is at such a low level as is safe to release restrictions."" Dr Glover added that ""everyone has a role to play"" to ensure that Covid-19 numbers are ""stamped down"" and ""kept down"". ""This is not just about government guidelines. It's also about public behaviours,"" he said. Health unions are also asking why restrictions would be relaxed, given the number of deaths in recent weeks. Chair of the BMA in Northern Ireland, Dr Tom Black, said: ""You need restrictions to reduce the transmission of the infection, to reduce the demands on hospitals."" Dr Black said demands on NI hospitals ""are nearly overwhelming hospital services"". Meanwhile, cases in care homes have also increased, with 143 facilities dealing with outbreaks - over 100 more than this time last month. Robin Swann told MLAs that staff, through no fault of their own, were carrying the virus - another reason, he said, for maintaining restrictions.

Several hurt in bomb attack at Saudi WW1 ceremony,"Saudi police blocked off a street leading to a non-Muslim cemetery in the Saudi city of Jeddah where the bomb was detonated Several people have been wounded in a bomb attack at a Remembrance Day ceremony attended by foreign diplomats in the Saudi city of Jeddah. The embassies of France, Greece, Italy, the UK and the US said an improvised explosive device blew up at a cemetery for non-Muslims on Wednesday morning. A joint statement strongly condemned the ""cowardly attack"". Saudi authorities confirmed that a Greek consulate employee and a Saudi security officer had been hurt. The BBC understands one British person suffered minor injuries. The government of Mecca province described the attack on the ceremony as ""cowardly"" and said security forces had launched an investigation.

Harry Dunn accused had 'no right to immunity',"Harry Dunn was killed after a crash outside RAF Croughton last year Harry Dunn's alleged killer was never entitled to immunity from prosecution in the UK, the High Court has heard. Mr Dunn, 19, died when his motorbike was in a crash with a car near RAF Croughton, Northamptonshire, on 27 August last year. The suspect, Anne Sacoolas, later left for the USA citing diplomatic immunity. She was charged with causing death by dangerous driving in December but an extradition request was denied in January. Mrs Sacoolas, 43, whose husband Jonathan worked as a technical assistant at the base, was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road when she hit Mr Dunn. His parents, Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn, claim the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) wrongly decided Mrs Sacoolas had diplomatic immunity and unlawfully obstructed Northamptonshire Police's investigation. Mr Dunn's parents Tim Dunn and Charlotte Charles want Mrs Sacoolas to return to the UK In 1995, the UK agreed to include staff at RAF Croughton on the diplomatic list, but asked the US to waive the immunity of administrative and technical staff in relation to ""acts performed outside the course of their duties"". The FCDO says that waiver only applied to staff at RAF Croughton and not their family members, meaning Mrs Sacoolas did have immunity at the time of the crash. But, at a remote hearing, Sam Wordsworth QC - representing the parents - said Mrs Sacoolas had ""no duties at all"" at the base and therefore ""never had any relevant immunity for the US to waive"". He told the court that, under the agreement, ""the US agreed to waive the immunity of the administrative and technical staff from criminal jurisdiction in respect of acts performed outside the course of their duties"". ""It follows that administrative and technical staff at RAF Croughton were only ever entitled to a limited immunity."" He said as ""no immunity from criminal jurisdiction was conferred on Mr Sacoolas in respect of acts performed outside the course of his duties"" it followed that his wife was not beyond prosecution either. ""Hence she was not immune with respect to the criminal proceedings at issue in this case,"" he said. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, cited diplomatic immunity after the crash and returned to the US Geoffrey Robertson QC - also representing the parents - earlier said the FCDO ""tacitly accepted the Sacoolas family's departure from the UK"". He referred to a text message sent to a US embassy official on 14 September 2019 - a day before Mrs Sacoolas and her family left for the USA. The message read: ""I think that now the decision has been taken not to waive (immunity), there's not much mileage in us asking you to keep the family here. ""It's obviously not us approving of their departure but I think you should be able to put them on the next flight out."" In written submissions, the FCDO's barrister Sir James Eadie QC said ""Mrs Sacoolas automatically had diplomatic immunity as the spouse of the administrative and technical staff of the US mission"". He denied claims the FCDO had obstructed the police investigation. He said officials had ""objected in strong terms"" to Mrs Sacoolas leaving the UK, and ""repeatedly emphasised"" that the department ""wanted the Sacoolas family to co-operate with the UK authorities"". The hearing before Lord Justice Flaux and Mr Justice Saini is expected to conclude on Thursday.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The UK government has defended its approach to rough sleeping as ""world leading"" amid criticism from Labour that it is providing ""neither the leadership nor the funding"" to tackle the problem.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students.

Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said that after the ""extraordinary effort"" to house rough sleepers early on in the pandemic the government had now ""lowered its ambition"". Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year. Ms Debbonaire said that thousands of people had become homeless since then and that the minister's words would ""ring hollow"" for those without a home.

island nation of Vanuatu has reported its first Covid-19 case. It had been one of the few remaining areas of the world that was free of the coronavirus. A 23-year-old man

said. He is in quarantine and contact tracing is under way. Prime Minister
Bob Loughman reassured the nation of 300,000 people that the situation was ""under controlâ. He said that while some domestic travel would be restricted
there were no plans to limit social gatherings. Most Pacific island nations closed their borders in the early days of
the pandemic, amid concerns that their weak healthcare systems would not be able to

free of the virus. A further 361 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in England, NHS England has said.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students.

Cancelling Higher exams cannot be ruled out,"The Scottish government has not ruled out cancelling Higher exams in Scotland next year and will make a final decision in mid-February. Last month Education Secretary John Swinney confirmed there would beno National 5 examsin 2021. But he told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandthe ""latest point"" he could make such a call for Highers would be the first break after Christmas On TuesdayGCSE and A-levels in Waleswere cancelled for 2021. Asked whether Scotland might follow suit, Mr Swinney, said: ""The latest point at which we can take that decision will be the February break, around about the middle of February. ""Obviously we will be looking very carefully at what is the degree of disruption to young people and what is the state of the pandemic at that stage. ""It is quite a long way off but we have to make sure that we have the effective contingency plans in place."" The Scottish Conservative's accused Mr Swinney of leaving pupils and teachers ""in the dark"". Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 John Swinney appears before Holyrood's education committee,external Mr Swinney, who appeared before a committee of MSPs at Holyrood earlier, said that ministers would be closely monitoring the situation going into the new year. On whether there was an argument for giving clarity now, Mr Swinney acknowledged there are a broad range of opinions on the subject and said he has looked carefully at it. He added: ""I concluded that there was a very clear desire among stakeholders for the Highers and Advance Highers to take their course because they are of course, the passport to the next stage of education, work and life for young people. ""That was also very strongly the view that I heard from young people into the bargain. ""It is a difficult question and it is one that we reflect on very carefully because we want to make sure young people are able to have certification for their achievements."" Conservative MSP Jamie Greene said the education secretary had already thrown in the towel on National 5 exams and ""he's now kicking a decision on Higher exams into the long grass"". He urged the government to ""pull out all the stops to ensure Higher exams go ahead as planned"". Mr Greene went on: ""Instead, they're leaving pupils and teachers in the dark again, with barely any time to plan and prepare for vital exams. The pandemic has been damaging to Scotland's schools but not nearly as damaging as the SNP's lack of leadership."" After summer 2020 exams were cancelled because of the pandemic, Prof Mark Priestley was commissioned to conduct a review of what had happened. Hisreport, which was issued at the beginning of October,,externalsaid Nat 5s should be cancelled and that Higher and Advanced Higher exams in 2021 ""will go ahead"". As things stand, the expectation is that Scottish Higher and Advanced Higher exams will take place in the spring. National 5 exams have already been cancelled. Unions had argued for the cancellation of all Scottish exams in 2021 but the government decided Highers and Advanced Higher exams should still go ahead if possible. The exam diet will take place a few weeks later than normal. This is to allow some slack for disruption. There have already been examples of individual schools being closed temporarily and there are concerns about interruption to teaching if staff are self-isolating or students are off for a prolonged period. There will also be changes to the formats of individual exams which could help if individuals have missed part of the course Of course, things may still change depending on the severity of the crisis through the winter and the spring. Meanwhile, Mr Swinney has insisted that school attendance was holding up in the face of the coronavairus pandemic. He was responding to astory in The Herald,externalthat in Lanarkshire about 1,000 pupils from both primary and secondary school had been off in the last month. The education secretary told Good Morning Scotland: ""I think it is important that we look at the sources of the infection. What I think is very clear from the information about the circumstance,s in which people have identified education as part of their contact tracing work, that is a very small proportion of positive cases that relate back to education. ""Now when you look into the particular outbreaks that take place that affect school pupils or staff we tend to find that those are cases where it has been an external community transmission that has happened. There is very little evidence of in-school transmission."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

"UK coronavirus death toll passes 50,000","The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 coronavirus deaths, according to the latest government figures. A total of 50,365 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 595 in the past 24 hours. The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the figures showed, despite hopes for a vaccine, ""we are not out of the woods"". He said: ""Every death is a tragedy,"" but added: ""I do think we have got now to a different phase in the way that we treat it."" How the UK reached 50,000 virus deaths How many cases are there in your area? How does the UK compare to the rest of the world? A further 22,950 cases of coronavirus were recorded on Wednesday,government figures show,external. There have been some 1.2 million confirmed cases in the UK since the epidemic began, and more than 185,000 people have been admitted to hospital with the virus. The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over 65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more from Nick here. The government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus -  but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been more than 60,000 deaths by 23 October, by this measure. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest death figures were a ""grim milestone"" and criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the pandemic during the first wave. He said the government owed it to the families of those who have lost their lives to the virus ""to get on top"" of its response to the second wave. The British Medical Association (BMA) said lessons had to be learned. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said: ""This is a point that should never have been reached."" He added: ""Today's figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organisation by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public."" The government had to ""ensure that nothing on this scale ever happens again"", he added, with a public inquiry to ""go over every step with a fine-tooth comb"". It comes as officials said no decision has yet been made onhow people under the age of 50 should be offered a Covid vaccine. The current priority list of people who would get a vaccine in ""phase one"" starts with those living and working in care homes, then - in stages - everyone over 60 years old. But the list is subject to change, with close attention being paid to how the vaccines work in older age groups, who often have a weak response to immunisation. Attention has turned to how a vaccine will be rolled out after Pfizer and BioNTech revealedtheir vaccine protects more than 90% of peoplefrom developing Covid symptoms. The prime minister urged everybody to get a coronavirus vaccine once one becomes available, adding that the arguments of anti-vaccination activists were ""total nonsense"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âAnti-vax is total nonsense is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" Mr Johnson would be happy to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Number 10 has said. On a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in south-east London on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the prospect of a vaccine and the ramping up of testing were ""two big boxing gloves"" to ""pummel"" the virus with, but said: ""Neither of them is capable of delivering a knock-out blow on its own. ""That's why this country needs to continue to work hard to keep discipline and to observe the measures we've put in."" Please enable JavaScript or upgrade your browser to see this interactive   Here are only some of those who have died. To see all of them would take more than {{x}} hours. Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in recent weeks. In England,a new four-week lockdown started last Thursday- replacing the three-tier system until 2 December. Mr Johnson said England must ""get through this current period of tough autumn measures"" to ""hopefully"" curb the spread of the virus enough to allow Christmas to be ""as normal as possible for as many people as possible"". Meanwhile, pubs reopened and travel restrictions were lifted in Wales on Monday,as it ended a two-week ""firebreak"" lockdown. Additional restrictions in Northern Ireland are due to end on Friday aftera proposal from the Northern Ireland Assembly's health minister to extend restrictions was blocked. In Scotland,there is now a five-tier system of virus alert levelswith different measures in place in different parts of the country. The tiers are numbered from zero to four, with level four requiring the introduction of lockdown restrictions for that area. TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme?

Testing plan to allow students home for Christmas,"Students could be allowed home for Christmas if they test negative twice University students are to be allowed to return home for Christmas in Scotland if they return two negative Covid-19 tests before travelling. Universities minister Richard Lochhead said up to 80,000 students are expected to travel home at the end of term. Dates for courses ending are due to be staggered to make sure there is not a ""great surge of movement"" in December. And a testing system is being set up UK-wide to ensure students do not carry the virus across the country. People will be given two tests, five days apart, and those who test negative on both occasions will be allowed to travel. Those who return a positive result would have to self-isolate, although it is hoped this would end in time for them to go home before the festive period. Once students are home, they will need to abide by the same restrictions on household gatherings and meetings as everyone else - but there will be no special rules for students at home. How will university students go home for Christmas 'Staggered return' for students after Christmas Student Covid tests for Christmas from 30 November Mr Lochhead told MSPs that students would be advised to ""voluntarily reduce their social mixing"" for two weeks before going home, only going out for essential reasons. He said tests ""cannot tell us with certainty that someone is Covid-free"" because people may be incubating the disease, saying it was ""vital for students to continue to follow all of the other measures in place"". And he added that work was ongoing to work out how students should return to universities after Christmas, saying lessons must be learned from outbreaks at the start of term in August. He said: ""It is clear that the return after the new year will not be normal and we will work with the sector to offer as much clarity for students and staff as we can in the coming weeks."" Under the plans students will be tested twice five days apart Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, said the testing programme would involve up to 65,000 students living in halls and student accommodation. He told BBC radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that lessons had been learned from thespike in casesat the start of the academic year. He said: ""If you are a student who is going home for Christmas it gives that extra assurance to you, and to the people that you are going home to, that you are not bringing the virus home with you."" Mr Sim added that some in-person teaching on campuses would end early on 30 November to ensure there was no ""surge of movement"" of students. Many universities are, however, anticipating more students than usual will remain in university accommodation over the holidays. In particular, they are aware many overseas students may be unable to return home or may be reluctant to risk travelling in case they need to quarantine once they return to the UK. In recent weeks, some students have claimed they could have remained at home as their lectures and tutorials are mostly taking place online. However, universities have argued students still have access to certain facilities which they could not use from home. Matt Crilly, NUS Scotland president, said students deserved the right to return home for the winter break and he wanted to see a coherent strategy from the Scottish government that allowed students to return home safely, while avoiding mass outbreaks. ""Many students rely on the support networks offered by their friends and families and going home to see them over the Christmas period can be critical for their mental health and wellbeing,"" Mr Crilly said. ""NUS Scotland is calling for a clear plan that has ample lead time, with a strategy including the use of mass testing, staggered departure dates and compassion. ""However, there will also be many students whose halls are their only home and others who will choose not to return home this festive period. We want to see the Scottish government offering additional support to student associations to ensure all students have access to facilities including catering (even if they are in non-catered halls), access to post rooms and mental health support.""

"UK coronavirus death toll passes 50,000It is the first European nation to pass the landmark, with 595 deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.UK","The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 coronavirus deaths, according to the latest government figures. A total of 50,365 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 595 in the past 24 hours. The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the figures showed, despite hopes for a vaccine, ""we are not out of the woods"". He said: ""Every death is a tragedy,"" but added: ""I do think we have got now to a different phase in the way that we treat it."" How the UK reached 50,000 virus deaths How many cases are there in your area? How does the UK compare to the rest of the world? A further 22,950 cases of coronavirus were recorded on Wednesday,government figures show,external. There have been some 1.2 million confirmed cases in the UK since the epidemic began, and more than 185,000 people have been admitted to hospital with the virus. The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over 65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more from Nick here. The government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus -  but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been more than 60,000 deaths by 23 October, by this measure. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest death figures were a ""grim milestone"" and criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the pandemic during the first wave. He said the government owed it to the families of those who have lost their lives to the virus ""to get on top"" of its response to the second wave. The British Medical Association (BMA) said lessons had to be learned. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said: ""This is a point that should never have been reached."" He added: ""Today's figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organisation by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public."" The government had to ""ensure that nothing on this scale ever happens again"", he added, with a public inquiry to ""go over every step with a fine-tooth comb"". It comes as officials said no decision has yet been made onhow people under the age of 50 should be offered a Covid vaccine. The current priority list of people who would get a vaccine in ""phase one"" starts with those living and working in care homes, then - in stages - everyone over 60 years old. But the list is subject to change, with close attention being paid to how the vaccines work in older age groups, who often have a weak response to immunisation. Attention has turned to how a vaccine will be rolled out after Pfizer and BioNTech revealedtheir vaccine protects more than 90% of peoplefrom developing Covid symptoms. The prime minister urged everybody to get a coronavirus vaccine once one becomes available, adding that the arguments of anti-vaccination activists were ""total nonsense"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âAnti-vax is total nonsense is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" Mr Johnson would be happy to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Number 10 has said. On a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in south-east London on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the prospect of a vaccine and the ramping up of testing were ""two big boxing gloves"" to ""pummel"" the virus with, but said: ""Neither of them is capable of delivering a knock-out blow on its own. ""That's why this country needs to continue to work hard to keep discipline and to observe the measures we've put in."" Please enable JavaScript or upgrade your browser to see this interactive   Here are only some of those who have died. To see all of them would take more than {{x}} hours. Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in recent weeks. In England,a new four-week lockdown started last Thursday- replacing the three-tier system until 2 December. Mr Johnson said England must ""get through this current period of tough autumn measures"" to ""hopefully"" curb the spread of the virus enough to allow Christmas to be ""as normal as possible for as many people as possible"". Meanwhile, pubs reopened and travel restrictions were lifted in Wales on Monday,as it ended a two-week ""firebreak"" lockdown. Additional restrictions in Northern Ireland are due to end on Friday aftera proposal from the Northern Ireland Assembly's health minister to extend restrictions was blocked. In Scotland,there is now a five-tier system of virus alert levelswith different measures in place in different parts of the country. The tiers are numbered from zero to four, with level four requiring the introduction of lockdown restrictions for that area. TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme?

Rolls Royce plans 16 mini-nuclear plants for UK,"Supporters maintain that small nuclear reactors can be unobtrusive and safe A consortium led by Rolls-Royce has announced plans to build up to 16 mini-nuclear plants in the UK. It says the project will create 6,000 new jobs in the Midlands and the North of England over the next five years. The prime minister is understood to be poised to announce at least Â£200m for the project as part of a long-delayed green plan for economic recovery. Rolls-Royce argues that as well as producing low-carbon electricity, the concept may become an export industry. The company's UK ""small modular reactor"" (SMR) group includes the National Nuclear Laboratory and the building company Laing O'Rourke. Last year, it received Â£18m to begin the design effort for the SMR concept. New nuclear plant at Sizewell set for green light UK's nuclear future to be decided at key meeting The government says new nuclear is essential if the UK is to meet its target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 - where any carbon released is balanced out by an equivalent amount absorbed from the atmosphere. But there is a nuclear-sized hole opening up in the energy network. Six of the UK's seven nuclear reactor sites are due to go offline by 2030 and the remaining one, Sizewell B, is due to be decommissioned in 2035. Together they account for around 20% of the country's electricity. Rolls-Royce and its partners argue that instead of building huge nuclear mega-projects in muddy fields we should construct a series of smaller nuclear plants from ""modules"" made in factories. The aim is to re-engineer nuclear power as a very high-tech Lego set. The components would be broken down into a series of hundreds of these modules which would be made in a central factory and shipped by road to the site for assembly. The objective is to tackle the biggest problem nuclear power faces:  the exorbitant cost. The reason it is so expensive is that the projects are huge and complex and have to meet very high safety standards. And, because so few new nuclear power stations are built, there are very few opportunities to learn from mistakes. EDF says Sizewell C will provide electricity for six million homes and create 25,000 jobs So, Rolls-Royce and its partners are saying: let's make them smaller and make lots of them so that we get really good at it. The concept would dramatically reduce the amount of construction that would be associated with a nuclear project, claimed Tom Samson, the chief executive of the UK Small Modular Reactor consortium (UK SMR). ""If we move all that activity into a controlled factory environment that drives down cost by simplification and standardisation,"" he explained. Each plant would produce 440 megawatts of electricity - roughly enough to power Sheffield - and the hope is that, once the first few have been made, they will cost around Â£2bn each. The consortium says the first of these modular plants could be up and running in 10 years, after that it will be able to build and install two a year. By comparison, the much larger nuclear plant being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset is expect to cost some Â£22bn but will produce more than 3 gigawatts of electricity - over six times as much. In addition to the six nuclear plants going offline by 2030, there's another challenge. You have to factor in a massive increase in electricity demand over the coming decades. That's because if we're going to reach our net zero target, we need to stop using fossil fuels for transport and home heating. The government has said this could lead to a three-fold increase in electricity use. The government says it remains committed to the construction of new nuclear power stations UK SMR isn't the only player which has spotted that there could be a gap in the market for smaller reactors. There are dozens of different companies around the world working on small reactor projects. That has got the critics of nuclear power worried. Greenpeace and other environmental groups say small nuclear power stations pose similar risks of radioactive releases and weapons proliferation as big ones. Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, Doug Parr, said that if the government wanted to take a punt on some new technology to tackle climate change it would be better off investing in hydrogen or geothermal power. And there are other reasons to question the SMR concept, says Prof MV Ramana of the University of British Columbia in Canada. He is a physicist and an expert on nuclear energy policy who has studied small modular reactors. He said UK SMR's 10-year time-scale for its first plant may prove optimistic.  The one constant in the history of the nuclear industry to date is that big new concepts never come in on time and budget, he said. He is sceptical that the factory concept can deliver significant cost savings given the complexity and scale of even a small nuclear plant. Smaller plants will have to meet the same rigorous safety standards as big ones, he points out. He said that where the concept has been tried elsewhere - in the US and China, for example - there have been long delays and costs have ended up being comparable to those of large nuclear power stations. Finally, he questioned whether there will be a market for these plants by the 2030s, when UK SMR says the first will be ready. ""Ten years from now, the competition will be renewables which are going to be far cheaper with much better storage technology than we have today,"" said Prof Ramana. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) The road to clean energy But Boris Johnson's powerful adviser, Dominic Cummings, is known to be taken with the modular nuclear idea. One of the reasons the government has been fighting so hard to free itself from the EU's state aid rules is so it can get its shoulder behind technologies it thinks will give the UK economy and its workers a real boost. Modular nuclear has the potential to do just that. If Rolls-Royce and its partners can show that the factory concept really does deliver high quality nuclear plants on time and on budget then there is potentially a huge world market for the technology. The price per unit of electricity may be higher than with wind or solar, said the clean energy consultant Michael Liebreich, but nuclear delivers power pretty much 24/7 and therefore can command a premium. UK SMR is pitching the concept as a UK solution to the global challenge of tackling climate change and says there will be a vast export market as the world starts to switch to low carbon energy. Boris Johnson is rumoured to be planning to take a big punt on nuclear power. His government has always said new nuclear is going to be a key part of Britain's future energy system. As well as the potential investment in SMRs, the BBC has already reported that the government is expected to give the long-discussed new large nuclear plant at Sizewell in Suffolk the go-ahead. Mr Johnson is expected to say these investments are essential if the UK is going to meet its promise to decarbonise the economy by 2050 as part of the worldwide effort to tackle climate change. And, while there may be good reasons to question whether the SMR concept will deliver on its promise of low-cost nuclear power, there is no question it holds out exactly the kind of optimistic vision for the UK's industrial future the government is desperate for.

45 more Covid deaths and 928 new cases,"A further 28 people have died with coronavirus in Wales, taking the total to 2,474, according to the latest figures. Public Health Wales data also showed 1,251 more people had tested positive for Covid-19, taking the total to 75,986. Each of Wales' seven health boards reported at least one new Covid-related death on Thursday. Cwm Taf Morgannwg reported the highest number, with eight new deaths. Across other health boards in Wales, Swansea Bay reported seven new deaths, while there were six in Aneurin Bevan and four in Betsi Cadwaladr.

Q&A: What can you do as Wales' firebreak ends?,"Bars and pubs in Wales are banned from serving alcohol from 18:00 BST on Friday This is usually party season but an office outing or drinks with friends could not be further from reality as Wales prepares for a Covid Christmas. Pubs, cafes and restaurants have beenbanned from selling alcoholand ordered to close at 18:00 GMT as the Welsh Government attempts to curb the rise of coronavirus cases. But cross-bordertravel restrictions to parts of England and Scotlandhas eased, although travel is not advised. So what areWales' latest rules,external? The regulations state groups of four people from different households are allowed to meet indoors at pubs, cafes and restaurants but the Welsh Government said people should limit themselves to seeing thesame ""one or two friends"". However, on Wednesday Wales' chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said: ""My message on this is really very simple - don't mix with people outside your household between now and Christmas. ""Don't mix if you can avoid it"". All pubs, restaurants and cafes have to shut at 18:00. They also won't be serving alcoholic drinks and are ordered to close early every day for two weeks until guidance is reviewed on 17 December. How many people have died with Covid-19 in Wales? Q&A: Can people from Wales go to England to drink? Pubs, shops, travel: What can you do in each Covid tier? Larger groups of people who all live in the same house are allowed to eat out together - but groups of more than four people who are in the same bubble are not allowed in pubs, cafes or restaurants. The rule of four will also apply when meeting people from different households outdoors, away from your home, but meeting anyone from outside your household bubble in someone's garden is not allowed. Two families can form a bubble or an extended household - and they are the only people you're allowed to see inside your home. ""To help keep everyone as safe as possible at home, only people from your own household or your extended household can meet at home,"" said First Minister Mark Drakeford. Indoor organised events are allowed over the winter because the Welsh Government says it would be more difficult to meet outside. Up to 15 people can take part in activities indoors and up to 30 outdoors - providing social distancing, hand hygiene and other Covid safety measures are followed The requirement to work from home whenever possible still remains in Wales, according to thenew rules,external. And as work is considered ""essential"", people are permitted to travel to England's very high risk tiers, if they cannot work from home. Yes - but there are restrictions if you're heading to the worst affected areas. As cross-border travel rules are relaxed on Friday from 18:00, you can go toplaces in tiers one and two,external- but not to areas under the strictest measures in tier three. Border communities: Chester and Wrexham It means travel to places like London, Liverpool, Chester, Cheltenham and Bath will be possible within the new rules. However you cannot visit places such as Manchester, Birmingham or Bristol, unless for work, essential childcare or to see your extended household. While pubs inEngland's tier one and twocan now open, youcan only buy alcohol as part of a ""substantial meal"". But the Welsh Government is urging people against cross-border travel in an attempt to curb rising coronavirus rates. Travel into Scotland's top tiers,external- levels three and four - is not allowed, much like England's tier three areas, except for essential reasons or seeing people in your extended household. The government is advising people not to travel across borders if it is not essential So places like Glasgow, Stirling and Livingston are among the eleven local authority areas with the highest Covid measures. People on the border in a 'difficult situation' What do the new rules mean for pubs in Wales? Covid: You asked and we answered ""We are advising people in Wales not to travel into those parts of England and Scotland where the infection rate is lower, to help prevent them taking coronavirus with them,"" Mr Drakeford has said. ""Coronavirus doesn't respect borders - we all have a part to play in keeping Wales and the UK safe. ""Please think carefully about where you are going and what you are doing. This virus thrives wherever we come together with others."" No. Atwo-week circuit-breaker took effect on 27 November,externalto help reduce transmission of the virus and Welsh legislations prevents travel. All children can go to school unless they have been asked to stay at home and self-isolate due to a Covid case in their class, bubble or year group. Yes - but only in Wales or to those areas of England and Scotland not in the highest level of restrictions. You can't go abroad. There are a small number of flights from UK airports but for ""essential purposes"" only, such as work or education. TheWelsh Government has said,externalinternational travel restrictions will continue and have warned they are likely to remain in place until at least January but ""kept under constant review"". You can still visit parts of Wales and other areas of the UK under lower levels of restrictions For those wanting to drive home to see family and friends to celebrate over the festive period,new rules will be introduced. From 23 to 27 December, people from across the UK will be able to meet. But with numbers limited to three households, some larger families, and those who have relatives who have separated, may face difficult choices when arranging the dinner table.

"UK coronavirus death toll passes 50,000It is the first European nation to pass the landmark, with 595 deaths recorded in the past 24 hours.","The UK has become the first country in Europe to pass 50,000 coronavirus deaths, according to the latest government figures. A total of 50,365 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test, up 595 in the past 24 hours. The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the US, Brazil, India and Mexico. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the figures showed, despite hopes for a vaccine, ""we are not out of the woods"". He said: ""Every death is a tragedy,"" but added: ""I do think we have got now to a different phase in the way that we treat it."" How the UK reached 50,000 virus deaths How many cases are there in your area? How does the UK compare to the rest of the world? A further 22,950 cases of coronavirus were recorded on Wednesday,government figures show,external. There have been some 1.2 million confirmed cases in the UK since the epidemic began, and more than 185,000 people have been admitted to hospital with the virus. The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over 65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more from Nick here. The government's death figures only include people who died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus -  but two other ways of measuring deaths give higher overall figures. The first includes all deaths where coronavirus was mentioned on the death certificate, even if the person had not been tested for the virus. The most recent figures suggest there had been more than 60,000 deaths by 23 October, by this measure. The second is a measure of ""excess deaths"" - the number of deaths over and above the usual number at this time of year. Deaths normally do rise at this time of the year, but the latest data from the Office for National Statistics and its counterparts in Scotland and Northern Ireland show the second wave of the virus has pushed the death rate above the average seen over the past five years. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the latest death figures were a ""grim milestone"" and criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the pandemic during the first wave. He said the government owed it to the families of those who have lost their lives to the virus ""to get on top"" of its response to the second wave. The British Medical Association (BMA) said lessons had to be learned. Dr Chaand Nagpaul, BMA council chair, said: ""This is a point that should never have been reached."" He added: ""Today's figure is a terrible indictment of poor preparation, poor organisation by the government, insufficient infection control measures, coupled with late and often confusing messaging for the public."" The government had to ""ensure that nothing on this scale ever happens again"", he added, with a public inquiry to ""go over every step with a fine-tooth comb"". It comes as officials said no decision has yet been made onhow people under the age of 50 should be offered a Covid vaccine. The current priority list of people who would get a vaccine in ""phase one"" starts with those living and working in care homes, then - in stages - everyone over 60 years old. But the list is subject to change, with close attention being paid to how the vaccines work in older age groups, who often have a weak response to immunisation. Attention has turned to how a vaccine will be rolled out after Pfizer and BioNTech revealedtheir vaccine protects more than 90% of peoplefrom developing Covid symptoms. The prime minister urged everybody to get a coronavirus vaccine once one becomes available, adding that the arguments of anti-vaccination activists were ""total nonsense"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âAnti-vax is total nonsense is total nonsense, you should definitely get a vaccine."" Mr Johnson would be happy to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Number 10 has said. On a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in south-east London on Wednesday, Mr Johnson said the prospect of a vaccine and the ramping up of testing were ""two big boxing gloves"" to ""pummel"" the virus with, but said: ""Neither of them is capable of delivering a knock-out blow on its own. ""That's why this country needs to continue to work hard to keep discipline and to observe the measures we've put in."" Please enable JavaScript or upgrade your browser to see this interactive   Here are only some of those who have died. To see all of them would take more than {{x}} hours. Restrictions have been tightened across the UK in recent weeks. In England,a new four-week lockdown started last Thursday- replacing the three-tier system until 2 December. Mr Johnson said England must ""get through this current period of tough autumn measures"" to ""hopefully"" curb the spread of the virus enough to allow Christmas to be ""as normal as possible for as many people as possible"". Meanwhile, pubs reopened and travel restrictions were lifted in Wales on Monday,as it ended a two-week ""firebreak"" lockdown. Additional restrictions in Northern Ireland are due to end on Friday aftera proposal from the Northern Ireland Assembly's health minister to extend restrictions was blocked. In Scotland,there is now a five-tier system of virus alert levelswith different measures in place in different parts of the country. The tiers are numbered from zero to four, with level four requiring the introduction of lockdown restrictions for that area. TESTING:What tests are available? JOBS:What is the job support scheme?

The lives lost in a single day,"Clockwise from top left: Keith, Mary, Rahima, Salina, Brian, Abdul, Bob Each day brings confirmation of hundreds more coronavirus deaths in the UK, each one marking a devastating loss for a family or community somewhere in the country. The UK announced its first coronavirus fatality in early March. By 12 April, which was Easter Sunday, there had been more than 10,000 confirmed hospital deaths. Less than two weeks later, that figure doubled again. The scale of the pandemic means it's easy for the stories of many of the virus' victims not to be heard. On 12 April alone, at least 1,174 people died in England and Wales. These are the stories of seven of those. Robert Savory, or Bob to all who knew him, would normally be organising Easter egg hunts or games like ""pin the carrot on the rabbit"". A doting grandad, Bob was rarely happier than when he was spending quality time with his family. It was a family tradition for everyone to gather at Bob and his wife Jo's house in Gloucestershire at weekends and on special occasions. But the house that would have been full with four children and seven grandchildren was quiet this year, as isolation measures prevented everyone getting together. By then, 63-year-old Bob had been admitted to hospital. He passed away that day. Bob was best known locally for his involvement in rugby club Chosen Hill Former Pupils RFC. The club said he was ""Chosen Hill through and through"", having held positions there from player to chairman. It was in the changing rooms of the club that Bob's shoulder-length mousy brown hair was shaved off some 40 years ago. His shaved head became his trademark look and following his death, friends and family shaved their own heads to raise money for local hospitals in honour of the man they jokingly called Dr Bob. More than 150 miles to the north-west in Cumbria, another sportsman and doting parent also died on Easter Sunday. Brian Arrowsmithspent his career in the lower reaches of the football league, but was a hero to the fans of his hometown club Barrow AFC. He started out playing at right-back in the 1960s, but was a versatile defender and served as captain when the club won promotion from the old Fourth Division. No-one made more appearances in the league for Barrow than Brian, and his impact was celebrated three years ago when the club named a stand after him. He was particularly proud of playing for his local team. He was born and bred on Walney Island, a sliver of land on the southern tip of Barrow-in-Furness that he described as ""God's little acre"". ""He was well known in the town and Brian couldn't walk past anybody without stopping and chatting,"" Jean, his wife of 56 years, said. Brian remained faithful to the football team for his entire life, transitioning from the pitch to the stands. The last match he would ever attend was in early March. Brian's beloved Barrow were defeated 0-2 by Notts County - their first home league loss since September. As usual Brian was offering his support at the sidelines, still hoping his club would win promotion. Weeks later the father-of-two contracted coronavirus and passed away in hospital, almost three months before his 80th birthday. Jean said he was at peace in his final moments. ""He would tell you if he was here that he had a great life."" Not everyone who passed away on Easter Sunday died in a hospital. Mary Andrewwas one of at least 339 people in England and Wales to die in a care home that day. Those deaths were not included in the more than 10,000 announced by the government up to that point. Mary had moved into a Derbyshire nursing home about seven months earlier, after a life defined by her independence. She started a career as a dispensing chemist, but her life's passion was the card game bridge. Mary set up her own bridge club in the 1960s and played tournaments, working her way up to the top of the standings to become a grandmaster, meaning she was one of the few people able to make a living from the game. Her son David, who jokingly refers to himself as a ""bridge orphan"", says the game was an obsession for Mary, who organised tournaments, clubs and holidays. An intellectual and gregarious woman, she was drawn to bridge because it was mentally stimulating and an opportunity for her to socialise. It also led to an unlikely encounter with a Hollywood heartthrob, when Mary played in a tournament with Lawrence of Arabia actor Omar Sharif at a London hotel in the 1960s. Mary shared her love for the game with hundreds of others, teaching people to play even in her 80s. She was also a ""scatterbrain"", says her son - she once took him and their family pet to the local shop and accidentally returned with only the dog. The last time David saw his 92-year-old mother, he was informed that there was a suspected case of coronavirus at the care home, meaning visits would be forbidden and residents kept in their rooms. Within weeks he got a call to say Mary had contracted coronavirus and that she would be put on an ""end of life pathway"". Mary had held on to the ashes of her husband, who died in 2012, so that they could be interred together. In their 63 years together, the couple had rarely spent a night apart. Coronavirus has not only taken the lives of people in care homes like Mary, but also the people looking after them, likeRahima Sidhanee. Caring was in her nature. Her home was full of orchids that she bought cheaply when they were past their best and then nursed back to life. If you invited her round for dinner, she would almost certainly bring some of her own food. The 69-year-old nurse was renowned among friends, family, neighbours and colleagues for her delicious and eclectic cooking. Her samosas stirred excitement at school fairs and efforts by family members to emulate her legendary roti always fell short. The last dinner her son Abu shared with her was just before the lockdown. He and his wife urged Rahima, who suffered from respiratory problems, to retire or at least take a break from work until the situation improved. But Rahima was a compassionate woman. She had been working at the Grennell Lodge nursing and care home in the town of Sutton for the past 20 years and was not prepared to give up when they needed her most. She continued working, and contracted coronavirus three weeks later. Rahima had what her son described as a basic upbringing on the Caribbean island of Trinidad, with no electricity, gas, or running water at home. She moved to the UK in the 1960s as part of a drive for recruitment into the NHS, and worked as a nurse and midwife before moving into the care sector. Her family were Hindu, but Rahima converted to Islam when she married. Despite divorcing some 30 years ago, the mother-of-three remained committed to her Muslim faith for the rest of her life. Described by Abu as quiet and understated, Rahima had suffered from depression in recent years. This meant that she wasn't as socially active as she might once have been, but she always maintained a close relationship with her family, particularly through the regular meals they would share at each other's houses. At this time in the Islamic calendar, Rahima and her loved ones would normally meet for iftar, the evening meal when Muslims break their fast during Ramadan. She died 11 days before the Muslim holy month began. One family friend, for whom she made chilli sauce every year, said Ramadan would never be the same again. Abdul Karim Sheikhalso emigrated to the UK in the 1960s. Born in Jalalpur Jattan in Pakistan's Punjab province as the eldest of 10 children, Abdul was always driven by dreams of a better life. That led him to the UK, where he settled in Newham, in east London. Abdul quickly became a central member of the community, dedicating his life to civic causes. ""It would literally not matter to him whether he was sleeping - you could knock on the door and he would wake up and answer the call. It didn't matter what time of day you came to our door,"" his son Saleem said. ""He always put himself second."" In one of his first acts in the community, Abdul helped found one of Newham's first mosques, serving the religious, social and cultural needs of the area's growing Muslim population. He was particularly dedicated to promoting racial equality and dialogue between different faiths, in what is one of London's most racially and culturally diverse boroughs. With a passion for debate and ideas for change, politics was a natural career choice for Abdul. He became a local councillor in 1990 and ceremonial mayor of Newham in 1998. His work took the boy from Punjab to Buckingham Palace, when his service to the Muslim community was recognised through the British Empire Medal. His son Saleem said his achievements were a source of great personal pride to Abdul. ""Coming from humble backgrounds to [being a mayor] in the UK was amazing,"" he said. Even in his 80s, Abdul continued to work on the causes close to his heart. His sons say he remained healthy and independent, and had recently returned from a trip overseas. But in April, Abdul developed a temperature and breathing difficulties. He was admitted to hospital and passed away within days. His family have been inundated with calls and cards from those whose lives he touched. ""He was loved by everybody. He's being missed by everyone in the community,"" his son Naeem said. While coronavirus has disproportionately affected older people, young people are also among those dying. At 37 years old, with a thriving business and children she adored,Salina Shawhad everything to look forward to. Salina strove to make the most of every moment, and employed her favourite phrase each day in urging loved ones to live their ""best life"". Salina was a ""vibrant character who stood out within a crowd"", her sister Simone said - someone who proved to others it was possible to be happy and successful as a single parent. She ran a child-minding business in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, and had also set up an affordable holiday club, which she hoped would bring communities together and allow parents to continue work during the school holidays. To Simone, she was a great listener who could always be relied upon to offer sound advice. Her biggest passion in life was her children. When the coronavirus outbreak hit the UK, she was heavily pregnant with her third daughter. She was admitted to hospital on 1 April, with suspected Covid-19. Other than gestational diabetes - a condition that can occur during pregnancy but usually disappears after giving birth - Salina was a healthy young woman with no other health conditions. Her baby was delivered via Caesarean section on 4 April, but Salina passed away just over a week later. Her daughters are now being looked after by family. Simone said Salina would ""shine within her children forever"". In the nearby Essex town of Romford,Keith Parkerwas also in hospital with coronavirus. With several underlying health conditions, Keith, 53, was among those particularly vulnerable to the pandemic. But he had overcome so much that family members jokingly called him ""the cat with nine lives"". Joanna first met Keith at school, when she had a crush on his best friend. The pair lost touch before their paths crossed again as adults in 2001. They agreed to meet for a meal, and three years later they married on the hottest day of the year. In recent years, Joanna had been his full-time carer. He was known among family and friends for his sense of humour. At a cousin's wedding, he started a flour and squirty cream fight. An old home video shows him putting M&Ms in his nose and blowing them out. The family loved going on holiday to Butlins, where Keith would be the first person to raise his hand to get up on stage. He fell ill with coronavirus in the week leading up to Easter Sunday. Other members of the family had also been unwell, but with relatively mild symptoms. By the Friday morning, Keith's condition had deteriorated - Joanna says his face had turned grey and his cheeks and nose purple from lack of oxygen. After he was taken to hospital, it quickly became clear that he would not survive. Joanna was allowed a short visit to say goodbye. Dressed in a gown, gloves and mask she struggled not to kiss or hug him. All she could do was hold his hand. When Joanna left the room, she stole a final look through a window into the room. ""I knew that was going to be the last time I was going to see him,"" she recalled. ""That would be it."" The family are now grappling with the reality of life without him. His infant granddaughter knew him as Grandad Munchkin. Every night she waves at a picture of him and blows a kiss. Do you have a story to share about your loved one?

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere.

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The UK government has defended its approach to rough sleeping as ""world leading"" amid criticism from Labour that it is providing ""neither the leadership nor the funding"" to tackle the problem. Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said that after the ""extraordinary effort"" to house rough sleepers early on in the pandemic the government had now ""lowered its ambition"". Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571.

How will students go home for Christmas?,"University students around the UK are beginning their journeys home for Christmas, after mass testing to screen them for coronavirus. Those in England and Wales are being asked to return home during the week-long ''travel window"" starting on Thursday after taking the tests, while Scotland isplanning a more staggered return.,external It is hoped this will reduce the risk of students spreading Covid-19 to their family and friends, following outbreaks on campuses earlier this term. Rapid Covid tests were distributed to universities at the end of November, so that students could be tested at the same time as England's lockdown ended on 2 December. Students who test negative have been asked to travel between 3 and 9 December, while general infection rates are lower. This means students ''pose a much-reduced risk to their loved ones and their community"", Universities Minister Michelle Donelan says. Universities in high-risk areas have been prioritised for testing, with results that can be turned around in an hour. Student Covid testing begins for Christmas exodus Testing facilities were set up at universities earlier in the year following outbreaks Unless they test positive or develop symptoms, students are encouraged to travel home during this timeframe, with any remaining teaching conducted online. Those found to have coronavirus will have to self-isolate for 10 days, but will still be able to get home in time for Christmas. This video can not be played How will I travel home in time for Christmas? Students are ""strongly advised"" to travel during the window, as they may not make it home for Christmas if they have to self-isolate later. Wales will follow a similar procedure to England,with students asked to travel by 9 December at the latest,and offered a rapid turnaround test before they go. Students in Scotland will be allowed to return homeif they return two negative tests,taken five days apart. Those who test positive would have to self-isolate before going home. The end dates of courses will be staggered to avoid a ""great surge of movement"" in December. The Northern Ireland Executive has not announced any specific plans for the travel windows but is also conducting mass testing of students. Students will havestaggered starting dates for returning to universities in England after Christmas- with some not back until 7 February. Students taking hands-on courses like medicine or performing arts would return from 4 to 18 January, with other subjects initially taught online. Other students would then return between 25 January and 7 February. The other UK nations have yet to publish their plans. Scotland's Universities Minister, Richard Lochhead, said lessons must be learned from outbreaks at the start of term in Augustbefore finalising plans for January. It's not yet known whether teaching in January will move online Most universities went into the new academic year offering a blend of in-person and online teaching. But some -including the two main ones in Manchester- had already suspended in-person teaching, while all universities will finish the autumn term online. Even if you can't attend lectures in person, it is unlikely you will get a refund if you can access your course online. The government has saidstudents shouldn't expect a refund,external''if they are receiving adequate online learning"". However, some MPs have called forstudents to receive discounts,externaland the National Union of Students wants refunds if ''quality of learning is severely impacted''. They may be receiving online tuition, but students have a right to access other resources too. ''If they don't have access to libraries and research facilities, students would have a claim for breach of contract,'' says Boz Michalowska-Howells, head of consumer law at Leigh Day solicitors. Any savings universities make by not providing facilities or through government schemes should be passed on to students via fee reductions, she adds. Higher education regulator the Office for Students (OfS) says it ''can and will investigate'' if it believes universities haven't taken all reasonable steps to protect standards. Some of those who have been told to self-isolate at short notice in halls are eligible for extra support. If someone in your accommodationdevelops coronavirus symptoms- a new, continuous cough, fever or loss of taste or smell - they should self-isolate immediately and arrange to be tested. The rest of their household should also self-isolate - for 14 daysuntil they know whether the test is positive.,externalThere arefines of up to Â£10,000 for failing to do so. What is self-isolation and who has to do it? Government guidance says universities should work with Public Health England to identify what a ""whole household isolation"" means in such circumstances. It says it would normally include ""students living in the same flat or on the same floor who share cooking or washing facilities"". In September, the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) - which works with the government - warned of ""significant outbreaks associated with higher education"". By early October, almost all of the local areas that had coronavirus case rates of over 1,000 also had high density student populations in England. A Sage paper also identified the end of term in mid-December as likely to lead to ""the peak health impacts of newly seeded infections due to...mass movement [of students]"".

Her 15-year-old sister had a kidney transplant some years ago and still has a weakened immune system, as does her mother who has rheumatoid arthritis. Also her uncle, one of the earliest of England's Covid cases, spent weeks on a ventilator before finally recovering. She says: ""That really brought home the fact that if any of my family get this virus, it would be devastating."" Reading the plans in the news to test students, before helping them get home, brought the third year University of Durham student ""a great sense of relief because it is a possible way out"". How will students go home for Christmas? Where will mass testing be available? She says: ""I think having designated days for people to leave may be a little difficult, especially within a week. ""But if it means I can get home safely then that's all that matters."" She adds: ""I definitely have good days and bad days. My housemates are quite good friends to me. They know how stressed I am. ""I've had days where I've rang my parents and said: 'I just want to come home.' ""They have been coming up with solutions like to stay in a hotel and isolate for two weeks, but they are also quite keen that I have some semblance of a university experience.""

This is known as surge testing - its purpose is to stop the spread of new forms of Covid at the very earliest stage. Increased testing and enhanced contact tracing iscarried out in very specific locations,external- local authority areas, postcodes or even individual streets. Some of this is carried out by health officials going door-to-door. It includes testing people who do not haveCovid symptoms. The testing also helps scientists better understand the new variants. Where is the Indian variant and how is it spreading? Surge testing is currently taking place in areas of England where the new Delta variant - first identified in India - is spreading fastest.

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid. The solution is then added to a test strip which shows a result in 20-30 minutes. Wherever you are in the UK, if you havesymptomsyou should book afree test online,external.

Government review urges capital gains tax overhaul,"The amount of tax levied on capital gains could be raised by billions of pounds, according to a new report. About Â£14bn could be raised by cutting exemptions and doubling rates, according to the review, which was commissioned by Chancellor Rishi Sunak. The main losers would wealthy people who own second homes or assets not shielded from tax. It comes as Chancellor Rishi Sunak looks for ways to cover the enormous costs of the coronavirus pandemic. In September, he reassured recently-elected Tory MPs there would not be a ""horror show of tax rises with no end in sight"". The Office for Tax Simplification (OTS), however, found that many current features of capital gains tax ""can distort behaviour"" as people try to lower their bills. No tax rise 'horror show', Sunak tells Tory MPs Capital gains tax review âstandard practiceâ The government-run body says the tax, levied at 10% for basic-rate taxpayers and 20% for higher-rate taxpayers, could be doubled if it were brought in line with income tax. Capital gains tax is the levy you pay on the profits - or gain - that you make when you sell, give away or dispose of something you own. For residential property, for example, it is charged at 18% or 28% for basic-rate taxpayers and higher-rate taxpayers respectively. The report also suggests the amount raised could also be boosted by cutting exemptions. At the moment, the first Â£12,300 of capital gains is exempt. About 50,000 taxpayers reported profits narrowly under that threshold last year. On Wednesday, the body said that the current rules were ""counter-intuitive"" and created ""odd incentives"".""The disparity in rates between capital gains tax and income tax can distort business and family decision-making and creates an incentive for taxpayers to arrange their affairs in ways that effectively re-characterise income as capital gains,"" the report said. Before dropping your jaw in horror that the Office of Tax Simplification is suggesting capital gains tax could be brought more in line with income tax - or doubled - pause for a second. In most years, most of us won't pay it. In fact, even if the number of people paying it trebled, it probably still wouldn't be you. More than 31 million people pay tax on their income, raising Â£180bn in 2017/18. By contrast, only 265,000 pay tax on capital gains - the profits they make when they sell assets such as shares or bonds. The first Â£12,300 is exempt; and because you can control when you sell an asset and realise a gain, many - some 50,000 - can arrange their affairs so any gain they made comes just in under the threshold. And when they do pay capital gains tax, it's at half the rate of income tax. The OTS report says most gains are concentrated among relatively few taxpayers, who are paying ""proportionately less"" tax than everyone else. In other words, the light capital gains tax regime aggravates the already yawning inequality of wealth between the few who can actually make capital gains and the many - who will rarely or never do so. The independent tax adviser also suggested scrapping the rule which allows capital gains tax to be wiped on inherited assets, as well as removing relief for investors selling shares in unlisted companies who have had them for a minimum of three years. If the recommendations are taken on by the government, thousands of taxpayers may face higher rates on the profits made on selling second homes or investments. Mr Sunak commissioned the report in July, but does not have to accept its findings. A spokesperson for the Treasury said: ""The government's priority right now is supporting jobs and the economy. ""We thank the OTS for their independent report which will be considered in due course.""

'Voice heard' at vanished girl's holiday home,"NÃ³ra Quoirin was reported missing on the morning of 4 August 2019 The mother of a British girl found dead in a Malaysian jungle heard a voice inside their family chalet the night her daughter went missing, an inquest heard. NÃ³ra Quoirin, from London, was reported missing on 4 August 2019. Her body was discovered nine days later. Meabh Quoirin, who believes her daughter was abducted, said she heard a ""voice"" inside the chalet. She was not concerned as she ""was not fully conscious"", she told the court. NÃ³ra's family, from Balham, were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur, when they reported NÃ³ra missing, the day after they had arrived. The 15-year-old, who was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development, was eventually found by a group of civilian volunteers in a palm-oil plantation less than two miles from the holiday home. Mrs Quoirin told the court in Seremban, Malaysia, she recounted hearing ""muffled sounds"" at the front of the resort on the night her daughter went missing. She added that it sounded like young people having a party. She said she fell into a deep sleep after that and did not leave the bed at any point in the night to avoid waking up and exacerbating her jet-lag, the inquest heard. Mrs Quoirin added she distinctly remembered being aware of muffled sounds in the chalet at another point saying that they ""felt very close"". Group 'waited hours' after schoolgirl's body find NÃ³ra Quoirin 'possibly alive amid first searches' 'Broken window' at holiday home girl vanished from She was not concerned by the voices as she was not fully conscious, she explained to the court. At 07:30, NÃ³ra's father Sebastien went to the mezzanine level of the chalet where Nora had been sharing a double bed with her 12-year-old sister Innes. It was then that they discovered their daughter was missing, Mrs Quoirin said. NÃ³ra's mother said her daughter ""wasn't very autonomous"" and that she could not manage zips or buttons Describing NÃ³ra learning and physical difficulties, Mrs Quoirin said that her daughter had ""a lot of physical challenges"" with her motor skills and struggled with balance and coordination. She described how if NÃ³ra tried to run or move quickly she would have an ""awkward gait and she would stumble if it was not flat."" Mrs Quoirin added that her daughter struggled with zips and buttons and that she had ""core strength"" problems. ""She would tire easily just sitting"", Mrs Quoirin said. ""Her school day was very tiring, just sitting would demand quite a lot of effort."" The mother said that her eldest daughter did not do anything at home without her help. ""She would always sit beside her mum or dad ... she never went anywhere by herself,"" she told the court. ""Overall we explained it that she had a mental age of about five or six."" Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate NÃ³ra Mrs Quoirin rejected the possibility that her daughter might have wandered off alone. ""Scratchings and markings"" were found on NÃ³ra's body, but the mother claimed they were not consistent with a child walking naked in the jungle ""constantly"". ""Nora always moved slowly,"" she added. Mrs Quoirin said a lot of damage would be done to the body because of the terrain and that it would have been ""extremely difficult"" for NÃ³ra to navigate it. The inquest continues.

Clothes and book sellers furious at lockdown rules,"Naomi Walker says fashion boutiques 'are being slowly strangled to death' Retailers forced to close because their businesses are deemed ""non-essential"" have hit out at the government's latest lockdown rules for England. James Daunt, the boss of Waterstones, told the BBC that bookshops were ""a support for people"" and should be allowed to stay open. Meanwhile, 60 independent fashion shops have teamed up to campaign against the impact of the coronavirus curbs. Boutiques in Business say that the government should think again. The organisation is led by fashion shop owner Amanda Leigh Slattery, who complains that ""essential"" retailers such as supermarkets and garden centres are being allowed to sell ""non-essential"" items including clothes. ""You can go to supermarkets and buy chinos, jeans or a white shirt - none of that is essential,"" she said. Ms Leigh Slattery said her own shop, Maya Maya in Kendal, was managing to stay above water, but a lot of fashion boutiques ""have Â£100,000 of stock sat in our stockrooms because we didn't sell it this summer"". Shops criticise lockdown rules on essential items Tesco 'wrong' to say period products not essential Which shops will still be open in lockdown? In protest against the restrictions, the group of boutiques are turning their shop-window mannequins around, as they say that the government has turned its back on them. ""It just feels completely unfair. I'm absolutely livid,"" said another shop owner, Naomi Walker, who runs the Bombshell Betty Boutique in Garstang, Lancashire. Mannequins are turned in Betty Bombshell Boutique as part of a protest against the restrictions ""Our landlords want our rent paid. Our suppliers want their invoices paid,"" said Ms Walker. ""We can't sell a thing. In the last lockdown, I didn't take a penny. ""November is our busiest trading month and we're hamstrung. I feel we are being slowly strangled to death."" The Booksellers Association has also written to government ministers calling for independent bookshops to be classed as essential retailers during the lockdown, which will last until 2 December. Waterstones' Mr Daunt told the BBC's Today programme: ""I think we are a support for people as they work through their lockdowns. ""The government knows and does recognise that retail as a whole is very safe environment, which is why so much of it is open,"" he said. This video can not be played How do you sell books in a lockdown? He argued that ""arbitrary lines"" had been drawn, with smaller bookshops forced to shut, while large newsagents such as WHSmith, which sell books alongside other items, were able to stay open. ""It can be catastrophically unfair on some people. The question is, has the line been remotely sensibly drawn? And in this case, I think not."" Without a good run-up to the key Christmas trading period, the outlook is bleak for smaller bookshops, he said. ""I have absolutely no doubt that if small bookshops do not get their Christmas, that many of them will go out of business."" The British Retail Consortium has said it does not agree with the decision to close ""non-essential"" retail outlets, arguing that their role in spreading the virus is minor. It estimates that Â£2bn of sales will be lost in November. Last week, the British Independent Retail Associationcalled for greater government intervention over retail restrictions,external. However, the Department For Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy maintained that the new restrictions had been brought in to limit social contact and slow the spread of coronavirus. ""We recognise this continues to be a very difficult period for businesses, which is why we've confirmed that there will be a full package of financial support in place,"" a government spokesperson said.

Covid on campus,"Messages from locked-down students at Manchester Metropolitan University Anoushka Mutanda Dougherty was in the first year of her degree at Manchester University when the pandemic began and all students were sent home. Now she's back and has been finding out from friends and first-year students how the pandemic is affecting their social lives. When coronavirus first stopped uni dead in its tracks back in March, I like most of my friends was expecting only a brief interlude to life as we knew it. I hadn't foreseen we'd be experiencing a second wave at the start of the next academic year - or that students arriving for the first time would be subjected to the horror that is virtual freshers. With nightclubs shuttered for the foreseeable future, the rule of six and the 10pm closure of bars and restaurants, the possibility for socialising is pretty bleak and must be a particularly heavy blow to freshers, who would normally expect to be meeting hundreds of new people and doing some intense partying. However, as I began to speak to people, I was surprised by the amount of optimism. It seemed that after months of lockdown, some students were grateful just to get out of their parents' house. And one way or another - responsibly or irresponsibly - lots of them were finding ways of socialising. For many first-years it's been a really tough few months. Their years at school came to an abrupt halt. Most were put under huge stress when the algorithm gave them bad results. Now they are borrowing thousands of pounds to be at university and won't be getting anything like a normal university experience. Anoushka (left) and her friend, Ria, in the pre-Covid era Is it realistic to expect them to socialise only with the other people in the flats in their halls of residence? What if they don't immediately get on with them - do we want them to be miserable and lonely? This pandemic is really serious, but so is mental health. I'm not sure how I would be coping in the first-years' shoes. I know after my parents dropped me off, I was disappointed that university didn't instantly live up to my expectations - and that was with all the normal freshers' week perks. I don't know if it's the same for boys, but a lot of the bonding took place for the girls when we were all drunk in the bathroom toilets of a club, and we were all telling each other how much we love each other. It kind of broke down those walls, and I'm not sure how else you get over that hump of awkwardness. Outside the hall where I lived last year, I met Sarah, a first-year who hasn't yet become close friends with her flatmates. The university hasn't explained how to meet coursemates, she told me. When she arrived she was given the key to her room, but there was no great announcement, she was just told to keep checking her emails. ""There haven't really been freshers' events,"" she says. ""I think everyone's just a bit confused about why we're here for two weeks without anything to do."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Helping to fill this vacuum are the friends she knew in London, where she went to school. And there have been parties in student halls. These were against government guidelines - with 20 or 25 people, sometimes more - but for her they were one of the few positive experiences she'd had since she arrived in Manchester. I mentioned to Sarah that I'd heard about a lot of flat parties on the university's Fallowfield campus, and a mosh pit outside one of the houses. So why wasn't campus security shutting them down? Sarah said that she had seen security staff. ""Like you kind of see them patrolling the area and stuff and they shut down the big ones [parties], but then people just migrate to another."" My friend Gabriel who I knew at school, but who took a gap year and has only just arrived, also thinks the university has been half-hearted about enforcing the rules, as if they didn't really expect people to follow them. It's true that people have been bombarded with emails about social distancing, and Gabriel says his name was taken at a party by some graduate students dressed in green uniforms - a sign that he may receive a warning - but otherwise it's been up to the students themselves to behave responsibly. And inevitably some haven't. After meeting Eve, I came across Bo, a student from Wuhan in China, where the coronavirus pandemic began. He told me that students have gone back to university there, but they all have to have a test first. Once it's confirmed that they haven't got the virus, they can socialise freely. Students returning to study at university in Wuhan Here, in some cases, it's almost like the opposite has been happening. People arrive at university, quickly find that they have been infected, and then socialise freely with others who are Covid-positive. Dimitry is in a hall at Manchester Metropolitan university that has been locked down for two weeks, which means, he says, that ""we can all socialise more - we don't really have to worry about the rule of six"". He goes to parties where people discuss their test results and their symptoms (which are usually mild - maybe a headache or a slight cough, or loss of taste and smell). Dimitry in lockdown ""I don't think it would have been like that if they hadn't done the lockdown. But now everyone is locked down for two weeks anyway, so if you really wanted to avoid getting Corona, you would literally have to stay in your room - and even then people in your flat would probably still give it to you,"" he says. ""So there's an inevitability in terms of catching the virus and most people are just like, 'Are we that bothered?'"" I've heard about other parties held specifically for students who are Covid-positive. Ruby, who studies in Leeds, told me about one she was invited to at a house where people were ""isolating"", and you could only get in by showing a positive test result on your phone. Ruby lives with her friends Amelia and Pav and a number of other students in a shared house. She says when two of them got positive test results the rest reluctantly agreed to isolate - and only after trips out to Nando's and a hairdresser's, and a mission to buy a pet fish. Amelia, Ruby and Pav preparing for seven days of fun in isolation Now they are intending to make the best of it. ""We're planning seven days of fun,"" says Ruby. ""We've ordered some clay today. We're having a week of activities planned, with themes for each room. We're going to have a party in each room in the house, just for the people in our house."" Amelia says that before their positive test results they weren't trying especially hard not to become infected, and that there was even a feeling that it would be better to get it now, when there was no risk of infecting their parents. Some people might disagree with this attitude, I pointed out. She replied that they had actually been pretty careful, only mixing with other students. They'd only made two socially distanced visits to the pub, and had worn masks on public transport. Last purchase before isolating - a goldfish ""I also think, now that we've had this scare, 'Oh my God, I went to the shop - and the man who works at the shop, I don't know where he lives and who he lives with,'"" she says. ""So we are thinking about it, and now that we know, we're being really careful, just staying in."" Pav thinks it's easy to criticise students who have caught the virus. ""People are like, 'You shouldn't have been doing this. You shouldn't have been doing that.' But really everyone's been doing it, all students, because it's a social place, people are mixing whatever they might say. It's part of being at university to mix and meet up with others."" I have met people who have been socialising only with the people in their student flats and houses. My friend, Lily, has thrived in isolation after testing positive, racking up her Uber Eats bill and watching hours of Desperate Housewives in her room. Lily, in isolation, collecting a birthday present At the other end of the scale, there are undoubtedly students who have been recklessly breaking rules. But bear in mind that academic fees are staying the same, despite everything, and that most students in enforced lockdown are still paying rent. Plenty of students think they were told to come back, instead of being instructed to stay at home and study online, because the university and the city needed their money. And some, like Gabriel, point out that the university hasn't done much apart from sending emails to show it's serious about enforcing the rules. On top of that, little has been done to prevent some students feeling isolated, and mental health support is drastically below par. Listen toBack to Union Monday 26 October at 20:00 on BBC Radio 4 Follow@Anoushka_md,externaland radio producer@SueM1tchell,externalon Twitter A University of Manchester spokesman said in a statement that the safety and well-being of students was the University's primary concern and that it would support them in every way it could. ""We have put in place a comprehensive support package for all students who are self-isolating, that includes a partnership with a major food retailer, delivery of parcels, support on well-being and practical matters such as laundry and prescription medicine. This has been communicated to all of our students,"" the statement said. ""We realise that the current restrictions on socialising are difficult for our new students in particular so we have worked with our Students' Union to put in place a welcome programme with a large number and variety of events.

Hampstead Heath pond searched for missing man,"Dive teams will search the No1 pond in Highgate ""over the coming weeks"" police said Police divers are searching a pond on Hampstead Heath for the body of a man who disappeared nearly eight years ago. Robert Duff, who would now be 45, has not been seen since 12 January 2013 when he failed to attend his daughter's 18th birthday party. Police now believe his remains might be in the No1 pond in Highgate, Camden, after new information came to light. Mr Duff's mother said the prospect his remains could be in ""a pond I walk past regularly is quite upsetting"". Helen Duff, 67, called the original investigation ""a complete shambles"". ""The appropriate steps weren't taken even though we told them that Robert's actions were completely out of character,"" she said. ""It feels like a lot of time has been wasted and evidence lost."" In May 2018, two men were arrested on suspicion of murdering Mr Duff but were later released under investigation. Robert Duff would be 45 today The Met has worked on the theory that Mr Duff was involved in a fight with two men on the day he vanished and was killed that evening. That night several people saw him in a flat in Bredgar Road in Archway, north London. Det Insp Tom Williams said: ""My team remains committed to finding Robert and providing the answers that his family are so desperately longing for. ""Following previous appeals, information was provided to my team that has led us to conduct a search of the No1 pond in Highgate. ""This work will continue over the coming weeks.""

Guinness recalls cans over contamination fearsThe firm has recalled cans of its non-alcoholic stout just two weeks after they were launched.Business,"The recall affects cans of Guinness 0.0 Guinness is recalling cans of its non-alcoholic stout because of contamination fears, just two weeks after they were launched. The brewer described the recall as ""precautionary"", but said ""microbiological contamination"" might mean some products were unsafe. The company urged anyone with cans of Guinness 0.0 not to drink them. It said it was working with supermarkets and other shops to remove all of the products from the shelves. The recall only affects customers in Great Britain, as the product was not yet on sale in Ireland or Northern Ireland. No other Guinness drinks have been recalled. Guinness 0.0 was launched to much fanfare in supermarkets on 26 October, having taken the brewer four years to perfect.

On its website, the brewery also says its team is ""working hard to investigate and determine the root cause"" of the contamination.

It is produced with the same amounts of water, barley, hops and yeast as a traditional Guinness, before the alcohol is removed using a cold filtration method. At the time of launch, Guinness bosses insisted that none of the traditional flavour had been lost, with the seal of approval being given by independent taste testers. The new product was due to become available on draught in pubs next spring, before being launched in other parts of the world later in 2021.

Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers resign en masse,"This video can not be played Wu Chi-wai, Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker 'announces mass resignations' All of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers have announced their resignation after Beijing forced the removal of four of their colleagues. On Wednesday Beijing passed a resolution allowing the city's government to dismiss politicians deemed a threat to national security. The opposition lawmakers then said they would leave in solidarity. For the first time since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 the body has almost no dissenting voices. BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonnell says the legislature was already stacked in favour of the pro-Beijing camp. The dismissal of the four legislators is viewed by many as the latest attempt by China to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms - something Beijing denies. Why students abroad fear Hong Kong's new law China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong activist hailed as the 'real Mulan' Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai told reporters following the lawmakers' removal: ""We can no longer tell the world that we still have 'one country, two systems', this declares its official death."" This video can not be played Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudio Mo: ""They are forcing us to quit"" Hong Kong - formerly a British colony - was returned to China under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which allowed it to retain more rights and freedoms than the mainland until 2047. But in late June China passed a controversial, far-reaching national security law in the territory after years of pro-democracy and anti-Beijing protests, which reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. The city's pro-democracy legislators had 19 seats in the 70-seat legislature. All those members have now left - either by resigning or by being dismissed. The new resolution passed by China's National People's Congress Standing Committee on Wednesday says that lawmakers should be disqualified if they support Hong Kong independence, refuse to acknowledge China's sovereignty, ask foreign forces to interfere in the city's affairs or in other ways threaten national security. This video can not be played Pro-Beijing lawmaker Michael Tien says China needed to take action to allow Hong Kong's legislature to function It also allows the Hong Kong government to directly remove lawmakers without having to approach the courts. Moments after that resolution passed, four lawmakers - Alvin Yeung, Kwok Ka-ki and Dennis Kwok of the Civic Party and Kenneth Leung of the Professionals Guild - were dismissed. All four of them are considered moderates and they have never supported Hong Kong independence. ""If observing due process and fighting for democracy can lead to being disqualified, it [disqualification] will be my honour,"" Dennis Kwok said. Critics warn the law will shut down dissent ""We... will stand with our colleagues who are disqualified. We will resign en masse,""  Wu Chi-wai said. The 15 lawmakers' letter of resignation will be submitted on Thursday. Two opposition lawmakers remain in the legislature - Cheng Chung-tai from the Civic Passion party and Pierre Chan, a medical doctor and lawmaker. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the disqualification of the four lawmakers was ""rational, reasonable and in line with the constitution and laws"". ""This was a necessary requirement for adhering to and improving on 'one country, two systems,' implementing Hong Kong's Basic Law, as well as Hong Kong's National Security Law,"" he said at a news conference in Beijing. But others have criticised the move. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the Chinese resolution ""a further assault on Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and freedoms under the UK-China Joint Declaration"". ""This campaign to harass, stifle and disqualify democratic opposition tarnishes China's international reputation and undermines Hong Kong's long-term stability."" Human rights organisation Amnesty International has also condemned the resolution. ""Bulldozing through arbitrary decisions via the Chinese government makes a mockery of the rule of law,"" Asia-Pacific regional director Yamini Mishra said. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said opinions in the legislature had to be expressed ""in a responsible manner"" The territory's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, is pro-Beijing and is supported by the central government there. Speaking to the media, Ms Lam said the four council members who were disqualified had already failed to meet the requirements to stand in the now postponed elections next year. She added that although she ""welcomes diverse opinions in the Legislative Council"" these had to be expressed ""in a responsible manner"". South China Morning Post newspaper quoted Ms Lam as saying no by-elections would be held in the four now vacant seats as legislative elections were only nine months away. The Chinese government and its surrogates in Carrie Lam's administration have - in recent times - used specific problems as a series of excuses to introduce wholesale, Draconian changes which will remain in place long after whatever hurdle it is has been cleared. In this case, four legislators had, controversially, been ruled ineligible for the next Legislative Council election. However, because the term of the current legislature had been extended for a year, due to a delayed vote, they had been able to remain in their existing positions. The four lawmakers after they were removed Carrie Lam wanted them gone straight away so she says she asked Beijing to introduce a new law enabling their immediate dismissal. In reality, who knows whether Hong Kong's leader requested this move or was told it was going to happen by the Communist Party's senior leadership? Either way, now the city government has been empowered to remove any pro-democracy politician who is seen to have acted with insufficient loyalty to the motherland in the future. Crucially, the courts can be bypassed under the new rules and, now that the Hong Kong government has said that the concept of the separation of powers has never actually applied in the city, the executive branch is able to dismiss members of the legislature and their view is that this is not really anything to worry about. As a Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong was to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech. Butthe new security law for the citypassed in response to months of pro-democracy protests criminalised ""secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces"". Beijing said the law will return stability to the territory, but critics said it effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest. After the introduction of the security law the UK offered Hong Kong residents still holding British National Overseas (BNO) status a route to British citizenship. What is a BNO passport? What is behind the Hong Kong citizenship offer? Around 300,000 people currently hold BNO passports, while an estimated 2.9 million people born before the handover are eligible for one. China last month strongly criticised the UKin response, telling London to ""immediately correct its mistakes"".

Students' lockdown dilemma,"The National Union of Students said students should have the choice whether to go home University students across England have been told they should not return home for the new lockdown. But many have already endured enforced isolation, had their lecturers moved online and are now unsure if the lockdown will be extended into Christmas. For some the prospect of four more weeks away from home is just too much to bear. Universities minister, Michelle Donelan,has written to students advising them to stay at their current accommodationto protect their loved ones. But the National Union of Students (NUS) said they should be able to return home before lockdown begins on Thursday. It said many students are concerned about the new restrictions and want the support of their families. NUS president Larissa Kennedy said it is understandable some students will want to leave university accommodation during this ""challenging period"". She said the government must ensure students are able to travel home safely before lockdown starts in line with current guidance for the wider population, which allows people to move homes and form new households until Thursday, and ""stop subjecting them to stricter rules than everyone else"". Ms Kennedy said: ""From online learning to long periods of self-isolation, often from shoebox rooms, students' experiences this term have been far from what they were led to expect. ""Many have recently gone through accommodation lockdowns and the mental health implications of making students stay longer than they want or need to cannot be underestimated."" Abbie Hobbs (left) and Hannah Yardley (right) are staying on in Bournemouth Hannah Yardley, 20, and her housemate Abbie Hobbs, 21, have decided to stay at Bournemouth University for lockdown in their off-campus accommodation. ""I'm staying because all my housemates are staying and I also live with someone who is doing the same course as me so it's easier to do our work together,"" said Hannah. The psychology student from Overton, Hampshire, added: ""I'm not too worried because I spent most of the last lockdown in halls and it was fine. ""However, if lockdown gets extended to Christmas, I probably will try to go home because everyone will want to be with their families and especially because my mum lives on her own. But I don't know if this will be allowed and I don't want to put people at risk."" Abbie hopes to be able to go home to Marlborough, Wiltshire, for Christmas but only ""as long as I wouldn't be putting my family at risk"". She added: ""I think it will be more fun continuing to live with friends in Bournemouth during lockdown. ""I don't think it will feel too different than with the current restrictions as we don't really go out anyway. Will Roberts is staying in Sheffield to work as a care assistant University of Sheffield student Will Roberts intends to stay in the city over lockdown to continue working as a part-time care assistant. The 22-year-old has housemates who are also choosing to stay, but said students would ignore restrictions if it meant they could not return home for Christmas. The international development student, from Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said: ""It's only meant to be a month and everyone knows students are going to go home for Christmas regardless of what happens."" But he added: ""If it came to Christmas and I wasn't allowed to go, I'd still go home as I get tested for coronavirus every week at work. ""Also my housemates and I are quite careful, and we don't have anyone else in our house. ""There's no chance I'm going to stay in Sheffield for Christmas unless I'm working."" Matt Wincott thinks there is little point staying in Bristol during lockdown Matt Wincott lives in a shared house with three other people who are all planning to go home for lockdown. The 20-year-old, who is studying business and management at Bristol University, said: ""I do not want to spend a month in Bristol on my own. ""Also, with all my lectures online I could be anywhere in the country, so it seems sensible to go home as it seems a safer place to be."" He said the government advice ""hasn't been very straightforward"". ""I am meant to be in the university twice a week for lessons but with the majority of people I know going home I'm not sure how or if these lessons will proceed. ""As a final year student, the lessons are important, but I can't justify staying in uni accommodation on my own to go into the university twice a week. ""The new rules have affected my decision hugely. With pubs shutting yet again Bristol has lost its last semblance of nightlife. ""I think I had my mind set from the first announcement. I feel maybe I could have stayed if my whole flat collectively decided we would but, as of now, two of them have already gone."" Reading University student Lucy wants to be with her parents University of Reading student Lucy Coleman said she will spend lockdown at home rather than living at her university house. The 21-year-old said she feels there is no point being on campus when her lectures are all online. The mathematics student from Sherborne, Dorset, said: ""When a second lockdown was announced my immediate reaction was to phone my parents to discuss it with them. ""If there are no sports or socialising it can get very lonely, so I just wanted to be with my parents. ""I know universities aren't necessarily affected, but I feel they may end up closing the library and stuff. ""And if they extend the lockdown I definitely don't want to be stuck here over Christmas.""

Rolls Royce plans UK class of mini-nuclear plants,"Supporters maintain that small nuclear reactors can be unobtrusive and safe A consortium led by Rolls-Royce has announced plans to build up to 16 mini-nuclear plants in the UK. It says the project will create 6,000 new jobs in the Midlands and the North of England over the next five years. The prime minister is understood to be poised to announce at least Â£200m for the project as part of a long-delayed green plan for economic recovery. Rolls-Royce argues that as well as producing low-carbon electricity, the concept may become an export industry. The company's UK ""small modular reactor"" (SMR) group includes the National Nuclear Laboratory and the building company Laing O'Rourke. Last year, it received Â£18m to begin the design effort for the SMR concept. New nuclear plant at Sizewell set for green light UK's nuclear future to be decided at key meeting The government says new nuclear is essential if the UK is to meet its target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050 - where any carbon released is balanced out by an equivalent amount absorbed from the atmosphere. But there is a nuclear-sized hole opening up in the energy network. Six of the UK's seven nuclear reactor sites are due to go offline by 2030 and the remaining one, Sizewell B, is due to be decommissioned in 2035. Together they account for around 20% of the country's electricity. Rolls-Royce and its partners argue that instead of building huge nuclear mega-projects in muddy fields we should construct a series of smaller nuclear plants from ""modules"" made in factories. The aim is to re-engineer nuclear power as a very high-tech Lego set. The components would be broken down into a series of hundreds of these modules which would be made in a central factory and shipped by road to the site for assembly. The objective is to tackle the biggest problem nuclear power faces:  the exorbitant cost. The reason it is so expensive is that the projects are huge and complex and have to meet very high safety standards. And, because so few new nuclear power stations are built, there are very few opportunities to learn from mistakes. EDF says Sizewell C will provide electricity for six million homes and create 25,000 jobs So, Rolls-Royce and its partners are saying: let's make them smaller and make lots of them so that we get really good at it. The concept would dramatically reduce the amount of construction that would be associated with a nuclear project, claimed Tom Samson, the chief executive of the UK Small Modular Reactor consortium (UK SMR). ""If we move all that activity into a controlled factory environment that drives down cost by simplification and standardisation,"" he explained. Each plant would produce 440 megawatts of electricity - roughly enough to power Sheffield - and the hope is that, once the first few have been made, they will cost around Â£2bn each. The consortium says the first of these modular plants could be up and running in 10 years, after that it will be able to build and install two a year. By comparison, the much larger nuclear plant being built at Hinkley Point in Somerset is expect to cost some Â£22bn but will produce more than 3 gigawatts of electricity - over six times as much. In addition to the six nuclear plants going offline by 2030, there's another challenge. You have to factor in a massive increase in electricity demand over the coming decades. That's because if we're going to reach our net zero target, we need to stop using fossil fuels for transport and home heating. The government has said this could lead to a three-fold increase in electricity use. The government says it remains committed to the construction of new nuclear power stations UK SMR isn't the only player which has spotted that there could be a gap in the market for smaller reactors. There are dozens of different companies around the world working on small reactor projects. That has got the critics of nuclear power worried. Greenpeace and other environmental groups say small nuclear power stations pose similar risks of radioactive releases and weapons proliferation as big ones. Greenpeace UK's chief scientist, Doug Parr, said that if the government wanted to take a punt on some new technology to tackle climate change it would be better off investing in hydrogen or geothermal power. And there are other reasons to question the SMR concept, says Prof MV Ramana of the University of British Columbia in Canada. He is a physicist and an expert on nuclear energy policy who has studied small modular reactors. He said UK SMR's 10-year time-scale for its first plant may prove optimistic.  The one constant in the history of the nuclear industry to date is that big new concepts never come in on time and budget, he said. He is sceptical that the factory concept can deliver significant cost savings given the complexity and scale of even a small nuclear plant. Smaller plants will have to meet the same rigorous safety standards as big ones, he points out. He said that where the concept has been tried elsewhere - in the US and China, for example - there have been long delays and costs have ended up being comparable to those of large nuclear power stations. Finally, he questioned whether there will be a market for these plants by the 2030s, when UK SMR says the first will be ready. ""Ten years from now, the competition will be renewables which are going to be far cheaper with much better storage technology than we have today,"" said Prof Ramana. Download the updated BBC Energy Briefing (10.4MB),external(PDF, 10.4MB) The road to clean energy But Boris Johnson's powerful adviser, Dominic Cummings, is known to be taken with the modular nuclear idea. One of the reasons the government has been fighting so hard to free itself from the EU's state aid rules is so it can get its shoulder behind technologies it thinks will give the UK economy and its workers a real boost. Modular nuclear has the potential to do just that. If Rolls-Royce and its partners can show that the factory concept really does deliver high quality nuclear plants on time and on budget then there is potentially a huge world market for the technology. The price per unit of electricity may be higher than with wind or solar, said the clean energy consultant Michael Liebreich, but nuclear delivers power pretty much 24/7 and therefore can command a premium. UK SMR is pitching the concept as a UK solution to the global challenge of tackling climate change and says there will be a vast export market as the world starts to switch to low carbon energy. Boris Johnson is rumoured to be planning to take a big punt on nuclear power. His government has always said new nuclear is going to be a key part of Britain's future energy system. As well as the potential investment in SMRs, the BBC has already reported that the government is expected to give the long-discussed new large nuclear plant at Sizewell in Suffolk the go-ahead. Mr Johnson is expected to say these investments are essential if the UK is going to meet its promise to decarbonise the economy by 2050 as part of the worldwide effort to tackle climate change. And, while there may be good reasons to question whether the SMR concept will deliver on its promise of low-cost nuclear power, there is no question it holds out exactly the kind of optimistic vision for the UK's industrial future the government is desperate for.

'Voices heard' at vanished girl's holiday home,"NÃ³ra Quoirin was reported missing on the morning of 4 August 2019 The mother of a British girl found dead in a Malaysian jungle heard a voice inside their family chalet the night her daughter went missing, an inquest heard. NÃ³ra Quoirin, from London, was reported missing on 4 August 2019. Her body was discovered nine days later. Meabh Quoirin, who believes her daughter was abducted, said she heard a ""voice"" inside the chalet. She was not concerned as she ""was not fully conscious"", she told the court. NÃ³ra's family, from Balham, were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur, when they reported NÃ³ra missing, the day after they had arrived. The 15-year-old, who was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development, was eventually found by a group of civilian volunteers in a palm-oil plantation less than two miles from the holiday home. Mrs Quoirin told the court in Seremban, Malaysia, she recounted hearing ""muffled sounds"" at the front of the resort on the night her daughter went missing. She added that it sounded like young people having a party. She said she fell into a deep sleep after that and did not leave the bed at any point in the night to avoid waking up and exacerbating her jet-lag, the inquest heard. Mrs Quoirin added she distinctly remembered being aware of muffled sounds in the chalet at another point saying that they ""felt very close"". Group 'waited hours' after schoolgirl's body find NÃ³ra Quoirin 'possibly alive amid first searches' 'Broken window' at holiday home girl vanished from She was not concerned by the voices as she was not fully conscious, she explained to the court. At 07:30, NÃ³ra's father Sebastien went to the mezzanine level of the chalet where Nora had been sharing a double bed with her 12-year-old sister Innes. It was then that they discovered their daughter was missing, Mrs Quoirin said. NÃ³ra's mother said her daughter ""wasn't very autonomous"" and that she could not manage zips or buttons Describing NÃ³ra learning and physical difficulties, Mrs Quoirin said that her daughter had ""a lot of physical challenges"" with her motor skills and struggled with balance and coordination. She described how if NÃ³ra tried to run or move quickly she would have an ""awkward gait and she would stumble if it was not flat."" Mrs Quoirin added that her daughter struggled with zips and buttons and that she had ""core strength"" problems. ""She would tire easily just sitting"", Mrs Quoirin said. ""Her school day was very tiring, just sitting would demand quite a lot of effort."" The mother said that her eldest daughter did not do anything at home without her help. ""She would always sit beside her mum or dad ... she never went anywhere by herself,"" she told the court. ""Overall we explained it that she had a mental age of about five or six."" Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate NÃ³ra Mrs Quoirin rejected the possibility that her daughter might have wandered off alone. ""Scratchings and markings"" were found on NÃ³ra's body, but the mother claimed they were not consistent with a child walking naked in the jungle ""constantly"". ""Nora always moved slowly,"" she added. Mrs Quoirin said a lot of damage would be done to the body because of the terrain and that it would have been ""extremely difficult"" for NÃ³ra to navigate it. The inquest continues.

Two-minute silence held to remember war dead,"This video can not be played  Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have joined figures from government and the armed forces for an Armistice Day service, as the UK fell silent to remember the war dead. A special service was held at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior. The congregation - and millions around the UK - commemorated those who died with a two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT. Armistice Day marks the day World War One ended in 1918. The grave of the Unknown Warrior represents those who died in the war and whose place of death is not known or whose remains are unidentified. In pictures: Two minutes' silence to mark Armistice Day Queen leads scaled-back Remembrance Sunday Headstone for soldier's unmarked grave Socially distanced Armistice takes place in Wales The scaled-back Westminster Abbey service, led by the Dean of Westminster, Dr David Hoyle, was attended by the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules Prince Charles wore a face mask throughout the service It included an address from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who paid tribute to the many millions who had died ""unnamed and unclaimed, except by God"". He went on to refer to the thousands, even millions, who were making sacrifices today, whose names may never be known. ""They may be anonymous but their actions are glorious,"" he told the congregation, all seated two metres apart. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage read his poem The Bed about a fallen soldier transported from being ""broken and sleeping rough in a dirt grave"" to being buried ""among drowsing poets and dozing saints"" in Westminster Abbey. Afterwards, former Catatonia singer now BBC radio presenter, Cerys Matthews, read the words of a World War One widow convinced the Unknown Warrior was her own husband. Ruby Turner, accompanied by Jools Holland, sang the hymn Abide with Me, which was sung at the burial 100 years ago. Commemorations have also been held at the Edinburgh Gardens Of Remembrance, Cardiff National War Memorial, Belfast City Hall and National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The public and veterans observed the two-minute silence away from the Cenotaph Police removed a climate change banner from the Cenotaph Before the scheduled events, an Extinction Rebellion activist staged a protest at the Cenotaph in central London. Private Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, placed a banner in front of the war memorial that read 'Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War'. He also laid a wreath of poppies with the slogan 'Act Now' at the site, saying ""unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war"". Both the banner and the wreath were later taken down by police. Boris Johnson's spokesman said their removal was ""an operational matter"" for officers and condemned the protest as ""profoundly disrespectful"". Ahead of the commemorations, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke to military families who have lost loved ones, telling them they should be ""proud"" of their achievements and ""the sacrifice and the bravery that they've shown"". The duchess marked Remembrance week by speaking via video call on Monday to three women about how they had been supported by the Royal British Legion. The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to three women who mourned the loss of partners or close family The Queen visited the Unknown Warrior's grave last week It comes after theQueen led the nation in marking Remembrance Sundayat a scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed to the public for the first time. Days before, the Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time when she made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior. The concept of the grave of the Unknown Warrior was inspired by Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. After the conflict he wrote to the then-Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, about his proposal which was later supported by King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The body was chosen from four unknown British servicemen - exhumed from four battle areas - by Brig Gen Louis Wyatt, commander of British forces in France and Flanders, and transported back to Britain. On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a union jack and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. The King - and nearly 1,000 widows and mothers of men killed in World War One - were present as the warrior was buried at the Abbey. A handful of earth from France was then dropped by the king onto his coffin during the service.

'No decision' on Covid vaccine plan for under 50s,"This video can not be played Prof Van-Tam said if he could, he would be at the front of the line to be the first to get a Covid vaccine No decision has been made on how people under 50 should be offered a Covid vaccine, officials say. The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the first phase of rolling out the vaccine would focus on older people who are at most risk. This would start with those in care homes and eventually cover 99% of people at risk of dying from Covid. Boris Johnson would be happy to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Number 10 has said. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""Any vaccines which are determined for use will undergo a vigorous series of safety checks, they will be absolutely safe for the public to use. ""And the Prime Minister would therefore, of course, be very happy to take the vaccine himself."" How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had encouraged his 78-year-old mother to get ready to be vaccinated and said he was confident the NHS was ready to roll out the vaccine. ""I am nevertheless absolutely convinced that the enormous NHS team behind this has grasped the nettle and understands the scale and challenge of the project and is up for it,"" he said. ""Phase two"" in younger people would depend on the precise details of how the vaccines work, they say. Attention is turning to how a vaccine will be rolled out after Pfizer and BioNTech revealed their vaccine protectsmore than 90% of peoplefrom developing Covid symptoms. The current priority list,externalknown as ""phase one"" is: People living and working in care homes Then those over 80, then over 75, over 70, over 65 and over 60 Then adults, but not children, with a health condition that puts them at greater risk Then people aged over 55 and finally those over 50 However, the priority list is subject to change with close attention being paid to how the vaccines work in older age groups, who often have a weak response to immunisation. It is possible that if more vaccines become available then some may perform better than others in different age groups. ""If phase one is completed then we will have protected hopefully over 99% of those individuals who are at risk of dying from Covid-19,"" Prof Wei Shen Lim, chairman of the JCVI said at a briefing at Downing Street. There is uncertainty about phase two because we still do no know exactly how these vaccines will work. They could provide ""sterilising immunity"" which means they work so well that people cannot even catch the virus. Or the vaccines could simply reduce the severity of the disease, but not stop people from catching and spreading it. Which of these turns out to be the case will take time and dictate who should get the vaccine. Prof Lim said: ""We have not decided who else should be vaccinated beyond phase one. That's not to say that they shouldn't be vaccinated. ""We need more information on the vaccines, who they are good for and whether they protect against transmission or infection."" He said one option for phase two was to focus on people who were most likely to need hospital treatment if they caught the virus, or those at risk of ""long Covid"". Why are some people not recovering? However, he said they may focus on people who are ""transmitting Covid instead"". The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has previously said Covid vaccines would not be used in children. At the same briefing, Dr June Raine, the head of the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, said it was was not lowering its standards despite the need to assess Covid vaccines at speed for use in the UK. She said: ""Although we have adapted our processes to undertake our rigorous review of effectiveness and safety in a rolling way, there is absolutely no chance that we will compromise on standards of safety or effectiveness.""

'No decision' on Covid vaccine plan for under 50sUncertainty about how the Covid vaccines work mean there is no plan for younger people yet.,"This video can not be played Prof Van-Tam said if he could, he would be at the front of the line to be the first to get a Covid vaccine No decision has been made on how people under 50 should be offered a Covid vaccine, officials say. The UK's Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation said the first phase of rolling out the vaccine would focus on older people who are at most risk. This would start with those in care homes and eventually cover 99% of people at risk of dying from Covid. Boris Johnson would be happy to receive a coronavirus vaccine, Number 10 has said. The Prime Minister's official spokesman said: ""Any vaccines which are determined for use will undergo a vigorous series of safety checks, they will be absolutely safe for the public to use. ""And the Prime Minister would therefore, of course, be very happy to take the vaccine himself."" How close are we to a coronavirus vaccine? Who will get the vaccine first and when can you have it? England's deputy chief medical officer, Prof Jonathan Van-Tam, said he had encouraged his 78-year-old mother to get ready to be vaccinated and said he was confident the NHS was ready to roll out the vaccine. ""I am nevertheless absolutely convinced that the enormous NHS team behind this has grasped the nettle and understands the scale and challenge of the project and is up for it,"" he said. ""Phase two"" in younger people would depend on the precise details of how the vaccines work, they say. Attention is turning to how a vaccine will be rolled out after Pfizer and BioNTech revealed their vaccine protectsmore than 90% of peoplefrom developing Covid symptoms. The current priority list,externalknown as ""phase one"" is: People living and working in care homes Then those over 80, then over 75, over 70, over 65 and over 60 Then adults, but not children, with a health condition that puts them at greater risk Then people aged over 55 and finally those over 50 However, the priority list is subject to change with close attention being paid to how the vaccines work in older age groups, who often have a weak response to immunisation. It is possible that if more vaccines become available then some may perform better than others in different age groups. ""If phase one is completed then we will have protected hopefully over 99% of those individuals who are at risk of dying from Covid-19,"" Prof Wei Shen Lim, chairman of the JCVI said at a briefing at Downing Street. There is uncertainty about phase two because we still do no know exactly how these vaccines will work. They could provide ""sterilising immunity"" which means they work so well that people cannot even catch the virus. Or the vaccines could simply reduce the severity of the disease, but not stop people from catching and spreading it. Which of these turns out to be the case will take time and dictate who should get the vaccine. Prof Lim said: ""We have not decided who else should be vaccinated beyond phase one. That's not to say that they shouldn't be vaccinated. ""We need more information on the vaccines, who they are good for and whether they protect against transmission or infection."" He said one option for phase two was to focus on people who were most likely to need hospital treatment if they caught the virus, or those at risk of ""long Covid"". Why are some people not recovering? However, he said they may focus on people who are ""transmitting Covid instead"". The health secretary, Matt Hancock, has previously said Covid vaccines would not be used in children. At the same briefing, Dr June Raine, the head of the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency, said it was was not lowering its standards despite the need to assess Covid vaccines at speed for use in the UK. She said: ""Although we have adapted our processes to undertake our rigorous review of effectiveness and safety in a rolling way, there is absolutely no chance that we will compromise on standards of safety or effectiveness.""

Train derailment causes major travel disruption,"The train came off the tracks as it passed through platform one at Sheffield station A freight train has derailed in Sheffield, resulting in disruption to services across the north of England. Network Rail said some services had been cancelled or were being diverted, with disruption lasting all day. The cement-carrying train derailed at low speed at 02:45 GMT north of the city's station, meaning trains are unable to run through the city. Services run by CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Northern and Transpennine Express were affected. Network Rail said it was working around the clock to get the station fully reopened Network Rail said the freight train had come off the tracks while passing though platform one at Sheffield station. It said multiple carriages had derailed and there was ""no indication as to the cause at this time"". No one was injured but Network Rail said the derailment had led to significant damage to signalling and points equipment, which meant five of the station's eight platforms were closed. The cause of the derailment is not yet known Matt Rice, Route Director for Network Rail's North and East Route, said: ""We will have our people working around the clock to get the station fully reopened as quickly as possible, but it's going to be a complex problem that won't be resolved immediately."" He added: ""Thankfully, train derailments are very rare, but when they do happen we have to act with utmost caution to protect the safety of everyone using the railway."" Tom Ingall, BBC Look North, Sheffield station What a mess. This derailment happened at very low speed, but still the train has caused significant damage to the tracks at the north end of Sheffield station. Several wagons of the train are off the rails, one has tipped on its side. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) are at the site now. RAIB inspectors are conducting a preliminary examination,  a spokesperson said. ""We understand that 16 wagons have derailed and no injuries have been reported,"" the statement added. ""If the evidence collected indicates there are likely to be important safety lessons for the railway industry then a full and thorough investigation will be carried out and the findings, along with any safety recommendations, published."" Network Rail said three platforms had been made available to ""enable a very limited service to run"". Read more on this and other Yorkshire stories Northern warned passengers that due to a lack of alternative road transport and the number of routes affected, passengers should not travel. Three platforms have been made available to enable a very limited service to run, Network Rail said Operator Cross Country, TransPennine Express and East Midlands Railway said trains were able to run via Sheffield but may be delayed due to congestion at the station and the limited number of platforms available.

Two-minute silence held to remember war deadSenior royals and politicians gathered on the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior.UK'Bomb attack' at Saudi WW1 ceremony hurts severalFrance says a device exploded as foreign diplomats marked Remembrance Day in the city of Jeddah.Middle East,"This video can not be played  Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have joined figures from government and the armed forces for an Armistice Day service, as the UK fell silent to remember the war dead. A special service was held at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior. The congregation - and millions around the UK - commemorated those who died with a two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT. Armistice Day marks the day World War One ended in 1918. The grave of the Unknown Warrior represents those who died in the war and whose place of death is not known or whose remains are unidentified. In pictures: Two minutes' silence to mark Armistice Day Queen leads scaled-back Remembrance Sunday Headstone for soldier's unmarked grave Socially distanced Armistice takes place in Wales The scaled-back Westminster Abbey service, led by the Dean of Westminster, Dr David Hoyle, was attended by the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules Prince Charles wore a face mask throughout the service It included an address from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who paid tribute to the many millions who had died ""unnamed and unclaimed, except by God"". He went on to refer to the thousands, even millions, who were making sacrifices today, whose names may never be known. ""They may be anonymous but their actions are glorious,"" he told the congregation, all seated two metres apart. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage read his poem The Bed about a fallen soldier transported from being ""broken and sleeping rough in a dirt grave"" to being buried ""among drowsing poets and dozing saints"" in Westminster Abbey. Afterwards, former Catatonia singer now BBC radio presenter, Cerys Matthews, read the words of a World War One widow convinced the Unknown Warrior was her own husband. Ruby Turner, accompanied by Jools Holland, sang the hymn Abide with Me, which was sung at the burial 100 years ago. Commemorations have also been held at the Edinburgh Gardens Of Remembrance, Cardiff National War Memorial, Belfast City Hall and National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The public and veterans observed the two-minute silence away from the Cenotaph Police removed a climate change banner from the Cenotaph Before the scheduled events, an Extinction Rebellion activist staged a protest at the Cenotaph in central London. Private Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, placed a banner in front of the war memorial that read 'Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War'. He also laid a wreath of poppies with the slogan 'Act Now' at the site, saying ""unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war"". Both the banner and the wreath were later taken down by police. Boris Johnson's spokesman said their removal was ""an operational matter"" for officers and condemned the protest as ""profoundly disrespectful"". Ahead of the commemorations, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke to military families who have lost loved ones, telling them they should be ""proud"" of their achievements and ""the sacrifice and the bravery that they've shown"". The duchess marked Remembrance week by speaking via video call on Monday to three women about how they had been supported by the Royal British Legion. The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to three women who mourned the loss of partners or close family The Queen visited the Unknown Warrior's grave last week It comes after theQueen led the nation in marking Remembrance Sundayat a scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed to the public for the first time. Days before, the Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time when she made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior. The concept of the grave of the Unknown Warrior was inspired by Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. After the conflict he wrote to the then-Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, about his proposal which was later supported by King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The body was chosen from four unknown British servicemen - exhumed from four battle areas - by Brig Gen Louis Wyatt, commander of British forces in France and Flanders, and transported back to Britain. On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a union jack and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. The King - and nearly 1,000 widows and mothers of men killed in World War One - were present as the warrior was buried at the Abbey. A handful of earth from France was then dropped by the king onto his coffin during the service.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance.""

Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The UK government has defended its approach to rough sleeping as ""world leading"" amid criticism from Labour that it is providing ""neither the leadership nor the funding"" to tackle the problem. Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said that after the ""extraordinary effort"" to house rough sleepers early on in the pandemic the government had now ""lowered its ambition"". Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year. Ms Debbonaire said that thousands of people had become homeless since then and that the minister's words would ""ring hollow"" for those without a home. Homeless charities havewarned that lives will be at risk over winterwithout support and called for a repeat of the scheme from the first wave of the pandemic. During the spring somehotelstook in rough sleepers to help reduce the spread of the virus. The small Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu has reported its first Covid-19 case. It had been one of the few remaining areas of the world that was free of the coronavirus. A 23-year-old man
returning from the United States was diagnosed with the virus, health officials
said. He is in quarantine and contact tracing is under way. Prime Minister
Bob Loughman reassured the nation of 300,000 people that the situation was ""under controlâ. He said that while some domestic travel would be restricted
there were no plans to limit social gatherings. Most Pacific island nations closed their borders in the early days of
the pandemic, amid concerns that their weak healthcare systems would not be able to
cope with a serious outbreak. Cases were recorded in the Marshall Islandsand the Solomon
Islands last month but Kiribati,
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are believed to still be
free of the virus. A further 361 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in England, NHS England has said. It brings the total number of people who have died by this measure to 35,324. NHS England said the dates of deaths reported ranged from 13 October to 10 November. The patients were aged between 43 and 102 years old and all except 20 had known underlying health conditions. Â© 2025 BBC.

Two-minute silence held to remember war deadSenior royals and politicians gathered on the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior.UK,"This video can not be played  Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have joined figures from government and the armed forces for an Armistice Day service, as the UK fell silent to remember the war dead. A special service was held at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior. The congregation - and millions around the UK - commemorated those who died with a two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT. Armistice Day marks the day World War One ended in 1918. The grave of the Unknown Warrior represents those who died in the war and whose place of death is not known or whose remains are unidentified. In pictures: Two minutes' silence to mark Armistice Day Queen leads scaled-back Remembrance Sunday Headstone for soldier's unmarked grave Socially distanced Armistice takes place in Wales The scaled-back Westminster Abbey service, led by the Dean of Westminster, Dr David Hoyle, was attended by the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules Prince Charles wore a face mask throughout the service It included an address from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who paid tribute to the many millions who had died ""unnamed and unclaimed, except by God"". He went on to refer to the thousands, even millions, who were making sacrifices today, whose names may never be known. ""They may be anonymous but their actions are glorious,"" he told the congregation, all seated two metres apart. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage read his poem The Bed about a fallen soldier transported from being ""broken and sleeping rough in a dirt grave"" to being buried ""among drowsing poets and dozing saints"" in Westminster Abbey. Afterwards, former Catatonia singer now BBC radio presenter, Cerys Matthews, read the words of a World War One widow convinced the Unknown Warrior was her own husband. Ruby Turner, accompanied by Jools Holland, sang the hymn Abide with Me, which was sung at the burial 100 years ago. Commemorations have also been held at the Edinburgh Gardens Of Remembrance, Cardiff National War Memorial, Belfast City Hall and National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The public and veterans observed the two-minute silence away from the Cenotaph Police removed a climate change banner from the Cenotaph Before the scheduled events, an Extinction Rebellion activist staged a protest at the Cenotaph in central London. Private Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, placed a banner in front of the war memorial that read 'Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War'. He also laid a wreath of poppies with the slogan 'Act Now' at the site, saying ""unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war"". Both the banner and the wreath were later taken down by police. Boris Johnson's spokesman said their removal was ""an operational matter"" for officers and condemned the protest as ""profoundly disrespectful"". Ahead of the commemorations, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke to military families who have lost loved ones, telling them they should be ""proud"" of their achievements and ""the sacrifice and the bravery that they've shown"". The duchess marked Remembrance week by speaking via video call on Monday to three women about how they had been supported by the Royal British Legion. The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to three women who mourned the loss of partners or close family The Queen visited the Unknown Warrior's grave last week It comes after theQueen led the nation in marking Remembrance Sundayat a scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed to the public for the first time. Days before, the Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time when she made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior. The concept of the grave of the Unknown Warrior was inspired by Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. After the conflict he wrote to the then-Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, about his proposal which was later supported by King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The body was chosen from four unknown British servicemen - exhumed from four battle areas - by Brig Gen Louis Wyatt, commander of British forces in France and Flanders, and transported back to Britain. On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a union jack and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. The King - and nearly 1,000 widows and mothers of men killed in World War One - were present as the warrior was buried at the Abbey. A handful of earth from France was then dropped by the king onto his coffin during the service.

"Train derailment causes major travel disruptionDisruption is expected to last all day due to the ""low speed"" freight train derailment in Sheffield.Sheffield & South Yorkshire","The train came off the tracks as it passed through platform one at Sheffield station A freight train has derailed in Sheffield, resulting in disruption to services across the north of England. Network Rail said some services had been cancelled or were being diverted, with disruption lasting all day. The cement-carrying train derailed at low speed at 02:45 GMT north of the city's station, meaning trains are unable to run through the city. Services run by CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Northern and Transpennine Express were affected. Network Rail said it was working around the clock to get the station fully reopened Network Rail said the freight train had come off the tracks while passing though platform one at Sheffield station. It said multiple carriages had derailed and there was ""no indication as to the cause at this time"". No one was injured but Network Rail said the derailment had led to significant damage to signalling and points equipment, which meant five of the station's eight platforms were closed. The cause of the derailment is not yet known Matt Rice, Route Director for Network Rail's North and East Route, said: ""We will have our people working around the clock to get the station fully reopened as quickly as possible, but it's going to be a complex problem that won't be resolved immediately."" He added: ""Thankfully, train derailments are very rare, but when they do happen we have to act with utmost caution to protect the safety of everyone using the railway."" Tom Ingall, BBC Look North, Sheffield station What a mess. This derailment happened at very low speed, but still the train has caused significant damage to the tracks at the north end of Sheffield station. Several wagons of the train are off the rails, one has tipped on its side. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) are at the site now. RAIB inspectors are conducting a preliminary examination,  a spokesperson said. ""We understand that 16 wagons have derailed and no injuries have been reported,"" the statement added. ""If the evidence collected indicates there are likely to be important safety lessons for the railway industry then a full and thorough investigation will be carried out and the findings, along with any safety recommendations, published."" Network Rail said three platforms had been made available to ""enable a very limited service to run"".

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"".

Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year. Ms Debbonaire said that thousands of people had become homeless since then and that the minister's words would ""ring hollow"" for those without a home. Homeless charities havewarned that lives will be at risk over winterwithout support and called for a repeat of the scheme from the first wave of the pandemic. During the spring somehotelstook in rough sleepers to help reduce the spread of the virus. The small Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu has reported its first Covid-19 case. It had been one of the few remaining areas of the world that was free of the coronavirus. A 23-year-old man
returning from the United States was diagnosed with the virus, health officials
said. He is in quarantine and contact tracing is under way. Prime Minister
Bob Loughman reassured the nation of 300,000 people that the situation was ""under controlâ. He said that while some domestic travel would be restricted
there were no plans to limit social gatherings. Most Pacific island nations closed their borders in the early days of
the pandemic, amid concerns that their weak healthcare systems would not be able to
cope with a serious outbreak. Cases were recorded in the Marshall Islandsand the Solomon
Islands last month but Kiribati,
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are believed to still be
free of the virus. A further 361 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in England, NHS England has said. It brings the total number of people who have died by this measure to 35,324. NHS England said the dates of deaths reported ranged from 13 October to 10 November. The patients were aged between 43 and 102 years old and all except 20 had known underlying health conditions. Â© 2025 BBC.

Students going home asked to travel by 9 Dec,"Students in Wales returning home for Christmas are being asked to travel by 9 December at the latest. They will be offered new rapid turnaround tests 24 hours before leaving, the Welsh Government said. Travelling home later than 9 December will be allowed if they need to self-isolate following a positive test. It follows asimilar announcement in England, where students are being given a week to travel home after lockdown there ends. Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Many students will wish to return home for the Christmas break and I'm pleased to confirm arrangements to enable that."" She warned that no-one should travel if they have symptoms, a positive test or if they have been asked to self-isolate by a contact tracer. The timing means students can complete quarantine and be home by Christmas Eve, the minister said, but she asked students to ""stay put"" and not return home until the first week of December. How will students go home for Christmas? Covid tests for Christmas from 30 November Students tear down 'prison-like' halls fencing The Welsh Government said new Covid-19 lateral flow tests will be provided to students who are travelling home. Universities have seen a number of outbreaks since students returned in the autumn though Ms Williams said there had been a ""steady decline"" in recent days. Opposition parties broadly welcomed the announcement, although the Welsh Conservatives said testing should be for ""university life, not just for Christmas"". Plaid Cymru called for ""comprehensive guidance"" for the return of students in New Year, to include remote and blended learning to ""ensure their safety"". Lily Scourfield says she wants to keep her mum safe at Christmas Lily Scourfield, 22, a Cardiff University medical student, said she wants to keep her mother safe ahead of what could be ""one of our last Christmases together"". ""My home is in Cardiff but I live in a student house, my mum's got cancer so she's in the most vulnerable category,"" she said. ""Therefore for me, I need to 100% know that I'm safe, perhaps with access to two tests before I even go home. ""[Mum is] sort of torn about it really because she wants me to be home for Christmas - that's her opinion, but I just want to keep her safe more than anything."" She said students ""obviously"" want to be with their families. ""I think there's a sort of common sentiment,"" he said ""I think they [students] don't want to bring any Covid or anything nasty to their families but they really want - from a sort of compassionate point of view - want to be with their families for Christmas."" Students at Welsh universities planning to travel home for the holidays are being asked to: Minimise their social contacts before the end of term Get a test, ""ideally within 24 hours"" before they travel Plan to travel no later than 9 December Familiarise themselves with university plans for ending in-person teaching and arrangements to ensure they can leave campus safely New facilities that can test people without symptoms will be available at ""participating universities in Wales"" within the next few weeks, the Welsh Government said. A spokesman said ministers are aiming for ""all universities to participate"". Ms Williams said it is hoped the new testing programme will begin in the next couple of weeks. Kirsty Williams said there had been a ""steady decline"" in Covid cases at university Discussions are still going on with universities and other governments on allowing students to return to universities after Christmas, a Welsh Government press conference heard. ""Those talks continue, but we're very much looking, not only to sending students home safely before Christmas, but welcoming them back to university, after the holidays,"" said Ms Williams. The minister again rejected calls for students to get a refund after a Covid-disrupted term. ""I appreciate that the experience this term has been a challenging one in many, many ways, but at this stage we don't have plans to ask universities to do either of those things."" The four governments of the UK have worked together on the issue, the Welsh Government said, adding it would contact Welsh students at universities elsewhere in the UK. Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said it will ""no doubt be welcome news for students who will want to be home for Christmas and for families who will be glad to see them return home after a difficult term"". But she added: ""Wales needs not just a clear plan for allowing students home for Christmas but also comprehensive guidance on their return to university in the New Year - including ensuring remote and blended learning to ensure their safety."" Suzy Davies of the Welsh Conservatives said she was ""pleased to see that Wales will broadly follow suit"" with the announcement in England ""and introduce a similar plan here giving similar reassurance to students and their families"". ""A wholly online experience is also a deterrent and raises questions about 'value for money', which Welsh Conservatives have raised before, and so testing should be for university life, not just for Christmas."" Rhian Thomas tested positive for coronavirus while at university in Exeter Rhian Thomas, 20, a third year history student from Swansea, is studying at Exeter University and lives in a six-bed house. ""This news has been a long time coming,"" she said. ""We were really glad to hear it because there was a lot of 'what do we do, what don't we do' because there's a lot of people at who are arguably more vulnerable than we are as students. ""There were many conversations as a house... there were even conversations on the possibility of us staying here for Christmas."" But she said there was a lack of guidance on how the mass testing will take place and how they should travel home. Ellie Cooper (L) and Caitlin Allen were both planning to go home early First year Cardiff University students Ellie Cooper and Caitlin Allen were already planning to return to their respective homes before the ""reassuring"" announcement was made. ""My plan was always to leave early in December, but I was going to take a test first because I've been so paranoid about bringing anything back,"" said 19-year-old Ellie, from Taunton in Somerset. ""I think it's a good idea what the government are putting forward. The only issue is a test is only as good as the day you take it."" Caitlin is returning to Abu Dhabi early as she has provide a negative test to travel and then quarantine on arrival. She said: ""It [testing] has its pros and cons but it is what it is, and if it means we can go home, be with our families and keep as many people safe as possible, then as students we have that responsibility and we'll do that.""

Â£3.6bn struggling towns fund looks biased - MPs,"Blackpool is one of the towns awarded money by the towns fund The government's process for choosing towns in England to benefit from a Â£3.6bn fund was ""not impartial"" a group of MPs have said. The scheme was originally launched in 2019 to boost struggling towns. But the Commons spending watchdog warned that a ""lack of transparency"" over how money has been awarded could ""fuel accusations of political bias"". The Ministry of Housing and Communities said the selection process was ""comprehensive, robust and fair"". Money from the Towns Fund is aimed at ""places with proud industrial and economic heritage"" but which have not ""always benefitted from economic growth in the same way as more prosperous areas"", the government has said. In September 2019 itpublished a list of the 100 towns,externalthat would benefit from the fund. Beneficiaries included Blackpool, Grimsby, St. Ives and Hastings. Minister dismisses call for constituency fund probe Can Johnson's levelling-up mission survive Covid? 'Blue Wall' voters rate the Tories one year on Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick came under fire last month when it was announced that his constituency would receive Â£25m from the fund. Mr Jenrick told the BBC that the decision to give the money to Newark, Nottinghamshire, had been taken by then-Northern Powerhouse Minister Jake Berry. He said he had himself decided to grant funds to a town in Mr Berry's constituency under the same scheme. Labour called the process ""murky"" but Mr Jenrick said it was ""perfectly normal"" and insisted he had had no involvement in the decision to select Newark as one of the beneficiaries. Shadow communities secretary Steve Reed said the committee's report ""raises yet more questions about the government's misuse of taxpayers' money"". ""Scandal-prone Robert Jenrick deprived more deserving towns of funding so he could funnel it into Conservative target seats ahead of the general election,"" he added. ""The secretary of state must now publish the Accounting Officer's findings because the public deserve to know if their money was used to benefit the Conservative Party instead of the struggling towns and high streets it was intended for."" In its report, the Public Accounts Committee said it was ""not convinced by the rationales for selecting some towns and not others"", adding that justifications offered by ministers were ""vague and based on sweeping assumptions"". It also said some towns were picked by ministers ""despite being identified by officials as the very lowest priority"". ""This lack of transparency has fuelled accusations of political bias in the selection process, and has risked the civil service's reputation for integrity and impartiality,"" the report said. The committee said the communities department should be transparent about how funding decisions were reached in order ""to avoid accusations that government is selecting towns for political reasons"". St. Ives will use part of the Towns Fund money to build a new skate park As part of the selection process, ministers picked towns from a pool of 541 places which had been ranked by officials based on local need and growth potential. Ministers chose all 40 ""high-priority"" towns, then selected a further 60 places from the low and medium priority categories. Twelve low-priority areas were selected over medium-priority towns including one town ranked 536th out of 541, the committee noted. The government said it completely disagreed with the criticism of the criteria used to award the money, saying factors such as the number of people without formal qualifications or a job were taken into account. ""The Towns Fund will help level up the country, creating jobs and building stronger and more resilient local economies,"" a spokesman for the Ministry of Local Government.

LiveLivePrime Minister's Questions16 minutes ago,"Boris Johnson has faced weekly question time with MPs Keir Starmer challenged the prime minister on government contracts for public relations consultants The PM defended the government's work with the private sector MPs marked Armistice day with a special service in the House of Commons chamber More than 50 Tory MPs have formed a group to opposed any extension to England's lockdown A plan for mass testing of students has been revealed to try to avoid a spike in virus infections at Christmas A study has concluded that the north of England has been 'worst hit' by pandemic Jennifer Scott, Justin Parkinson and Richard Morris BBC Politics We are going to bring our live page to a close for today, after all the drama inside and outside the Commons. But don't worry, you canread all the stories from the BBC Politics team hereor follow ourTwitter for the latest updates,external. See you next week for another lockdown edition of PMQs from the heart of Westminster. Reality Check In response to a question about government contracts awarded to private firms for personal protective equipment (PPE) against coronavirus, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said:âThis government has secured and delivered 32 billion items of personal protective equipment.â He added that the government has to work with the private sector and that some are more effective than others. The 32 billion figure, which the PM quoted, refers to the number of PPE items which have been ordered, according to the governmentâs latestPPE strategy document from 28 September,external. TheNational Audit Office (NAO) says,externalit is looking into the government procurement during the COVID-19 pandemic as âconcerns have been raisedâ about some of them âincluding around a lack of transparencyâ. The NAO will report its findings in late 2020. TheDepartment of Health and Social Care (DHSC) says,external4.6 billion PPE items have been distributed to GPs, social care providers, community pharmacists, dentists and hospices, from February to 1 November 2020. The government worked with over 15,000 suppliers. The PPE includes masks, gloves, eye protection, aprons and coveralls but also cleaning equipment, general purpose detergent and hand hygiene items. You canread more hereon PPE supply in the NHS. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor This is a classic story of beltway Westminster intrigue, but it is worth talking about, as it tells you something important about how the government is actually run. After a bumpy few weeks and a series of u-turns and leaks, the prime minister has been looking for someone to fill a chief of staff role - to try to bring some order to his operation in No 10. The Times and Daily Mail reported overnight that he was poised to offer that jobs to his director of communications, Lee Cain. Mr Cain is very close to Dominic Cummings - the PM's most senior political adviser - and someone who has worked for Boris Johnson for a very, very long time. Some people think it is about promoting somebody from the Vote Leave faction inside government, even though they have been responsible for those bumpy communications in the last few months. Others have asked why the PM is just looking at his inner circle, rather than looking outwards to get his operation under control. But the added intrigue is sources have confirmed when news reached  the PM's fiancÃ©e, Carrie Symonds, she made it quite clear she is unhappy about this idea. Now, we don't know whether the appointment will go ahead or not. Reality Check The SNPâs Westminster leader Ian Blackford asked the prime minister about people who he said had been excluded from coronavirus financial assistance. âAnother group who have been left behind by the prime minister are the three million people who have been completely excluded from UK government support,â he said. The three million figure, which was also referred to by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, appears to comes from a group called Excluded UK, which provides a breakdown of the figure. The biggest group they cite is the 1.175 million people who earn less than 50% of their income from self-employment and so are not eligible for thesupport provided for the self-employed. But it means that group receives at least half of their income from working as an employee, and that work would make some of them potentially eligible for support from government schemes such as the furlough scheme. So while such people would not get as much of their income replaced as workers who are entirely employed or wholly self-employed, it is not right to say that they have been âcompletely excludedâ.  This post was updated to clarify that some people would not qualify for either scheme because â for example - theyâve recently switched from being employed to self-employed.

Vicki YoungDeputy Political Editor Over with our TV cousins on BBC2 Politics Live our Deputy Political Editor Vicki Young says that, in recent weeks Labour have attacked the government on incompetence in making Covid decisions, but they are now attacking the government on wasting taxpayers' money on contracts. At the beginning of the pandemic, she says, the public were more open to government ""splashing the cash"" but now questions are being asked ""all these months later, is there enough oversight"" of these contracts being handed to the private sector. Vicki says, the prime minister is painting Sir Keir Starmer as ""anti-the private sector"". But, people watching will decide if the government need to now look more closely at these contracts. BBC Politics So, here's a quick recap on what came up at PMQs  We have more analysis and updates to bring you though, so don't go anywhere yet! Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent Sometimes PMQs delivers parliamentary fireworks, other times it's a bit of a damp squib. This afternoon's scrappy exchanges fell into the latter category. Sir Keir Starmer tried to use the controversy around the head of thegovernment's vaccine task forceto make a bigger point about a lack of ""basic accountability and transparency"". But Boris Johnson went on the counter-attack suggesting Labour was instinctively opposed to the private sector and trumpeted again the week's big news of a vaccine breakthrough. The Labour leader attempted to put the PM on the ropes over a lack of support for the self-employed. On cue, he responded with the claim the government had done everything it possible could to help. You could call it a score-draw but given this week's heavy defeats in the House of Lords and Tory backbenchersorganising themselves in opposition to the government's pandemic strategy- the Prime Minister's likely to chalk that session of PMQs up as a win. BBC Politics Outside the heat of the chamber, there is more talk of changes in No 10 and someone else upset with the PM's decisions. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says two sources have now confirmed Lee Cain - the current director of communications in Downing Street - was offered the job of chief of staff over the weekend. The idea is to bring more order to things between the famous black door after a fair few mishaps and u-turns in recent weeks - what Laura describes as ""bumpy"" times. But Mr Johnson's own fiancÃ©e, Carrie Symonds, is reported to be ""deeply unhappy"" about the plan. Read our political editor's Twitter thread here for more info,external. House of CommonsParliament On Remembrance Day, Conservative Andrew Selous says families of armed forces ""put up with more disruption than anyone else"" and deserve more help. The PM says there is assistance coming on childcare and getting family members into employment. That ends PMQs for this week. House of CommonsParliament Labour's Angela Eagle asks if the PM has any advice for Donald Trump, who is ignoring the US election verdict. Boris Johnson says he has a good relationship with Mr Trump - and President-elect Joe Biden. He praises Mr Biden's attitude to climate change, to be discussed at the COP26 conference in Glasgow next year. House of CommonsParliament Lib Dem Alistair Carmichael raised the case of a constituent in Orkney. He says the official definition of deck hands has become ""skilled"" for immigration purposes, but that the home secretary is ignoring this. The PM says the government is now able to control its own immigration police because of Brexit. House of CommonsParliament Conservative Imran Ahmed Khan says that while the UK battles Covid, it shouldn't forget the importance of protecting minorities. He says four Ahmedi Muslims have recently been shot in Peshawar. He asks if Boris Johnson agrees that hatred taught in Pakistan ""ends up on the streets of Britain"". Mr Johnson says the Minister for Asia recently raised this with the Human Rights Minister of Pakistan, and that state supported hatred must end. He has asked Pakistan to guarantee fundamental rights of all their citizens. House of CommonsParliament Independent MP Jonathan Edwards says help worth Â£2bn for parts of Wales will end next week and that the UK government is ""about to pick our pockets"". The PM responds that this is not true and that after the end of the post-Brexit transition money will no longer ""be siphoned through Brussels"". The SNP's Westminster Leader Ian Blackford says the Office of National Statistics figures published yesterday show that the UK faces a ""Tory unemployment crisis"" as UK unemployment is now at 4.8%. He asks the PM to make the Â£20 uplift to Universal Credit permanent, and to extend it to legacy benefits. Mr Johnson says he is ""delighted"" that a ""Scottish nationalist"" is supporting Universal Credit. He says the Â£20 uplift is continuing, and the furlough scheme is continuing through to March. Mr Blackford says it is ""shameful"" that the PM continues to not answer questions on the future of the Â£20 uplift to UC. He says in the lead up to Christmas, people will be worried about their future, he asks the PM to make support schemes more generous. Mr Johnson says that the Â£20 uplift to UC will continue to next year, and that there is a ""winter support package"" for the ""poorest and neediest... throughout the tough period of Covid"". House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir says the prime minister ""doesn't get it"" as the furlough scheme doesn't apply to millions of self-employed people. In his final question, the Labour leader asks about a self-employed photographer called Chris, saying he is ""desperately waiting for the chancellor to address this injustice"". But Mr Johnson says the ""best way to get his job working again, to get this country back on its feet, is to continue on this path driving the virus down"". He says he is grateful to those taking part in the ""tough autumn measures"" and mass testing, and with the addition of the news on a new vaccine this week, the government has ""two big boxing gloves to pummel this virus"". But he calls on people to ""continue to work hard, keep discipline and observe the measures we have put in"". House of CommonsParliament Sir Keir says the PM ""must know"" that the ""last minute"" extension of the furlough scheme led to thousands losing their jobs. The Labour leader says the ""British people are paying the price for the mistakes of the prime minister and the chancellor"". He also says the chancellor has ""repeatedly failed to close gaps"" in support for the self-employed. The PM says the pandemic has been ""unquestionably hard on the people of this country and people have suffered"". But he says the government has ""done everything we possibly can to help"" - including for the self-employed. Sir Keir is not yet done on the PR spend, saying there is a ""sharp contrast between the way government sprays money at companies that don't deliver"" and its ""reluctance"" to support citizens. He said delays by the Chancellor in giving support has led to the rise in redundancies. ""What's the PM's message to those that have lost jobs because of the chancellor's delay?"" he asks. But the PM says the Labour leader ""knows full well the furlough programme has continued throughout this pandemic"" and will do until March. He says it is ""one of the most generous programmes in the world"" and the government can be ""proud of the way we have looked after the entire population"". Â© 2025 BBC.

Guinness recalls cans over contamination fearsThe firm has recalled cans of its non-alcoholic stout just two weeks after they were launched.,"The recall affects cans of Guinness 0.0 Guinness is recalling cans of its non-alcoholic stout because of contamination fears, just two weeks after they were launched. The brewer described the recall as ""precautionary"", but said ""microbiological contamination"" might mean some products were unsafe. The company urged anyone with cans of Guinness 0.0 not to drink them. It said it was working with supermarkets and other shops to remove all of the products from the shelves. The recall only affects customers in Great Britain, as the product was not yet on sale in Ireland or Northern Ireland. No other Guinness drinks have been recalled. Guinness 0.0 was launched to much fanfare in supermarkets on 26 October, having taken the brewer four years to perfect. In a statement,external, the brand, which is owned by Diageo, apologised to customers. Primula recalls cheese tubes amid toxin fears J&J to sell baby powder in UK despite US stoppage ""We wanted to let you know that as a precautionary measure, we are recalling Guinness 0.0 in Great Britain because of a microbiological contamination which may make some cans of Guinness 0.0 unsafe to consume. ""If you have bought Guinness 0.0 do not consume it. Instead, please return the product to your point of purchase for a full refund. ""Alternatively, contact the Diageo Consumer Careline... with details of your purchase to receive a refund voucher before disposing of the product."" On its website, the brewery also says its team is ""working hard to investigate and determine the root cause"" of the contamination. Several concerned social media users called on the firm to issue further information on the type of contamination as soon as possible. The new stout was created in response to what Guinness said was growing consumer demand for lower-calorie and non-alcoholic drinks. It is produced with the same amounts of water, barley, hops and yeast as a traditional Guinness, before the alcohol is removed using a cold filtration method. At the time of launch, Guinness bosses insisted that none of the traditional flavour had been lost, with the seal of approval being given by independent taste testers. The new product was due to become available on draught in pubs next spring, before being launched in other parts of the world later in 2021.

Britney Spears loses bid to halt father's control,"Britney Spears has argued that she is ""afraid"" of her father A US court has rejected an attempt by Britney Spears, 38, to have her father removed as conservator of her estate. Jamie Spears has been his daughter's legal guardian for 12 years, due to concerns about her mental health. Ms Spears' lawyer said the pop star was ""afraid"" of him, and that she would not perform so long as he remained in the role. Her father's lawyer argued that he always acted in the best interests of his daughter. A judge said she would consider future appeals for his dismissal or outright removal. In the meantime, at the request of Ms Spears, financial company Bessemer Trust has been appointed as a co-conservator. During a hearing on Tuesday, Ms Spears' lawyer, Samuel Ingham, said she and her father have no ""viable working relationship"" and have not spoken in a ""long while"". Jamie Spears has been Britney's conservator since 2008 But Vivian Thoreen, Jamie Spears' lawyer, argued that the reason they hadn't spoken was because Mr Ingham had advised Ms Spears against it. Ms Thoreen also defended Mr Spears' record as conservator. When he assumed the role, Ms Spears was fighting tens of millions of dollars in lawsuits. But under his guidance, Ms Thoreen said her business operation was now worth $60m (Â£45m). The legal battle is taking place against the backdrop of the ""Free Britney"" movement - a group of fans who believe Ms Spears is being kept prisoner by her father and others. Britney Spears wants the legal guardianship to reflect ""her current lifestyle and her stated wishes"" Britney Spears has not controlled her financial affairs or many of her career decisions since 2008 under the court-enacted agreement. A conservatorship is usually granted for individuals who are unable to make their own decisions, like those with dementia or other mental illnesses. Essentially, for the last dozen years, her father and attorney have managed her assets and personal life - including being able to restrict her visitors and communicate with doctors about her treatment. Britney comes back from the brink The star began behaving erratically in 2007 after her divorce from Kevin Federline, and she lost custody of their two children, although she has frequent visits. Her alleged mental breakdowns took place in the public eye. She made headlines for shaving her head and was photographed hitting a paparazzo's car with an umbrella, and went to rehab facilities several times. She was placed in psychiatric care after refusing to surrender her sons in a stand-off with the police, and the conservatorship was put in place in early 2008. In the years under the conservatorship, she has released four albums, completed a four-yearLas Vegas residency, and served as a judge on The X Factor. Fans protested outside the hearing in LA Tuesday's hearing took place against the backdrop of the #FreeBritney movement, an organisation of fans who believe Spears is being kept prisoner against her will. Some in the movement say Spears sends coded messages about her captivity through her social media accounts. The star recently responded to their concern in a video, saying she was doing ""fine"". Inside the #FreeBritney campaign ""I know that there have been a lot of comments and a lot of people saying a lot of different things about me, but I just want to let you guys know that I am fine,"" she said. ""I'm the happiest I've ever been in my life."" Following the court hearing, Britney posted a vintage photograph of children playing in the street, captioned: ""Keep jumping towards your dreams"".

Lynne and Britney Spears, pictured in 2015 Britney Spears' mother, and James's ex-wife, Lynne Spears was allowed to take part in the hearing as an interested party. In a statement released through her lawyer, she said her daughter should not be forced to obey her father's demands, calling their relationship ""toxic."" ""It has broken Lynne's heart that things have come to this point,"" Gladstone N Jones, said. Jones added that Lynne Spears has no ill will towards James, but thinks it's ""time to start fresh"" and remove him.

Post-Brexit trade talks to continue next week,"Negotiations for a post-Brexit trade deal between the UK and EU are expected to continue next week as the deadline draws nearer. The two sides resumed talks in London this week, with a UK government source saying they were in the ""final stage"". But big gaps still remain, such as on fishing access, with the UK source describing the EU's position as ""wholly unrealistic"". Boris Johnson has said he is prepared to move forward without a deal. Ireland's foreign minister, Simon Coveney said it was ""quite possible [the talks] could fall apart and we don't get a deal"". But he said, while reaching an agreement would be ""very difficult"", it was ""doable"" and the coming days were ""crucial"". Brexit will be 'brutal' for UK, warns ex-PM Major What are the sticking points in Brexit trade talks? How many trade deals has the UK done? The UK officially left the EU on 31 January, but has been in a transition period since then - following many of the bloc's rules while a trade agreement is negotiated. That period is due to end on 31 December and if a deal is not agreed, the UK will trade with the bloc on World Trade Organisation rules - leading to tariffs being introduced on many imports and exports, which could push up costs for businesses and consumers. Both sides say they want to avoid this outcome, but the the EU has said it will not do a deal ""at any price"", and Mr Johnson has said the UK will prosper either way. If a deal is agreed, it would need to be signed off by MPs in the UK and parliaments across the EU before the end of the transition period to come into force by 1 January. Mr Johnson spoke on the phone to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Saturday, agreeing some progress had been made in recent weeks after the EU agreed to discuss specific legal texts. But Ms von der Leyen said ""large differences"" remained over the question of access to British fishing waters from 2021 and regulations on workers' rights, environmental protection, and state aid designed to maintain a ""level-playing field"". Any talk of an end game, final stage, or make or break moment has become foolish throughout the Brexit process. Negotiations between the two sides over a future trading relationship are, predictably, going to the wire. But as it stands there is a deadline of 31 December, after which the UK and EU will have to operate in a very different way. If a trade deal is agreed before then, the EU member states will each need to ratify it, along with the European Parliament and MPs at Westminster. Given that time pressure and the big gaps still evidently separating both sides, progress is needed soon for agreement to be reached. Nobody expects the talks to continue beyond the end of next week, so while a breakthrough doesn't seem imminent, it will have to come within days if a deal is to be done. The extension to the talks comes aftera heavy defeat for the government in the Lordsover its controversial Brexit legislation. The Internal Market Bill contains measures that overrule parts of the UK's Brexit withdrawal agreement with the EU, and the government has said it could break international law. The Lords voted to remove the sections, but the government has pledged to reintroduce them when the bill returns to the Commons.

Two-minute silence held to remember war deadSenior royals and politicians are gathered on the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior.UK,"This video can not be played  Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have joined figures from government and the armed forces for an Armistice Day service, as the UK fell silent to remember the war dead. A special service was held at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior. The congregation - and millions around the UK - commemorated those who died with a two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT. Armistice Day marks the day World War One ended in 1918. The grave of the Unknown Warrior represents those who died in the war and whose place of death is not known or whose remains are unidentified. In pictures: Two minutes' silence to mark Armistice Day Queen leads scaled-back Remembrance Sunday Headstone for soldier's unmarked grave Socially distanced Armistice takes place in Wales The scaled-back Westminster Abbey service, led by the Dean of Westminster, Dr David Hoyle, was attended by the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules Prince Charles wore a face mask throughout the service It included an address from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who paid tribute to the many millions who had died ""unnamed and unclaimed, except by God"". He went on to refer to the thousands, even millions, who were making sacrifices today, whose names may never be known. ""They may be anonymous but their actions are glorious,"" he told the congregation, all seated two metres apart. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage read his poem The Bed about a fallen soldier transported from being ""broken and sleeping rough in a dirt grave"" to being buried ""among drowsing poets and dozing saints"" in Westminster Abbey. Afterwards, former Catatonia singer now BBC radio presenter, Cerys Matthews, read the words of a World War One widow convinced the Unknown Warrior was her own husband. Ruby Turner, accompanied by Jools Holland, sang the hymn Abide with Me, which was sung at the burial 100 years ago. Commemorations have also been held at the Edinburgh Gardens Of Remembrance, Cardiff National War Memorial, Belfast City Hall and National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The public and veterans observed the two-minute silence away from the Cenotaph Police removed a climate change banner from the Cenotaph Before the scheduled events, an Extinction Rebellion activist staged a protest at the Cenotaph in central London. Private Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, placed a banner in front of the war memorial that read 'Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War'. He also laid a wreath of poppies with the slogan 'Act Now' at the site, saying ""unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war"". Both the banner and the wreath were later taken down by police. Boris Johnson's spokesman said their removal was ""an operational matter"" for officers and condemned the protest as ""profoundly disrespectful"". Ahead of the commemorations, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke to military families who have lost loved ones, telling them they should be ""proud"" of their achievements and ""the sacrifice and the bravery that they've shown"". The duchess marked Remembrance week by speaking via video call on Monday to three women about how they had been supported by the Royal British Legion. The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to three women who mourned the loss of partners or close family The Queen visited the Unknown Warrior's grave last week It comes after theQueen led the nation in marking Remembrance Sundayat a scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed to the public for the first time. Days before, the Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time when she made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior. The concept of the grave of the Unknown Warrior was inspired by Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. After the conflict he wrote to the then-Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, about his proposal which was later supported by King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The body was chosen from four unknown British servicemen - exhumed from four battle areas - by Brig Gen Louis Wyatt, commander of British forces in France and Flanders, and transported back to Britain. On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a union jack and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. The King - and nearly 1,000 widows and mothers of men killed in World War One - were present as the warrior was buried at the Abbey. A handful of earth from France was then dropped by the king onto his coffin during the service.

"No decision on NI Covid restrictions after talksWith the current laws set to expire at midnight on Thursday, ministers are set to meet again later.Northern IrelandComments","Pubs and restaurants were among businesses forced to close in Northern Ireland on 16 October The Stormont executive remains deadlocked over what to do when the coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland end, in just over a day's time. Ministers met on Wednesday night to try to resolve differences, but the meeting was adjourned shortly before 20:30 GMT without any announcement. The regulations saw much of NI's economy placed under tight measures on 16 October. Ministers will meet on Thursday morning, hours before the laws expire. The Department of Health reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, with 791 more people testing positive for the virus. Earlier, a proposal from the health minister to extend all measures for one more week was blocked by the DUP. The DUP supports a partial reopening of hospitality and close contact services from Friday. It put forward a separate proposal suggesting this, but it was also voted down at the executive. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, has suggested a compromise proposal which would have kept the restrictions in place for one more week and this will be discussed by ministers on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, Health Minister Robin Swann warned his ministerial colleagues that doing nothing ""needs to be avoided"" at all costs, and that some mitigations must be retained. But the proposal fell after the DUP triggered a cross-community vote, effectively giving them a veto over the plan. Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? This can be deployed by any three ministers to require cross-community support on a particular matter, effectively giving a party with enough ministers in the power-sharing executive a veto. Mr Swann's original proposal calling for a two-week extension wasblocked by the DUP on Tuesday. Late-night talks resulting in stalemate at Stormont aren't exactly a rare occurrence. If past experience is anything to go by, usually the longer discussions go on, the more time there is for opposing positions to become entrenched. History seems to be repeating itself except unlike with previous deadlocks, this time ministers are grappling with the ongoing challenge of a global pandemic. Both lives and livelihoods are immediately on the line. Throughout the crisis, the executive has consisted of five political parties in the power-sharing coalition, where reaching consensus has required a delicate balance of competing party interests and conflicting policy decisions. Read more here. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance had previously said they would support a two-week extension of all restrictions. Mr Weir claimed Sinn FÃ©in had changed its stance over relaxing restrictions and claimed inter-party agreement could have been reached earlier. ""I think people want certainty and I hope there can be a sensible compromise that can be reached,"" he added. ""It's important to stress that poverty can kill as well as Covid-19."" Michelle O'Neill says her party will be guided by public health advice On Sunday, Ms O'Neill had suggesteda partial and graduated reopening of some sectors was being considered by ministers. In a statement on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said: ""Last night, Sinn FÃ©in, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party voted in favour of the health minister's proposals to extend restrictions. The DUP blocked those proposals."" First Minister Arlene Foster told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that any decision on the restrictions must be balanced and protect both hospitals and livelihoods. Northern Ireland was facing a ""mental health tsunami"" if the economy was not considered, as well as health advice, she said. ""There will be excess deaths if we continue with the restrictions or if we take no decisions at all,"" the DUP leader said. Arlene Foster said that she would have liked a decision much sooner ""but we are in a five-party coalition and that brings challenges with it"" ""Poverty has its own health outcomes... we are facing a mental health tsunami in relation to the pressure that we are putting on families as they come up to Christmas."" BBC News NI has seen the latest advice from Health Minister Robin Swann, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young, issued to ministers on Wednesday. It is understood Mr Swann stated that a ""do nothing"" approach, allowing the regulations to expire, is the worst possible scenario and should be avoided at all costs. Modelling data from health officials to the executive says that reopening some sectors, or allowing the regulations to expire, mean it is ""more likely than not"" that further interventions may be required before Christmas. The Â£400m figure presented by Mrs Dodds comes from a study by Stormont's Department for the Economywhich looks at lost output,external. It includes direct and indirect losses along with the costs of a potential delay to economic recovery, and comes with a significant margin of error. The department has also produced a second estimate using an economic model built by the Fraser of Allander Institute, which estimates the lost output to be about Â£430m. Restaurateur Martin Murphy is not hopeful that his businesses will open this weekend. He said he felt ""left in limbo"". Hair and beauty salons closed on Friday 16 October - it is thought they could reopen with some mitigations ""We were supposed to open on Friday but as yet, there's no planning. There's no way we could open on Friday - regardless of what the executive decides, it's still off the table for us,"" said Mr Murphy. ""We've been closed now for coming up to four weeks, there's been no grants in our bank account whatsoever."" One of the proposals brought by Mrs Dodds would allow close contact businesses to re-open on a ""one in, one out"" basis by appointment only. Hairdresser Lynette Murray already operates on that policy and asked why she was forced to close in the first place. ""I would have assumed there would have been some sort of risk assessment, but everyone was put in the same category,"" she said. ""I think it's really unfair. We are in the position where we don't have the luxury of getting paid if we don't go to work. ""We have applied for grants but nothing has gone into our bank accounts.""

Newly discovered primate 'already facing extinction',"The monkey is known for its white eye patches A monkey that is new to science has been discovered in the remote forests of Myanmar. The Popa langur, named after its home on Mount Popa, is critically endangered with numbers down to about 200 individuals. Langurs are a group of leaf-eating monkeys that are found across south east Asia. The newly described animal is known for its distinctive spectacle-like eye patches and greyish-coloured fur. It is at risk from habitat loss and hunting. Scientists have long suspected there might be a new species in Myanmar, based on DNA extracted from the droppings of wild monkeys, but evidence has been hard to find. Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate Conservation: Bridge of hope for world's rarest primate Mystery extinct ape found in ancient Chinese tomb About 100 of the monkeys live in a protected forest near Mount Popa With very little information to go on, they turned to historical specimens stored in natural history museums in London, Leiden, New York and Singapore. Early explorers to Burma collected the monkey specimens, which had never been examined in detail. The researchers extracted DNA and measured physical features such as tail and ear length, which they compared with those of wild populations. This revealed a new species, the Popa langur, which is found only in patches of forest in the centre of the country. Most live in a wildlife sanctuary park on the slopes of the sacred pilgrimage site of Mount Popa. Describing the species scientifically will help in its conservation, said Frank Momberg of the conservation group Fauna & Flora International. He told BBC News: ""The Popa langur, just newly described, is already critically endangered and facing extinction so it's absolutely critical to protect the remaining population and to engage with local communities as well as private sector stakeholders to safeguard its future."" There are only 200 to 250 animals of the new species, which live in four isolated populations. The monkey lives in social groups In the last decade or so, Myanmar has opened up to international collaborations with scientists, which has led to the discovery of species new to science, including reptiles, amphibians. But the discovery of a new primate is rare. Christian Roos of the primate genetics laboratory at the German Primate Centre in Gottingnen said the animals faced threats from habitat loss and hunting. ""Hunting is a big problem but the bigger threat is the habitat is almost gone and it is reduced, fragmented and isolated due to human encroachment, "" he said. The discovery is described in the journalZoological Research. Genetic studies revealed that the Popa langur (Trachypithecus popa) separated from other known species around one million years ago.

Northern England 'worst hit' by Covid-19 pandemic,"The Northern Health Science Alliance made 12 recommendations to the government The north has been hit harder than the rest of England during the coronavirus pandemic, ""exacerbating"" regional inequalities, according to a study. The Northern Health Science Alliance also found the mortality rate, even after factoring in deprivation, ages and ethnicity, was worst in the north.

Biden: Trump refusal to concede 'an embarrassment'President Trump meanwhile tweeted he would ultimately win the election he has been projected to lose.,"This video can not be played Biden: ""Embarrassment"" that Trump has not conceded the election Joe Biden has said President Donald Trump's refusal to concede victory in last week's White House election is ""an embarrassment"". But the US president-elect - who has been making contact with foreign leaders - insisted nothing would stop the transfer of power. Mr Trump meanwhile tweeted he would ultimately win the race that all major TV networks have forecast he lost. As happens every four years, US media projected the election victor. None of the state-by-state results have yet been certified. Several vote counts are continuing, and the outcome will only be set in stone once the US electoral college meets on 14 December. What Trump could do after leaving the White House What happens now? How is President Trump challenging the result? The electoral collegeis made up of delegates from each state. They are tasked with choosing the next president according to how their state voted. Mr Biden is projected to win more than the 270 electoral college votes needed to secure the presidency. The Democrat has a period of transition until his inauguration on 20 January to choose his team and prepare to take the reins of power. The president-elect was asked by a reporter on Tuesday what he thought of President Trump's refusal to acknowledge defeat. ""I just think it's an embarrassment, quite frankly,"" Mr Biden, a Democrat, said in Wilmington, Delaware. ""The only thing that, how can I say this tactfully, I think it will not help the president's legacy."" ""At the end of the day, you know, it's all going to come to fruition on January 20,"" he added. Mr Biden has been fielding phone calls with foreign leaders as he prepares to assume office. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, Irish Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel were among those he spoke to on Tuesday. Referring to those calls, Mr Biden said: ""I'm letting them know that America is back. We're going to be back in the game."" Election results in maps and charts Johnson congratulates Biden in phone call Americast: The election post-mortem But as he and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris forge ahead, a little-known government agency led by a Trump appointee is stalling the handover. The General Services Administration is tasked with co-ordinating funding and access to federal agencies for incoming administrations. However, it has so far declined to formally recognise Mr Biden as president-elect, which means that the transition team is yet to receive $9.9m in federal funds and has not been able to send its staff to key departments. In a statement, the GSA said its administrator ""ascertains the apparent successful candidate once a winner is clear based on the process laid out in the Constitution"". In past transitions, the GSA recognised the new president soon after victory was declared. The only exception is the disputed vote in 2000 when it waited for a Supreme Court ruling on 14 December which decided the election in favour of George W Bush. Despite the delay, Mr Biden said: ""We don't see anything slowing us down, quite frankly."" This video can not be played Kamala Harris' ancestral Indian village celebrates the US vice-president-elect On Tuesday, Mr Trump took to Twitter to fire off several tweets in capital letters about ""massive ballot counting abuse"", asserting: ""We will win!"" His tweets were labelled by the social media network as disputed. The president has been making claims that Mr Biden was only able to win the election through electoral corruption, but no proof has emerged so far to support the allegations. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, a Trump loyalist, told a news conference at the Department of State on Tuesday that once every ""legal"" vote was counted a ""second Trump administration"" would begin. This video can not be played Mitch McConnell: 'Trump 100 percent within rights to look into election irregularities' Mr Trump's fellow Republicans have largely refrained from acknowledging Mr Biden's projected victory. Asked on Tuesday why he had not congratulated the Democrat, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin said: ""Nothing to congratulate him about."" Missouri Senator Roy Blunt said Mr Trump ""may not have been defeated at all"". Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell has said Mr Trump has every right to launch legal challenges to the result in several battleground states such as Pennsylvania. Few Republicans want to attract the ire of the president by publicly accepting that Joe Biden has won. The ones who have spoken out already - Senators Susan Collins, Ben Sasse and Mitt Romney among them - broke with Trump a long time ago. For the rest, the president still has enormous power in the party's base, and he can - and has - wielded it against those he believes are insufficiently loyal. And so, from Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell on down, the name of the game is patience. Accept that the president has a right to make his claims, give him time to vent his frustration, but figure that there will be no evidence of sufficient magnitude to change the results of the election. Celebrate Republican down-ballot wins, without acknowledging the absurdity of alleged election-fixing that is massive enough to unseat a president but not to deliver a fully Democratic Congress. Through their actions, if not their words, the president's fellow Republicans are acknowledging that come January, there will be a new president. Mr Trump, too, shall pass. A Pennsylvania postal worker who claimed that officials tampered with mail-in ballots in the swing state has withdrawn his claims, according to the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives Oversight Committee. Richard Hopkins alleged that a postmaster in Erie, Pennsylvania, had instructed workers to backdate late votes so they could be counted. He signed a legal statement under oath attesting to his claim, but the oversight committee said Mr Hopkins had disowned the allegation after questioning by a US Postal Service inspector general. A man claiming to be Mr Hopkins later denied retracting his story ina video posted to YouTube,external. ""I did not recant my statement,"" he said. ""That is not what happened and you will find out tomorrow."" Mr Trump retweeted the video, lauding the purported whistleblower as a ""brave patriot"". Mr Hopkins' claim was cited in a letter from Senator Lindsey Graham, a Trump ally, to the Department of Justice, urging it to open a federal investigation. Allow Twitter content?

Republicans received a boost on Tuesday in their campaign to keep control of the upper chamber of Congress as a Democratic challenger conceded defeat in a North Carolina race. The state's Republican incumbent Thom Tillis narrowly held on after his Democratic opponent, Cal Cunningham, was engulfed by scandal over an extramarital affair. This video can not be played ""My message to Republican friends"" With North Carolina settled, all eyes now turn to Georgia, where the two Senate seats currently held by Republicans will be decided in a runoff election in January. If the Democrats win both seats - which won't be easy - they could still flip control of the Senate. That's because, in the event of a 50-50 tie, the vice-president is the tie-breaker, and Kamala Harris is due to take office in January. Last week, Republicans were also able to retake an Alabama Senate seat won by Democrats in 2018, though they lost seats in Colorado and Arizona.

Guinness issues recall over contamination fears,"The recall affects cans of Guinness 0.0 Guinness is recalling cans of its non-alcoholic stout because of contamination fears, just two weeks after they were launched. The brewer described the recall as ""precautionary"", but said ""microbiological contamination"" might mean some products were unsafe. The company urged anyone with cans of Guinness 0.0 not to drink them. It said it was working with supermarkets and other shops to remove all of the products from the shelves. The recall only affects customers in Great Britain, as the product was not yet on sale in Ireland or Northern Ireland. No other Guinness drinks have been recalled. Guinness 0.0 was launched to much fanfare in supermarkets on 26 October, having taken the brewer four years to perfect. In a statement,external, the brand, which is owned by Diageo, apologised to customers. Primula recalls cheese tubes amid toxin fears J&J to sell baby powder in UK despite US stoppage ""We wanted to let you know that as a precautionary measure, we are recalling Guinness 0.0 in Great Britain because of a microbiological contamination which may make some cans of Guinness 0.0 unsafe to consume. ""If you have bought Guinness 0.0 do not consume it. Instead, please return the product to your point of purchase for a full refund. ""Alternatively, contact the Diageo Consumer Careline... with details of your purchase to receive a refund voucher before disposing of the product."" On its website, the brewery also says its team is ""working hard to investigate and determine the root cause"" of the contamination. Several concerned social media users called on the firm to issue further information on the type of contamination as soon as possible. The new stout was created in response to what Guinness said was growing consumer demand for lower-calorie and non-alcoholic drinks. It is produced with the same amounts of water, barley, hops and yeast as a traditional Guinness, before the alcohol is removed using a cold filtration method. At the time of launch, Guinness bosses insisted that none of the traditional flavour had been lost, with the seal of approval being given by independent taste testers. The new product was due to become available on draught in pubs next spring, before being launched in other parts of the world later in 2021.

Two-minute silence to remember war dead,"This video can not be played  Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have joined figures from government and the armed forces for an Armistice Day service, as the UK fell silent to remember the war dead. A special service was held at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior. The congregation - and millions around the UK - commemorated those who died with a two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT. Armistice Day marks the day World War One ended in 1918. The grave of the Unknown Warrior represents those who died in the war and whose place of death is not known or whose remains are unidentified. In pictures: Two minutes' silence to mark Armistice Day Queen leads scaled-back Remembrance Sunday Headstone for soldier's unmarked grave Socially distanced Armistice takes place in Wales The scaled-back Westminster Abbey service, led by the Dean of Westminster, Dr David Hoyle, was attended by the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules Prince Charles wore a face mask throughout the service It included an address from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who paid tribute to the many millions who had died ""unnamed and unclaimed, except by God"". He went on to refer to the thousands, even millions, who were making sacrifices today, whose names may never be known. ""They may be anonymous but their actions are glorious,"" he told the congregation, all seated two metres apart. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage read his poem The Bed about a fallen soldier transported from being ""broken and sleeping rough in a dirt grave"" to being buried ""among drowsing poets and dozing saints"" in Westminster Abbey. Afterwards, former Catatonia singer now BBC radio presenter, Cerys Matthews, read the words of a World War One widow convinced the Unknown Warrior was her own husband. Ruby Turner, accompanied by Jools Holland, sang the hymn Abide with Me, which was sung at the burial 100 years ago. Commemorations have also been held at the Edinburgh Gardens Of Remembrance, Cardiff National War Memorial, Belfast City Hall and National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The public and veterans observed the two-minute silence away from the Cenotaph Police removed a climate change banner from the Cenotaph Before the scheduled events, an Extinction Rebellion activist staged a protest at the Cenotaph in central London. Private Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, placed a banner in front of the war memorial that read 'Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War'. He also laid a wreath of poppies with the slogan 'Act Now' at the site, saying ""unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war"". Both the banner and the wreath were later taken down by police. Boris Johnson's spokesman said their removal was ""an operational matter"" for officers and condemned the protest as ""profoundly disrespectful"". Ahead of the commemorations, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke to military families who have lost loved ones, telling them they should be ""proud"" of their achievements and ""the sacrifice and the bravery that they've shown"". The duchess marked Remembrance week by speaking via video call on Monday to three women about how they had been supported by the Royal British Legion. The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to three women who mourned the loss of partners or close family The Queen visited the Unknown Warrior's grave last week It comes after theQueen led the nation in marking Remembrance Sundayat a scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed to the public for the first time. Days before, the Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time when she made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior. The concept of the grave of the Unknown Warrior was inspired by Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. After the conflict he wrote to the then-Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, about his proposal which was later supported by King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The body was chosen from four unknown British servicemen - exhumed from four battle areas - by Brig Gen Louis Wyatt, commander of British forces in France and Flanders, and transported back to Britain. On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a union jack and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. The King - and nearly 1,000 widows and mothers of men killed in World War One - were present as the warrior was buried at the Abbey. A handful of earth from France was then dropped by the king onto his coffin during the service.

Tory MPs form group to oppose future lockdowns,"Conservative MPs have set up a group to fight any future lockdown in England, arguing it would be ""devastating"" for the economy and ""cost lives"". The Covid Recovery Group, which has around 50 MP members, wants the country to ""live with"" coronavirus after nationwide restrictions end next month. The ""cure"" prescribed by the government ran ""the risk of being worse than the disease"", MP Mark Harper said. But the PM has stressed the NHS faces a ""medical disaster"" without action. A further 20,412 coronavirus cases were reported in the UK on Tuesday, with another 532 deaths within 28 days of a positive test recorded. No guarantees on vaccine but NHS ready - Hancock Northern England 'worst hit' by Covid-19 pandemic Mass Covid testing for 67 local areas in England How many people could become unemployed? The four-week lockdown in England - which includes the closure of pubs, restaurants and non-essential retail, while curbing household mixing and unnecessary travel - is scheduled to end on 2 December. Parliament overwhelmingly backed the restrictions earlier this month, but 34 Conservative MPs, concerned about civil liberties and the effect on wider health and the economy, rebelled against the government. Another 19, including former Prime Minister Theresa May, abstained. The government says it wants a return to regionalised, tiered restrictions when lockdown ends - and ministers have been warned of an even larger rebellion if they try to extend it into Christmas and the New Year. The Covid Recovery Group - which includes ex-Chief Whip Mr Harper and the chairman of the 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs, Sir Graham Brady - says the ""devastating cycle"" of prohibitions cannot go on. It wants ministers to investigate whether restrictions are costing more lives than they are saving, by stopping cancer and dementia treatments and increasing suicide rates among the under-40s. The group is calling for the ""monopoly"" it says scientists have on advising the government to end, and an assurance that no policies will go before Parliament without three ""independent"" experts backing them first. Figures published on Tuesday showed redundancies rose to a record high of 314,000 in the three months to the end of September, as firms laid off people in anticipation of furlough ending in November. Despite the government extending the wage-subsidy scheme to March, economists say the jobs picture remains bleak. Mr Harper said the country needed to find a ""sustainable way"" of living with Covid until a vaccine was available for mass use to stop ""immense"" economic damage. ""Lockdowns cost lives, whether in undiagnosed cancer treatments, deteriorating mental health, and missed A&E appointments - not to mention the impact it has on young people's education, job prospects and our soaring debts,"" he said. ""The cure we're prescribing runs the risk of being worse than the disease."" The new group, he added, would ""play its part in helping the government to deliver an enduring strategy for living with the virus... command public support, end this devastating cycle of repeated restrictions"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said it was critical people continued to follow the rules to get the infection rate down, adding that ""our plan is working"". He added that the NHS would be ready to begin the roll-out of a new vaccine from next month, if it gets approval. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson has warned people not to ""rely"" on this ""as a solution"" to the medical emergency caused by coronavirus.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The UK government has defended its approach to rough sleeping as ""world leading"" amid criticism from Labour that it is providing ""neither the leadership nor the funding"" to tackle the problem. Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said that after the ""extraordinary effort"" to house rough sleepers early on in the pandemic the government had now ""lowered its ambition"". Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year. Ms Debbonaire said that thousands of people had become homeless since then and that the minister's words would ""ring hollow"" for those without a home. Homeless charities havewarned that lives will be at risk over winterwithout support and called for a repeat of the scheme from the first wave of the pandemic. During the spring somehotelstook in rough sleepers to help reduce the spread of the virus. The small Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu has reported its first Covid-19 case. It had been one of the few remaining areas of the world that was free of the coronavirus. A 23-year-old man
returning from the United States was diagnosed with the virus, health officials
said. He is in quarantine and contact tracing is under way. Prime Minister
Bob Loughman reassured the nation of 300,000 people that the situation was ""under controlâ. He said that while some domestic travel would be restricted
there were no plans to limit social gatherings. Most Pacific island nations closed their borders in the early days of
the pandemic, amid concerns that their weak healthcare systems would not be able to
cope with a serious outbreak. Cases were recorded in the Marshall Islandsand the Solomon
Islands last month but Kiribati,
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are believed to still be
free of the virus. A further 361 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in England, NHS England has said. It brings the total number of people who have died by this measure to 35,324. NHS England said the dates of deaths reported ranged from 13 October to 10 November. The patients were aged between 43 and 102 years old and all except 20 had known underlying health conditions. Â© 2025 BBC.

The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The UK government has defended its approach to rough sleeping as ""world leading"" amid criticism from Labour that it is providing ""neither the leadership nor the funding"" to tackle the problem. Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said that after the ""extraordinary effort"" to house rough sleepers early on in the pandemic the government had now ""lowered its ambition"". Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year. Ms Debbonaire said that thousands of people had become homeless since then and that the minister's words would ""ring hollow"" for those without a home. Homeless charities havewarned that lives will be at risk over winterwithout support and called for a repeat of the scheme from the first wave of the pandemic. During the spring somehotelstook in rough sleepers to help reduce the spread of the virus. The small Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu has reported its first Covid-19 case. It had been one of the few remaining areas of the world that was free of the coronavirus. A 23-year-old man
returning from the United States was diagnosed with the virus, health officials
said. He is in quarantine and contact tracing is under way. Prime Minister
Bob Loughman reassured the nation of 300,000 people that the situation was ""under controlâ. He said that while some domestic travel would be restricted
there were no plans to limit social gatherings. Most Pacific island nations closed their borders in the early days of
the pandemic, amid concerns that their weak healthcare systems would not be able to
cope with a serious outbreak. Cases were recorded in the Marshall Islandsand the Solomon
Islands last month but Kiribati,
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are believed to still be
free of the virus. A further 361 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in England, NHS England has said. It brings the total number of people who have died by this measure to 35,324. NHS England said the dates of deaths reported ranged from 13 October to 10 November. The patients were aged between 43 and 102 years old and all except 20 had known underlying health conditions. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Guinness issues recall over contamination fearsThe firm has announced a ""precautionary"" recall of its recently launched non-alcoholic stout.","The recall affects cans of Guinness 0.0 Guinness is recalling cans of its non-alcoholic stout because of contamination fears, just two weeks after they were launched. The brewer described the recall as ""precautionary"", but said ""microbiological contamination"" might mean some products were unsafe. The company urged anyone with cans of Guinness 0.0 not to drink them. It said it was working with supermarkets and other shops to remove all of the products from the shelves. The recall only affects customers in Great Britain, as the product was not yet on sale in Ireland or Northern Ireland. No other Guinness drinks have been recalled. Guinness 0.0 was launched to much fanfare in supermarkets on 26 October, having taken the brewer four years to perfect. In a statement,external, the brand, which is owned by Diageo, apologised to customers. Primula recalls cheese tubes amid toxin fears J&J to sell baby powder in UK despite US stoppage ""We wanted to let you know that as a precautionary measure, we are recalling Guinness 0.0 in Great Britain because of a microbiological contamination which may make some cans of Guinness 0.0 unsafe to consume. ""If you have bought Guinness 0.0 do not consume it. Instead, please return the product to your point of purchase for a full refund. ""Alternatively, contact the Diageo Consumer Careline... with details of your purchase to receive a refund voucher before disposing of the product."" On its website, the brewery also says its team is ""working hard to investigate and determine the root cause"" of the contamination. Several concerned social media users called on the firm to issue further information on the type of contamination as soon as possible. The new stout was created in response to what Guinness said was growing consumer demand for lower-calorie and non-alcoholic drinks. It is produced with the same amounts of water, barley, hops and yeast as a traditional Guinness, before the alcohol is removed using a cold filtration method. At the time of launch, Guinness bosses insisted that none of the traditional flavour had been lost, with the seal of approval being given by independent taste testers. The new product was due to become available on draught in pubs next spring, before being launched in other parts of the world later in 2021.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico.

And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The UK government has defended its approach to rough sleeping as ""world leading"" amid criticism from Labour that it is providing ""neither the leadership nor the funding"" to tackle the problem. Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said that after the ""extraordinary effort"" to house rough sleepers early on in the pandemic the government had now ""lowered its ambition"". Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year. Ms Debbonaire said that thousands of people had become homeless since then and that the minister's words would ""ring hollow"" for those without a home. Homeless charities havewarned that lives will be at risk over winterwithout support and called for a repeat of the scheme from the first wave of the pandemic. During the spring somehotelstook in rough sleepers to help reduce the spread of the virus. The small Pacific
island nation of Vanuatu has reported its first Covid-19 case. It had been one of the few remaining areas of the world that was free of the coronavirus. A 23-year-old man
returning from the United States was diagnosed with the virus, health officials
said. He is in quarantine and contact tracing is under way. Prime Minister
Bob Loughman reassured the nation of 300,000 people that the situation was ""under controlâ. He said that while some domestic travel would be restricted
there were no plans to limit social gatherings. Most Pacific island nations closed their borders in the early days of
the pandemic, amid concerns that their weak healthcare systems would not be able to
cope with a serious outbreak. Cases were recorded in the Marshall Islandsand the Solomon
Islands last month but Kiribati,
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are believed to still be
free of the virus. A further 361 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in England, NHS England has said. It brings the total number of people who have died by this measure to 35,324. NHS England said the dates of deaths reported ranged from 13 October to 10 November. The patients were aged between 43 and 102 years old and all except 20 had known underlying health conditions. Â© 2025 BBC.

'Voices heard' at holiday home girl vanished from,"NÃ³ra Quoirin was reported missing on the morning of 4 August 2019 The mother of a British girl found dead in a Malaysian jungle heard a voice inside their family chalet the night her daughter went missing, an inquest heard. NÃ³ra Quoirin, from London, was reported missing on 4 August 2019. Her body was discovered nine days later. Meabh Quoirin, who believes her daughter was abducted, said she heard a ""voice"" inside the chalet. She was not concerned as she ""was not fully conscious"", she told the court. NÃ³ra's family, from Balham, were staying in Sora House in Dusun eco-resort near Seremban, about 40 miles (65km) south of Kuala Lumpur, when they reported NÃ³ra missing, the day after they had arrived. The 15-year-old, who was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development, was eventually found by a group of civilian volunteers in a palm-oil plantation less than two miles from the holiday home. Mrs Quoirin told the court in Seremban, Malaysia, she recounted hearing ""muffled sounds"" at the front of the resort on the night her daughter went missing. She added that it sounded like young people having a party. She said she fell into a deep sleep after that and did not leave the bed at any point in the night to avoid waking up and exacerbating her jet-lag, the inquest heard. Mrs Quoirin added she distinctly remembered being aware of muffled sounds in the chalet at another point saying that they ""felt very close"". Group 'waited hours' after schoolgirl's body find NÃ³ra Quoirin 'possibly alive amid first searches' 'Broken window' at holiday home girl vanished from She was not concerned by the voices as she was not fully conscious, she explained to the court. At 07:30, NÃ³ra's father Sebastien went to the mezzanine level of the chalet where Nora had been sharing a double bed with her 12-year-old sister Innes. It was then that they discovered their daughter was missing, Mrs Quoirin said. NÃ³ra's mother said her daughter ""wasn't very autonomous"" and that she could not manage zips or buttons Describing NÃ³ra learning and physical difficulties, Mrs Quoirin said that her daughter had ""a lot of physical challenges"" with her motor skills and struggled with balance and coordination. She described how if NÃ³ra tried to run or move quickly she would have an ""awkward gait and she would stumble if it was not flat."" Mrs Quoirin added that her daughter struggled with zips and buttons and that she had ""core strength"" problems. ""She would tire easily just sitting"", Mrs Quoirin said. ""Her school day was very tiring, just sitting would demand quite a lot of effort."" The mother said that her eldest daughter did not do anything at home without her help. ""She would always sit beside her mum or dad ... she never went anywhere by herself,"" she told the court. ""Overall we explained it that she had a mental age of about five or six."" Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate NÃ³ra Mrs Quoirin rejected the possibility that her daughter might have wandered off alone. ""Scratchings and markings"" were found on NÃ³ra's body, but the mother claimed they were not consistent with a child walking naked in the jungle ""constantly"". ""Nora always moved slowly,"" she added. Mrs Quoirin said a lot of damage would be done to the body because of the terrain and that it would have been ""extremely difficult"" for NÃ³ra to navigate it. The inquest continues.

Children 'failed' by broken care system,"The most vulnerable children are being ""failed by the state"" and a broken residential care system, the children's commissioner for England has said. Greater use of private provision has led to a fragmented, unco-ordinated and irrational system amid ""significant profits"", said Anne Longfield. The system has been allowed to slip deeper into crisis, she said. The government said an independent review of children's social care would begin ""as soon as possible"". Ms Longfield has published three reports detailing the plight of children the system ""doesn't know what to do with"". She said the government has failed to respond to previous warnings that thousands of these children are in danger of becoming victims of criminal and sexual exploitation. Older children were found to be living in ""disgusting"" conditions akin to a prison cell, one of the reports said. It described how one 17-year-old said her accommodation was filthy and smelly, with just one working shower - covered in mould - between 14 children and young adults. ""Elsewhere children have told us they have not even been provided with the means to eat or sleep - things like duvet covers, plates or cutlery,"" the same report said. Unregulated homes 'inappropriate' for under 18s Children in care 'moved around like parcels' Councils 'in red over child protection' All three reports highlight a shortage of children's home places, resulting in: 8,000 children moving between three or more homes within a year 13,000 children in unregulated homes at some point during a year hundreds unable to get places in a secure children's homes ""Only last month, a High Court judge wrote to me after an extremely vulnerable child in care could not get a suitable care home place anywhere in the country, even though the courts had found their life was in danger,"" said Ms Longfield. ""These shocking cases used to be rare but are now routine, and I am worried the whole system is becoming immune to the devastating effect this is having on children who may have previously been abused and neglected, or have serious mental or physical health needs."" One of the reports analyses how, over the past decade, as demand for care has grown and local authority provision has failed to keep pace, private provision has expanded. The researchers found the majority of private provision was rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, although smaller providers were more likely to have lower ratings than either larger providers or local authorities. Some providers are owned by private equity companies and carry ""significant amounts of debt"" which could ""risk their stability"", says the report. ""Both the government and councils have failed in their responsibilities by leaving it to the market,"" said Ms Longfield. ""The growing reliance on private providers, some of whom are making millions, is another symptom of a system failing to prioritise the needs of children."" Iryna Pona, policy manager at the Children's Society, said the reports were enormously worrying but not surprising. ""The Children's Society is very concerned about how children in care are being failed by the very services who are supposed to be caring for and protecting them,"" she said. This video can not be played The findings of a 2019 BBC investigation on children in care were called ""a scandal"" The Local Government Association, which represents councils across England, says it shares the commissioner's concerns about the risk of businesses running children's homes going bust asadult care provider Southern Cross did, almost a decade ago. ""Providers should also not be making excessive profit from providing placements for children,"" said Judith Blake, who chairs the LGA's Children and Young People Board. A Department for Education statement said: ""The education secretary has been clear that no child should be denied the opportunity for a loving, stable family life, or be bounced around the care system in accommodation that does not meet their needs. ""We have also set out that children under the age of 16 should not be living in unregulated homes. ""Our bold, broad and independently led care review will launch as soon as possible, and will support improvements in the children's social care system.""

Service to mark Unknown Warrior burial centenary,"This video can not be played  Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall have joined figures from government and the armed forces for an Armistice Day service, as the UK fell silent to remember the war dead. A special service was held at Westminster Abbey to mark the centenary of the burial of the Unknown Warrior. The congregation - and millions around the UK - commemorated those who died with a two-minute silence at 11:00 GMT. Armistice Day marks the day World War One ended in 1918. The grave of the Unknown Warrior represents those who died in the war and whose place of death is not known or whose remains are unidentified. In pictures: Two minutes' silence to mark Armistice Day Queen leads scaled-back Remembrance Sunday Headstone for soldier's unmarked grave Socially distanced Armistice takes place in Wales The scaled-back Westminster Abbey service, led by the Dean of Westminster, Dr David Hoyle, was attended by the prime minister, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace and Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick. Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules Prince Charles wore a face mask throughout the service It included an address from the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, who paid tribute to the many millions who had died ""unnamed and unclaimed, except by God"". He went on to refer to the thousands, even millions, who were making sacrifices today, whose names may never be known. ""They may be anonymous but their actions are glorious,"" he told the congregation, all seated two metres apart. Poet Laureate Simon Armitage read his poem The Bed about a fallen soldier transported from being ""broken and sleeping rough in a dirt grave"" to being buried ""among drowsing poets and dozing saints"" in Westminster Abbey. Afterwards, former Catatonia singer now BBC radio presenter, Cerys Matthews, read the words of a World War One widow convinced the Unknown Warrior was her own husband. Ruby Turner, accompanied by Jools Holland, sang the hymn Abide with Me, which was sung at the burial 100 years ago. Commemorations have also been held at the Edinburgh Gardens Of Remembrance, Cardiff National War Memorial, Belfast City Hall and National Arboretum in Staffordshire. The public and veterans observed the two-minute silence away from the Cenotaph Police removed a climate change banner from the Cenotaph Before the scheduled events, an Extinction Rebellion activist staged a protest at the Cenotaph in central London. Private Donald Bell, who served four tours in Northern Ireland, placed a banner in front of the war memorial that read 'Honour Their Sacrifice, Climate Change Means War'. He also laid a wreath of poppies with the slogan 'Act Now' at the site, saying ""unchecked climate change means a return to a world at war"". Both the banner and the wreath were later taken down by police. Boris Johnson's spokesman said their removal was ""an operational matter"" for officers and condemned the protest as ""profoundly disrespectful"". Ahead of the commemorations, the Duchess of Cambridge spoke to military families who have lost loved ones, telling them they should be ""proud"" of their achievements and ""the sacrifice and the bravery that they've shown"". The duchess marked Remembrance week by speaking via video call on Monday to three women about how they had been supported by the Royal British Legion. The Duchess of Cambridge spoke to three women who mourned the loss of partners or close family The Queen visited the Unknown Warrior's grave last week It comes after theQueen led the nation in marking Remembrance Sundayat a scaled-back service at the Cenotaph in London's Whitehall. Social distancing measures were in place and the service was closed to the public for the first time. Days before, the Queen was seen wearing a face mask in public for the first time when she made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior. The concept of the grave of the Unknown Warrior was inspired by Rev David Railton, who had served as a chaplain on the Western Front during World War One. After the conflict he wrote to the then-Dean of Westminster, Herbert Ryle, about his proposal which was later supported by King George V and Prime Minister David Lloyd George. The body was chosen from four unknown British servicemen - exhumed from four battle areas - by Brig Gen Louis Wyatt, commander of British forces in France and Flanders, and transported back to Britain. On 11 November 1920, the coffin was draped with a union jack and taken on a gun carriage to the Cenotaph, where the Queen's grandfather George V placed a wreath upon it. The King - and nearly 1,000 widows and mothers of men killed in World War One - were present as the warrior was buried at the Abbey. A handful of earth from France was then dropped by the king onto his coffin during the service.

Hong Kong disqualifies pro-democracy lawmakers,"This video can not be played Wu Chi-wai, Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker 'announces mass resignations' All of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers have announced their resignation after Beijing forced the removal of four of their colleagues. On Wednesday Beijing passed a resolution allowing the city's government to dismiss politicians deemed a threat to national security. The opposition lawmakers then said they would leave in solidarity. For the first time since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 the body has almost no dissenting voices. BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonnell says the legislature was already stacked in favour of the pro-Beijing camp. The dismissal of the four legislators is viewed by many as the latest attempt by China to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms - something Beijing denies. Why students abroad fear Hong Kong's new law China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong activist hailed as the 'real Mulan' Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai told reporters following the lawmakers' removal: ""We can no longer tell the world that we still have 'one country, two systems', this declares its official death."" This video can not be played Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudio Mo: ""They are forcing us to quit"" Hong Kong - formerly a British colony - was returned to China under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which allowed it to retain more rights and freedoms than the mainland until 2047. But in late June China passed a controversial, far-reaching national security law in the territory after years of pro-democracy and anti-Beijing protests, which reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. The city's pro-democracy legislators had 19 seats in the 70-seat legislature. All those members have now left - either by resigning or by being dismissed. The new resolution passed by China's National People's Congress Standing Committee on Wednesday says that lawmakers should be disqualified if they support Hong Kong independence, refuse to acknowledge China's sovereignty, ask foreign forces to interfere in the city's affairs or in other ways threaten national security. This video can not be played Pro-Beijing lawmaker Michael Tien says China needed to take action to allow Hong Kong's legislature to function It also allows the Hong Kong government to directly remove lawmakers without having to approach the courts. Moments after that resolution passed, four lawmakers - Alvin Yeung, Kwok Ka-ki and Dennis Kwok of the Civic Party and Kenneth Leung of the Professionals Guild - were dismissed. All four of them are considered moderates and they have never supported Hong Kong independence. ""If observing due process and fighting for democracy can lead to being disqualified, it [disqualification] will be my honour,"" Dennis Kwok said. Critics warn the law will shut down dissent ""We... will stand with our colleagues who are disqualified. We will resign en masse,""  Wu Chi-wai said. The 15 lawmakers' letter of resignation will be submitted on Thursday. Two opposition lawmakers remain in the legislature - Cheng Chung-tai from the Civic Passion party and Pierre Chan, a medical doctor and lawmaker. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the disqualification of the four lawmakers was ""rational, reasonable and in line with the constitution and laws"". ""This was a necessary requirement for adhering to and improving on 'one country, two systems,' implementing Hong Kong's Basic Law, as well as Hong Kong's National Security Law,"" he said at a news conference in Beijing. But others have criticised the move. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the Chinese resolution ""a further assault on Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and freedoms under the UK-China Joint Declaration"". ""This campaign to harass, stifle and disqualify democratic opposition tarnishes China's international reputation and undermines Hong Kong's long-term stability."" Human rights organisation Amnesty International has also condemned the resolution. ""Bulldozing through arbitrary decisions via the Chinese government makes a mockery of the rule of law,"" Asia-Pacific regional director Yamini Mishra said. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said opinions in the legislature had to be expressed ""in a responsible manner"" The territory's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, is pro-Beijing and is supported by the central government there. Speaking to the media, Ms Lam said the four council members who were disqualified had already failed to meet the requirements to stand in the now postponed elections next year. She added that although she ""welcomes diverse opinions in the Legislative Council"" these had to be expressed ""in a responsible manner"". South China Morning Post newspaper quoted Ms Lam as saying no by-elections would be held in the four now vacant seats as legislative elections were only nine months away. The Chinese government and its surrogates in Carrie Lam's administration have - in recent times - used specific problems as a series of excuses to introduce wholesale, Draconian changes which will remain in place long after whatever hurdle it is has been cleared. In this case, four legislators had, controversially, been ruled ineligible for the next Legislative Council election. However, because the term of the current legislature had been extended for a year, due to a delayed vote, they had been able to remain in their existing positions. The four lawmakers after they were removed Carrie Lam wanted them gone straight away so she says she asked Beijing to introduce a new law enabling their immediate dismissal. In reality, who knows whether Hong Kong's leader requested this move or was told it was going to happen by the Communist Party's senior leadership? Either way, now the city government has been empowered to remove any pro-democracy politician who is seen to have acted with insufficient loyalty to the motherland in the future. Crucially, the courts can be bypassed under the new rules and, now that the Hong Kong government has said that the concept of the separation of powers has never actually applied in the city, the executive branch is able to dismiss members of the legislature and their view is that this is not really anything to worry about. As a Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong was to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech. Butthe new security law for the citypassed in response to months of pro-democracy protests criminalised ""secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces"". Beijing said the law will return stability to the territory, but critics said it effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest. After the introduction of the security law the UK offered Hong Kong residents still holding British National Overseas (BNO) status a route to British citizenship. What is a BNO passport? What is behind the Hong Kong citizenship offer? Around 300,000 people currently hold BNO passports, while an estimated 2.9 million people born before the handover are eligible for one. China last month strongly criticised the UKin response, telling London to ""immediately correct its mistakes"".

"UPS relaxes rules on beards, braids and piercings","United Parcel Service (UPS) is relaxing its rules on employee appearance, lifting a long-standing ban on facial hair. The delivery giant said the changes also include eliminating gender-specific rules. UPS says the new guidelines are part of an effort to ""celebrate diversity rather than corporate restrictions"". The company, which has more than 500,000 workers globally, has a long list of personal appearance guidelines. Man rejected for UPS delivery driver job because of beard Coronavirus: 'I had to shave off my beard so I could wear a face mask' 15 excellent facts we've learned about beards Rules cover everything from hairstyles to the length of shorts. Hairstyles such as Afros and braids will now be allowed as UPS tackles bias, diversity and inclusion. UPS says piercings should be limited to earrings and small facial ones, and must be ""business-like"". However, tattoos should still be covered up. This video can not be played With over 48,000 followers online Curlture use their influence to represent and inspire other black women The strict rules were aimed mostly at public-facing employees like delivery drivers. ""These changes reflect our values and desire to have all UPS employees feel comfortable, genuine and authentic while providing service to our customers and interacting with the general public,"" a spokesman told the BBC. In May, UPS hired its first female chief executive, Carol TomÃ©. She ""listened to feedback from employees and heard that changes in this area would make them more likely to recommend UPS as an employer"". UPS workers were allowed to have a beard if they got a medical or religious exemption, often to referred to as ""shaver waivers"". However, in 2018 UPS paid $4.9m (Â£3.7m) to settle a religious discrimination lawsuit filed by the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission over its rules on beards and hair length. Workers have previously launched petitions to overturn the ban on beards. The new policy allows facial hair like beards and moustaches ""as long as they are worn in a business-like manner and don't create a safety concern"", according to internal documents.

Cancelling Higher exams not yet ruled out,"The Scottish government has not ruled out cancelling Higher exams in Scotland next year and will make a final decision in mid-February. Last month Education Secretary John Swinney confirmed there would beno National 5 examsin 2021. But he told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandthe ""latest point"" he could make such a call for Highers would be the first break after Christmas On TuesdayGCSE and A-levels in Waleswere cancelled for 2021. Asked whether Scotland might follow suit, Mr Swinney, said: ""The latest point at which we can take that decision will be the February break, around about the middle of February. ""Obviously we will be looking very carefully at what is the degree of disruption to young people and what is the state of the pandemic at that stage. ""It is quite a long way off but we have to make sure that we have the effective contingency plans in place."" The Scottish Conservative's accused Mr Swinney of leaving pupils and teachers ""in the dark"". Scottish National 5 exams to be cancelled in 2021 John Swinney appears before Holyrood's education committee,external Mr Swinney, who appeared before a committee of MSPs at Holyrood earlier, said that ministers would be closely monitoring the situation going into the new year. On whether there was an argument for giving clarity now, Mr Swinney acknowledged there are a broad range of opinions on the subject and said he has looked carefully at it. He added: ""I concluded that there was a very clear desire among stakeholders for the Highers and Advance Highers to take their course because they are of course, the passport to the next stage of education, work and life for young people. ""That was also very strongly the view that I heard from young people into the bargain. ""It is a difficult question and it is one that we reflect on very carefully because we want to make sure young people are able to have certification for their achievements."" Conservative MSP Jamie Greene said the education secretary had already thrown in the towel on National 5 exams and ""he's now kicking a decision on Higher exams into the long grass"". He urged the government to ""pull out all the stops to ensure Higher exams go ahead as planned"". Mr Greene went on: ""Instead, they're leaving pupils and teachers in the dark again, with barely any time to plan and prepare for vital exams. The pandemic has been damaging to Scotland's schools but not nearly as damaging as the SNP's lack of leadership."" After summer 2020 exams were cancelled because of the pandemic, Prof Mark Priestley was commissioned to conduct a review of what had happened. Hisreport, which was issued at the beginning of October,,externalsaid Nat 5s should be cancelled and that Higher and Advanced Higher exams in 2021 ""will go ahead"". As things stand, the expectation is that Scottish Higher and Advanced Higher exams will take place in the spring. National 5 exams have already been cancelled. Unions had argued for the cancellation of all Scottish exams in 2021 but the government decided Highers and Advanced Higher exams should still go ahead if possible. The exam diet will take place a few weeks later than normal. This is to allow some slack for disruption. There have already been examples of individual schools being closed temporarily and there are concerns about interruption to teaching if staff are self-isolating or students are off for a prolonged period. There will also be changes to the formats of individual exams which could help if individuals have missed part of the course Of course, things may still change depending on the severity of the crisis through the winter and the spring. Meanwhile, Mr Swinney has insisted that school attendance was holding up in the face of the coronavairus pandemic. He was responding to astory in The Herald,externalthat in Lanarkshire about 1,000 pupils from both primary and secondary school had been off in the last month. The education secretary told Good Morning Scotland: ""I think it is important that we look at the sources of the infection. What I think is very clear from the information about the circumstance,s in which people have identified education as part of their contact tracing work, that is a very small proportion of positive cases that relate back to education. ""Now when you look into the particular outbreaks that take place that affect school pupils or staff we tend to find that those are cases where it has been an external community transmission that has happened. There is very little evidence of in-school transmission."" LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Testing plan to allow students home for ChristmasHigher Education Minister Richard Lochhead is expected to give details on the scheme at Holyrood.Scotland,"Students could be allowed home for Christmas if they test negative twice University students are to be allowed to return home for Christmas in Scotland if they return two negative Covid-19 tests before travelling. Universities minister Richard Lochhead said up to 80,000 students are expected to travel home at the end of term. Dates for courses ending are due to be staggered to make sure there is not a ""great surge of movement"" in December. And a testing system is being set up UK-wide to ensure students do not carry the virus across the country. People will be given two tests, five days apart, and those who test negative on both occasions will be allowed to travel. Those who return a positive result would have to self-isolate, although it is hoped this would end in time for them to go home before the festive period. Once students are home, they will need to abide by the same restrictions on household gatherings and meetings as everyone else - but there will be no special rules for students at home. How will university students go home for Christmas 'Staggered return' for students after Christmas Student Covid tests for Christmas from 30 November Mr Lochhead told MSPs that students would be advised to ""voluntarily reduce their social mixing"" for two weeks before going home, only going out for essential reasons. He said tests ""cannot tell us with certainty that someone is Covid-free"" because people may be incubating the disease, saying it was ""vital for students to continue to follow all of the other measures in place"". And he added that work was ongoing to work out how students should return to universities after Christmas, saying lessons must be learned from outbreaks at the start of term in August. He said: ""It is clear that the return after the new year will not be normal and we will work with the sector to offer as much clarity for students and staff as we can in the coming weeks."" Under the plans students will be tested twice five days apart Alastair Sim, director of Universities Scotland, said the testing programme would involve up to 65,000 students living in halls and student accommodation. He told BBC radio'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme that lessons had been learned from thespike in casesat the start of the academic year. He said: ""If you are a student who is going home for Christmas it gives that extra assurance to you, and to the people that you are going home to, that you are not bringing the virus home with you."" Mr Sim added that some in-person teaching on campuses would end early on 30 November to ensure there was no ""surge of movement"" of students. Many universities are, however, anticipating more students than usual will remain in university accommodation over the holidays. In particular, they are aware many overseas students may be unable to return home or may be reluctant to risk travelling in case they need to quarantine once they return to the UK. In recent weeks, some students have claimed they could have remained at home as their lectures and tutorials are mostly taking place online. However, universities have argued students still have access to certain facilities which they could not use from home. Matt Crilly, NUS Scotland president, said students deserved the right to return home for the winter break and he wanted to see a coherent strategy from the Scottish government that allowed students to return home safely, while avoiding mass outbreaks. ""Many students rely on the support networks offered by their friends and families and going home to see them over the Christmas period can be critical for their mental health and wellbeing,"" Mr Crilly said. ""NUS Scotland is calling for a clear plan that has ample lead time, with a strategy including the use of mass testing, staggered departure dates and compassion. ""However, there will also be many students whose halls are their only home and others who will choose not to return home this festive period. We want to see the Scottish government offering additional support to student associations to ensure all students have access to facilities including catering (even if they are in non-catered halls), access to post rooms and mental health support.""

"Hong Kong disqualifies pro-democracy lawmakersChina has today allowed the city to expel legislators who ""endangered national security"".","This video can not be played Wu Chi-wai, Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmaker 'announces mass resignations' All of Hong Kong's pro-democracy lawmakers have announced their resignation after Beijing forced the removal of four of their colleagues. On Wednesday Beijing passed a resolution allowing the city's government to dismiss politicians deemed a threat to national security. The opposition lawmakers then said they would leave in solidarity. For the first time since Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997 the body has almost no dissenting voices. BBC China correspondent Stephen McDonnell says the legislature was already stacked in favour of the pro-Beijing camp. The dismissal of the four legislators is viewed by many as the latest attempt by China to restrict Hong Kong's freedoms - something Beijing denies. Why students abroad fear Hong Kong's new law China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? Hong Kong activist hailed as the 'real Mulan' Democratic Party chairman Wu Chi-wai told reporters following the lawmakers' removal: ""We can no longer tell the world that we still have 'one country, two systems', this declares its official death."" This video can not be played Pro-democracy lawmaker Claudio Mo: ""They are forcing us to quit"" Hong Kong - formerly a British colony - was returned to China under the ""one country, two systems"" principle, which allowed it to retain more rights and freedoms than the mainland until 2047. But in late June China passed a controversial, far-reaching national security law in the territory after years of pro-democracy and anti-Beijing protests, which reduced Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. The city's pro-democracy legislators had 19 seats in the 70-seat legislature. All those members have now left - either by resigning or by being dismissed. The new resolution passed by China's National People's Congress Standing Committee on Wednesday says that lawmakers should be disqualified if they support Hong Kong independence, refuse to acknowledge China's sovereignty, ask foreign forces to interfere in the city's affairs or in other ways threaten national security. This video can not be played Pro-Beijing lawmaker Michael Tien says China needed to take action to allow Hong Kong's legislature to function It also allows the Hong Kong government to directly remove lawmakers without having to approach the courts. Moments after that resolution passed, four lawmakers - Alvin Yeung, Kwok Ka-ki and Dennis Kwok of the Civic Party and Kenneth Leung of the Professionals Guild - were dismissed. All four of them are considered moderates and they have never supported Hong Kong independence. ""If observing due process and fighting for democracy can lead to being disqualified, it [disqualification] will be my honour,"" Dennis Kwok said. Critics warn the law will shut down dissent ""We... will stand with our colleagues who are disqualified. We will resign en masse,""  Wu Chi-wai said. The 15 lawmakers' letter of resignation will be submitted on Thursday. Two opposition lawmakers remain in the legislature - Cheng Chung-tai from the Civic Passion party and Pierre Chan, a medical doctor and lawmaker. Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Wang Wenbin said the disqualification of the four lawmakers was ""rational, reasonable and in line with the constitution and laws"". ""This was a necessary requirement for adhering to and improving on 'one country, two systems,' implementing Hong Kong's Basic Law, as well as Hong Kong's National Security Law,"" he said at a news conference in Beijing. But others have criticised the move. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab called the Chinese resolution ""a further assault on Hong Kong's high degree of autonomy and freedoms under the UK-China Joint Declaration"". ""This campaign to harass, stifle and disqualify democratic opposition tarnishes China's international reputation and undermines Hong Kong's long-term stability."" Human rights organisation Amnesty International has also condemned the resolution. ""Bulldozing through arbitrary decisions via the Chinese government makes a mockery of the rule of law,"" Asia-Pacific regional director Yamini Mishra said. Chief Executive Carrie Lam said opinions in the legislature had to be expressed ""in a responsible manner"" The territory's leader, Chief Executive Carrie Lam, is pro-Beijing and is supported by the central government there. Speaking to the media, Ms Lam said the four council members who were disqualified had already failed to meet the requirements to stand in the now postponed elections next year. She added that although she ""welcomes diverse opinions in the Legislative Council"" these had to be expressed ""in a responsible manner"". South China Morning Post newspaper quoted Ms Lam as saying no by-elections would be held in the four now vacant seats as legislative elections were only nine months away. The Chinese government and its surrogates in Carrie Lam's administration have - in recent times - used specific problems as a series of excuses to introduce wholesale, Draconian changes which will remain in place long after whatever hurdle it is has been cleared. In this case, four legislators had, controversially, been ruled ineligible for the next Legislative Council election. However, because the term of the current legislature had been extended for a year, due to a delayed vote, they had been able to remain in their existing positions. The four lawmakers after they were removed Carrie Lam wanted them gone straight away so she says she asked Beijing to introduce a new law enabling their immediate dismissal. In reality, who knows whether Hong Kong's leader requested this move or was told it was going to happen by the Communist Party's senior leadership? Either way, now the city government has been empowered to remove any pro-democracy politician who is seen to have acted with insufficient loyalty to the motherland in the future. Crucially, the courts can be bypassed under the new rules and, now that the Hong Kong government has said that the concept of the separation of powers has never actually applied in the city, the executive branch is able to dismiss members of the legislature and their view is that this is not really anything to worry about. As a Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong was to have its own legal system, multiple political parties, and rights including freedom of assembly and free speech. Butthe new security law for the citypassed in response to months of pro-democracy protests criminalised ""secession, subversion and collusion with foreign forces"". Beijing said the law will return stability to the territory, but critics said it effectively curtails freedom of speech and protest. After the introduction of the security law the UK offered Hong Kong residents still holding British National Overseas (BNO) status a route to British citizenship. What is a BNO passport? What is behind the Hong Kong citizenship offer? Around 300,000 people currently hold BNO passports, while an estimated 2.9 million people born before the handover are eligible for one. China last month strongly criticised the UKin response, telling London to ""immediately correct its mistakes"".

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data. ""By limiting contact with others, you are helping to stop the spread of the virus. ""This will lead to fewer infections and help to save lives. Together we can bring the virus under control."" We've just heard that the UK virus death toll has past 50,000. This is how things stand virus-wise in the UK this afternoon: The UK is the fifth country to pass 50,000 deaths, coming after the United States, Brazil, India and Mexico. The US has recorded the most deaths worldwide at 238,680, followed by Brazil, with 162,802, and India, 127,571. After the UK, Italy has the next highest death toll in Europe, at 42,953, while France has suffered 41,062 deaths and Spain 39,345. You can see how other countries comparehere. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The UK's Covid death toll has reached a grim and tragic milestone - and illustrates what a devastating impact the pandemic has had on the country. But one figure alone cannot tell the full story. The burden has not been felt equally. The single biggest factor has been age - with more than nine in 10 deaths in the over-65s. Poorer areas and ethnic minorities have also been disproportionately affected. Deaths from other causes have also risen as people have gone without treatment. The UK has on most measures seen one of the highest death rates in the world. Blame, understandably, has been laid at the government's door. It has been criticised in particular for being too slow to lockdown and for its record on testing and tracing. But the UK is not alone in struggling. Similar debates have been had in Italy, Spain and France. And the sad reality is this figure will keep climbing in the months to come. But there is now at last some real hope that, with a vaccine looking likely, the toll will be much, much less next year. Read more of Nick Triggle's analysishere. A further 595 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test in the UK,taking the total by that measure to 50,365. According to theDepartment of Health and Social Care,external, 22,950 more people have tested positive for the virus as of today. The second wave of the UK's coronavirus pandemic will be gruelling with increased pressure throughout winter, doctors have been warned. The chief medical officers of England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, the NHS, the General Medical Council and the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges have written to doctors urging them to be flexible during the second wave, which may require them to work in clinical areas outside their usual practice. The letter, tweeted by Chris Whitty, chief medical officer for England, says the second Covid wave ""may well be prolonged throughout the winter period"", and he warns of local variation and fluctuation which may require a ""sustained response from the whole profession"". ""This will be gruelling professionally and personally,"" the letter says. It also thanks doctors for their ""tireless efforts"" and ""exemplary"" response to the pandemic. Allow Twitter content?

But the 70 young musicians who make up the Ulster Youth Orchestra in Northern Ireland have found a way to make themselves heard. Under the supervision of Daniele Rustioni, the Ulster Orchestra's chief conductor, they remotely recorded an ambitious piece of musical magic. The players followed Mr Rustioni's conducting online before each individual recording was carefully patched together to create a spectacular orchestral experience. Students across Scotland will be advised to only go out for essential reasons and exercise for two weeks before going home for the Christmas holidays, the country's higher education minister has said. In a statement to the Scottish Parliament, Richard Lochhead said there will be ""staggered and early departure irrespective of the level the institution is currently in"". He added: ""Universities will be asked to make any necessary adjustments to scheduling to ensure that in-person teaching and assessment ends early enough to allow students time to get home at the end of term. ""I see that Universities Scotland has highlighted the staggered dates for the end of in-person teaching at Scottish universities from late November to mid-December, so they are not expecting a great surge of movement."" The Scottish government is expecting up to 80,000 students to be going home for Christmas and as many as possible will be offered voluntary tests for coronavirus before they travel, according to Mr Lochhead. He said Scotland would be part of a UK-wide programme of asymptomatic testing for students. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The UK government has defended its approach to rough sleeping as ""world leading"" amid criticism from Labour that it is providing ""neither the leadership nor the funding"" to tackle the problem. Asking an urgent question in the House of Commons, shadow housing secretary Thangam Debbonaire said that after the ""extraordinary effort"" to house rough sleepers early on in the pandemic the government had now ""lowered its ambition"". Housing minister Kelly Tolhurst told MPs the government was providing a further Â£15m for local authorities - building on what she described as the success of the'everyone in'scheme, which the government estimates led to 29,000 people being housed earlier in the year. Ms Debbonaire said that thousands of people had become homeless since then and that the minister's words would ""ring hollow"" for those without a home.

island nation of Vanuatu has reported its first Covid-19 case. It had been one of the few remaining areas of the world that was free of the coronavirus. A 23-year-old man
returning from the United States was diagnosed with the virus, health officials
said. He is in quarantine and contact tracing is under way. Prime Minister
Bob Loughman reassured the nation of 300,000 people that the situation was ""under controlâ. He said that while some domestic travel would be restricted
there were no plans to limit social gatherings. Most Pacific island nations closed their borders in the early days of
the pandemic, amid concerns that their weak healthcare systems would not be able to
cope with a serious outbreak. Cases were recorded in the Marshall Islandsand the Solomon
Islands last month but Kiribati,
Micronesia, Nauru, Palau, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu are believed to still be
free of the virus. A further 361 people have died in hospital after testing positive for coronavirus in England, NHS England has said. It brings the total number of people who have died by this measure to 35,324. NHS England said the dates of deaths reported ranged from 13 October to 10 November. The patients were aged between 43 and 102 years old and all except 20 had known underlying health conditions. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here are the main Covid-related headlines from today:  Boris Johnson was seated apart from the royal couple to follow social distancing rules This video can not be played How not to wear a face mask The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has updated its research around masks,external, saying that wearing one does not only protect others but also the person wearing the mask. Previous guidance had rested on the idea that the main benefit of mask-wearing came from potentially stopping an infected person transmitting Covid to others. But now, the CDC said ""studies demonstrate that cloth mask materials can also reduce wearers' exposure to infectious droplets through filtration, including filtration of fine droplets and particles less than 10 microns"". It cited several studies including one that examined a case where two hair stylists with symptomatic Covid interacted with 139 clients over an eight-day period. Researchers managed to speak to and test 67 of the clients, none of whom developed an infection. The stylists and all clients had worn masks in the salon. A study of an outbreak aboard a US aircraft carrier, the USS Theodore Roosevelt, found mask-wearing seemed to have reduced the risk of virus transmission by 70%, the CDC said. It said masks with multiple cloth layers of higher thread counts were more protective than single-layer, lower thread-count masks.  Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has said the UK passing 50,000 coronavirus deaths is a ""grim milestone"". He criticised the government for being ""slow"" in its response to the first phase and ""not having learnt the lessons"" for the second phase. He said: ""It is a grim milestone and we're the first in Europe to hit it. ""Behind these numbers is a devastated family, one for every death, and they have to be uppermost in our mind. ""The government was slow at phase one and they haven't learned the lesson going into phase two. ""We owe it to all of the families who are grieving to get on top of the virus and head towards a vaccine and that's what the government must absolutely focus on now."" Asked if he would like to see the lockdown in England extended beyond 2 December Sir Keir said he would ""have to see the position on that date"". Former chief scientific adviser Sir David King has said the UK's pandemic death toll was ""astonishing"" and ""really bad news"". He said: ""What I think happened was we as a government did not keep our eye on the ball, particularly in the early days."" Sir David said the country should have started preparing for the pandemic in February, pointing to the example of Greece, and should have been in a position where hospitals had the equipment they needed in March, along with setting up local public health services to carry out test and trace. Sir David, who chairs the Independent Sage group of scientists, said the ""big fault"" in his view was a ""very slow reaction in the first place"" and then going into lockdown in March without developing a test, trace and isolate system. ""Quite simply we haven't yet seen an end strategy to deal with this,"" he said. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm Some experts think Sweden is not doing enough to curb its infection rate Sweden is banning alcoholic drinks sales after 22:00, as part of its efforts to stem the spread of Covid-19. The law comes into force on 20 November and is expected to stay in place until the end of February 2021. Sweden - like many European countries - has experienced a sharp increase in Covid-19 cases in recent weeks. Several thousand infections are being reported on a daily basis in a country of only 10 million. Some 131 people are currently in intensive care. Prime Minister Stefan LÃ¶fven said the country was heading towards âdarker timesâ in terms of the spread of infection. He said that while many Swedes were following the countryâs voluntary guidelines - which include working from home and avoiding public transport - growing numbers had âbegun to relaxâ during the autumn. The announcement comes amid growing national debates about whether Sweden is doing enough to stop the spread of the coronavirus. Uppsala University Hospitalâs Head of Infectious Diseases, Fredrik Sund, has called the voluntary guidelines âtoothlessâ and says he is worried about the growing pressure on hospitals. Sweden has never had a formal lockdown, although in recent weeks the government has sharpened its tone. A ban on groups of more than eight people in pubs and restaurants was announced last week. Tougher local recommendations have been introduced in different regions. These vary but usually include avoiding physical contact with people you donât live with and staying away from public places. A sports instructor says she still struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since contracting coronavirus in March. ""Long Covid"" is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had Covid-19. Sarah Wakefield, from Bridgend in Wales, said: ""I'm 46 and I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Watch her story: This video can not be played Sports instructor 'feels like I'm 96' months after covid Mark LowenBBC News, Rome How quickly it has changed. A month ago, Italy seemed to be avoiding the worst of the second wave that other European countries were seeing. Now its numbers are even worse than many of its neighbours. On Wednesday it passed the milestone of more than a million Covid cases. The health ministry reported 623 deaths, a level not seen since early April. The first country in the west to be crushed by the pandemic is falling again. And this time, itâs not just wealthy Lombardy in the north thatâs suffering - but Campania and Calabria in the south too, two of the EUâs poorest regions. Thatâs prompted serious concern over their ability to cope. In Naples, some Covid patients had to be transferred to ambulances parked outside hospitals, since ICUs inside were filling up. Italy has increased its number of intensive care beds since the first wave - but in some places theyâre again nearing capacity. Unlike March though, when Italy became the first country in the world to impose a national lockdown, this time the government is resisting it, opting so far for a regional tiered approach - a mix of red, amber and yellow zones. But although thereâs some evidence that the rate of infection is beginning to stabilise, pressure is growing for a national red zone - ""lockdown lite"" is how itâs dubbed here, closing most shops, bars and restaurants and banning movement between regions. There could be a decision by the weekend. Boris Johnson said the pandemic is entering a new phase in the UK after the country's death toll passed 50,000. The prime minister said: ""Every death is a tragedy. We mourn everybody who is gone."" Speaking during a visit to a Tesco distribution centre in Erith, south-east London, he added: ""After the tough autumn measures which I hope people will stick really, really rigidly as far as they can, we are very much hoping things will start to come to our aid. ""Number one is mass testing - the rapid turnaround testing - and the other is the realistic prospect of a vaccine. ""We have two boxing gloves to pummel the disease in the weeks and months that follow but I have got to stress that we are not out of the woods yet. It does require everybody to follow the guidance."" He said that ""hopefully"" the four-week lockdown in England will allow restrictions to be eased enough for people to have a Christmas that is ""as normal as possible"". People in Melbourne - Australia's second most populous city - are able to enjoy socialising again after months of strict lockdown Top
US scientist Dr Anthony Fauci has spoken of seeing pictures of Australians âsitting
on the beach, relaxing, enjoying the sun"" and thinking ""thatâs what we would love to see here
in the United States"". He told Australian broadcaster ABC,externalthat controlling the outbreak in the US was not
impossible but was getting harder as record numbers of infections are reported
each week. While
he said lockdowns should only be used as a last resort, he noted that Australiaâs
tough restrictions had enabled the country to get cases down to a âvery, very good
baseline which meansâ¦ that itâs much easier to identify, isolate and contact
traceâ. Dr
Fauci also admitted during the interview that working with the Trump administration â which has opposed much of his and other experts' advice â had âobviously been very stressful"". He said he hoped the incoming Biden administration would focus on bringing in ""universal"" safety measures across the US, and spoke of his optimism that a vaccine might bring ""some sort of normality"" next year. Following the UK's coronavirus deaths exceeding 50,000, the medical director of Public Health England warned that the ""upward trend is likely to continue"". Dr Yvonne Doyle said: ""Sadly the upward trend is likely to continue and it will be several weeks before any impact of the current measures - and the sacrifices we are all making - is seen and is reflected in the data.

"Train derailment causes major travel disruptionDisruption is expected to last all day due to the ""low speed"" freight train derailment in Sheffield.","The train came off the tracks as it passed through platform one at Sheffield station A freight train has derailed in Sheffield, resulting in disruption to services across the north of England. Network Rail said some services had been cancelled or were being diverted, with disruption lasting all day. The cement-carrying train derailed at low speed at 02:45 GMT north of the city's station, meaning trains are unable to run through the city. Services run by CrossCountry, East Midlands Railway, Northern and Transpennine Express were affected. Network Rail said it was working around the clock to get the station fully reopened Network Rail said the freight train had come off the tracks while passing though platform one at Sheffield station. It said multiple carriages had derailed and there was ""no indication as to the cause at this time"". No one was injured but Network Rail said the derailment had led to significant damage to signalling and points equipment, which meant five of the station's eight platforms were closed. The cause of the derailment is not yet known Matt Rice, Route Director for Network Rail's North and East Route, said: ""We will have our people working around the clock to get the station fully reopened as quickly as possible, but it's going to be a complex problem that won't be resolved immediately."" He added: ""Thankfully, train derailments are very rare, but when they do happen we have to act with utmost caution to protect the safety of everyone using the railway."" Tom Ingall, BBC Look North, Sheffield station What a mess. This derailment happened at very low speed, but still the train has caused significant damage to the tracks at the north end of Sheffield station. Several wagons of the train are off the rails, one has tipped on its side. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) are at the site now. RAIB inspectors are conducting a preliminary examination,  a spokesperson said. ""We understand that 16 wagons have derailed and no injuries have been reported,"" the statement added. ""If the evidence collected indicates there are likely to be important safety lessons for the railway industry then a full and thorough investigation will be carried out and the findings, along with any safety recommendations, published."" Network Rail said three platforms had been made available to ""enable a very limited service to run"".

"Covid on campus: Partying, isolating - and sometimes both","Messages from locked-down students at Manchester Metropolitan University Anoushka Mutanda Dougherty was in the first year of her degree at Manchester University when the pandemic began and all students were sent home. Now she's back and has been finding out from friends and first-year students how the pandemic is affecting their social lives. When coronavirus first stopped uni dead in its tracks back in March, I like most of my friends was expecting only a brief interlude to life as we knew it. I hadn't foreseen we'd be experiencing a second wave at the start of the next academic year - or that students arriving for the first time would be subjected to the horror that is virtual freshers. With nightclubs shuttered for the foreseeable future, the rule of six and the 10pm closure of bars and restaurants, the possibility for socialising is pretty bleak and must be a particularly heavy blow to freshers, who would normally expect to be meeting hundreds of new people and doing some intense partying. However, as I began to speak to people, I was surprised by the amount of optimism. It seemed that after months of lockdown, some students were grateful just to get out of their parents' house. And one way or another - responsibly or irresponsibly - lots of them were finding ways of socialising. For many first-years it's been a really tough few months. Their years at school came to an abrupt halt. Most were put under huge stress when the algorithm gave them bad results. Now they are borrowing thousands of pounds to be at university and won't be getting anything like a normal university experience. Anoushka (left) and her friend, Ria, in the pre-Covid era Is it realistic to expect them to socialise only with the other people in the flats in their halls of residence? What if they don't immediately get on with them - do we want them to be miserable and lonely? This pandemic is really serious, but so is mental health. I'm not sure how I would be coping in the first-years' shoes. I know after my parents dropped me off, I was disappointed that university didn't instantly live up to my expectations - and that was with all the normal freshers' week perks. I don't know if it's the same for boys, but a lot of the bonding took place for the girls when we were all drunk in the bathroom toilets of a club, and we were all telling each other how much we love each other. It kind of broke down those walls, and I'm not sure how else you get over that hump of awkwardness. Outside the hall where I lived last year, I met Sarah, a first-year who hasn't yet become close friends with her flatmates. The university hasn't explained how to meet coursemates, she told me. When she arrived she was given the key to her room, but there was no great announcement, she was just told to keep checking her emails. ""There haven't really been freshers' events,"" she says. ""I think everyone's just a bit confused about why we're here for two weeks without anything to do."" SOCIAL DISTANCING:How have rules on meeting friends changed? FACE MASKS:When do I need to wear one? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Helping to fill this vacuum are the friends she knew in London, where she went to school. And there have been parties in student halls. These were against government guidelines - with 20 or 25 people, sometimes more - but for her they were one of the few positive experiences she'd had since she arrived in Manchester. I mentioned to Sarah that I'd heard about a lot of flat parties on the university's Fallowfield campus, and a mosh pit outside one of the houses. So why wasn't campus security shutting them down? Sarah said that she had seen security staff. ""Like you kind of see them patrolling the area and stuff and they shut down the big ones [parties], but then people just migrate to another."" My friend Gabriel who I knew at school, but who took a gap year and has only just arrived, also thinks the university has been half-hearted about enforcing the rules, as if they didn't really expect people to follow them. It's true that people have been bombarded with emails about social distancing, and Gabriel says his name was taken at a party by some graduate students dressed in green uniforms - a sign that he may receive a warning - but otherwise it's been up to the students themselves to behave responsibly. And inevitably some haven't. After meeting Eve, I came across Bo, a student from Wuhan in China, where the coronavirus pandemic began. He told me that students have gone back to university there, but they all have to have a test first. Once it's confirmed that they haven't got the virus, they can socialise freely. Students returning to study at university in Wuhan Here, in some cases, it's almost like the opposite has been happening. People arrive at university, quickly find that they have been infected, and then socialise freely with others who are Covid-positive. Dimitry is in a hall at Manchester Metropolitan university that has been locked down for two weeks, which means, he says, that ""we can all socialise more - we don't really have to worry about the rule of six"". He goes to parties where people discuss their test results and their symptoms (which are usually mild - maybe a headache or a slight cough, or loss of taste and smell). Dimitry in lockdown ""I don't think it would have been like that if they hadn't done the lockdown. But now everyone is locked down for two weeks anyway, so if you really wanted to avoid getting Corona, you would literally have to stay in your room - and even then people in your flat would probably still give it to you,"" he says. ""So there's an inevitability in terms of catching the virus and most people are just like, 'Are we that bothered?'"" I've heard about other parties held specifically for students who are Covid-positive. Ruby, who studies in Leeds, told me about one she was invited to at a house where people were ""isolating"", and you could only get in by showing a positive test result on your phone. Ruby lives with her friends Amelia and Pav and a number of other students in a shared house. She says when two of them got positive test results the rest reluctantly agreed to isolate - and only after trips out to Nando's and a hairdresser's, and a mission to buy a pet fish. Amelia, Ruby and Pav preparing for seven days of fun in isolation Now they are intending to make the best of it. ""We're planning seven days of fun,"" says Ruby. ""We've ordered some clay today. We're having a week of activities planned, with themes for each room. We're going to have a party in each room in the house, just for the people in our house."" Amelia says that before their positive test results they weren't trying especially hard not to become infected, and that there was even a feeling that it would be better to get it now, when there was no risk of infecting their parents. Some people might disagree with this attitude, I pointed out. She replied that they had actually been pretty careful, only mixing with other students. They'd only made two socially distanced visits to the pub, and had worn masks on public transport. Last purchase before isolating - a goldfish ""I also think, now that we've had this scare, 'Oh my God, I went to the shop - and the man who works at the shop, I don't know where he lives and who he lives with,'"" she says. ""So we are thinking about it, and now that we know, we're being really careful, just staying in."" Pav thinks it's easy to criticise students who have caught the virus. ""People are like, 'You shouldn't have been doing this. You shouldn't have been doing that.' But really everyone's been doing it, all students, because it's a social place, people are mixing whatever they might say. It's part of being at university to mix and meet up with others."" I have met people who have been socialising only with the people in their student flats and houses. My friend, Lily, has thrived in isolation after testing positive, racking up her Uber Eats bill and watching hours of Desperate Housewives in her room. Lily, in isolation, collecting a birthday present At the other end of the scale, there are undoubtedly students who have been recklessly breaking rules. But bear in mind that academic fees are staying the same, despite everything, and that most students in enforced lockdown are still paying rent. Plenty of students think they were told to come back, instead of being instructed to stay at home and study online, because the university and the city needed their money. And some, like Gabriel, point out that the university hasn't done much apart from sending emails to show it's serious about enforcing the rules. On top of that, little has been done to prevent some students feeling isolated, and mental health support is drastically below par. Listen toBack to Union Monday 26 October at 20:00 on BBC Radio 4 Follow@Anoushka_md,externaland radio producer@SueM1tchell,externalon Twitter A University of Manchester spokesman said in a statement that the safety and well-being of students was the University's primary concern and that it would support them in every way it could. ""We have put in place a comprehensive support package for all students who are self-isolating, that includes a partnership with a major food retailer, delivery of parcels, support on well-being and practical matters such as laundry and prescription medicine. This has been communicated to all of our students,"" the statement said. ""We realise that the current restrictions on socialising are difficult for our new students in particular so we have worked with our Students' Union to put in place a welcome programme with a large number and variety of events. Where possible these are face-to-face, but our courses and numerous clubs and societies have also developed online options. ""As a University we are doing all we can to keep our students, staff and the wider Manchester community safe.""

Army medics are helping with vaccinations in some areas where the Delta variant is spreading Scientists have identified a number of ""variants of concern"" - these arenewly spotted versions of Covid, which could be more contagious. Also, because they're newer, less is known about how they respond to current vaccines. The Delta variant - first identified in India - is the latest to cause concern. Others include those first identified in Brazil, South Africa and the UK (Kent). The variants were initially named after the place where they were first seen, butthe World Health Organization (WHO) has announced a new naming systemwhich uses Greek letters instead. The PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test People tested under the new variant surge programmes are being offered a PCR test. This involves swabbing your nose or throat, dropping the swab in a vial of liquid and sending it to a lab for analysis. It is regarded as the most reliable test, but normally takes a day or longer to get a result. The lateral flow test This also involves a swab from the nose or throat, which is dropped into liquid.

The lockdown dilemma facing England's students,"The National Union of Students said students should have the choice whether to go home University students across England have been told they should not return home for the new lockdown. But many have already endured enforced isolation, had their lecturers moved online and are now unsure if the lockdown will be extended into Christmas. For some the prospect of four more weeks away from home is just too much to bear. Universities minister, Michelle Donelan,has written to students advising them to stay at their current accommodationto protect their loved ones. But the National Union of Students (NUS) said they should be able to return home before lockdown begins on Thursday. It said many students are concerned about the new restrictions and want the support of their families. NUS president Larissa Kennedy said it is understandable some students will want to leave university accommodation during this ""challenging period"". She said the government must ensure students are able to travel home safely before lockdown starts in line with current guidance for the wider population, which allows people to move homes and form new households until Thursday, and ""stop subjecting them to stricter rules than everyone else"". Ms Kennedy said: ""From online learning to long periods of self-isolation, often from shoebox rooms, students' experiences this term have been far from what they were led to expect. ""Many have recently gone through accommodation lockdowns and the mental health implications of making students stay longer than they want or need to cannot be underestimated."" Abbie Hobbs (left) and Hannah Yardley (right) are staying on in Bournemouth Hannah Yardley, 20, and her housemate Abbie Hobbs, 21, have decided to stay at Bournemouth University for lockdown in their off-campus accommodation. ""I'm staying because all my housemates are staying and I also live with someone who is doing the same course as me so it's easier to do our work together,"" said Hannah. The psychology student from Overton, Hampshire, added: ""I'm not too worried because I spent most of the last lockdown in halls and it was fine. ""However, if lockdown gets extended to Christmas, I probably will try to go home because everyone will want to be with their families and especially because my mum lives on her own. But I don't know if this will be allowed and I don't want to put people at risk."" Abbie hopes to be able to go home to Marlborough, Wiltshire, for Christmas but only ""as long as I wouldn't be putting my family at risk"". She added: ""I think it will be more fun continuing to live with friends in Bournemouth during lockdown. ""I don't think it will feel too different than with the current restrictions as we don't really go out anyway. Will Roberts is staying in Sheffield to work as a care assistant University of Sheffield student Will Roberts intends to stay in the city over lockdown to continue working as a part-time care assistant. The 22-year-old has housemates who are also choosing to stay, but said students would ignore restrictions if it meant they could not return home for Christmas. The international development student, from Prestatyn, Denbighshire, said: ""It's only meant to be a month and everyone knows students are going to go home for Christmas regardless of what happens."" But he added: ""If it came to Christmas and I wasn't allowed to go, I'd still go home as I get tested for coronavirus every week at work. ""Also my housemates and I are quite careful, and we don't have anyone else in our house. ""There's no chance I'm going to stay in Sheffield for Christmas unless I'm working."" Matt Wincott thinks there is little point staying in Bristol during lockdown Matt Wincott lives in a shared house with three other people who are all planning to go home for lockdown. The 20-year-old, who is studying business and management at Bristol University, said: ""I do not want to spend a month in Bristol on my own. ""Also, with all my lectures online I could be anywhere in the country, so it seems sensible to go home as it seems a safer place to be."" He said the government advice ""hasn't been very straightforward"". ""I am meant to be in the university twice a week for lessons but with the majority of people I know going home I'm not sure how or if these lessons will proceed. ""As a final year student, the lessons are important, but I can't justify staying in uni accommodation on my own to go into the university twice a week. ""The new rules have affected my decision hugely. With pubs shutting yet again Bristol has lost its last semblance of nightlife. ""I think I had my mind set from the first announcement. I feel maybe I could have stayed if my whole flat collectively decided we would but, as of now, two of them have already gone."" Reading University student Lucy wants to be with her parents University of Reading student Lucy Coleman said she will spend lockdown at home rather than living at her university house. The 21-year-old said she feels there is no point being on campus when her lectures are all online. The mathematics student from Sherborne, Dorset, said: ""When a second lockdown was announced my immediate reaction was to phone my parents to discuss it with them. ""If there are no sports or socialising it can get very lonely, so I just wanted to be with my parents. ""I know universities aren't necessarily affected, but I feel they may end up closing the library and stuff. ""And if they extend the lockdown I definitely don't want to be stuck here over Christmas.""

Newly discovered primate 'already facing extinction'Historical museum specimens have helped to solve a long standing scientific monkey puzzle.Science & Environment,"The monkey is known for its white eye patches A monkey that is new to science has been discovered in the remote forests of Myanmar. The Popa langur, named after its home on Mount Popa, is critically endangered with numbers down to about 200 individuals. Langurs are a group of leaf-eating monkeys that are found across south east Asia. The newly described animal is known for its distinctive spectacle-like eye patches and greyish-coloured fur. It is at risk from habitat loss and hunting. Scientists have long suspected there might be a new species in Myanmar, based on DNA extracted from the droppings of wild monkeys, but evidence has been hard to find. Conservation: Glimmer of hope for world's rarest primate Conservation: Bridge of hope for world's rarest primate Mystery extinct ape found in ancient Chinese tomb About 100 of the monkeys live in a protected forest near Mount Popa With very little information to go on, they turned to historical specimens stored in natural history museums in London, Leiden, New York and Singapore. Early explorers to Burma collected the monkey specimens, which had never been examined in detail. The researchers extracted DNA and measured physical features such as tail and ear length, which they compared with those of wild populations. This revealed a new species, the Popa langur, which is found only in patches of forest in the centre of the country. Most live in a wildlife sanctuary park on the slopes of the sacred pilgrimage site of Mount Popa. Describing the species scientifically will help in its conservation, said Frank Momberg of the conservation group Fauna & Flora International. He told BBC News: ""The Popa langur, just newly described, is already critically endangered and facing extinction so it's absolutely critical to protect the remaining population and to engage with local communities as well as private sector stakeholders to safeguard its future."" There are only 200 to 250 animals of the new species, which live in four isolated populations. The monkey lives in social groups In the last decade or so, Myanmar has opened up to international collaborations with scientists, which has led to the discovery of species new to science, including reptiles, amphibians. But the discovery of a new primate is rare. Christian Roos of the primate genetics laboratory at the German Primate Centre in Gottingnen said the animals faced threats from habitat loss and hunting. ""Hunting is a big problem but the bigger threat is the habitat is almost gone and it is reduced, fragmented and isolated due to human encroachment, "" he said. The discovery is described in the journalZoological Research. Genetic studies revealed that the Popa langur (Trachypithecus popa) separated from other known species around one million years ago.

Sarah Wakefield, 46, from Bridgend, said: ""I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Campaign group Long Covid Wales wants specialist clinics across Wales,similar to those planned for England. The Welsh Government said it expected health boards to develop and improve access to rehabilitation services. Long Covid is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had coronavirus. Mrs Wakefield - once so fit - says she now cannot carry out simple tasks such as carrying laundry upstairs BBC Wales Live asked Wales' seven health boards if they have a specialist long Covid service. But so far only one health board said it would set up a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation service for people with long Covid who did not initially need hospitalisation. Mrs Wakefield was working as a mountain bike coach and paddle sports instructor but says she now struggles to carry laundry upstairs, make tea or help her three children with homework because of her symptoms. She has not worked since March and said was going to have to apply for benefits. Mrs Wakefield says she struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks She said: ""The sort of work I did required me to ride six or seven hours up the mountain - and I couldn't even dream of going up the end of my road on my bike at the moment."" 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? Coronavirus: 'Long Covid could be four different syndromes' Long Covid: 'I thought I'd get over this no problem' Mrs Wakefield, who owns her own business, said she hoped to be able to work again by next spring, but the ongoing nature of long Covid made it hard to know when she would feel better. Dr Ian Frayling has had symptoms of long Covid since March Dr Ian Frayling, 61, from Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, is a genetic pathologist and senior clinical research fellow at Cardiff University. He is also a member of the campaign group Long Covid Wales, having had symptoms of the condition since early March. He said: ""It takes your life awayâ¦ it's frightening because it's an illness without a prognosis, we have no idea how long it will continue in people. ""Those of us who were infected very early on are still suffering."" Dr Frayling said there should be multi-disciplinary clinics in each health board area to avoid what he called the current ""postcode lottery"". Lee David Bowen, 49, from Trethomas, Caerphilly, is a professional opera singer who has previously performed with the Welsh National Opera. He has been suffering with fatigue and brain fog since he became unwell with Covid-19 at the end of February. Lee David Bowen has been suffering with fatigue since February He said: ""Something as simple as cooking a meal can be shattering, really debilitating. ""Trying to catch up on admin, emails from my agent or whatever, you get through one email and it's exhausting, absolutely exhausting."" He thinks some people with long Covid have been ignored by their GPs. ""It's just very saddening to see these people are not being taken seriously,"" he added. ""And I can see that not only is there going to be a physical health problem for people, but there's a massive mental health problem that's coming down the line."" Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King's College London Tim Spector led aCovid symptom study,external, which looked at data from 4m people in the UK using a symptom tracker app. It found older people, women and those who experience a wide range of initial Covid-19 symptoms may bemore likely to develop long Covid. He warned unless the virus changes, there will continue to be an increase in cases of long Covid. He said: ""It could be that this ends up being a longer lasting public health problem than actually the excess deaths caused by the virus that tend to occur in the more elderly in our population."" He also backed calls for regional multi-disciplinary centres. ""At the moment there's no treatments but we do urgently need more research in this area and we need earlier interventionâ¦ we need to get a lot of different expertise together to get on top of this,"" he said. Mrs Wakefield said the nature of her illness meant she did not know when she would be able to return to work Cardiff and Vale Health Board is the first in Wales planning to open a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation service. It hopes to open in early December and run it until April 2022. A psychologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, dietician and a speech and language therapist will collectively treat the physical and mental health symptoms associated with long Covid as part of the service. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Our approach to supporting people recovering from Covid-19 will continue to be focused on providing care and support as close to home as possible, which is tailored to people's specific needs. ""We have published a national rehabilitation framework and guidance, which is based on the latest available evidence and will continue to be updated as we continue to learn and improve our understanding of this disease and its long-term impacts ""Our winter protection plan and NHS planning guidance makes clear we expect health boards to work with their partners, including GP practices, to develop and improve access to multi-professional rehabilitation services."" Long Covid, also known as post-Covid syndrome, is a condition where a person experiences symptomsmore than 12 weeks after becoming infected,externalwith coronavirus. Research by King's College London estimatesone in 45 people are sick for at least 12 weeks. Symptoms vary from person to person but can include fatigue, breathlessness, a cough that will not go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut.

"Children 'failed' by broken care systemEngland's children's commissioner says some young people are living in ""disgusting"" conditions.Family & Education","The most vulnerable children are being ""failed by the state"" and a broken residential care system, the children's commissioner for England has said. Greater use of private provision has led to a fragmented, unco-ordinated and irrational system amid ""significant profits"", said Anne Longfield. The system has been allowed to slip deeper into crisis, she said. The government said an independent review of children's social care would begin ""as soon as possible"". Ms Longfield has published three reports detailing the plight of children the system ""doesn't know what to do with"". She said the government has failed to respond to previous warnings that thousands of these children are in danger of becoming victims of criminal and sexual exploitation. Older children were found to be living in ""disgusting"" conditions akin to a prison cell, one of the reports said. It described how one 17-year-old said her accommodation was filthy and smelly, with just one working shower - covered in mould - between 14 children and young adults. ""Elsewhere children have told us they have not even been provided with the means to eat or sleep - things like duvet covers, plates or cutlery,"" the same report said. Unregulated homes 'inappropriate' for under 18s Children in care 'moved around like parcels' Councils 'in red over child protection' All three reports highlight a shortage of children's home places, resulting in: 8,000 children moving between three or more homes within a year 13,000 children in unregulated homes at some point during a year hundreds unable to get places in a secure children's homes ""Only last month, a High Court judge wrote to me after an extremely vulnerable child in care could not get a suitable care home place anywhere in the country, even though the courts had found their life was in danger,"" said Ms Longfield. ""These shocking cases used to be rare but are now routine, and I am worried the whole system is becoming immune to the devastating effect this is having on children who may have previously been abused and neglected, or have serious mental or physical health needs."" One of the reports analyses how, over the past decade, as demand for care has grown and local authority provision has failed to keep pace, private provision has expanded. The researchers found the majority of private provision was rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, although smaller providers were more likely to have lower ratings than either larger providers or local authorities. Some providers are owned by private equity companies and carry ""significant amounts of debt"" which could ""risk their stability"", says the report. ""Both the government and councils have failed in their responsibilities by leaving it to the market,"" said Ms Longfield. ""The growing reliance on private providers, some of whom are making millions, is another symptom of a system failing to prioritise the needs of children."" Iryna Pona, policy manager at the Children's Society, said the reports were enormously worrying but not surprising. ""The Children's Society is very concerned about how children in care are being failed by the very services who are supposed to be caring for and protecting them,"" she said. This video can not be played The findings of a 2019 BBC investigation on children in care were called ""a scandal"" The Local Government Association, which represents councils across England, says it shares the commissioner's concerns about the risk of businesses running children's homes going bust asadult care provider Southern Cross did, almost a decade ago. ""Providers should also not be making excessive profit from providing placements for children,"" said Judith Blake, who chairs the LGA's Children and Young People Board. A Department for Education statement said: ""The education secretary has been clear that no child should be denied the opportunity for a loving, stable family life, or be bounced around the care system in accommodation that does not meet their needs. ""We have also set out that children under the age of 16 should not be living in unregulated homes. ""Our bold, broad and independently led care review will launch as soon as possible, and will support improvements in the children's social care system.""

UK to ban illegally logged rainforest productsGreen groups welcome the UK's plan to outlaw the import of food and other goods from protected areas.Science & Environment,"A road cuts through burnt Amazon rainforest in Brazil New laws should help prevent consumers from buying food grown on rainforest land that has been illegally logged. UK firms will be banned from selling commodities if their production breaches local laws protecting forests and other natural areas. The change will be included in a new Environment Bill that MPswill discuss. The aim is to stop British consumers playing an inadvertent role in an environmental crime through the goods in their supermarket basket. McDonald's among firms urging tougher forest rules Deforestation link to Amazon soya and beef exports Fears over 'weakening' of UK green watchdog The key commodities most grown on land that is illegally cleared are: cocoa soya palm oil beef and leather rubber timber pulp and paper It is estimated that around half of tropical deforestation is illegal - and linked to the expansion of commercial forestry and agriculture, with land being cleared to make way for grazing animals and growing crops. That matters to humanity because rainforests are vital for absorbing climate-heating emissions, their diverse species, their capacity to store water and their potential for new medicines. Palm oil plantations have led to a loss of rainforest The government has agreed the UK must stop metaphorically ""importing"" the problem of deforestation. Its move has been welcomed by environmentalists, but they raise questions whether it will be possible to trace all products. They also ask what level the fines will be, and how the law will be enforced. Ruth Chambers, from the umbrella group Greener UK, said âThis is really a great step to protect rainforests â but we donât know the full details yet. âThe other issue is that this ban only refers to illegally deforested landâ¦ in some countries forest protection is so weak that rainforests are being felled legally. What will the government do about that?â Other green groups said much more was needed to halt rainforest loss. The governmentâs decision follows recommendations from the independent Global Resource Initiative Taskforce, which consulted more than 200 businesses and organisations. It said the UK should work in partnership with other countries and support farmers to transition to less damaging forms of farming. International Environment Minister, Lord Goldsmith, said: âIn every conceivable way we depend on the natural world around us. Protecting rainforests must be a core priority. âOur new due diligence law is one piece of a much bigger package of measures that we are putting in place to tackle deforestation.â Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of the taskforce, said: âWe are at an extraordinary inflection point â governments are having to invest in recovery and have choices about how to invest to build back better. ""One of the ways we can do this is through our supply chains and what we buy. âThe government recognises the responsibility of the UK to ensure we are not importing deforestation and contributing to further environmental crisis.â Supermarkets have played a part in the global taskforce. Tesco chief executive Jason Tarry said: âThis aligns with Tescoâs goal of zero deforestation.  We hope this encourages all businesses to do the right thing.â The government will welcome the positive reaction of green groups towards this addition to the Environment Bill. Ministers have been at loggerheads with green campaigners and the Lords over their refusal to enshrine in law that imported food stuffs should match the standard of foods from British farms.

No decision on NI Covid restrictions after talks,"Pubs and restaurants were among businesses forced to close in Northern Ireland on 16 October The Stormont executive remains deadlocked over what to do when the coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland end, in just over a day's time. Ministers met on Wednesday night to try to resolve differences, but the meeting was adjourned shortly before 20:30 GMT without any announcement. The regulations saw much of NI's economy placed under tight measures on 16 October. Ministers will meet on Thursday morning, hours before the laws expire. The Department of Health reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, with 791 more people testing positive for the virus. Earlier, a proposal from the health minister to extend all measures for one more week was blocked by the DUP. The DUP supports a partial reopening of hospitality and close contact services from Friday. It put forward a separate proposal suggesting this, but it was also voted down at the executive. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, has suggested a compromise proposal which would have kept the restrictions in place for one more week and this will be discussed by ministers on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, Health Minister Robin Swann warned his ministerial colleagues that doing nothing ""needs to be avoided"" at all costs, and that some mitigations must be retained. But the proposal fell after the DUP triggered a cross-community vote, effectively giving them a veto over the plan. Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? This can be deployed by any three ministers to require cross-community support on a particular matter, effectively giving a party with enough ministers in the power-sharing executive a veto. Mr Swann's original proposal calling for a two-week extension wasblocked by the DUP on Tuesday. Late-night talks resulting in stalemate at Stormont aren't exactly a rare occurrence. If past experience is anything to go by, usually the longer discussions go on, the more time there is for opposing positions to become entrenched. History seems to be repeating itself except unlike with previous deadlocks, this time ministers are grappling with the ongoing challenge of a global pandemic. Both lives and livelihoods are immediately on the line. Throughout the crisis, the executive has consisted of five political parties in the power-sharing coalition, where reaching consensus has required a delicate balance of competing party interests and conflicting policy decisions. Read more here. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance had previously said they would support a two-week extension of all restrictions. Mr Weir claimed Sinn FÃ©in had changed its stance over relaxing restrictions and claimed inter-party agreement could have been reached earlier. ""I think people want certainty and I hope there can be a sensible compromise that can be reached,"" he added. ""It's important to stress that poverty can kill as well as Covid-19."" Michelle O'Neill says her party will be guided by public health advice On Sunday, Ms O'Neill had suggesteda partial and graduated reopening of some sectors was being considered by ministers. In a statement on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said: ""Last night, Sinn FÃ©in, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party voted in favour of the health minister's proposals to extend restrictions. The DUP blocked those proposals."" First Minister Arlene Foster told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that any decision on the restrictions must be balanced and protect both hospitals and livelihoods. Northern Ireland was facing a ""mental health tsunami"" if the economy was not considered, as well as health advice, she said. ""There will be excess deaths if we continue with the restrictions or if we take no decisions at all,"" the DUP leader said. Arlene Foster said that she would have liked a decision much sooner ""but we are in a five-party coalition and that brings challenges with it"" ""Poverty has its own health outcomes... we are facing a mental health tsunami in relation to the pressure that we are putting on families as they come up to Christmas."" BBC News NI has seen the latest advice from Health Minister Robin Swann, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young, issued to ministers on Wednesday. It is understood Mr Swann stated that a ""do nothing"" approach, allowing the regulations to expire, is the worst possible scenario and should be avoided at all costs. Modelling data from health officials to the executive says that reopening some sectors, or allowing the regulations to expire, mean it is ""more likely than not"" that further interventions may be required before Christmas. The Â£400m figure presented by Mrs Dodds comes from a study by Stormont's Department for the Economywhich looks at lost output,external. It includes direct and indirect losses along with the costs of a potential delay to economic recovery, and comes with a significant margin of error. The department has also produced a second estimate using an economic model built by the Fraser of Allander Institute, which estimates the lost output to be about Â£430m. Restaurateur Martin Murphy is not hopeful that his businesses will open this weekend. He said he felt ""left in limbo"". Hair and beauty salons closed on Friday 16 October - it is thought they could reopen with some mitigations ""We were supposed to open on Friday but as yet, there's no planning. There's no way we could open on Friday - regardless of what the executive decides, it's still off the table for us,"" said Mr Murphy. ""We've been closed now for coming up to four weeks, there's been no grants in our bank account whatsoever."" One of the proposals brought by Mrs Dodds would allow close contact businesses to re-open on a ""one in, one out"" basis by appointment only. Hairdresser Lynette Murray already operates on that policy and asked why she was forced to close in the first place. ""I would have assumed there would have been some sort of risk assessment, but everyone was put in the same category,"" she said. ""I think it's really unfair. We are in the position where we don't have the luxury of getting paid if we don't go to work. ""We have applied for grants but nothing has gone into our bank accounts.""

MP writes to Hancock over anorexia inquests,"Clockwise, from top left: Maddy Wallace, Amanda Bowles, Averil Hart, Emma Brown and Maria Jakes An MP has written to Health Secretary Matt Hancock about concerns in anorexia treatment in the wake of five inquests for women who died with the illness. Issues including patient monitoring and poor clinical training were raised at inquests for the women, who died in Cambridgeshire between 2012 and 2018. Cambridge MP Daniel Zeichner asked Mr Hancock what ""the government plan to learn from this terrible situation"". The Department of Health told the BBC: ""It is vital we learn lessons"". Cambridgeshire and Peterborough assistant coroner Sean Horstead said he would write a prevention of future deaths report following the inquests into the deaths of Averil Hart, Emma Brown, Maria Jakes, Amanda Bowles and Madeline Wallace. How anorexia took the lives of five women Amanda Bowles was found dead at her Cambridge home in September 2017 Mr Horstead said the ""absence of a formally commissioned monitoring service in primary or secondary care is the context wherein a number of these deaths have arisen"". The coroner also raised concerns over education and training, finding a ""level of ignorance amongst medical practitioners that has yet to change"". Mr Horstead said there was ""a hope that the tide can be turned"" and that the inquests ""can be the start of that in some small way"". Maria Jakes died at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridge in September 2018 Ms Bowles, Ms Jakes and Miss Hart all died in Cambridge and in his letter to Mr Hancock, the city's Labour MP Mr Zeichner said: ""I am sure you agree with me that these are truly tragic cases and our hearts go out to the families of these women."" He added: ""I would be grateful if you could let me know what lessons the government plan to learn from this terrible situation so as to improve the quality of NHS provisions for those with eating disorders such as anorexia to prevent more deaths, both in Cambridge and Peterborough, and nationally."" A spokesman for the department said: ""Every death from an eating disorder is a tragedy and it is vital we learn lessons where things have gone wrong to ensure the NHS provides safe, high quality care, including by responding effectively to matters of concern raised by coroners. ""We are committed to ensuring those who need it can access support and are expanding eating disorder services through the NHS's long-term plan, including scaling up early intervention services to support young people.""

'Long Covid has left me feeling like I'm 96',"This video can not be played Long Covid is not yet fully understood A sports instructor suffering from ""long Covid"" says she struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks since becoming unwell in March. Sarah Wakefield, 46, from Bridgend, said: ""I feel like I'm 96. It's horrible."" Campaign group Long Covid Wales wants specialist clinics across Wales,similar to those planned for England. The Welsh Government said it expected health boards to develop and improve access to rehabilitation services. Long Covid is a term being used to describe a range of symptoms identified in people months after they have had coronavirus. Mrs Wakefield - once so fit - says she now cannot carry out simple tasks such as carrying laundry upstairs BBC Wales Live asked Wales' seven health boards if they have a specialist long Covid service. But so far only one health board said it would set up a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation service for people with long Covid who did not initially need hospitalisation. Mrs Wakefield was working as a mountain bike coach and paddle sports instructor but says she now struggles to carry laundry upstairs, make tea or help her three children with homework because of her symptoms. She has not worked since March and said was going to have to apply for benefits. Mrs Wakefield says she struggles to speak, climb stairs and do everyday tasks She said: ""The sort of work I did required me to ride six or seven hours up the mountain - and I couldn't even dream of going up the end of my road on my bike at the moment."" 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering? Coronavirus: 'Long Covid could be four different syndromes' Long Covid: 'I thought I'd get over this no problem' Mrs Wakefield, who owns her own business, said she hoped to be able to work again by next spring, but the ongoing nature of long Covid made it hard to know when she would feel better. Dr Ian Frayling has had symptoms of long Covid since March Dr Ian Frayling, 61, from Cowbridge, Vale of Glamorgan, is a genetic pathologist and senior clinical research fellow at Cardiff University. He is also a member of the campaign group Long Covid Wales, having had symptoms of the condition since early March. He said: ""It takes your life awayâ¦ it's frightening because it's an illness without a prognosis, we have no idea how long it will continue in people. ""Those of us who were infected very early on are still suffering."" Dr Frayling said there should be multi-disciplinary clinics in each health board area to avoid what he called the current ""postcode lottery"". Lee David Bowen, 49, from Trethomas, Caerphilly, is a professional opera singer who has previously performed with the Welsh National Opera. He has been suffering with fatigue and brain fog since he became unwell with Covid-19 at the end of February. Lee David Bowen has been suffering with fatigue since February He said: ""Something as simple as cooking a meal can be shattering, really debilitating. ""Trying to catch up on admin, emails from my agent or whatever, you get through one email and it's exhausting, absolutely exhausting."" He thinks some people with long Covid have been ignored by their GPs. ""It's just very saddening to see these people are not being taken seriously,"" he added. ""And I can see that not only is there going to be a physical health problem for people, but there's a massive mental health problem that's coming down the line."" Professor of Genetic Epidemiology at King's College London Tim Spector led aCovid symptom study,external, which looked at data from 4m people in the UK using a symptom tracker app. It found older people, women and those who experience a wide range of initial Covid-19 symptoms may bemore likely to develop long Covid. He warned unless the virus changes, there will continue to be an increase in cases of long Covid. He said: ""It could be that this ends up being a longer lasting public health problem than actually the excess deaths caused by the virus that tend to occur in the more elderly in our population."" He also backed calls for regional multi-disciplinary centres. ""At the moment there's no treatments but we do urgently need more research in this area and we need earlier interventionâ¦ we need to get a lot of different expertise together to get on top of this,"" he said. Mrs Wakefield said the nature of her illness meant she did not know when she would be able to return to work Cardiff and Vale Health Board is the first in Wales planning to open a multi-disciplinary rehabilitation service. It hopes to open in early December and run it until April 2022. A psychologist, physiotherapist, occupational therapist, dietician and a speech and language therapist will collectively treat the physical and mental health symptoms associated with long Covid as part of the service. A Welsh Government spokesperson said: ""Our approach to supporting people recovering from Covid-19 will continue to be focused on providing care and support as close to home as possible, which is tailored to people's specific needs. ""We have published a national rehabilitation framework and guidance, which is based on the latest available evidence and will continue to be updated as we continue to learn and improve our understanding of this disease and its long-term impacts ""Our winter protection plan and NHS planning guidance makes clear we expect health boards to work with their partners, including GP practices, to develop and improve access to multi-professional rehabilitation services."" Long Covid, also known as post-Covid syndrome, is a condition where a person experiences symptomsmore than 12 weeks after becoming infected,externalwith coronavirus. Research by King's College London estimatesone in 45 people are sick for at least 12 weeks. Symptoms vary from person to person but can include fatigue, breathlessness, a cough that will not go away, joint pain, muscle aches, hearing and eyesight problems, headaches, loss of smell and taste as well as damage to the heart, lungs, kidneys and gut. Mental health problems have been reported including depression, anxiety and struggling to think clearly. More on Wales Live 22.35 GMT, BBC One Wales 'Long Covid': Why are some people not recovering?

Fears for teachers' workload after exams cancelled,"This video can not be played Some pupils are happy with the news but others less so A union has expressed concerns that teachers' workload will increase as Wales' GCSE, AS and A-level exams in summer 2021 are cancelled. On Tuesday it wasannounced assessments would be done under teacher supervisiondue to the impact of Covid-19. They will be externally set and marked but delivered within the classroom. NASUWT Cymru welcomed the move but warned teachers could not be expected to ""come up with, prepare, assess, standardise and moderate"". Allow Twitter content?

Speaking on behalf of the teaching union, Sion Amlyn said it was ""imperative that as much of that workload is taken off the teachers as possible"". ""There are still question marks in terms of what exactly the mechanism will be,"" he said. ""When you consider what's been happening with this pandemic in general, and when you apply that to a school based scenario, our members are already telling us that they are struggling to finish the syllabus let alone anything else. Q&A: What does Wales scrapping 2021 exams mean? Mixed response as 2021 exams in Wales scrapped ""Any mechanism that they come up with for this continual assessment style approach to give qualifications - the mechanism needs to have the assessment, the moderation and the standardisation done elsewhere because fundamentally we must be able to let the teachers carry on with their fundamental workload, and that is teaching kids to prepare them for whatever lies ahead."" But Mr Amlyn added it was beneficial that a decision had been made so that teachers can now plan ahead. On Tuesday Education Minister Kirsty Williams said it was impossible to guarantee a level playing field for exams due to the ongoing impact of the Covid pandemic. She said cancelling exams would give time for teaching to continue through the summer term adding that teachers would have flexibility on when to take the assessments, within the ""context of results timelines"".

Although the education minister said universities are familiar with different qualifications, Cerys said she did not feel reassured, and was looking forward to more detail as to how the system is going to work.

Businesses 'not ready' with 50 days until Brexit,"Helen Roberts is worried about the impact no trade deal would have on lamb sales Welsh businesses and ports are not yet ready for the end of the Brexit transition phase in 50 days' time, a Welsh minister has said. Labour's Jeremy Miles has asked firms to urgently look at what they need to do by 31 December. He urged UK ministers to ""support jobs"" by not ending the transition period without a trade deal with the EU. But Conservative Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said that ""by and large people are getting ready"". What is the Brexit transition period? 'Welsh farmers too reliant on exporting to the EU' Post-Brexit aid replacement progress 'negligible' On Wednesday the Welsh Governmentpublished its plan for the end of the transition period,external. The report says a ""Crisis Intervention Scheme' may be needed to support Welsh meat exporters if no deal on UK-EU trade is struck. ""Such a scheme could potentially be of a substantial scale and would require cross-UK collaboration and additional UK Government financial support to be provided to the Welsh Government to deliver,"" the document says. It also warns of ""potential for major disruption to international trade (particularly, but not only, with the EU) impacting on exporting businesses, import supply chains and inward investment which all in turn could risk the sustainability of some businesses and negatively impact on jobs and wages"".In the meantime Mr Miles, Welsh minister for European transition, has urged people to look at how their business or family could be affected by the end of the transition period and take steps to prepare. He called on the UK Government to ""take responsibility and act with us"" on areas it is responsible for. The transition phase, until the 31 December, allows the UK to trade with the European Unions as if it were a member, with the United Kingdom following EU rules and regulations. Jeremy Miles says not agreeing a trade deal with the EU would be ""grossly irresponsible"" The UK is currently negotiating a trade deal with the EU, but there aresticking points on issues such as fishing rights and business competition rules. The prime minister has insisted the United Kingdom is ""very well prepared"" to move on if the two parties cannot agree a deal. Without a trade deal, the UK would trade with the EU on World Trade Organisation terms - meaning higher taxes would be imposed on products being imported and exported. A lamb producer, whose farm spans the Wales-England border south of Wrexham, is concerned about the impact of these tariffs if the UK has to sell its lamb to the EU without a trade deal. Helen Roberts, who is also development officer of the National Sheep Association Cymru, said a deal would offer farmers security. ""We've taken the decision to carry on putting the ram out, and producing next year's crop, and we'll have to take the consequences of what a no deal might bring for us next year, which could possibly be a cut in income of up to 30%,"" she said. The UK's Brexit transition period ends on 31 December Mr Miles said it was difficult to mitigate all the impacts of the transition period ending but businesses needed the ""certainty"" of knowing whether a deal would be agreed or not. He said: ""These are big challenges and the message from us isn't 'everything will be fine', but everyone needs to make sure they're aware of the impact on them and take the appropriate steps in the short period we have left."" However Mr Hart said businesses should be aware that deals ""by and large go to the wire"". He added: ""I don't buy the argument that somehow the fact this hasn't been settled by now comes as a surprise. That's not how substantial negotiations like this work."" Mr Miles said that while some of the responsibilities of preparing Welsh ports were Welsh Government responsibilities, checks on the border from 1 January would be a UK government responsibility. ""We need to make sure that businesses, exporters, hauliers, the port companies are all prepared for that and the infrastructure is in place to deal with it,"" he said. Mr Miles added there had not been ""as much engagement as we should have"" over the Welsh Government having more involvement in the discussions. Simon Hart says Wales could ""weather that storm"" of no trade deal with the EU However Mr Hart said there ""has been proper engagement"". ""The infrastructure plans around Holyhead are well advanced,"" he said. ""There has been discussion around the precise location of a site, that involves local authorities and others. ""I'm confident we can meet the deadlines by June or July next year so any disruption is absolutely minimised. ""That does require UK and Welsh Government collaboration - that element has been quite positive."" Mr Miles said it would be ""grossly irresponsible"" of the UK government to fail to agree a trade deal with the EU. ""If the UK leaves the transition period with a weak deal or no deal at all - that will be a matter of political choice for the UK government. ""We are asking the UK government to make the right choices to support jobs and livelihoods in Wales, to give people the clarity and the certainty that they are crying out for what will happen at the end of December."" But Mr Hart said that if no deal was agreed then Wales could ""weather that storm and come out stronger the other side"" and ruled out an extension of the transition period. ""We made a commitment in our manifesto to deliver on the outcome of that referendum, that's precisely what we are doing - no ifs no buts.""

Peru clashes over President Vizcarra's impeachment,"This video can not be played Peru protests spurred by President Vizcarra's impeachment Clashes have broken out in the Peruvian capital, Lima, between security forces and protesters angry at the impeachment of President MartÃ­n Vizcarra. Riot police were out in force to keep the demonstrators back, using tear gas and jets of water. The police tried to keep hundreds of people away from the Congress building. On Monday, Congress voted to impeach Mr Vizcarra over allegations he handed out government contracts in return for bribes. The unrest occurred as the Speaker of Congress Manuel Merino was being sworn in as the country's interim president. There are concerns of a growing political crisis as Peru faces a severe economic downturn brought on by the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Vizcarra enjoys continued support among many voters for his reform attempts. President Martin Vizcarra has denied the allegations of wrongdoing As an independent, he repeatedly clashed with Congress, and some of his supporters have labelled his ousting a coup. Mr Vizcarra previously said he would accept the impeachment vote, not take any legal action, and leave the presidential palace. But on Tuesday, he questioned the ""legality and legitimacy"" of his removal. ""Legality is in question because the Constitutional Court has not yet ruled, and legitimacy is given by the people,"" he told reporters outside his home in Lima. Some of Mr Vizcarra's supporters have labelled his ousting a coup Mr Merino is expected to assume the presidency until July 2021 - when Mr Vizcarra's term was due to end. Coronavirus: What's happening in Peru? Monday's move in Congress came after a previous attempt to oust the president. An earlier vote held on 18 September fell far short of gaining the necessary votes when only 32 lawmakers cast their ballot in favour of removing Mr Vizcarra. Mr Vizcarra, 57, has previously denied allegations that he accepted bribes worth 2.3m soles ($640,000; Â£487,000) when he was governor of the southern Moquegua region. As well as Lima, several other cities across the country saw hundreds of people join rallies He became president in March 2018 and had been embroiled in a bitter battle with Congress, which is dominated by rival parties, since he took office. Last year, the president dissolved Congress, arguing that lawmakers were obstructing his anti-corruption agenda. A new Congress was elected in January, but tension remains high between the legislative and the executive, with Mr Vizcarra accusing lawmakers of fostering ""chaos and disorder"". Presidential elections are scheduled for April 2021, and Mr Vizcarra is banned by the constitution from running for a second term.

Anglesey 'best site in UK' for nuclear plant,"The new Wylfa power station would have been built next to the old power plant on Anglesey A leading American engineering firm has said Wylfa is considered by many as ""the best site in the UK"" to build a large new nuclear power plant. Bechtel has been reported to be leading a consortium of companies in a bid to restart the project on Anglesey. It comes after Japanese firm Hitachipulled the plug on the Â£20bn Wylfa Newydd schemein September. But while Bechtel has not confirmed the move it has confirmed being involved in Wylfa Newydd from the start. Critics have argued nuclear energy is expensive, dangerous and has a legacy of waste lasting generations. They want to see greener solutions such as wind and marine energy. But Bechtel told BBC News Wales: ""We remain committed to working with our partners in the UK and abroad to deliver the best clean energy solutions to power millions of homes.Â£ Fresh talks to save Â£20bn nuclear plant revealed Family home demolished for scrapped nuclear plant A site on Anglesey would be ""helping the UK reach net zero, supporting the government's levelling up agenda and turbocharging the UK's domestic nuclear supply chain capability, setting it on a path to deliver and export future clean energy solutions"", the firm added. The UK government remains committed to building large-scale nuclear power plants, which it sees as central to decarbonising the energy supply. It is expected to publish a 10-point plan next week to meet a target of net zero emissions in the UK by 2050. Six previous nuclear sites had been identified as locations for new plants to be built. But only Hinkley Point in Somerset has gone ahead, with three others, including Wylfa Newydd, losing their financial backers. Despite the UK government's commitment to large scale nuclear power plants, the cost of construction has raised concerns for investors. It had held a public consultation on bills for energy payers being increased to help cover the costs of building new nuclear power stations, but nothing concrete followed. Other financial support has been made available by the UK government for the nuclear industry. Ynys Mon MP Virginia Crosbie hopes projects such as Wylfa Newydd would help keep young people on the island. ""Anglesey desperately needs skilled employment which is why I have championed Wylfa Newydd and Anglesey as 'Energy Island' at every opportunity, and I am working with all levels of local and national partners to make it happen,"" she said. ""There are many other innovative projects on Anglesey that have the potential to offer skilled employment and I am keen to encourage young people to stay on the island and invest in their community.""

Boris Johnson congratulates Biden,"UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has congratulated Joe Biden on his US election win. Mr Biden called the PM ahead of the leaders of other major European countries. Mr Johnson said he looked forward to ""strengthening the partnership"" between the US and UK. He is also understood to have assured Mr Biden that Brexit would not undermine theGood Friday Agreementon peace in Northern Ireland. In a statement, Mr Biden's office,externalsaid he had ""reaffirmed"" his support for the Good Friday Agreement, which his Democratic predecessor in the White House, President Bill Clinton, played an instrumental role in bringing about. It said he had also expressed his desire to strengthen the historic ""special relationship"" between the two countries and ""redouble co-operation"" on issues of mutual concern, including health security and promoting democracy. The media declared Mr Biden the election winner on Saturday after he passed the threshold of 270electoral college votes. But counting is ongoing in some states, with incumbent President Donald Trump disputing many of the results. PM Biden tweet glitch blamed on technical error What a Biden presidency means for the UK World leaders who haven't congratulated Biden A Downing Street spokesperson said the prime minister had ""warmly congratulated"" Mr Biden and ""conveyed his congratulations"" to Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris. ""They discussed the close and longstanding relationship between our countries and committed to building on this partnership in the years ahead, in areas such as trade and security - including through Nato,"" the No 10 spokesperson added. ""The prime minister and president-elect also looked forward to working closely together on their shared priorities, from tackling climate change, to promoting democracy, and building back better from the coronavirus pandemic."" There is always a clamour to get an early call with a US President-elect. It seems Boris Johnson has fared well - with his phone ringing before other European leaders. Downing Street will hope that's a sign that Joe Biden values the ""special relationship"" and wants to work closely with Mr Johnson. But it's important to note President-elect Biden has been talking tonight about the importance of the Good Friday Agreement in the context of Brexit. It was raised in the call with the UK prime minister, who insisted the peace treaty would be protected by his plans. The controversialInternal Market Bill- which Mr Biden has previously raised questions about - wasn't discussed by name. But the UK knows the sands in the White House are shifting. A Brexit enthusiast is being replaced by a sceptic. The 25-minute conversation came amid concerns that Mr Biden'spreviously stated dislike of Brexit- which Mr Trump, by contrast, supported - could strain relations. It's understood Mr Johnson and Mr Biden discussed the importance of implementing Brexit in a way that upholds the Good Friday Agreement. Mr Johnson assured the President-elect that would be the case. Mr Biden later spoke to Ireland's Taoiseach (PM) MicheÃ¡l Martin, in what Mr Martin's aides described as a ""warm conversation"". ""President-elect Biden recalled his strong Irish roots and his visit to Ireland with his family in 2016,"" the Irish government said in a statement. ""The President-elect reaffirmed his full support for the Good Friday Agreement and they discussed the importance of a Brexit outcome that respects the Good Friday Agreement and ensures no return of a border on the island of Ireland."" The president-elect later spoke to French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Macron promised to work with the US to tackle climate change and terrorism, while Mrs Merkel said she wanted a close working relationship with the Biden administration, their spokespeople said. Earlier on Tuesday, the UK government blamed a""technical error""for a tweet from Mr Johnson congratulating Mr Biden on his US election victory which faintly showed the name ""Trump"" in the background.

"No decision on NI Covid restrictions after talksWith less than 48 hours to go until the current laws expire, ministers have yet to announce a plan.Northern Ireland","Pubs and restaurants were among businesses forced to close in Northern Ireland on 16 October The Stormont executive remains deadlocked over what to do when the coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland end, in just over a day's time. Ministers met on Wednesday night to try to resolve differences, but the meeting was adjourned shortly before 20:30 GMT without any announcement. The regulations saw much of NI's economy placed under tight measures on 16 October. Ministers will meet on Thursday morning, hours before the laws expire. The Department of Health reported eight further coronavirus-related deaths on Wednesday, with 791 more people testing positive for the virus. Earlier, a proposal from the health minister to extend all measures for one more week was blocked by the DUP. The DUP supports a partial reopening of hospitality and close contact services from Friday. It put forward a separate proposal suggesting this, but it was also voted down at the executive. The Alliance leader, Naomi Long, has suggested a compromise proposal which would have kept the restrictions in place for one more week and this will be discussed by ministers on Thursday. Earlier on Wednesday, Health Minister Robin Swann warned his ministerial colleagues that doing nothing ""needs to be avoided"" at all costs, and that some mitigations must be retained. But the proposal fell after the DUP triggered a cross-community vote, effectively giving them a veto over the plan. Q&A: How does the NI Executive work? This can be deployed by any three ministers to require cross-community support on a particular matter, effectively giving a party with enough ministers in the power-sharing executive a veto. Mr Swann's original proposal calling for a two-week extension wasblocked by the DUP on Tuesday. Late-night talks resulting in stalemate at Stormont aren't exactly a rare occurrence. If past experience is anything to go by, usually the longer discussions go on, the more time there is for opposing positions to become entrenched. History seems to be repeating itself except unlike with previous deadlocks, this time ministers are grappling with the ongoing challenge of a global pandemic. Both lives and livelihoods are immediately on the line. Throughout the crisis, the executive has consisted of five political parties in the power-sharing coalition, where reaching consensus has required a delicate balance of competing party interests and conflicting policy decisions. Read more here. Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and Alliance had previously said they would support a two-week extension of all restrictions. Mr Weir claimed Sinn FÃ©in had changed its stance over relaxing restrictions and claimed inter-party agreement could have been reached earlier. ""I think people want certainty and I hope there can be a sensible compromise that can be reached,"" he added. ""It's important to stress that poverty can kill as well as Covid-19."" Michelle O'Neill says her party will be guided by public health advice On Sunday, Ms O'Neill had suggesteda partial and graduated reopening of some sectors was being considered by ministers. In a statement on Wednesday, Ms O'Neill said: ""Last night, Sinn FÃ©in, the UUP, the SDLP and the Alliance Party voted in favour of the health minister's proposals to extend restrictions. The DUP blocked those proposals."" First Minister Arlene Foster told the BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme that any decision on the restrictions must be balanced and protect both hospitals and livelihoods. Northern Ireland was facing a ""mental health tsunami"" if the economy was not considered, as well as health advice, she said. ""There will be excess deaths if we continue with the restrictions or if we take no decisions at all,"" the DUP leader said. Arlene Foster said that she would have liked a decision much sooner ""but we are in a five-party coalition and that brings challenges with it"" ""Poverty has its own health outcomes... we are facing a mental health tsunami in relation to the pressure that we are putting on families as they come up to Christmas."" BBC News NI has seen the latest advice from Health Minister Robin Swann, Chief Medical Officer Dr Michael McBride and Chief Scientific Adviser Prof Ian Young, issued to ministers on Wednesday. It is understood Mr Swann stated that a ""do nothing"" approach, allowing the regulations to expire, is the worst possible scenario and should be avoided at all costs. Modelling data from health officials to the executive says that reopening some sectors, or allowing the regulations to expire, mean it is ""more likely than not"" that further interventions may be required before Christmas. The Â£400m figure presented by Mrs Dodds comes from a study by Stormont's Department for the Economywhich looks at lost output,external. It includes direct and indirect losses along with the costs of a potential delay to economic recovery, and comes with a significant margin of error. The department has also produced a second estimate using an economic model built by the Fraser of Allander Institute, which estimates the lost output to be about Â£430m. Restaurateur Martin Murphy is not hopeful that his businesses will open this weekend. He said he felt ""left in limbo"". Hair and beauty salons closed on Friday 16 October - it is thought they could reopen with some mitigations ""We were supposed to open on Friday but as yet, there's no planning. There's no way we could open on Friday - regardless of what the executive decides, it's still off the table for us,"" said Mr Murphy. ""We've been closed now for coming up to four weeks, there's been no grants in our bank account whatsoever."" One of the proposals brought by Mrs Dodds would allow close contact businesses to re-open on a ""one in, one out"" basis by appointment only. Hairdresser Lynette Murray already operates on that policy and asked why she was forced to close in the first place. ""I would have assumed there would have been some sort of risk assessment, but everyone was put in the same category,"" she said. ""I think it's really unfair. We are in the position where we don't have the luxury of getting paid if we don't go to work. ""We have applied for grants but nothing has gone into our bank accounts.""

Technical error blamed for PM's Biden tweet glitchBoris Johnson's congratulatory message included the word Trump faintly in background.,"The hidden text can be easily seen after the colours of the image are manipulated The government has blamed a ""technical error"" for a Boris Johnson tweet congratulating Joe Biden on his US election victory which faintly showed the name ""Trump"" in the background. Social media users commented on the discrepancy while theGuido Fawkes website,externalsaid the message also included the word ""second term"" buried in it. Officials said two messages were prepared before the result was known. The alternative one had been ""embedded"" in the other by mistake, they said. Mr Johnson posted the message on Twitter on Saturday,externalafter broadcasters in the US and elsewhere declared the Democratic former vice-president the winner. Allow Twitter content?

On Monday, the prime minister - who has never met Mr Biden - congratulated him on his victory in a phone conversationwhich the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said lasted about 20 minutes. Mr Johnson said he and the president-elect discussed their ""shared priorities"" and was looking forward to ""strengthening the partnership"" between the two countries. The UK PM is believed to be the first European leader Mr Biden has spoken to since the election. Mr Biden is preparing to assume office in January, although incumbent President Donald Trump is refusing to accept the outcome of the election and is mounting a series of legal challenges in certain states. The message the PM sent on Sunday read: ""Congratulations to Joe Biden on his election as president of the United States and to Kamala Harris on her historic achievement. ""The US is our most important ally and I look forward to working closely together on our shared priorities, from climate change to trade and security."" But the message appeared to include traces of a different one referring to Mr Trump, who has been in office since 2017. Guido Fawkes said the ""remnants"" of this could be seen by adjusting the contrast and brightness levels of the actual message that was posted. This video can not be played UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson speaking about Joe Biden's victory: ""There's far more that unites us than divides us"" A government spokesperson said: ""As you'd expect, two statements were prepared in advance for the outcome of this closely contested election. ""A technical error meant that parts of the alternative message were embedded in the background of the graphic."" UK ministers have said they are excited about working with Mr Biden on issues such as climate change and trade. In recent days, Mr Biden's team has sought to downplay lingering tensions over Mr Johnson's role in Brexit and past comments he has made about both President Trump and his predecessor Barack Obama. Mr Biden, who has made his opposition to Brexit well known, has insisted maintaining peace in Northern Ireland is paramount in any post-Brexit UK-US trade deal. The president-elect is continuing a ring-round of world leaders, having also spoken to Germany's Angela Merkel and France's Emmanuel Macron. Before news of Mr Biden's conversation with Mr Johnson emerged, the Irish PM Michael Martin posted a Twitter message saying he had just finished a ""positive"" conversation with the president-elect. The message was quickly deleted, after which the Irish government revealed it had been sent in error and although a call had been arranged the two had yet to speak. A few hours later, Mr Martin posted another message saying he had had a ""warm and engaging"" call with Mr Biden.
