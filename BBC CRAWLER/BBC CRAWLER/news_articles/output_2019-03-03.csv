"Hunt for pair over stabbing of girl, 17","Jodie Chesney was fatally attacked in a park near Romford, east London Police are searching for two suspects they believe were involved in the stabbing of 17-year-old Jodie Chesney in east London. Jodie died at the scene of the attack in St Neot's Road, Harold Hill, at about 21:30 GMT on Friday. The Metropolitan Police said Jodie had been playing music with five other teenagers in a park when two males walked up to the group and one stabbed her once in the back. They ran off towards Retford Road. Officers said the pair had been seen in the park about half an hour earlier but had not spoken to Jodie or her group of friends. People have been laying flowers near the entrance to the part throughout Sunday The force said Jodie's attacker was a black male in his late teens but gave no further details, and said there were no descriptions of the second suspect. Det Ch Insp Dave Whellams urged any witnesses who had not spoken to police yet to contact him. ""There has been excellent support from the local community and a number of people have shared information with police, but there will be other witnesses and people with information that may prove crucial. ""Although the description of the suspect is limited, I am certain that people will have seen the two males hanging around the park or running away from the scene - or will otherwise have noticed something suspicious. I need those people to call me."" Jodie was earlier described as a ""bundle of joy and such a good person"" by one classmate, with another telling BBC News: ""She was so beautiful - inside and out. ""She was kind, wouldn't hurt anyone and would do anything to make anyone happy."" The playground where Jodie was found is called Amy's Play Site Acting Det Ch Supt John Ross said: ""Yesterday a 17-year-old girl lost her life, and I want to express my deepest sympathies to [Jodie's] family and friends. ""Her death is a tragedy. I can reassure them and the whole community that we are doing everything possible to identify and bring to justice the person or persons responsible. ""It is days like these that really do highlight how we must continue to work tirelessly with our partners and the public to tackle knife crime."" People visited the area near the crime scene to lay flowers throughout the weekend Flowers were left at the scene, with one message reading ""RIP Angel"" Jodie's family have issued an appeal on social media for witnesses to the attack. Her grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote on Facebook: ""How have we come to this point where kids can't have a walk in a park without suffering an unprovoked attack? ""If anyone knows anything about this please contact the police with information. ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now. This has to stop, there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" Police sealed off the area, known locally as Amy's Park, and conducted forensic searches, but no arrests have yet been made. Forensic officers searched trees near the park on Sunday morning The teenager's death comes less than a week after 20-year-old ChÃ© Morrisonwas stabbed to death outside Ilford train station in east London. While Jodie is the first teenage girl to die in a homicide in the capital this year, she is the 18th person to be killed in London in 2019 and the fifth teenage death. Last year, two 17-year-old girls and one 18-year-old woman were murdered in London. London killings: All the victims of 2018 Can knife crime be stopped before it starts?

Huawei's Meng Wanzhou sues Canada,"Meng Wanzhou's arrest has strained relations between China, and Canada and the US The chief financial officer of China's tech giant Huawei is suing Canada over her arrest at the request of the US. Meng Wanzhou was held in December at Vancouver airport on suspicion of fraud and breaching US sanctions on Iran. On Friday Ms Meng filed a civil claim against Canada's government, border agency and police for ""serious breaches"" of her civil rights. It came on the same day that Canada officially launched Meng Wanzhou's extradition process to the US. Huawei charges: The 100, 400 and 800-word story Should we worry about Huawei? China has attacked Ms Meng's arrest and the extradition process as a ""political incident"". She denies all the charges against her. Ms Meng's claim - filed in British Columbia's Supreme Court on Friday - seeks damages against the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), Canadian Border Services Agency (CBSA) and the federal government for allegedly breaching her civil rights under Canada's Charter of Rights and Freedoms. She says CBSA officers held, searched and questioned her at the airport under false pretences before she was arrested by the RCMP. Ms Meng has a property in Vancouver and is currently out on bail Her detention was ""unlawful"" and ""arbitrary"", the suit says, and officers ""intentionally failed to advise her of the true reasons for her detention, her right to counsel, and her right to silence"". Ms Meng, 47, will next appear in court on Wednesday, when it will be confirmed that Canada has issued a legal writ over her extradition to the US. A date for an extradition hearing will be set. But this is still the early stages. A judge must authorise her committal for extradition and the justice minister would then decide whether to surrender her to the US. There will be chances for appeal and some cases have dragged on for years. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. The US alleges Huawei misled the US and a global bank about its relationship with two subsidiaries, Huawei Device USA and Skycom Tech, to conduct business with Iran. Why Huawei matters in five charts US President Donald Trump's administration has reinstated all sanctions on Iran removed under a 2015 nuclear deal and recently imposed even stricter measures, hitting oil exports, shipping and banks. It also alleges Huawei stole technology from T Mobile used to test smartphone durability, as well as obstructing justice and committing wire fraud. In all, the US has laid 23 charges against the company. Some Western nations are reviewing business with the firm over spying concerns, although Huawei has always maintained it acts independently. This video can not be played Huawei founder Ren Zhengfei on the arrest of his daughter The arrest has seriously strained relations between China, and the US and Canada. Beijing says it is an ""abuse of the bilateral extradition treaty"" between Canada and the US, and has expressed its ""resolute opposition"" and ""strong dissatisfaction"" with the proceedings. China also says the accusations against Huawei, the world's second biggest smartphone maker by volume, are a ""witch-hunt"". Two Canadian citizens are thought to have been detained in China in retaliation for the arrest. China and the US are also engaged in tough trade negotiations to end a major tariff dispute.

Yemen port deal 'could die within weeks',"Forces on both sides are yet to leave Hudaydah A peace deal in Yemen's main port city ""could be dead within weeks"", British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said during a visit to the country. The Yemeni government and the rebel Houthi movement have yet to implement a UN-brokered plan to pull out and redeploy forces around Hudaydah. The port is the principal lifeline for two-thirds of Yemen's population, which is on the brink of famine. Mr Hunt said 80,000 children in the country had already starved to death. More than 20 million people were on the brink of starvation, he added. The UN says at least 6,800 civilians have been killed and 10,700 injured in the fighting. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates lead a coalition that has imposed a partial blockade in Yemen after President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi was forced to flee abroad by the Houthis - a group the Sunni states consider to be a proxy of regional Shia power Iran. Shaky truce in key Yemeni port of Hudaydah Yemen crisis: Why is there a war? The pull-out from Hudaydah is a critical part of a ceasefire agreed in Sweden in December. It was intended to lead to broader talks to end the four-year conflict. The deal also involves the release of thousands of prisoners, which has also not yet taken place. Mr Hunt, the first Western foreign minister to visit the country since the conflict began, said the two sides were now in the ""last chance saloon"". Speaking from the southern port city of Aden, which is under Yemeni government control, he urged them to take the risks necessary to secure peace. Allow Twitter content?

Last month UN officials saidthey had gained access to a vast store of food in Hudaydahfor the first time in six months.

By the end of last month member states had promised $2.6bn (Â£2bn) - a 30% increase on the amount pledged at a similar conference last year, but $1.6bn short of the total the UN hopes to raise. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are the biggest potential donors this year, having pledged $500m each.

US House to begin Trump abuse inquiry,"Mr Nadler, a Democrat, chairs the House judiciary committee A committee of the US House of Representatives is seeking documents alleging obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by President Donald Trump and his aides. Judiciary committee chairman Jerrold Nadler told ABC news that 60 individuals and entities would be receiving requests from Monday. Mr Nadler said he believed Mr Trump had obstructed justice. But any impeachment move would depend on the results of the inquiry. President Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing and accused Democrats of a witch hunt. On Saturday, he launched a furious attack on Special Counsel Robert Mueller, railing against the inquiry he is leading into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia. Mr Mueller is expected to hand in his report to the attorney general shortly. What might 'Mueller report' look like? Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Targeting Mr Mueller repeatedly - as well as firing the former FBI chief over the Russia inquiry - were among the issues Mr Nadler cited as ""clear"" cases of obstruction of justice by President Trump.

But the Democratic congressman said ""we do not have the evidence"" to start an impeachment procedure against the president. ""Impeachment is a long way down the road, we don't have the facts yet, but we're going to initiate proper investigations,"" Mr Nadler told This Week. ""Tomorrow [Monday], we will be issuing document requests to over 60 different people and individuals from the White House to the Department of Justice,"" he said.

IS bride 'should live in Holland' - husband,"This video can not be played Yago Riedijk said he saw nothing wrong in marrying 15-year-old Shamima Begum. The Dutch husband of Shamima Begum, who joined the Islamic State group in Syria in 2015 aged 15, has said he wants her to return to the Netherlands with him. Yago Riedijk and Ms Begum married days after she arrived inside IS territory. Speaking to the BBC, he admitted fighting for the group but says he now wants to return home with his wife and their newborn son. Mr Riedijk, 27, is being held in a Kurdish detention centre in north-eastern Syria. He faces a six-year jail term for joining a terror organisation if he returns to the Netherlands. Who will take IS fighter and his teen bride? Begum family challenge Javid on citizenship How many IS foreign fighters are left? In an interview with the BBC's Middle East correspondent, Quentin Sommerville, Mr Riedijk said he rejected IS and had tried to leave the group. He told our correspondent that he was imprisoned in Raqqa and tortured after the extremists accused him of being a Dutch spy. Describing life under IS control, Mr Riedijk also said he attended the stoning of a woman for ""fornication"", saw piles of dead bodies in the city and lost an infant daughter to malnutrition. By BBC Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville He sits opposite me in a yellow plastic chair, 27 years old now, in a freezing interview room in a Kurdish detention centre. His guards have just removed his handcuffs. If I see Shamima, he asks me to ""tell her that I love her and have patience"". ""Hopefully soon we'll be together again and things will turn out alright, hopefully."" It seems unlikely that will happen anytime soon. Over the next hour, he paints a contradictory picture of an insulated home life, and a maelstrom of terror outside. Read more from Quentinhere. Ms Begum, now aged 19, escaped with her IS fighter husband from the town of Baghuz, the group's last territory in eastern Syria, as the caliphate crumbled. Mr Riedijk surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters, and Ms Begum and their newborn son, Jarrah, ended up among 39,000 people in the al-Hol refugee camp in northern Syria. She has now reportedly gone elsewhere. Mr Riedijk also told the BBC he saw nothing wrong with marrying Ms Begum - 15 at the time, while he was 23 - because it was ""her choice"". Ms Begum pictured on CCTV at Gatwick Airport in February 2015 Describing how he met the schoolgirl from east London in the women's centre in Raqqa, he said he was initially not interested because she was too young. He said: ""To be honest, when my friend came and said there was a girl who was interested in marriage, I wasn't that interested because of her age, but I accepted the offer anyway."" He added that she had seemed to be ""in a good state of mind"". Mr Riedijk, from Arnhem in the Netherlands, insisted: ""It was her own choice. She asked to look for a partner for her, and I was invited."" He conceded ""she was very young, maybe it would have been better for her to wait a bit"", before adding: ""But she didn't, she chose to get married and I chose to marry her."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 alongside Amira Abase, also 15 at the time, and Kadiza Sultana, who was 16. Ms Sultana is believed to have been killed in an air strike in 2016. The UK has revoked Ms Begum's citizenship on the grounds that she is a Bangladeshi national through her mother, who is a Bangladeshi citizen. But Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has disputed this, saying Ms Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizen and that she will not be allowed into the country. And, last month, Ms Begum's family told the home secretary they were going to challenge his decision to revoke her UK citizenship. In the letter,seen by the BBC, Shamima Begum's sister Renu said they could not ""simply abandon her"" and asked for assistance in bringing her newborn baby to the UK. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, said Ms Begumhad a ""right to return to Britain""- and called the decision to revoke her citizenship ""extreme"". What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Inside the chaos left by IS group's fall How do countries deal with IS returnees? Could defeated IS rebound? Although Mr Riedijk is on a terrorism watch list, his Dutch citizenship has not been revoked. However, BBC foreign correspondent Anna Holligan said Ms Begum would struggle to get her underage marriage recognised in the Netherlands, and any application for a residence permit would be jeopardised by the fact that she too was suspected of terrorism crimes. Their newborn son though, might be entitled to Dutch citizenship through his father, she added. Recently, the Dutch justice department has warned of the threat posed by jihadist women returning from abroad. It said even women and children, who were not trained and did not take part in hostilities, could pose a ""long-term potential threat"" because of exposure to IS ideology. Mr Riedijk was born and raised in Dutch suburbia but abandoned his life in 2014 to join IS. He was one of 300 Dutch men and women who travelled to Syria and Iraq, our correspondent said. Of those, some 135 Dutch nationals with ""jihadist intentions"" are still there, according to anti-terrorism officials. It is not known how many want to come back, but last week the Netherlands removed the citizenship of another Dutch jihadist, Outhmane B. The Dutch justice ministry has said those wishing to return will receive no government help. It added, however, that if Mr Riedijk turned himself in at a Dutch embassy or consulate he would be sent back to the Netherlands to serve his six-year prison term.

Run-down towns to get post-Brexit boost,"A Â£1.6bn government fund has been launched to boost less well-off towns in England after Brexit. The pot is split into Â£1bn, divided in England using a needs-based formula, and Â£600m communities can bid for. More than half of the money, to be spread over seven years, will go to the north of England and the Midlands. Labour called it a bribe to influence MPs to back the PM's Brexit deal and critics say it does not cover cuts to local authority funding. The Department of Housing, Communities and Local Government said there will be additional announcements ""in due course"" for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. No Welsh cash in Â£1.6bn post-Brexit fund Council spending cuts, in seven charts 'Worst yet to come' in council cuts Brexit: All you need to know In January, MPs rejected the withdrawal deal Theresa May has reached with the EU by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a sitting government in history. To win another vote, which Mrs May has promised will be on or before 12 March, she could find herself relying on the votes of Labour MPs from Leave-voting parts of the country. John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, a former coal mining area in Nottinghamshire, told the PM last month to ""show us the money"" with ""transformative investment"" in areas that voted to leave. The Labour MP, who backed Mrs May's Brexit deal at the first vote, denied it amounted to ""transactional politics"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy: âObviously, I wouldnât turn down any moneyâ¦ but my vote is not for saleâ But John McDonnell, Labour's shadow chancellor, said the fund ""smacks of desperation from a government reduced to bribing MPs to vote for their damaging flagship Brexit legislation"". The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said the money will be targeted on coastal communities, market towns, and de-industrialised towns, which meets the demands of some Labour MPs, who say regeneration funding tends to go to big cities. The funding will go to specific projects like a new university campus or railway station, our correspondent added. Dismissing the claim that the funding aimed to entice Labour MPs, Housing and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire insisted the cash would be made available even if the withdrawal agreement was rejected and denied the funding was a bribe. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""This funding is there regardless of the outcome, but obviously we want to see a deal happening, we believe that is what is in the best interests of our country."" He said the money would ""supplement the work of councils"" and could be ""transformative"" and was there ""to see that towns grow"". However, Labour MP Alex Sobel, of the cross-party People's Vote campaign, which wants a new referendum on Brexit, said it was ""a drop in the ocean"" compared with the cost of leaving the EU. He said the annual loss to local economies would be more than enough to wipe out any potential return from this scheme. Theresa May, pictured with her husband Philip, has promised MPs another vote on her deal by 12 March Labour's Ruth Smeeth, the MP for Leave-supporting Stoke-on-Trent, described the amount of money as ""extraordinarily pathetic"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Westminster Hour programme, she said: ""If you're talking about national renewal, this is less money than is being taken out of my economy by the introduction of [new welfare system] universal credit over the next four years."" Labour and Stoke-on-Trent Central MP Gareth Snell said the announcement was a ""huge disappointment"", tweeting: ""The entire allocation for the West Midlands over four years is less than the total value of cuts faced by Stoke-on-Trent City Council alone over the same period."" Anna Turley, Labour MP for Redcar, has described the funding as ""a shameless little bung."" She told BBC Radio 5 Live that Â£90m had been lost from her local council over nine years of austerity and the money was ""bobbins"" and was ""shameless and embarrassing"". And Labour's Rhondda MP Chris Bryant tweeted: ""And not a penny for Wales. The trouble with bribes is they embody injustice."" Welsh councils facing real-terms cuts Austerity blamed for children in care rise A really simple guide to all things Brexit But the prime minister insisted: ""Communities across the country voted for Brexit as an expression of their desire to see change - that must be a change for the better, with more opportunity and greater control. ""These towns have a glorious heritage, huge potential and, with the right help, a bright future ahead of them."" She said prosperity had been ""unfairly spread"" for ""too long"". By BBC political correspondent Iain Watson A month ago John Mann - who voted to leave the EU - told the BBC there was a ""good dialogue"" going on with the government. And he was hopeful Mrs May would come back with ""something significant"" for his, and other, areas outside London. He and a group of Labour MPs from Leave areas were demanding the protection of employment rights after Brexit - and assurances poorer areas wouldn't lose out when EU regional funding ended. The cash on offer from the government is equivalent to less than 2% of English local authority spending. Theresa May says she is simply making good a promise she made in her first speech as prime minister to help ""ordinary working class families"". But the Labour leadership see this as a ""bribe"" to tempt some of their own MPs to break ranks and back Mrs May's deal. The former Conservative, now Independent, MP Anna Soubry claims it's an attempt to buy votes. But the government insists the true beneficiaries will be residents of coastal and industrial communities who feel left behind. The Â£1.6bn Stronger Towns Fund will be broken down into Â£600m, which communities in any part of England can bid for, and Â£1bn allocated using a needs-based formula to the following areas: North-west England:Â£281m North-east England:Â£105m Yorkshire and the Humber:Â£197m West Midlands:Â£212m East Midlands:Â£110m South-west England:Â£33m South-east England:Â£37m East England:Â£25m ""The formula allocations are based on a combination of productivity, income, skills, deprivation metrics and proportion of the population living in towns,"" a department spokesperson said. ""This targets funding at those places with economies that are performing relatively less well to the England average."" London is not included in the list, but towns within Greater London can bid for a share of the Â£600m pot, the department spokesperson added. The government said communities would be able to draw up job-boosting plans for their town, with the support and advice of their Local Enterprise Partnerships. It added that it would also seek to ensure towns in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland would benefit from the new funding.

What was life like for the IS couple?,"This video can not be played Yago Riedijk spoke to Quentin Sommerville in a Kurdish detention centre Shamima Begum said she joined the Islamic State group (IS) in search of the perfect family life, and it was in Raqqa, shortly after she arrived in Syria four years ago, that it arranged a marriage between her and Dutch armed extremist Yago Riedijk. She was 15 at the time and he was 23. In the UK, he would be committing a sexual offence. He sits opposite me in a yellow plastic chair, 27 years old now, in a freezing interview room in a Kurdish detention centre. His guards have just removed his handcuffs. If I see Shamima, he asks me to ""tell her that I love her and have patience"". ""Hopefully soon we'll be together again and things will turn out all right - hopefully."" It seems unlikely that will happen anytime soon. Over the next hour, he paints a contradictory picture of an insulated home life, and a maelstrom of terror outside. IS bride 'should live in Holland' - husband Who will take IS fighter and his teenage 'bride'? Begum family challenge Javid on citizenship What is Shamima Begum's legal status? He said he kept the two separate and that his wife, despite her public statements to the contrary, was ignorant of IS's crimes. ""I was keeping her in a protected shell,"" he said. ""I did not give her any information about what was going on outside. The problems that I was facing, the dangers. ""She was just sitting inside taking care of the household while I was trying to get by. ""Feed her, feed myself. Try to keep out of trouble. Try to not getting killed by secret services. ""You know, making decisions that changed our lives, trying to keep us in safety."" IS was driven out of Raqqa, the de facto capital of its ""caliphate"", in October 2017 When I met Ms Begum last week, she said she had joined IS in search of the perfect family life. She told me: ""My family wouldn't help me get married in the UK and the way they showed family life in IS was pretty nice. ""Like the perfect family life, saying they'd take care of you and take care of your family. And that was true. ""They did take care of me and my family at first but things changed after that."" Their caliphate dream unravelled quickly. It was a world of headless corpses and IS prison and torture for Mr Riedijk. When I asked him if he knew of any Yazidis - the religious sect IS enslaved and murdered - he had this to say: ""I heard about one Dutch guy. He had a slave. ""That's about as close as I ever got to a slave. I heard she was about 40 years old."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Ms Begum had said she had seen a human head in a bin; her husband explained it was in a bag on top of a pile of dead IS prisoners wearing military uniforms. And he attended the stoning of a woman accused of ""fornication"". ""I actually never witnessed a beheading,"" he said. ""I've actually witnessed a stoning once. ""And I've watched, I've seen people who have been executed but not the execution itself."" ""Actually, she wasn't stoned to death,"" he corrected. ""She stood up and she ran away. ""And, after that, they said to the guys who were throwing stones: 'Stop throwing stones.' ""It's not allowed to throw the stones after she gets up and runs away. So we stopped throwing stones at her and she escaped. After that they left her alone."" Mr Riedijk's wife claimed that he ""wasn't really a fighter"", but he went to fight for IS in Kobane and was injured. He fought again in Aleppo. He said: ""I made a huge mistake. I've thrown away years of my life. It was not my life. ""Luckily, I didn't directly hurt other people. But me joining and supporting a group like that. It's something that's not acceptable."" He added that he had hardly used his weapon. Now he says he wants to return to the Netherlands, with his wife, and his newborn baby son. ""I would love to go back to my own country,"" he said, ""which I now understand the privileges that I lived with. The privilege of living there as a citizen. ""And, of course, I understand that many people have a problem with what I did and I totally understand that. ""I have to take responsibility for what I did, serve my sentence. But I hope to be able to return to a normal life and to raise a family."" How many IS foreign fighters are left? Could a defeated IS rebound? Tales from inside the chaos left by IS How do countries deal with IS returnees? For now, Ms Begum and Mr Riedijk have neither their passports nor control of their own fate.

Labour 'show us the money' row,"This video can not be played John Mann: This is not transactional politics Labour MPs have been warned by their party not to accept money for their constituencies in return for supporting Theresa May's Brexit deal. Labour chairman Ian Lavery said ""taking such a bribe would be fool's gold"" given the Tories' record on austerity. John Mannhas urged the PM,externalto ""show us the money"" with ""transformative investment"" in areas that voted Leave. But the Labour MP, who backed Theresa May's Brexit deal, denied it amounted to ""transactional politics"". Labour's Brexit tribes Senior Tory 'could accept Brexit delay' Brexit: All you need to know Writing on the Labour List website,external, Mr Lavery, the former general secretary of the National Union of Mineworkers and a close ally of Jeremy Corbyn, accused Mrs May of playing ""divide and rule"" over Brexit. ""If the prime minister wants to talk about ending austerity and protecting rights as we leave the EU, she should do so with the leader of the Labour Party and his team. ""Any Labour MP seriously considering discussions with the PM should remember her record and that of her party going back generations. Quite simply, taking such a bribe would be fool's gold."" The government is understood to be considering proposals from a group of Labour MPs in predominantly Leave-supporting constituencies, to allocate more funds to their communities for big infrastructure projects. It is thought the MPs have urged the prime minister to consider re-allocating the EU's regional aid budget away from big cities and local councils and to give the cash direct to smaller communities, often in former steel and coal mining areas. John Mann, MP for Bassetlaw, a former coal mining area in Nottinghamshire, met cabinet office officials in Whitehall on Thursday and told reporters: ""I want to see, when we leave the European Union, significant investment in new technologies, new jobs, science and industry in areas like mine and all the other areas in the country like mine. ""This isn't transactional politics, this is about getting a national fund ... the areas that voted Leave the most are the areas that have not had that investment."" A couple of weeks ago, a Labour MP confessed quietly that they would vote for Theresa May's Brexit deal in the end. But they wanted something to show for it, suggesting, half-teasingly, that they wanted the PFI debt of their local hospital paid off. That MP was frustrated that the government had taken so long, as they saw it, to try to reach out to get them on board. But they predicted that we would soon see what they described as ""transactional politics"", in a way that we haven't seen before in this country. With Number 10 in a frantic hunt for support, maybe that time has arrived. Read more from Laura It comes as ministers continue to try to win support for the withdrawal deal Theresa May has negotiated with the EU, which was rejected by a historic margin in a Commons vote more than two weeks ago. Mr Mann was one of only three Labour MPs to back the deal. Downing Street says that ministers are looking at a programme of ""national renewal"" following Brexit, to tackle inequality and rebuild communities but has denied any funding amounted to ""cash for votes"". Tottenham MP David Lammy is part of the People's Vote campaign for another referendum Asked if the government was trying to bribe Labour MPs, Chancellor Philip Hammond said: ""No it doesn't work like that I'm afraid. ""What we are doing is looking at some of the drivers behind the Brexit vote. ""What was it that felt that made so many communities feel that they didn't have a stake in the way our economy was operating? ""And making sure we are investing in, for example, former coalfield communities to ensure they can keep up with the changes that are happening across the economy and that they too can share in our future prosperity."" But David Lammy, Labour MP for Tottenham, in north London,tweeted his response,externalto headlines suggesting the PM was preparing to ""woo Labour MPs with cash to back Brexit"" saying: ""Cowards and facilitators. History will be brutal."" And his colleague Chuka Umunna, who like Mr Lammy campaigns for another EU referendum, said on Twitter: ""Government by bung is WRONG - whether involving DUP MPs or those from any other party. ""Funding should be based on the needs of the people not on the needs of an incompetent Tory PM to secure the votes of MPs for a deal which will make the UK poorer."" Allow Twitter content?

He isn't going to get any money and they are well provided for by the amount of rates they get in most areas and the wealth the business community brings to London."" The veteran MP for Birkenhead, on Merseyside, who backs Brexit, told BBC Newsnight Labour MPs representing Leave constituencies ""should be fighting me to get to the front of the queue to get those funds"". He added: ""That's how politics operates. The Tory party in government is very good at shoving money their way to their constituencies. I wish Labour were as effective."" But Anna Turley, MP for Redcar, a Teesside coastal town, which voted to leave the EU, told the same programme she found the idea ""appalling"". ""We have had nearly a decade now of austerity that has seen constituencies like mine absolutely hammered, Â£6bn has come out of public spending in the North by this government and if [there is] a programme or national renewal, I'm afraid it's too little too late.""

Who will take the IS couple?,"This suspected IS fighter left Baghouz this week; Riedijk and Shamima Begum left earlier Yago Riedijk was born and raised in well-to-do Dutch suburbia but abandoned it all in his early twenties for so-called Islamic State (IS). Old pictures show a smiling teenager perched behind a child on a motorbike. A smattering of hairs on his chin suggests he is cultivating a beard. He left the Netherlands in 2014. If he returns, he faces a six-year jail term for joining a terrorist organisation. You may be familiar with his jihadi bride, Shamima Begum from east London who is believed to have ""married"" him 10 days after she arrived inside IS territory aged 15. They now face an uncertain fate. Thousands of displaced people are in the al-Hol camp in north-eastern Syria Riedijk was one of 300 Dutch men and women who travelled to Syria and Iraq. Some 135 Dutch nationals with ""jihadist intentions"" are still there, anti-terrorism officials say. It is not known how many want to come back, and it is not clear if they can. Authorities across Europe are alive to the threat of returning jihadists: The Netherlands this week removed the citizenship of Riedijk's fellow Dutch jihadist, Outhmane B Thirteen French citizens accused of fighting for IS are facing trial in Iraq rather than in France itself, and the French government will not intervene Belgium has won an appeal which means it cannot be forced to repatriate two Belgian women convicted of being Islamic State militants from Syria along with their children The UK has revoked Shamima Begum's citizenship As IS began to crumble, he and Shamima Begum escaped the town of Baghouz to protect their unborn child. Riedijk, now 27, is held in north-eastern Syria while she was in the sprawling al-Hol refugee camp - temporary home to 39,000 people, mostly women and children - but has now reportedly gone elsewhere. This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" When the UK revoked her citizenship, she raised the prospect of applying for Dutch nationality through her ""husband"". Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? Why countries face a dilemma over IS children How many IS foreign fighters are left? Begum family launch challenge on citizenship move Although Riedijk is on a terrorism watch list, his citizenship has not been revoked. If he made it to a Dutch embassy or consulate, in theory he would be allowed to return home. Shamima Begum will struggle to get her underage union recognised in the Netherlands, but their newborn son, Jarrah, may be entitled to Dutch citizenship. There are as many as 170 children in Syria who could lay claim to Dutch nationality. A map showing the verified origin countries of children who travelled to Iraq or Syria Only this week the Dutch justice department warned of the threat posed by jihadist women,externalreturning from abroad, as well as by boys older than nine years old. Even women and children who were not trained and did not take part in hostilities could pose a ""long-term potential threat"" because of exposure to IS ideology, it said. Jimmy's cafe nestles on a neat shopping precinct close to where Riedijk grew up, in the eastern city of Arnhem. Jimmy, softly spoken, gestures to the table where Riedijk and his friends used to gather. Two men in their twenties talk candidly of friends seduced and conscripted by a brutal death cult. Frustrated their city has been christened the Netherlands' ""jihadist capital"", they blame Dutch society for failing to stop ""good kids"" from being groomed. ""They were kick-boxing, deejaying, but then they stopped seeing opportunity here in the Netherlands,"" says one. ""Guys started coming to our mosque, preaching, and the boys started to break away, become more extreme in their thinking, they were meeting in apartments and then we hear they've gone."" Dutch grapple with jihadist threat Their experience tallies with the findings of a study that pinpoints a period in 2013 when radicalisation in Arnhem reached its peak. Recruits often suffer from low self-esteem and are searching for a stronger identity, says Barbara Klunder, who has represented a number of young Dutch jihadist suspects. ""It's not so much religious, but more a feeling of belonging and being fully accepted by their own people fighting the same enemy."" The spotlight returned to Riedijk's hometown last autumn, when seven men were arrested at a holiday park in the southern town of Weert. Leaked photos appear to show them kissing Kalashnikov rifles, posing in bomb vests, and preparing to carry out a terror attack at a rock festival in Arnhem with the aim of ""creating as many casualties as possible"", in the words of the Dutch prosecutor. A police image shows a raid on the suspected ""Arnhem terror cell"" Six men between 21 and 35 who either came from Arnhem or lived there remain in custody awaiting trial. Bomb materials seized after Dutch arrests Another element in the Arnhem terror cell case is Riedijk himself, as he is suspected of being linked to the group. With a jail sentence awaiting him, it is unclear whether he will come back. His parents have declined to comment. Patrick, a childhood friend, describes him as ""one of the quiet people in class"". Shocked by his departure, he believes Riedijk should be brought home and locked up for life. Dutch justice officials will be taking no chances. What other EU member states decide to do regarding repatriation is up to them, but that does not mean the Netherlands has to follow, says the national co-ordinator for security and counter-terrorism. Arnhem Mayor Ahmed Marcouch believes Riedijk should be brought home to face justice. ""We will continue to guide him and keep an eye on him,"" he told a local paper. But he does not want Shamima Begum to come. ""You cannot be eligible for a residence permit when you have committed terrorist crimes.""

Where now for Shamima Begum?,"This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" I saw her approach through the crowded camp and recognised her from her shoes. They peeked out from underneath her black abaya; like a child's trainers they were red, blue and gold but almost in pieces. I'd spotted them when we first met two days earlier. Shamima Begum took off her veil, and carefully sat down in the director's office, in the al-Hol internment camp in north-eastern Syria. A tiny squeal came from under the stained, black dress. Her three-day-old son Jarrah was cradled underneath. There had been an international search for her when, at 15 years old, she disappeared four years ago, along with two school friends from the Bethnal Green Academy in east London. She'd left to join the Islamic State group (IS). And now the world wanted her to disappear again. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Why countries face a dilemma over IS children When asked, she professed ignorance of the jihadist group's worst crimes - the enslavement of the Yazidi people and the rest of the appalling crimes they committed in Iraq and Syria. But she also justified some - claiming, in a twisted logic - that the bombing of the Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena in 2017, which killed 22 people, many of them children, was no worse than Western air strikes here in Syria. The fact that one followed the other didn't seem to figure in her thinking. Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 On our second meeting, the public anger about her crime and her request to now come back to Britain, had sunk in. She was more apologetic. But by then it was too late. The UK home secretary had stripped her of her citizenship. There are already more than a dozen British women and children in camps here, but none have captured public attention like her. As a reporter I've interviewed many IS fighters, including the men accused of beheading the American journalist, James Foley, and British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines. Could a defeated IS rebound? How many IS foreign fighters are left? There was outrage, but not on anything like the same scale as that directed at Shamima Begum. She isn't accused of murder, but her betrayal of Britain by committing the crime of joining a ""proscribed terror group"" stings deeply. And there was anger, too, that we were giving her airtime, even though she was strongly challenged on her outrageous answers - including an attempt to justify the institutionalised rape of Yazidi women. Her lack of contrition - though she did express regret - was particularly galling. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK British citizens played an outsized role in the IS group. Other European countries contributed more fighters but they didn't have Jihadi John. Mohammed Emwazzi, to give him his real name, horrified us, revelling in his murders and goading the West to come get him. He was killed eventually in a drone strike in Raqqa. Shamima Begum liked those videos. Those horror films, and others promising an Islamic religious paradise, drew her to IS. How could she leave Britain - leave us - for that? ""I wanted to get married and my parents wouldn't let me,"" she responded. If the public was ill-prepared for the 19-year-old's reappearance, then so too was the British government. Until she's 21 she has the right to Bangladeshi citizenship. That was enough space - ""a very limited loophole"" as one diplomat described it to me - for her to be declared no longer British; no longer Britain's problem. As I sit here in Deir al-Zour province in south-eastern Syria, the caliphate she joined willingly is dying. Thirty trucks just left the tiny strip of land they hold in the tiny village of Baghuz, full of IS supporters and others. Earlier in the week, more than 2,000 people were evacuated from the area. They haven't been processed yet, but intelligence suggests that British women will be among them. British fighters too are still inside - will they die in the last battle or will they surrender? And if they survive, will there be more ""very limited loopholes"" to stop them from returning to Britain too? Russia, Kazakhstan and the United States have taken back women from areas under IS control. European countries have not. Iraq and Tunisia have taken back IS fighters; Britain, like many others, has not. IS bride 'is not Bangladeshi citizen' 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' There are risks in letting these people become someone else's problem. The Syrian Kurds holding them say there should be international tribunals here in Syria. After all, it's where they did the most harm. But with US forces leaving, will the detained suspects and their family members be secure? And there is the risk that in Syria's ever-changing alliances, the Kurds could hand them over to the regime. Let's not forget that President Bashar al-Assad was once happy to funnel foreign and local extremists into Iraq to attack Western forces there. He can't be trusted with Western prisoners.

At the end of our second interview, she slowly rose from the chair and, replacing her veil, left to feed her child. ""I don't know where I'll end up,"" she said. I watched the black figure with tattered shoes disappear into the teeming camp. Many others have followed in her footsteps from Britain, to Syria, and the Islamic State group.

"IS bride 'should live in Holland' - husbandThe husband of Shamima Begum, who travelled to Syria aged 15, wants her to return to Holland with him.UK","This video can not be played Yago Riedijk said he saw nothing wrong in marrying 15-year-old Shamima Begum. The Dutch husband of Shamima Begum, who joined the Islamic State group in Syria in 2015 aged 15, has said he wants her to return to the Netherlands with him. Yago Riedijk and Ms Begum married days after she arrived inside IS territory. Speaking to the BBC, he admitted fighting for the group but says he now wants to return home with his wife and their newborn son. Mr Riedijk, 27, is being held in a Kurdish detention centre in north-eastern Syria. He faces a six-year jail term for joining a terror organisation if he returns to the Netherlands. Who will take IS fighter and his teen bride? Begum family challenge Javid on citizenship How many IS foreign fighters are left? In an interview with the BBC's Middle East correspondent, Quentin Sommerville, Mr Riedijk said he rejected IS and had tried to leave the group. He told our correspondent that he was imprisoned in Raqqa and tortured after the extremists accused him of being a Dutch spy. Describing life under IS control, Mr Riedijk also said he attended the stoning of a woman for ""fornication"", saw piles of dead bodies in the city and lost an infant daughter to malnutrition. By BBC Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville He sits opposite me in a yellow plastic chair, 27 years old now, in a freezing interview room in a Kurdish detention centre. His guards have just removed his handcuffs. If I see Shamima, he asks me to ""tell her that I love her and have patience"". ""Hopefully soon we'll be together again and things will turn out alright, hopefully."" It seems unlikely that will happen anytime soon. Over the next hour, he paints a contradictory picture of an insulated home life, and a maelstrom of terror outside. Read more from Quentinhere. Ms Begum, now aged 19, escaped with her IS fighter husband from the town of Baghuz, the group's last territory in eastern Syria, as the caliphate crumbled. Mr Riedijk surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters, and Ms Begum and their newborn son, Jarrah, ended up among 39,000 people in the al-Hol refugee camp in northern Syria. She has now reportedly gone elsewhere. Mr Riedijk also told the BBC he saw nothing wrong with marrying Ms Begum - 15 at the time, while he was 23 - because it was ""her choice"". Ms Begum pictured on CCTV at Gatwick Airport in February 2015 Describing how he met the schoolgirl from east London in the women's centre in Raqqa, he said he was initially not interested because she was too young. He said: ""To be honest, when my friend came and said there was a girl who was interested in marriage, I wasn't that interested because of her age, but I accepted the offer anyway."" He added that she had seemed to be ""in a good state of mind"". Mr Riedijk, from Arnhem in the Netherlands, insisted: ""It was her own choice. She asked to look for a partner for her, and I was invited."" He conceded ""she was very young, maybe it would have been better for her to wait a bit"", before adding: ""But she didn't, she chose to get married and I chose to marry her."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Ms Begum left the UK in February 2015 alongside Amira Abase, also 15 at the time, and Kadiza Sultana, who was 16. Ms Sultana is believed to have been killed in an air strike in 2016. The UK has revoked Ms Begum's citizenship on the grounds that she is a Bangladeshi national through her mother, who is a Bangladeshi citizen. But Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has disputed this, saying Ms Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizen and that she will not be allowed into the country. And, last month, Ms Begum's family told the home secretary they were going to challenge his decision to revoke her UK citizenship. In the letter,seen by the BBC, Shamima Begum's sister Renu said they could not ""simply abandon her"" and asked for assistance in bringing her newborn baby to the UK. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, meanwhile, said Ms Begumhad a ""right to return to Britain""- and called the decision to revoke her citizenship ""extreme"". What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Inside the chaos left by IS group's fall How do countries deal with IS returnees? Could defeated IS rebound? Although Mr Riedijk is on a terrorism watch list, his Dutch citizenship has not been revoked. However, BBC foreign correspondent Anna Holligan said Ms Begum would struggle to get her underage marriage recognised in the Netherlands, and any application for a residence permit would be jeopardised by the fact that she too was suspected of terrorism crimes. Their newborn son though, might be entitled to Dutch citizenship through his father, she added. Recently, the Dutch justice department has warned of the threat posed by jihadist women returning from abroad. It said even women and children, who were not trained and did not take part in hostilities, could pose a ""long-term potential threat"" because of exposure to IS ideology. Mr Riedijk was born and raised in Dutch suburbia but abandoned his life in 2014 to join IS. He was one of 300 Dutch men and women who travelled to Syria and Iraq, our correspondent said. Of those, some 135 Dutch nationals with ""jihadist intentions"" are still there, according to anti-terrorism officials. It is not known how many want to come back, but last week the Netherlands removed the citizenship of another Dutch jihadist, Outhmane B. The Dutch justice ministry has said those wishing to return will receive no government help. It added, however, that if Mr Riedijk turned himself in at a Dutch embassy or consulate he would be sent back to the Netherlands to serve his six-year prison term.

Algeria's president defies protesters,"This video can not be played Police face students opposing the president's plan to run again Algeria's veteran President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has defied protesters by confirming he will run again - but says he will not serve a full term. In a letter he said if he won April's vote he would oversee a national dialogue leading to fresh elections that he would not contest. His decision to seek a fifth term in office sparked nationwide protests. Mr Bouteflika, 82, has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013. Sunday saw new protests as a midnight deadline loomed for candidates to register. By nightfall young people were again marching in the capital Algiers despite the president's offer. Algeria protests: The beginning of the end? Mr Bouteflika's campaign manager submitted papers on behalf of the ailing president, who is undergoing medical treatment in Switzerland. The electoral commission has said candidates need to submit them in person, but the Constitutional Council ruled that he did not have to be physically present. The proposal came in the form of a letter to the Algerian people read out on state television. Should he be re-elected. Mr Bouteflika said he would hold an ""inclusive national conference"" followed by a vote to determine the next president. He said he would not run again and acknowledged the protests that have rocked Algeria. President Bouteflika has been rarely seen in public - here he was voting in May 2017 ""I listened and heard the heartfelt cry of protesters and in particular of the thousands of youth who asked me about the future of our country,"" the letter said, read by a presenter on ENTV. ""These youth express an understandable concern about the uncertainties they face. I have the duty and will to appease the hearts and spirits of my compatriots."" So far, six other candidates have formally registered, among them a retired general, Ali Ghediri, who has promised to bring ""change"" to Algeria. Businessman Rachid Nekkaz, who has a sizeable Facebook following and is said to be popular among Algeria's young, announced plans to run, but was deemed ineligible. Instead his cousin, a car mechanic who is also called Rachid Nekkaz has entered and the businessman says he will serve as his campaign manager. Two opposition parties, the Labour Party, and the Islamist Movement of Society for Peace, have said they will boycott the election. A key challenger in previous elections, Ali Benflis, also is not running. Yes - public shows of dissent in Algeria are rare, and the protests have been the biggest since Mr Bouteflika came to power 20 years ago. Demonstrations broke out about 10 days ago after Mr Bouteflika announced his plans to run for office again. Anti-riot police have been deployed in Algiers Young people have been at the forefront of the protests in Algeria On Sunday, people again took to the streets of the capital Algiers and other major cities. Police reportedly used water cannon to disperse students rallying in Algiers. There have also been demonstrations in France, the former colonial power, which is home to a large Algerian community. ""We aren't opposed to the president, but he is unconscious, he doesn't exist anymore, his generals and those close to him are doing what they will behind his back,"" one demonstrator told the AFP news agency. Mr Bouteflika came to power in 1999 and is credited with putting an end to a civil war that is estimated to have killed more than 100,000 people. Protests against food prices and unemployment broke out in 2011 during the Arab Spring but he responded by lifting a nearly two-decades old state of emergency, meeting a key demand of protesters. After his stroke he won re-election in a poll denounced by the opposition and dissolved the country's powerful spy agency, replacing it with a body loyal to him. Critics say his ill health means that he is unable to perform his duties as president. Despite the dissent, Mr Bouteflika is still widely tipped to win the election this year. Algeria's opposition is divided and Mr Bouteflika won the last presidential elections in 2014 despite doing no personal campaigning.

First UK transgender prison unit to open,"The UK's first prison unit for transgender inmates will open this week, the Ministry of Justice has said. The wing, within a women's prison in south London, will initially cater for three offenders. Officials say the three prisoners, who have Gender Recognition Certificates, will not have access to the other women at HMP Downview, in Sutton. The Ministry of Justice said prisoner safety was ""our biggest concern"". The move comes after the case of Karen White, a transgender prisoner, who sexually assaulted two women while on remand at New Hall jail in Wakefield. Karen White was born Stephen Wood White, who was born male and now identifies as a woman, was described by a judge as a ""predator"" who was a danger to women and children. She was given a life sentence for sexual offences. A Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: ""Prisoner safety is our biggest concern and any decisions we take will seek to best manage the risks posed by each offender. ""The wider management of transgender offenders is a highly sensitive issue which poses unique and complex challenges and we are determined to get it right. ""That's why we are reviewing the way we manage all transgender offenders."" They added that the work was ongoing. By BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The creation of a special unit for transgender inmates is the latest development in a sensitive, controversial and fast-moving area of prison policy. It is only 16 months since the Ministry of Justice reviewed its procedures and drew up new guidelines to ensure the ""great majority"" of transgender offenders ""experience the system in the gender in which they identify"". However, the department was clearly shaken by the case of Karen White - the court which dealt with her case heard she'd used her ""transgender persona"" to put herself in contact with vulnerable women prisoners. And, in February, ministers said they were carrying out another review of the guidelines they had only recently announced. The Downview unit, it seems, is one of the outcomes of this latest review - an attempt to strike the correct balance between the rights of transgender inmates and the safety of other prisoners. The number of transgender inmates in the prison system is hard to calculate and constantly changing. But last Augustthe BBC's Reality Check team saidfigures showed there were 17 in Scotland and 125 in England and Wales. No figures were given for Northern Ireland. HMP Downview has been a women's prison since 2001. It closed for three years for refurbishment, reopening in 2016 with capacity for 355 inmates, and is currently building up its population.

Begum family challenge Javid,"This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" The family of Shamima Begum - who left the UK to join the Islamic State group in Syria - have told the home secretary they are going to challenge his decision to revoke her UK citizenship. In the letter to Sajid Javid,seen by the BBC, they say they ""cannot simply abandon her"". They also asked for assistance in bringing her newborn baby to the UK. Mr Javid said he has not read the letter yet but will be ""looking closely at it"". He added: ""Sadly, foreign fighters that have left our country to go and join a terrorist organisation, many of them will have taken children or had children there. ""Obviously all these children are perfectly innocent."" Ms Begum, who left Bethnal Green, east London in 2015, is living in a refugee camp in northern Syria and gave birth to a son last weekend. In an interview with the BBC on Monday, she said she did not regret travelling to Syria, though she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She told the BBC she was ""shocked"" by the 2017 Manchester Arena attack - which killed 22 people and was claimed by IS - but she also compared it to military assaults on IS strongholds by coalition forces, saying it was ""retaliation"". Begum family's letter in full Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? Begum has 'right to return' to UK - Corbyn The letter, written by her sister Renu Begum on behalf of the family, says: ""We wish to make clear, that along with the rest of the country, we are shocked and appalled at the vile comments she has made to the media in recent days. ""These are not representative of British values, and my family entirely reject the comments she has made."" Renu Begum says the family made ""every fathomable effort"" to stop Shamima Begum from getting into Islamic State territory in 2015. ""That year we lost Shamima to a murderous and misogynistic cult. ""My sister has been in their thrall now for four years, and it is clear to me that her exploitation at their hands has fundamentally damaged her."" By home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 The letter from Renu Begum shows that Shamima Begum's family - who have stayed out of the spotlight for most of the week - are now prepared to take on the home secretary in the courts, and in the media. She is careful to stress how shocked they were by Shamima Begum's comments. But she is also equally vehement about how they cannot abandon her sister and how they ""must""  - to use their words - challenge his decision. The appeal for help in bringing Shamima Begum's baby son back to the UK will be one of the hardest parts of the letter politically for the Home Secretary Sajid Javid. He said in the House of Commons that the children of IS members would not lose their British citizenship. Renu Begum points out that Jarrar - who is not yet a week old - is the ""one true innocent"" in what they call the ""debacle"". In the letter, Renu Begum says none of the family has had any contact with Shamima, but they have watched her on television ""set fire to our nation's emotions"". She says they were ""sickened"" by Shamima's comments but hope Mr Javid understands that her family ""cannot simply abandon her"". The letter says: ""We have a duty to her, and a duty to hope that as she was groomed into what she has become, she can equally be helped back into the sister I knew, and daughter my parents bore. ""We hope you understand our position in this respect and why we must, therefore, assist Shamima in challenging your decision to take away the one thing that is her only hope at rehabilitation, her British citizenship."" The Home Office has said it is possible to strip the teenager of British nationality on the grounds that she is eligible for citizenship of another country - Bangladesh, through her mother, who is a Bangladeshi citizen. I have one citizenship, says IS bride What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Why countries face a dilemma over IS children However, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has saidMs Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizenand there was ""no question"" of her being allowed into the country. This video can not be played Geoffrey Robertson QC, one of the UK's most senior international lawyers says Shamima Begum should be put on trial in Britain The home secretary said he would not leave an individual stateless, which is illegal under international law. Mr Javid also suggested Ms Begum's child could still be British, despite the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Javid's decision was ""extreme""and she had ""a right to return to Britain"". Geoffrey Robertson QC, a former United Nations judge, said it should be up to the UK courts to determine what punishment she should receive for joining a terrorist organisation. He told the BBC: ""It's surely for a judge to decide whether she deserves mercy or sympathy, not for a politician."" Begum has 'right to return' to UK - Corbyn What is Shamima Begum's legal status?

Woman arrested over death of baby girl,"A woman has been charged with the murder of a three-month-old baby girl in south London.

Blair praises 'courageous' Independents,"Tony Blair says he is staying in the Labour Party despite having a ""great deal of sympathy"" with breakaway MPs. The former Labour leader said he had not spoken to the MPs before they quit the party but he had been in touch with ""some of them"" since. ""Hard-left"" Labour and a ""hard Brexit"" Tory party had created a ""vast"" new space, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. Eight MPs quit Labour and joined forces with three former Tories to form a new Independent Group in Parliament. The eight are all longstanding critics of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn. They all support the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum - and have been highly critical of Labour's response to anti-Semitism allegations. Umunna made Independent Group spokesman Blair: I'm not the man to lead new party They have not yet formed a new party and have no plans at this stage to fight elections, but they say they want to provide an alternative to the ""broken"" two party system. Mr Blair said: ""I've got a great deal of sympathy with what they're doing and what they're saying."" But he added: ""I'm staying in the Labour Party. I've been in the Labour Party for over 40 years, I led it for 13 years, I was the longest-serving Labour prime minister, I'm deeply attached to the Labour Party. ""But do I sympathise with what they have done? Yes, I do. I think they're courageous in having done it."" He said the move showed there was ""a limit to the self-indulgence"" of the two main parties, as they moved further to the left and right, respectively, leaving millions of voters politically ""homeless"". And he warned: ""You are going to have a situation in which the two main parties break up."" Mr Blair's name has been linked to the formation of a new centre ground party for some time, but he has never publicly confirmed it. He said he believed Labour's Deputy Leader Tom Watson had ""shown really great leadership"" in recent weeks by setting up a forum for centrist Labour MPs. Lord Falconer: I am completely committed to Labour ""He's actually encouraging them, in a sense, to stay because he's providing a space within which people can debate and argue,"" said Mr Blair. Earlier, shadow chancellor John McDonnell pointed to different groups which already exist within Labour. He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday: ""Tom is bringing other people together, he has a perfect right to do that, that's fair enough. ""We need as much policy debate as we possibly can and I welcome that."" Lord Falconer, a close ally of Mr Blair during his years in government, has also ruled out joining the new Independent Group, but he said some colleagues in the House of Lords were clearly ""toying"" with quitting the party. ""I am completely committed to Labour. I am too old to leave,"" the former Lord Chancellor told BBC Radio 5 Live's Pienaar's Politics. But he added: ""There's a lot of anxiety in the Lords about the leadership of the Labour Party and there are a lot of people, I suspect, toying with whether they're staying or not."" The former justice secretary is leading a review into cases of anti-Semitism in the Labour Party. The Independent Group of MPs appointed former Labour MP Chuka Umunna as its spokesman on Friday, and announced who would be speaking in different policy areas.

Thousands raised for missing climbersBriton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardi went missing a week ago on on a peak in Pakistan.Derby,"Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi before their last contact with their team About 110,000 euros (Â£95,000) has been raised to continue the search for two climbers who went missing on a peak in Pakistan seven days ago. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardilast made contact from Nanga Parbat on 24 February. Tensions between Pakistan and Indiaand poor flying weather have delayed rescue attempts. The cash will keep funding a helicopter team, which is said to cost about 50,000 euros (Â£43,000) a day. Mr Ballard, 30, originally from Belper, Derbyshire, is the son of Alison Hargreaves, who died descending from the summit of K2 in 1995 -  the same year she becamethe first woman to conquer Everest unaided,external. Tom Ballard's mother Alison Hargreaves on her descent from the top of Mount Everest, which she reached in 1995 A search for Mr Ballard, who moved to Scotland in 1995, and Mr Nardi began on Thursday after delays due to airspace restrictions. A three-person tent ""invaded by snow"" was spotted on the same day. Stefano Pontecorvo, the Italian ambassador in Pakistan, tweeted on Sunday that the search had been postponed again due to snow on the mountain. Allow Twitter content?

Rescue attempts have been frustrated, largely due to the weather, which has meant the helicopter and high-altitude drones cannot fly. Friends have raised 108,930 euros (Â£93,819) which will go towards the daily cost of the rescue. Tom Ballard's sponsor Montane said it was not giving up hope By BBC World Affairs reporter Richard Galpin Nanga Parbat - also known as the killer mountain - is regarded as one of the toughest of all the world's highest peaks, and climbing it in winter presents an even greater challenge. With temperatures as low as -40C, strong winds and the danger of avalanches, the risks are particularly high. But both Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi are very accomplished mountaineers, and there is still some lingering hope they could be found alive. A Spanish climber, Alex Txikon, who had been attempting a winter ascent of K2, has several high-altitude drones with him. He has been flown by the Pakistan military to the nearest town to Nanga Parbat base camp. But the helicopter could not continue its journey because of bad weather, and that means yet another delay in the search for the climbers.

Jodie's classmates came to the crime scene to pay their respects Jodie was described as a ""bundle of joy and such a good person"" by one classmate, with another telling BBC News: ""She was so beautiful - inside and out. ""She was kind, wouldn't hurt anyone and would do anything to make anyone happy."" A playground in the park has been the focus of forensic investigations The playground where Jodie was found is called Amy's Play Site He added: ""She put her in the recovery position and waited for the ambulance to turn up. I think she tried to resuscitate her. ""She is dealing with it better than she was last night. She was shocked with the amount of blood there was. ""Normally you do not see anything like this in the park. ""Hopefully they will get someone for it. This just should not happen."" People visited the area near the crime scene to lay flowers throughout the weekend Flowers were left at the scene, with one message reading ""RIP Angel"" The park is not an area ""where you frequently see violence"", a councillor for the area said Jodie's family have issued an appeal on social media for witnesses to the attack. Her grandmother, Debbie Chesney, wrote: ""How have we come to this point where kids can't have a walk in a park without suffering an unprovoked attack? ""If anyone knows anything about this please contact the police with information. ""We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now. This has to stop, there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence.""

US House to begin Trump abuse inquiryA committee seeks documents on alleged obstruction of justice and abuse of power by the president.US & Canada,"Mr Nadler, a Democrat, chairs the House judiciary committee A committee of the US House of Representatives is seeking documents alleging obstruction of justice, corruption and abuse of power by President Donald Trump and his aides. Judiciary committee chairman Jerrold Nadler told ABC news that 60 individuals and entities would be receiving requests from Monday. Mr Nadler said he believed Mr Trump had obstructed justice. But any impeachment move would depend on the results of the inquiry. President Trump has consistently denied any wrongdoing and accused Democrats of a witch hunt. On Saturday, he launched a furious attack on Special Counsel Robert Mueller, railing against the inquiry he is leading into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia. Mr Mueller is expected to hand in his report to the attorney general shortly. What might 'Mueller report' look like? Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Targeting Mr Mueller repeatedly - as well as firing the former FBI chief over the Russia inquiry - were among the issues Mr Nadler cited as ""clear"" cases of obstruction of justice by President Trump.

""Impeachment is a long way down the road, we don't have the facts yet, but we're going to initiate proper investigations,"" Mr Nadler told This Week. ""Tomorrow [Monday], we will be issuing document requests to over 60 different people and individuals from the White House to the Department of Justice,"" he said.

Russia Novichok link made using GooglePolice said they realised the seriousness of the case when they found Sergei Skripal online.Wiltshire,"Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived the attack in Salisbury last March The first police on the scene of the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal realised the seriousness of the case after Googling his name. Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targeted with the nerve agent Novichok on 4 March 2018 in Salisbury. Sgt Tracey Holloway said after finding his name online they realised ""it could be something bigger"". A church service, ahead of the first anniversary of the attack, has taken place. St Thomas's Church, in the city, remembered the victims and offered thanks to the community. Mr Skripal's house and 11 other potentially infected sites were ruled safe on Friday. The operation included taking thousands of test samples from across Salisbury and nearby Amesbury, where Dawn Sturgess, 44, was fatally poisoned in July. Britain has accused Russia of carrying out the poisoning of the Skripals. Russia has also been blamed for the death of Ms Sturgess and the poisoning of Mr Rowley, who are believed to have come into contact with a bottle of Novichok discarded by the Skripals' attackers. Salisbury declared free of Novichok 'Novichok' litter pick ban 'should end' Russian flag flown on Salisbury Cathedral Dawn Sturgess and partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in Amesbury Det Sgt Nick Bailey was contaminated at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March Sgt Holloway said they knew ""relatively early that they were both going to intensive care"". But police had initially thought the Skripals' collapse had been caused by a drugs overdose. ""The paramedics said they weren't sure what it was and we didn't know what they were suffering with,"" she said. ""They weren't dressed in the way I would expect a drug user to be, so I wasn't really sure what we had."" Police first at the scene - including Sgt Tracey Holloway - found Mr Skripal's name online Military personnel have spent 13,000 hours on the clean-up following the nerve agent poisoning in March 2018 When the officers went back to the station they made the link to Russia - and the possibility of a much bigger case - as they found Mr Skripal's name online. ""It was actually another CID officer who had Googled his name and then said, 'Tracey, do you want to come and have a look at this?' ""It was at that point that we got the link to the Russians side of things. And at that point we thought this could be something bigger than what we believed could be a drugs overdose."" Sergei and Yulia Skripal survived the attack following treatment at Salisbury District Hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who searched their house following the poisoning, returned to work last year and is preparing to run a marathon to raise money for the hospital. Meanwhile Ms Sturgess's son has urged Vladimir Putin to hand over the men suspected of being responsible for his mother's death. Ewan Hope has appealed directly to the Russian president ""as a human being"" to allow British investigators to speak to the suspects. His mother's partner, Charlie Rowley, said he wanted ""someone to pay for what they've done"". In an open letter to Mr Putinpublished by the Sunday Mirror,external, Mr Hope said: ""The British police believe at least two Russian citizens were responsible for her death but it appears they are being protected by your state. ""I am appealing to you as a human being to allow our officers to question these men about my mother's murder. The least she deserves is justice.""

NHS patients to be offered free tampons,"Women and girls in hospital who need sanitary protection will be offered free tampons and other products from this summer, NHS England has said. It follows a British Medical Association campaign pointing out many hospitals supply razors and shaving foam to men, but no sanitary products. NHS England said it was ""absolutely right"" that women had access to daily essentials while in hospital. The charity Freedom4Girls said tampons must be ""readily available everywhere"". In February,the BMA saidtwo in every five UK hospital trusts and health boards did not give sanitary products to patients who needed them, or only in emergencies. And at 27 trusts, there was nowhere to buy sanitary products anywhere on site. Free sanitary products scheme extended in Scotland Watch: Free sanitary products 'boost school attendance' Watch: Is there period poverty in the UK? NHS England's Chief Executive Simon Stevens said on Sunday: ""It's fundamental that we give patients the best experience possible during what can be a stressful time of their life, and by providing sanitary products the NHS can prevent unnecessary embarrassment and leave people to focus on their recovery."" While some hospitals already provide sanitary products, NHS England said it would now be mandated in the new standard contract with hospitals for 2019-20. Dame Parveen Kumar, chair of the BMA's board of science, welcomed the move which she said would come as a relief for many patients. She said BMA research had shown how ""patchy or non-existent"" the provision was, as well as the ""relatively small cost"" of providing tampons and sanitary pads free of charge. Tina Leslie from the charity Freedom4Girls, which campaigns against period poverty, said it was a ""fantastic step forward"". But she added: ""They need to be readily available everywhere where people who menstruate can actually get hold of them, whether they're either caught short or whether they can't afford them. ""Period poverty is really widespread in the UK as well as the rest of the world."" The BMA is pressing for the move to apply to hospitals across the whole of the UK, although progress outside of England is already under way. In Scotland, free sanitary products are available in schools, colleges and universities, and a pilot to provide free products to low income households in Aberdeen is being rolled out.

Thousands raised for missing climbers,"Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi before their last contact with their team About 110,000 euros (Â£95,000) has been raised to continue the search for two climbers who went missing on a peak in Pakistan seven days ago. Briton Tom Ballard and Italian Daniele Nardilast made contact from Nanga Parbat on 24 February. Tensions between Pakistan and Indiaand poor flying weather have delayed rescue attempts. The cash will keep funding a helicopter team, which is said to cost about 50,000 euros (Â£43,000) a day. Mr Ballard, 30, originally from Belper, Derbyshire, is the son of Alison Hargreaves, who died descending from the summit of K2 in 1995 -  the same year she becamethe first woman to conquer Everest unaided,external.

Rescue attempts have been frustrated, largely due to the weather, which has meant the helicopter and high-altitude drones cannot fly. Friends have raised 108,930 euros (Â£93,819) which will go towards the daily cost of the rescue. Tom Ballard's sponsor Montane said it was not giving up hope By BBC World Affairs reporter Richard Galpin Nanga Parbat - also known as the killer mountain - is regarded as one of the toughest of all the world's highest peaks, and climbing it in winter presents an even greater challenge. With temperatures as low as -40C, strong winds and the danger of avalanches, the risks are particularly high. But both Tom Ballard and Daniele Nardi are very accomplished mountaineers, and there is still some lingering hope they could be found alive. A Spanish climber, Alex Txikon, who had been attempting a winter ascent of K2, has several high-altitude drones with him. He has been flown by the Pakistan military to the nearest town to Nanga Parbat base camp. But the helicopter could not continue its journey because of bad weather, and that means yet another delay in the search for the climbers.

Fox welcomes Brexiteers' tests for May,"This video can not be played Liam Fox on Brexit delay: ""If we have no option... then so be it"" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox welcomed a new offer from Tory Brexiteers as ""a genuine attempt"" to find ""common territory"". The Brexit-backing European Research Group has set out three tests it wants Theresa May to pass to secure its support for her deal with the EU. They still want a time-limit to the Irish backstop - but they say they don't mind how that is achieved. Mrs May has promised MPs a vote on her deal on or before 12 March. The three tests, drawn up by eight Brexit-backing lawyers, including Tories and a DUP MP, is seen as a softening of the ERG's previous stance on the backstop, which is meant to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Tory MP Bone denies Brexiteers are split Minister quits over Brexit delay vote Brexit: A really simple guide They say it is up to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who is in talks with the EU, how he achieves an exit mechanism from the backstop. They had previously been demanding specific legal changes to the agreement. In private talks with Mr Cox, the ERG called for a legally binding mechanism to escape the backstop, with a clear exit route and an unambiguous rewrite of the language in the government's legal advice, according toThe Sunday Times,external. Liam Fox told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""I hope it's a genuine attempt - and I think it is - to try to map out common territory."" He also sought to allay the fears of Brexit-backing Tories that Mrs May's offer to MPs of a vote on delaying the UK's departure - if her deal does not get through Parliament - could scupper Brexit. ""To attempt to have a delay mechanism in order to thwart the process of Brexit itself is actually politically completely unacceptable,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""And, as I have said before, would provoke a backlash amongst voters."" He did not rule out a short delay to Brexit, even if Mrs May's deal gets through, in order to get the legislation through Parliament, however. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. MPs last month rejected the withdrawal deal Theresa May has reached with the EU by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a sitting government in history. Mrs May believes the majority of the MPs who voted against her deal - including 118 Conservatives - would back it if she managed to secure changes that would prevent the UK being tied to EU customs rules indefinitely. She has promised MPs another vote on her deal by 12 March - and if that fails, she says MPs will get a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal, and then, by 14 March, a vote on whether Brexit should be postponed for a short period. Please upgrade your browser Sir Graham Brady, chairman of the influential 1922 committee of backbench Conservative MPs, said: ""Most MPs are in a mood to compromise, but the danger of this backstop becoming permanent is a real one and it has to be tackled."" Getting the backing of the ERG for her deal would be a major boost for Mrs May but would still not guarantee she could get it through Parliament. Caroline Flint: Labour MPs should consider backing 'improved deal' Some Tory MPs would prefer to see the UK leave without a deal, rather than the PM's deal, even with changes. And there are a variety of views within the ERG itself, with some leading figures taking a more hardline approach than others. Mrs May could find herself relying on the votes of Labour MPs from Leave-voting parts of the country, who are in favour of Brexit but want guarantees from the PM that workers' rights will not fall behind the EU after Britain's departure. Labour MP Caroline Flint told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday that given the choice between ""an improved deal and no deal, we should seriously consider the improved deal"". She said as many as 30 Labour MPs felt the same way, with even more against another EU referendum. ""I think there is something like 60 or 70 Labour MPs who feel as strongly as I do against a second referendum,"" she said. By BBC Political Correspondent Nick Eardley Imagine Theresa May sitting with a calculator - trying to figure out if she has any prospect of winning the vote on a new deal she's promised in the next nine days. At first glance, it appears a near-impossible task - and yet today might allow her to indulge in some cautious optimism. Brexiteers have set out their terms. They're familiar and they won't be easy. But the PM knows what she needs to do to win over dozens in her own party. Add to that some Labour MPs - who want to deliver Brexit and have been offered incentives to get on board. The challenge is still a big one. The numbers are still against her. But the PM might, just might, think she has a chance. Labour has so far failed to get MPs to back its alternative Brexit plan, which would see the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU, and has now said it will attempt to get a new EU referendum. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested Labour MPs would be expected to vote for an amendment calling for a referendum, when MPs vote on Mrs May's deal on or before 12 March. Rebecca Long-Bailey: We are not looking to overturn the result of the referendum ""I think on an issue as this we would see a whip, but also you've got to respect people's views and their constituency interests as well, and the whipping arrangement will be determined in discussion in due course,"" he told Sophy Ridge. Shadow Business Minister Rebecca Long-Bailey told Andrew Marr the Labour leadership would also continue to push its own Brexit plan and try to force a general election. Quizzed on what should be on the ballot paper in another referendum, she said it could be Theresa May's deal, ""a number of other Leave options"" and possibly Remain, but it would be up to MPs. Ms Long-Bailey added: ""We are not looking to overturn the result of the referendum.""

South Korea and US to end war games,"Tens of thousands of US military personnel are based in South Korea The US and South Korea have confirmed they will no longer hold two large-scale joint military exercises. The drills, which have always infuriated North Korea, will be replaced by a smaller-scale joint exercise. Thealliance's defence chiefs said the decision supported ""diplomatic efforts,externalto achieve complete denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula"". A smaller series of drills will instead take place, starting on Monday. What are the US-South Korea war games? US troops 'will stay in South Korea' North Korea has long regarded the US-South Korean drills as preparation for an invasion. After US President Donald Trump's historic meeting with North Korea's Kim Jong-un last year, a number of exercises were suspended. Then on a phone call on Saturday, defence ministers from the US and South Korea agreed to end the Foal Eagle and Key Resolve series of exercises. South Korea's military said on Sunday the two countries would instead conduct a new, smaller military exercise called Dong Maeng from 4 to 12 March. ""Dong Maeng, which means alliance in English, has been modified from the previously held spring exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle and will focus on strategic, operational and tactical aspects of general military operations on the Korean Peninsula,"" the two militaries said in a joint statement.

Critics have said cancelling the drills could undermine US and South Korean military defences against the North, but others say those concerns are unjustified. Foal Eagle was the largest of the regular joint exercises held by the two militaries. In the past, it has involved as many as 200,000 South Koreans and the roughly 30,000 US personnel based in South Korea. Key Resolve was a computer-simulated exercise alongside Foal Eagle.

What to make of the Hanoi summit collapse? Kim's hiding sister and other unreal moments Mr Trump's second summit with Kim Jong-un in Vietnam this week ended abruptly without a deal. President Trump said he had to ""walk"" because the North Koreans had demanded the full lifting of economic sanctions before denuclearisation.

Algeria protests keep pressure on leader,"This video can not be played Police face students opposing the president's plan to run again Algeria's veteran President Abdelaziz Bouteflika has defied protesters by confirming he will run again - but says he will not serve a full term. In a letter he said if he won April's vote he would oversee a national dialogue leading to fresh elections that he would not contest. His decision to seek a fifth term in office sparked nationwide protests. Mr Bouteflika, 82, has rarely been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 2013. Sunday saw new protests as a midnight deadline loomed for candidates to register. By nightfall young people were again marching in the capital Algiers despite the president's offer. Algeria protests: The beginning of the end? Mr Bouteflika's campaign manager submitted papers on behalf of the ailing president, who is undergoing medical treatment in Switzerland. The electoral commission has said candidates need to submit them in person, but the Constitutional Council ruled that he did not have to be physically present. The proposal came in the form of a letter to the Algerian people read out on state television. Should he be re-elected. Mr Bouteflika said he would hold an ""inclusive national conference"" followed by a vote to determine the next president. He said he would not run again and acknowledged the protests that have rocked Algeria. President Bouteflika has been rarely seen in public - here he was voting in May 2017 ""I listened and heard the heartfelt cry of protesters and in particular of the thousands of youth who asked me about the future of our country,"" the letter said, read by a presenter on ENTV. ""These youth express an understandable concern about the uncertainties they face. I have the duty and will to appease the hearts and spirits of my compatriots."" So far, six other candidates have formally registered, among them a retired general, Ali Ghediri, who has promised to bring ""change"" to Algeria. Businessman Rachid Nekkaz, who has a sizeable Facebook following and is said to be popular among Algeria's young, announced plans to run, but was deemed ineligible. Instead his cousin, a car mechanic who is also called Rachid Nekkaz has entered and the businessman says he will serve as his campaign manager. Two opposition parties, the Labour Party, and the Islamist Movement of Society for Peace, have said they will boycott the election. A key challenger in previous elections, Ali Benflis, also is not running. Yes - public shows of dissent in Algeria are rare, and the protests have been the biggest since Mr Bouteflika came to power 20 years ago. Demonstrations broke out about 10 days ago after Mr Bouteflika announced his plans to run for office again. Anti-riot police have been deployed in Algiers Young people have been at the forefront of the protests in Algeria On Sunday, people again took to the streets of the capital Algiers and other major cities. Police reportedly used water cannon to disperse students rallying in Algiers. There have also been demonstrations in France, the former colonial power, which is home to a large Algerian community. ""We aren't opposed to the president, but he is unconscious, he doesn't exist anymore, his generals and those close to him are doing what they will behind his back,"" one demonstrator told the AFP news agency. Mr Bouteflika came to power in 1999 and is credited with putting an end to a civil war that is estimated to have killed more than 100,000 people. Protests against food prices and unemployment broke out in 2011 during the Arab Spring but he responded by lifting a nearly two-decades old state of emergency, meeting a key demand of protesters. After his stroke he won re-election in a poll denounced by the opposition and dissolved the country's powerful spy agency, replacing it with a body loyal to him. Critics say his ill health means that he is unable to perform his duties as president. Despite the dissent, Mr Bouteflika is still widely tipped to win the election this year. Algeria's opposition is divided and Mr Bouteflika won the last presidential elections in 2014 despite doing no personal campaigning.

The artists safeguarding disused buildings,"Musician Ollie Tobin, artist Josh Field and writer Roland Fischer-Vousden founded SET to provide artists with workspaces in London Rising rents are seeing artists priced out of major cities, but now landlords are turning to them to help protect commercial properties from squatters. Twenty-seven-year-olds Josh Field and Ollie Tobin, and Roland Fischer-Vousden, 28, are school friends with a passion for the arts. In 2014, just before completing their undergraduate degrees in London, they realised that they would struggle to realise their dreams of becoming working creatives, because there was nowhere for them to work. The creation of large-scale art pieces and music often requires space, industrial tools and the freedom to make a lot of noise. None of these things are possible at urban residential properties, and studio space is very expensive. ""Art school doesn't prepare you for the real world, and we were trying to find some sort of loophole where we could get affordable vacant space in London,"" Josh says. Artist Kirsty Harris at her studio in a SET building in Bermondsey, south-east London Kirsty says a studio is so valuable that she would rather go without material things in order to afford the space Seeing the concept of property guardianship become popular in London - where people pay low rent to live in and look after vacant buildings - the trio began contacting property developers. Within two years, their hard work paid off, and in September 2016, they founded a non-profit called SET. SET offers workspaces to painters, musicians, sculptors, graphic designers, metalworkers, interactive artists and fashion designers. They were able to lease their first building in east London, and 50 artists snapped up the available spaces within three weeks. Madeleine Pledge and Eva Gold prepare an exhibition entitled The Dwelling at SET Today, SET has rented seven buildings in two years, including a Victorian pub, a book-packing warehouse, a Grade II listed Victorian train station, high-rise office buildings and commercial properties. Their project has helped artists like Richard Gasper, Kira Freije, Sam Austen and Hazel Brill, who have exhibited work at some of London's top galleries. Sculptor Henrietta Armstrong at work in her studio at SET ""It's somewhere you can escape to. I'm a lot more productive if I've got a space and it's away from my house,"" says artist Kirsty Harris, 40. She stresses that all artists want to have both a home and a studio, and will often compromise on material things in order to afford both. Printer Jordan Taylor says the shared workspace offers more freedom and a community of like-minded people to collaborate creatively with ""There's no-one looking over your shoulder,"" says 28-year-old Jordan Taylor, an artist and co-owner of eco-printing press start-up PageMasters, who has been with SET for two years. ""SET is a much more autonomous place than anywhere I've been before. ""There's also a lot of benefit in having access to a community. It's good for collaborating, making contacts and getting more work."" Vacant properties are subject to business rates, but these are reduced if a non-profit uses the property. Music producer Warmthness in his soundproofed studio at SET in Bermondsey The landlord and SET enter into a temporary ""meanwhile"" lease. The property is leased rent-free, with the non-profit agreeing to cover business rates, utility bills, building insurance, ground rent and service charge. Leases typically last only six months, or are rolling month-to-month. The artists often don't know when they'll be asked to leave, which can be stressful and interrupt their work, but they say it beats having nowhere to work at all. Families visiting a SET Open Studios event day in Dalston ""The landlords are getting free security. We're competitive to other guardianship companies because we can use buildings that are not suitable as living spaces, including semi-derelict properties,"" says Josh Field. SET converts vacant buildings into safe, usable space by adding amenities like lighting, heating and basic security, as well as erecting walls for studios. Interested artists apply to become members of SET, and their monthly membership fees are used to pay the bills. Kitty Clark performing at SET's Bar in Dalston. The bar provides a source of income and helps to promote musicians In addition to giving artists workspace, the public is encouraged to visit and participate in free workshops, as a way to give back to the local community. While there are other groups in London who help artists find affordable studio space in disused properties, SET says it is the first to offer landlords ""a competitive security alternative"" and brand themselves ""as a service instead of a tenant"". A similar scheme that turns vacant commercial property into artist studios operates in Leeds. In 1993, artists Karen Watson and John Wakeman were looking for a space to work. They gathered a large group of artists to form East Street Arts (ESA), and applied for funding through Arts Council England. This enabled them to purchase a building in Leeds city centre, which they turned into Patrick Studios. ESA was founded with the aim of promoting artists and getting them paid opportunities. Artist Drew Caines working at East Street Arts' Patrick Studios in Leeds As part of that, the non-profit tries to generate its own income, such as running an arts-themed hostel in Leeds. Today, it also offers funding for PhDs at Sheffield University into developing housing for artists, and it recently launched a four-year programme called Guild, which provides training to help artists learn financial planning and how to run a business. ""We're trying to make artist groups have more of a business focus. A lot of groups have problems securing space, dealing with landlords and councils,"" Gaynor Seville, strategic manager of ESA's Guild programme, explains. ""To do that we need to help them develop skills you wouldn't ordinarily associate with artists."" An exhibition at Leeds City College, featuring work by artists from East Street Arts ESA also helped another non-profit, Castlefield Gallery, to get started in Manchester, where gentrification has eradicated almost all artist workspaces. Back in London, Southwark Council has had its own team working with the private sector to secure working spaces for artists since 2010. Its regeneration efforts also involve bringing disused buildings back into use. People enjoying street food at a food court in Peckham Levels ""Artists have a great way of bringing buildings back in the heart of the community, by working with schools and community organisations,"" says Labour's Johnson Situ, Southwark councillor for the ward of Peckham. ""The council doesn't engage in these leases to make a profit. The leases more gear towards us being able to see a social impact."" Although the council does seek to make money from commercial properties, it found that temporary leases led to long-lasting social benefits in urban areas. People take classes at Peckham Levels' yoga studio One of the council's biggest successes is Peckham Levels, a disused multi-storey car park that was once a concrete eyesore. Today, it offers shops, restaurants, artist workspaces and a place for local start-ups to build their businesses and offer apprenticeships to young adults. Outset Contemporary Art Fund, a foundation that supports contemporary art, is also trying to help artists by convincing property developers to incorporate artist workspaces at a discounted rent into new residential developments and shopping malls. The Ramp in Peckham Levels is a creative co-working space for start-ups and freelancers ""It creates a better environment for your other tenants,"" says Outset's project director Yves Blais. ""There's a reason why Central St Martins moved into Granary Square behind King's Cross Station - it was to attract other tenants, like Google."" However, Andrew Teacher, founder of Blackstock Consulting, which advises property companies, and who previously performed in bands, questions councils' decisions to give these temporary leases to artists. ""A lot of old buildings aren't safe and aren't suited for these purposes. If you're an artist going in using various tools, you need safety procedures to prevent fire hazards, and there's a question about how these safety procedures are maintained,"" he says. ""Why are artists only useful when we can't rent out a building?"" He wants to see councils take out compulsory orders to purchase pieces of land, and then subsidise the rent on properties for artists. ""Just as nurses shouldn't have to go to food banks, artists shouldn't have to scrabble around."" BBC photos by Phil Coomes. All photographs subject to copyright.

'I was abandoned in a phone box as a baby',"This video can not be played Sarah, thought to be two days old, was wrapped in a sheet and left lying in the phone box A woman abandoned in a phone box when she was just two days old has said she is desperate to find her birth mother. Sarah Renwick was found in the phone box at in Blyth, Northumberland, at 01:00 BST on 10 July 1996. A woman, believed to be her mother, called the ambulance service from the kiosk to say she had given birth and had left the baby there. ""I'm really hopeful, but at the same time I'm preparing that it might be the case where I never find out,"" she said. Although Sarah knew she was adopted, she had no idea she had been left in a phone box until recently, when she began researching her past. When emergency services arrived at the phone box in Renwick Road, nobody but the baby was in sight. Taken to hospital in Ashington, she weighed 7lb 6oz and was thought to be two days old. She was clean and healthy. The baby was named Sarah Renwick - after the police officer who found her and the street she was found in. Adopted at the age of seven weeks, Sarah was brought up in North Tyneside before moving to Australia in 2007. She lived there with her new parents and brother, who is also adopted, before moving back to Northumberland four years ago. She now has a new name, but has asked the BBC not to reveal it or photograph her as she is now. ""Everything's been great with my family... then we came back, and I'd met my partner, got engaged and had a baby, and then I started wondering about my birth parents. ""Growing up I'd always known that I was adopted and I've had a really really good life... I didn't want to ask my parents about it in case they felt not good enough,"" Sarah said. A few weeks ago, Sarah, now 22, began searching local newspaper archives in the hope of finding out about her past. Finally she discovered cuttings from the time. It was the first time she had seen herself as a baby. Sarah began searching local newspaper archives in the hope of finding information about her birth mum She said: ""I can't really describe it. I was shocked even though I already had this feeling that that was what had happened, it felt like the earth stood still. ""I'd never seen a picture of myself as a newborn baby up until then and even now... looking at it, it still doesn't even feel like it's me. It's a really weird feeling. ""My parents have now explained to me that they felt it was for the best I didn't know, but they wished it had come from them."" Sarah hascreated a Facebook page,externalin the hope someone might have information that could lead her to her birth mother. In 1996, police and social services carried out an extensive search and there was a public appeal but to no avail. The woman appeared not to have attended any prenatal or postnatal appointments and Sarah's birth certificate was blank. It is thought her birth mother called the hospital once she had been fostered and said she still loved her, then hung up. ""I thought if I've got no mum or dad on my birth certificate, I must have been abandoned. ""Blyth is a really small place. I just think that someone must know something and I just want someone to come forward so I can get answers. ""My baby is seven months old and it was weird, I've never felt different to everyone else, and it was when I was sitting in a room with my partner's family, and they were all talking about how much he weighed at birth and how the baby looked like people in his family, I just sort of sat there and I was like 'this is the only time that I've ever felt that like I'm different to everyone else'. ""I didn't know my birth weight - well it's in the paper - but my mum finds it upsetting to look through so she hadn't looked to check. During the anonymous phone call, the woman, believed to be the birth mother, appears to call out to a friend called Lisa or Theresa ""I just feel like it's the circumstances that make me want to know why, was she OK after, and has it played on her mind? Does she ever think about me? Rare triplets carving out media careers Thousands raised for missing climbers 'It's the worst news in the world' ""I feel like I'm preparing for the worst, which is that she wouldn't want to talk to me, but I feel that what I want is to just get answers about what happened - where was I born, what did she go through and what was the deciding factor in leaving me. ""Just so that we can both get closure, because I feel that I've had a really good life and she might not have if this has been playing on her mind. ""I feel that if she knows I forgive her and we can have a discussion about what happened, then we'll both have a weight off our shoulders and be able to go forward happy in life knowing that it's out there.""

Russia Novichok link made using Google,"Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived the attack in Salisbury last March The first police on the scene of the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal realised the seriousness of the case after Googling his name. Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targeted with the nerve agent Novichok on 4 March 2018 in Salisbury. Sgt Tracey Holloway said after finding his name online they realised ""it could be something bigger"". A church service, ahead of the first anniversary of the attack, has taken place. St Thomas's Church, in the city, remembered the victims and offered thanks to the community. Mr Skripal's house and 11 other potentially infected sites were ruled safe on Friday. The operation included taking thousands of test samples from across Salisbury and nearby Amesbury, where Dawn Sturgess, 44, was fatally poisoned in July. Britain has accused Russia of carrying out the poisoning of the Skripals. Russia has also been blamed for the death of Ms Sturgess and the poisoning of Mr Rowley, who are believed to have come into contact with a bottle of Novichok discarded by the Skripals' attackers. Salisbury declared free of Novichok 'Novichok' litter pick ban 'should end' Russian flag flown on Salisbury Cathedral Dawn Sturgess and partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in Amesbury Det Sgt Nick Bailey was contaminated at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March Sgt Holloway said they knew ""relatively early that they were both going to intensive care"". But police had initially thought the Skripals' collapse had been caused by a drugs overdose. ""The paramedics said they weren't sure what it was and we didn't know what they were suffering with,"" she said. ""They weren't dressed in the way I would expect a drug user to be, so I wasn't really sure what we had."" Police first at the scene - including Sgt Tracey Holloway - found Mr Skripal's name online Military personnel have spent 13,000 hours on the clean-up following the nerve agent poisoning in March 2018 When the officers went back to the station they made the link to Russia - and the possibility of a much bigger case - as they found Mr Skripal's name online. ""It was actually another CID officer who had Googled his name and then said, 'Tracey, do you want to come and have a look at this?' ""It was at that point that we got the link to the Russians side of things. And at that point we thought this could be something bigger than what we believed could be a drugs overdose."" Sergei and Yulia Skripal survived the attack following treatment at Salisbury District Hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who searched their house following the poisoning, returned to work last year and is preparing to run a marathon to raise money for the hospital. Meanwhile Ms Sturgess's son has urged Vladimir Putin to hand over the men suspected of being responsible for his mother's death. Ewan Hope has appealed directly to the Russian president ""as a human being"" to allow British investigators to speak to the suspects. His mother's partner, Charlie Rowley, said he wanted ""someone to pay for what they've done"". In an open letter to Mr Putinpublished by the Sunday Mirror,external, Mr Hope said: ""The British police believe at least two Russian citizens were responsible for her death but it appears they are being protected by your state. ""I am appealing to you as a human being to allow our officers to question these men about my mother's murder. The least she deserves is justice.""

Trump launches furious attack on Mueller,"This video can not be played Trump attacks his opponents in Maryland speech US President Donald Trump has launched a furious attack on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and on his critics at a conservative summit. In the longest speech of his presidency, Mr Trump railed against the inquiry into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia. ""We're waiting for a report by people who weren't elected,"" he told a crowd of cheering conservatives. Mr Mueller is expected to hand in his report to the attorney general shortly. Warning: this report contains strong language Sanders launches 2020 presidential bid ""Unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there and all of a sudden they are trying to take you out with bullshit, okay?"" the president said. Mr Trump has frequently called the special counsel's investigation a ""witch hunt"". What might 'Mueller report' look like? Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The speech - clocking in at more than two hours - also included sharp attacks on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former FBI head James Comey, the Democratic Party and those critical of his approach to North Korea. Mr Trump's second summit with Kim Jong-un in Vietnam ended abruptly without a deal this week. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, Mr Trump lashed out at his detractors in a wide-ranging speech. ""This is how I got elected, by being off script .â.â. and if we don't go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks,"" he began. There were chants of ""We love you"" and ""Trump is our man"" during the speech The president repeatedly said that Mr Mueller had ""never received a vote"", nor had Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mr Mueller to his position. Mr Rosenstein plans to step down by Marchafter frequent presidential attacks. The president alleged Mr Mueller was ""best friends"" with former FBI head James Comey, and mocked the accent offormer attorney general Mr Sessions, whom he fired in November. He said Mr Sessions was ""weak and ineffective and he doesn't do what he should have done"". The president's attacks ranged widely. He called the Green New Deal proposal - pitched by some Democrats as a radical bid to combat climate change - ""the craziest plan"", saying ""when the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric"". 'They want to take away your hamburgers' Can the Green New Deal really work? After a series of remarks on immigrants who, he said, must ""love our country"", Mr Trump said, ""We have people in Congress that hate our country."" ""And you know that, and we can name every one of them if you want,"" he said. The 116th Congress is considered the most diverse in history He also defended his summit with North Korea leader Mr Kim, telling the crowd they had made ""a lot of progress"" and saying the country had ""an incredible, brilliant future"". Mr Trump also pledged to protect free speech on US university campuses with an executive order. Conservatives have said some US universities stifle right-wing opinions. The speech came at the end of a difficult week for the president. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen called him a ""racist"", ""conman"" and a ""cheat""in a congressional hearing.

Dragon capsule docks with space station,"This video can not be played US astronaut Anne McClain inside the Dragon capsule America's new astronaut capsule has successfully docked with the International Space Station (ISS) as part of its demonstration mission. The Dragon vehicle, launched by California's SpaceX company on Saturday, made the attachment autonomously. It is the latest in a series of tests the capsule must pass in order to get approval from Nasa to transport people. All this particular mission is carrying is a test dummy and 180kg of supplies. But if everything goes according to plan, astronauts could be launching in the Dragon as early as July. The capsule's ""soft capture"" contact with the ISS occurred at 10:51 GMT, when the station was flying over ocean just north of New Zealand. A full and secure docking was confirmed about 10 minutes later.

Astronauts aboard the ISS watched closely on HD cameras to make sure the capsule performed as planned. The capsule advanced on the station slowly, stepping through a series of planned waypoints. US astronaut Anne McClain and Canadian astronaut David Saint-Jacques oversaw events from the station's big bay window, or Cupola. They had the facility to command the Dragon to hold, retreat and even abort the docking. After some rehearsals, the ""go"" was given for the final approach. The Dragon capsule lifted its nose cone to make the docking Attachment was made to a new type of mating adaptor on the ISS's Harmony module. This has a spring system which initially dampens the movement of the incoming vehicle, before applying a series of hooks to pull it in and make an air-tight seal - so-called ""hard capture"". McClain, Saint-Jacques and ISS commander Oleg Kononenko were able to enter the Dragon a couple of hours later, after the air pressures inside the capsule and the station had been equalised. Watching on the ground was Bob Behnken, who's been picked, along with Doug Hurley, to make the first crewed ride in the Dragon when it gets its certification. ""It was super exciting to see it,"" he said. ""I know you heard the applause and all the clapping that went along with the accomplishment today and so it's just one more milestone that gets us ready for our flight coming up here."" The docking procedure is a step up for SpaceX because the cargo ships it normally sends to the lab have to be grappled by a robotic arm and pulled into a berthing position. The freighters do not have the sophistication to dock themselves. The Dragon capsule is due to stay at the ISS until Friday when it will detach and begin the journey back to Earth. This is the phase of the mission that SpaceX founder Elon Musk says worries him the most â the fiery, high-speed descent through the atmosphere. The Dragon's backshell, or conical upper-section, has a somewhat irregular shape and that could lead to a roll instability at hypersonic speeds. ""It should be fine, but that'll be a thing to make sure it works on re-entry,"" said Mr Musk. ""Everything we know so far is looking positive.

Brexiteers outline EU deal terms,"This video can not be played Liam Fox on Brexit delay: ""If we have no option... then so be it"" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox welcomed a new offer from Tory Brexiteers as ""a genuine attempt"" to find ""common territory"". The Brexit-backing European Research Group has set out three tests it wants Theresa May to pass to secure its support for her deal with the EU. They still want a time-limit to the Irish backstop - but they say they don't mind how that is achieved. Mrs May has promised MPs a vote on her deal on or before 12 March. The three tests, drawn up by eight Brexit-backing lawyers, including Tories and a DUP MP, is seen as a softening of the ERG's previous stance on the backstop, which is meant to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Tory MP Bone denies Brexiteers are split Minister quits over Brexit delay vote Brexit: A really simple guide They say it is up to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who is in talks with the EU, how he achieves an exit mechanism from the backstop. They had previously been demanding specific legal changes to the agreement. In private talks with Mr Cox, the ERG called for a legally binding mechanism to escape the backstop, with a clear exit route and an unambiguous rewrite of the language in the government's legal advice, according toThe Sunday Times,external. Liam Fox told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""I hope it's a genuine attempt - and I think it is - to try to map out common territory."" He also sought to allay the fears of Brexit-backing Tories that Mrs May's offer to MPs of a vote on delaying the UK's departure - if her deal does not get through Parliament - could scupper Brexit. ""To attempt to have a delay mechanism in order to thwart the process of Brexit itself is actually politically completely unacceptable,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""And, as I have said before, would provoke a backlash amongst voters."" He did not rule out a short delay to Brexit, even if Mrs May's deal gets through, in order to get the legislation through Parliament, however. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. MPs last month rejected the withdrawal deal Theresa May has reached with the EU by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a sitting government in history. Mrs May believes the majority of the MPs who voted against her deal - including 118 Conservatives - would back it if she managed to secure changes that would prevent the UK being tied to EU customs rules indefinitely. She has promised MPs another vote on her deal by 12 March - and if that fails, she says MPs will get a vote on whether the UK should leave without a deal, and then, by 14 March, a vote on whether Brexit should be postponed for a short period.

Getting the backing of the ERG for her deal would be a major boost for Mrs May but would still not guarantee she could get it through Parliament. Caroline Flint: Labour MPs should consider backing 'improved deal' Some Tory MPs would prefer to see the UK leave without a deal, rather than the PM's deal, even with changes. And there are a variety of views within the ERG itself, with some leading figures taking a more hardline approach than others. Mrs May could find herself relying on the votes of Labour MPs from Leave-voting parts of the country, who are in favour of Brexit but want guarantees from the PM that workers' rights will not fall behind the EU after Britain's departure. Labour MP Caroline Flint told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday that given the choice between ""an improved deal and no deal, we should seriously consider the improved deal"". She said as many as 30 Labour MPs felt the same way, with even more against another EU referendum. ""I think there is something like 60 or 70 Labour MPs who feel as strongly as I do against a second referendum,"" she said.

Brexiteers deliver key terms to May,"This video can not be played Liam Fox on Brexit delay: ""If we have no option... then so be it"" International Trade Secretary Liam Fox welcomed a new offer from Tory Brexiteers as ""a genuine attempt"" to find ""common territory"". The Brexit-backing European Research Group has set out three tests it wants Theresa May to pass to secure its support for her deal with the EU. They still want a time-limit to the Irish backstop - but they say they don't mind how that is achieved. Mrs May has promised MPs a vote on her deal on or before 12 March. The three tests, drawn up by eight Brexit-backing lawyers, including Tories and a DUP MP, is seen as a softening of the ERG's previous stance on the backstop, which is meant to prevent the return of a hard border on the island of Ireland. Tory MP Bone denies Brexiteers are split Minister quits over Brexit delay vote Brexit: A really simple guide They say it is up to Attorney General Geoffrey Cox, who is in talks with the EU, how he achieves an exit mechanism from the backstop. They had previously been demanding specific legal changes to the agreement. In private talks with Mr Cox, the ERG called for a legally binding mechanism to escape the backstop, with a clear exit route and an unambiguous rewrite of the language in the government's legal advice, according toThe Sunday Times,external. Liam Fox told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""I hope it's a genuine attempt - and I think it is - to try to map out common territory."" He also sought to allay the fears of Brexit-backing Tories that Mrs May's offer to MPs of a vote on delaying the UK's departure - if her deal does not get through Parliament - could scupper Brexit. ""To attempt to have a delay mechanism in order to thwart the process of Brexit itself is actually politically completely unacceptable,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""And, as I have said before, would provoke a backlash amongst voters."" He did not rule out a short delay to Brexit, even if Mrs May's deal gets through, in order to get the legislation through Parliament, however. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March, with or without a deal. MPs last month rejected the withdrawal deal Theresa May has reached with the EU by 230 votes - the biggest defeat for a sitting government in history.

Sanders launches 2020 presidential bid,"This video can not be played Mr Sanders got personal as he rounded on President Trump US Senator Bernie Sanders has launched his bid to be president in 2020 with an attack on corporate greed and a promise to unleash a ""political revolution"". Speaking in Brooklyn, New York, he called Donald Trump the ""most dangerous president"" in recent US history. Mr Sanders, a 77-year-old independent senator for Vermont, lost the 2016 Democrat race to Hillary Clinton. He faces a much more crowded field this time but brings name recognition and a passionate support base. More than 10 others are also running to be Democrat candidate, including Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, New Jersey Senator Cory Booker and the Mayor of San Antonio, Texas, Julian Castro. His speech promised a presidency that would ""bring people together"". He outlined numerous policies and attacked greed and the ""billionaire class"". As president, he said he would: Enact a ""federal jobs guarantee"" to ensure all Americans have work More than double the minimum wage from $7.25 (Â£5.50) to $15 Pass ""comprehensive"" immigration reform, including allowing hundreds of thousands of undocumented migrants to stay in the US Make universities and colleges tuition-free Reform healthcare to give universal coverage He promised to fight for ""economic justice, social justice, racial justice and environmental justice"".

One of the challenges Mr Sanders faces is that the Democratic Party has shifted to the left, making his message less distinctive, BBC North America reporter Anthony Zurcher says. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Sanders's brother Larry said the Vermont senator was right to try again for the presidency. ""I think Bernard's presidency would be really uplifting, finally to have somebody who people see as honest and has been committed for such a long time to be saying that we don't need the poverty, we can have all the things that we need,"" he said. ""It's all been a kind of crazy dogma that 'oh no, no, no, you can't afford that'."" Mr Sanders was born in Brooklyn, and the backdrop for his speech gave him an opportunity to contrast himself with the president. He grew up as the son of a Jewish immigrant who worked as a paint seller, while Mr Trump, who also was born in New York, was the son of a wealthy real estate developer. ""I did not have a father who gave me millions of dollars to build luxury skyscrapers, casinos and country clubs,"" he said. ""But I had something more valuable: I had the role model of a father who had unbelievable courage in journeying across an ocean, with no money in his pocket, to start a new and better life."" As he was speaking Mr Trump was addressing a conference of conservative activists, in which he attacked the Democrats and promised he would win re-election. Trump launches furious attack on Mueller He sarcastically mocked Democrat proposals on the environment and said plans for universal healthcare would lead to a ""socialist takeover of American healthcare"". He is the longest-serving independent in congressional history, but competes for the Democratic nomination as he says standing as a third-party candidate would diminish his chances of winning the presidency. He attended the University of Chicago, and in the 1960s and 1970s participated in anti-war and civil rights activism, like the 1963 March on Washington. Should Bernie Sanders' fundraising worry rivals? 17 things that Bernie Sanders believes In 1990, he became the first independent in 40 years to be elected to the House of Representatives. He served there until he ran for and won a seat in the Senate in 2007. Mr Sanders entered the race for the 2016 Democratic nomination as a marginal candidate but emerged as a surprise star during a series of televised debates. He labels himself a Democratic socialist, which he has defined as someone who seeks to ""create an economy that works for all, not just the very wealthy"". He became Mrs Clinton's closest rival, but she ultimately won the nomination before losing the presidential election to Mr Trump. Bernie Sanders has joined the race to stop Donald Trump from being re-elected. But who else has a shot at becoming the next president? Find out who is already running and who might join them.

Russia Novichock link made using Google,"Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived the attack in Salisbury last March The first police on the scene of the poisoning of the former Russian spy Sergei Skripal realised the seriousness of the case after Googling his name. Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targeted with the nerve agent Novichok on 4 March 2018 in Salisbury. Sgt Tracey Holloway said after finding his name online they realised ""it could be something bigger"". A church service, ahead of the first anniversary of the attack, has taken place. St Thomas's Church, in the city, remembered the victims and offered thanks to the community. Mr Skripal's house and 11 other potentially infected sites were ruled safe on Friday. The operation included taking thousands of test samples from across Salisbury and nearby Amesbury, where Dawn Sturgess, 44, was fatally poisoned in July. Britain has accused Russia of carrying out the poisoning of the Skripals. Russia has also been blamed for the death of Ms Sturgess and the poisoning of Mr Rowley, who are believed to have come into contact with a bottle of Novichok discarded by the Skripals' attackers. Salisbury declared free of Novichok 'Novichok' litter pick ban 'should end' Russian flag flown on Salisbury Cathedral Dawn Sturgess and partner Charlie Rowley were exposed to Novichok in Amesbury Det Sgt Nick Bailey was contaminated at the home of Sergei and Yulia Skripal in March Sgt Holloway said they knew ""relatively early that they were both going to intensive care"". But police had initially thought the Skripals' collapse had been caused by a drugs overdose. ""The paramedics said they weren't sure what it was and we didn't know what they were suffering with,"" she said. ""They weren't dressed in the way I would expect a drug user to be, so I wasn't really sure what we had."" Police first at the scene - including Sgt Tracey Holloway - found Mr Skripal's name online Military personnel have spent 13,000 hours on the clean-up following the nerve agent poisoning in March 2018 When the officers went back to the station they made the link to Russia - and the possibility of a much bigger case - as they found Mr Skripal's name online. ""It was actually another CID officer who had Googled his name and then said, 'Tracey, do you want to come and have a look at this?' ""It was at that point that we got the link to the Russians side of things. And at that point we thought this could be something bigger than what we believed could be a drugs overdose."" Sergei and Yulia Skripal survived the attack following treatment at Salisbury District Hospital. Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who searched their house following the poisoning, returned to work last year and is preparing to run a marathon to raise money for the hospital. Meanwhile Ms Sturgess's son has urged Vladimir Putin to hand over the men suspected of being responsible for his mother's death. Ewan Hope has appealed directly to the Russian president ""as a human being"" to allow British investigators to speak to the suspects. His mother's partner, Charlie Rowley, said he wanted ""someone to pay for what they've done"". In an open letter to Mr Putinpublished by the Sunday Mirror,external, Mr Hope said: ""The British police believe at least two Russian citizens were responsible for her death but it appears they are being protected by your state. ""I am appealing to you as a human being to allow our officers to question these men about my mother's murder. The least she deserves is justice.""

Who will take IS fighter and his teenage 'bride'?,"This suspected IS fighter left Baghouz this week; Riedijk and Shamima Begum left earlier Yago Riedijk was born and raised in well-to-do Dutch suburbia but abandoned it all in his early twenties for so-called Islamic State (IS). Old pictures show a smiling teenager perched behind a child on a motorbike. A smattering of hairs on his chin suggests he is cultivating a beard. He left the Netherlands in 2014. If he returns, he faces a six-year jail term for joining a terrorist organisation. You may be familiar with his jihadi bride, Shamima Begum from east London who is believed to have ""married"" him 10 days after she arrived inside IS territory aged 15. They now face an uncertain fate. Thousands of displaced people are in the al-Hol camp in north-eastern Syria Riedijk was one of 300 Dutch men and women who travelled to Syria and Iraq. Some 135 Dutch nationals with ""jihadist intentions"" are still there, anti-terrorism officials say. It is not known how many want to come back, and it is not clear if they can. Authorities across Europe are alive to the threat of returning jihadists: The Netherlands this week removed the citizenship of Riedijk's fellow Dutch jihadist, Outhmane B Thirteen French citizens accused of fighting for IS are facing trial in Iraq rather than in France itself, and the French government will not intervene Belgium has won an appeal which means it cannot be forced to repatriate two Belgian women convicted of being Islamic State militants from Syria along with their children The UK has revoked Shamima Begum's citizenship As IS began to crumble, he and Shamima Begum escaped the town of Baghouz to protect their unborn child. Riedijk, now 27, is held in north-eastern Syria while she was in the sprawling al-Hol refugee camp - temporary home to 39,000 people, mostly women and children - but has now reportedly gone elsewhere. This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" When the UK revoked her citizenship, she raised the prospect of applying for Dutch nationality through her ""husband"". Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? Why countries face a dilemma over IS children How many IS foreign fighters are left? Begum family launch challenge on citizenship move Although Riedijk is on a terrorism watch list, his citizenship has not been revoked. If he made it to a Dutch embassy or consulate, in theory he would be allowed to return home. Shamima Begum will struggle to get her underage union recognised in the Netherlands, but their newborn son, Jarrah, may be entitled to Dutch citizenship. There are as many as 170 children in Syria who could lay claim to Dutch nationality. A map showing the verified origin countries of children who travelled to Iraq or Syria Only this week the Dutch justice department warned of the threat posed by jihadist women,externalreturning from abroad, as well as by boys older than nine years old. Even women and children who were not trained and did not take part in hostilities could pose a ""long-term potential threat"" because of exposure to IS ideology, it said. Jimmy's cafe nestles on a neat shopping precinct close to where Riedijk grew up, in the eastern city of Arnhem. Jimmy, softly spoken, gestures to the table where Riedijk and his friends used to gather. Two men in their twenties talk candidly of friends seduced and conscripted by a brutal death cult. Frustrated their city has been christened the Netherlands' ""jihadist capital"", they blame Dutch society for failing to stop ""good kids"" from being groomed. ""They were kick-boxing, deejaying, but then they stopped seeing opportunity here in the Netherlands,"" says one. ""Guys started coming to our mosque, preaching, and the boys started to break away, become more extreme in their thinking, they were meeting in apartments and then we hear they've gone."" Dutch grapple with jihadist threat Their experience tallies with the findings of a study that pinpoints a period in 2013 when radicalisation in Arnhem reached its peak. Recruits often suffer from low self-esteem and are searching for a stronger identity, says Barbara Klunder, who has represented a number of young Dutch jihadist suspects. ""It's not so much religious, but more a feeling of belonging and being fully accepted by their own people fighting the same enemy."" The spotlight returned to Riedijk's hometown last autumn, when seven men were arrested at a holiday park in the southern town of Weert. Leaked photos appear to show them kissing Kalashnikov rifles, posing in bomb vests, and preparing to carry out a terror attack at a rock festival in Arnhem with the aim of ""creating as many casualties as possible"", in the words of the Dutch prosecutor. A police image shows a raid on the suspected ""Arnhem terror cell"" Six men between 21 and 35 who either came from Arnhem or lived there remain in custody awaiting trial. Bomb materials seized after Dutch arrests Another element in the Arnhem terror cell case is Riedijk himself, as he is suspected of being linked to the group. With a jail sentence awaiting him, it is unclear whether he will come back. His parents have declined to comment. Patrick, a childhood friend, describes him as ""one of the quiet people in class"". Shocked by his departure, he believes Riedijk should be brought home and locked up for life. Dutch justice officials will be taking no chances. What other EU member states decide to do regarding repatriation is up to them, but that does not mean the Netherlands has to follow, says the national co-ordinator for security and counter-terrorism. Arnhem Mayor Ahmed Marcouch believes Riedijk should be brought home to face justice. ""We will continue to guide him and keep an eye on him,"" he told a local paper. But he does not want Shamima Begum to come. ""You cannot be eligible for a residence permit when you have committed terrorist crimes.""

Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum?,"This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" I saw her approach through the crowded camp and recognised her from her shoes. They peeked out from underneath her black abaya; like a child's trainers they were red, blue and gold but almost in pieces. I'd spotted them when we first met two days earlier. Shamima Begum took off her veil, and carefully sat down in the director's office, in the al-Hol internment camp in north-eastern Syria. A tiny squeal came from under the stained, black dress. Her three-day-old son Jarrah was cradled underneath. There had been an international search for her when, at 15 years old, she disappeared four years ago, along with two school friends from the Bethnal Green Academy in east London. She'd left to join the Islamic State group (IS). And now the world wanted her to disappear again. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Why countries face a dilemma over IS children When asked, she professed ignorance of the jihadist group's worst crimes - the enslavement of the Yazidi people and the rest of the appalling crimes they committed in Iraq and Syria. But she also justified some - claiming, in a twisted logic - that the bombing of the Ariana Grande concert at the Manchester Arena in 2017, which killed 22 people, many of them children, was no worse than Western air strikes here in Syria. The fact that one followed the other didn't seem to figure in her thinking. Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 On our second meeting, the public anger about her crime and her request to now come back to Britain, had sunk in. She was more apologetic. But by then it was too late. The UK home secretary had stripped her of her citizenship. There are already more than a dozen British women and children in camps here, but none have captured public attention like her. As a reporter I've interviewed many IS fighters, including the men accused of beheading the American journalist, James Foley, and British aid workers Alan Henning and David Haines. Could a defeated IS rebound? How many IS foreign fighters are left? There was outrage, but not on anything like the same scale as that directed at Shamima Begum. She isn't accused of murder, but her betrayal of Britain by committing the crime of joining a ""proscribed terror group"" stings deeply. And there was anger, too, that we were giving her airtime, even though she was strongly challenged on her outrageous answers - including an attempt to justify the institutionalised rape of Yazidi women. Her lack of contrition - though she did express regret - was particularly galling. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK British citizens played an outsized role in the IS group. Other European countries contributed more fighters but they didn't have Jihadi John. Mohammed Emwazzi, to give him his real name, horrified us, revelling in his murders and goading the West to come get him. He was killed eventually in a drone strike in Raqqa. Shamima Begum liked those videos. Those horror films, and others promising an Islamic religious paradise, drew her to IS. How could she leave Britain - leave us - for that? ""I wanted to get married and my parents wouldn't let me,"" she responded. If the public was ill-prepared for the 19-year-old's reappearance, then so too was the British government. Until she's 21 she has the right to Bangladeshi citizenship. That was enough space - ""a very limited loophole"" as one diplomat described it to me - for her to be declared no longer British; no longer Britain's problem. As I sit here in Deir al-Zour province in south-eastern Syria, the caliphate she joined willingly is dying. Thirty trucks just left the tiny strip of land they hold in the tiny village of Baghuz, full of IS supporters and others. Earlier in the week, more than 2,000 people were evacuated from the area. They haven't been processed yet, but intelligence suggests that British women will be among them. British fighters too are still inside - will they die in the last battle or will they surrender? And if they survive, will there be more ""very limited loopholes"" to stop them from returning to Britain too? Russia, Kazakhstan and the United States have taken back women from areas under IS control. European countries have not. Iraq and Tunisia have taken back IS fighters; Britain, like many others, has not. IS bride 'is not Bangladeshi citizen' 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' There are risks in letting these people become someone else's problem. The Syrian Kurds holding them say there should be international tribunals here in Syria. After all, it's where they did the most harm. But with US forces leaving, will the detained suspects and their family members be secure? And there is the risk that in Syria's ever-changing alliances, the Kurds could hand them over to the regime. Let's not forget that President Bashar al-Assad was once happy to funnel foreign and local extremists into Iraq to attack Western forces there. He can't be trusted with Western prisoners. Shamima Begum may disappear from public view soon (to where, I don't know - Bangladesh, says it doesn't want her either). At the end of our second interview, she slowly rose from the chair and, replacing her veil, left to feed her child. ""I don't know where I'll end up,"" she said. I watched the black figure with tattered shoes disappear into the teeming camp. Many others have followed in her footsteps from Britain, to Syria, and the Islamic State group. And we still don't know where they will end up either. Begum family challenge Javid on citizenship What is Shamima Begum's legal status?

"Trump launches furious attack on MuellerThe US president tells a conservative summit his opponents are trying to ""take me out"".","This video can not be played Trump attacks his opponents in Maryland speech US President Donald Trump has launched a furious attack on Special Counsel Robert Mueller and on his critics at a conservative summit. In the longest speech of his presidency, Mr Trump railed against the inquiry into alleged collusion between his campaign and Russia. ""We're waiting for a report by people who weren't elected,"" he told a crowd of cheering conservatives. Mr Mueller is expected to hand in his report to the attorney general shortly. Warning: this report contains strong language Sanders launches 2020 presidential bid ""Unfortunately, you put the wrong people in a couple of positions and they leave people for a long time that shouldn't be there and all of a sudden they are trying to take you out with bullshit, okay?"" the president said. Mr Trump has frequently called the special counsel's investigation a ""witch hunt"". What might 'Mueller report' look like? Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The speech - clocking in at more than two hours - also included sharp attacks on former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, former FBI head James Comey, the Democratic Party and those critical of his approach to North Korea. Mr Trump's second summit with Kim Jong-un in Vietnam ended abruptly without a deal this week. Speaking at the Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, Mr Trump lashed out at his detractors in a wide-ranging speech. ""This is how I got elected, by being off script .â.â. and if we don't go off script, our country is in big trouble, folks,"" he began. There were chants of ""We love you"" and ""Trump is our man"" during the speech The president repeatedly said that Mr Mueller had ""never received a vote"", nor had Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, who appointed Mr Mueller to his position. Mr Rosenstein plans to step down by Marchafter frequent presidential attacks. The president alleged Mr Mueller was ""best friends"" with former FBI head James Comey, and mocked the accent offormer attorney general Mr Sessions, whom he fired in November. He said Mr Sessions was ""weak and ineffective and he doesn't do what he should have done"". The president's attacks ranged widely. He called the Green New Deal proposal - pitched by some Democrats as a radical bid to combat climate change - ""the craziest plan"", saying ""when the wind stops blowing, that's the end of your electric"". 'They want to take away your hamburgers' Can the Green New Deal really work? After a series of remarks on immigrants who, he said, must ""love our country"", Mr Trump said, ""We have people in Congress that hate our country."" ""And you know that, and we can name every one of them if you want,"" he said. The 116th Congress is considered the most diverse in history He also defended his summit with North Korea leader Mr Kim, telling the crowd they had made ""a lot of progress"" and saying the country had ""an incredible, brilliant future"". Mr Trump also pledged to protect free speech on US university campuses with an executive order. Conservatives have said some US universities stifle right-wing opinions. The speech came at the end of a difficult week for the president. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen called him a ""racist"", ""conman"" and a ""cheat""in a congressional hearing.

How the 'Mueller report' may look,"Robert Mueller's report goes first to the attorney general, who will decide how much to release to the public It's been 22 months since former FBI Director Robert Mueller was appointed to head a special investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and whether the Trump campaign was involved. Now his work is done and his report has been submitted to the Department of Justice. But what does that mean? Time Magazine senior editor Ryan Teague Beckwith has described trying to keep up with the twists in the Mueller investigation as akin to understanding the plot of a Russian novel by listening to a book club conversation. Now, at last, perhaps we will see the full manuscript. Or at least the CliffsNotes (that's York Notes to you Brits). Or maybe we won't. If it all seems confusing, that's because no-one knows exactly what happens next. It doesn't mean we'll know all the details immediately - or ever. The notoriously tight-lipped former FBI director could simply announce that his work is done, pack his bags and go back to a private life of golf clubs, corporate boards, academic speaking engagements and trips to the Apple store Genius Bar. Not necessarily. In fact, probably not. It doesn't seem likely there will be a detailed investigative narrative presented to the public similar to the multi-tome report produced by Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr back in 1998. Boxes and boxes of the Starr report Mr Starr's wide-ranging investigation that started with a real-estate inquiry and ended up scouring Bill Clinton's affair with Monica Lewinsky was governed by a federal statute with different rules. And Mr Starr himself - a former judge and Republican administration lawyer - was a different kind of man to the by-the-books ex-Marine Mueller. Mr Mueller's probe is conducted under the auspices of the Justice Department and isgoverned by its regulations,external. The special counsel's obligations at the conclusion of his work are to provide a ""confidential report"" to Attorney General Bill Barr explaining his prosecutorial decisions. The Trump-Russia saga in 250 words What does the special counsel do? Mr Barr must then provide the top members of the Senate and House Judiciary committees with a brief explanation of any actions taken - or instances where he overruled the special counsel's proposed action. It is up to the attorney general to decide whether it would be in the ""public interest"" to make any of these reports or communications accessible to the rest of us. This is the million-dollar question. In his testimony during his January Senate confirmation hearings, Mr Barr was repeatedly pressed by Democrats to promise he would make public any findings or reports produced by the Mueller investigation. He demurred. Now, in his just-released letter to senior members of Congress, the attorney general seems eager to tell us more. ""I am reviewing the report and anticipate that I may be in a position to advise you of the Special Counsel's principal conclusions as soon as this weekend,"" he writes. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? Five big things Mueller is looking at Traditionally the Justice Department has been reluctant to provide information about investigations that do not lead to criminal prosecution. That was a guideline notably violated by former FBI Director James Comey during his July 2016 press statement outlining the results of a federal investigation into Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server while she was Barack Obama's secretary of state. It would be ironic, to say the least, if the resulting political fallout from Mr Comey's decision - which Ms Clinton's campaign believes dealt a mortal wound - is used by Mr Barr to defend a decision to keep confidential damaging details of the Mueller investigation involving Donald Trump. His letter concludes: ""I remain committed to as much transparency as possible, and I will keep you informed as to the status of my review."" It's certainly a possibility. Or if we do learn something, it could take a while to render it into a form for public consumption (or, given the way things work in Washington, to leak). Imagine the scene in Washington, as the political world learns Mr Mueller has provided his findings to Mr Barr and then waits - for hours, days - to learn what, if anything, will come of it. There is another possibility, however. Up until now, Mr Mueller has spoken through his court filings, which are rich in detail and new revelations. While Mr Mueller's report to the attorney general will be confidential, it may not be his final word at the conclusion of his investigations. There may be more indictments to come. This video can not be played Mueller is done... this is what we know so far Over the course of the last 21 months, Mr Mueller - in his prosecutorial documents - has explained how Russian agents and operatives allegedly gathered information about the US political process, initiated a social media campaign to influence and enflame American political views, funded on-the-ground political activities, and hacked the emails and files of top Democratic operatives in an effort to damage Mrs Clinton's presidential campaign. He has prosecuted multiple members of the president's inner campaign circle for a variety of misdeeds, including obstruction of justice and lying about Russian contacts. He helped strike a deal with Mr Trump's personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, which unearthed evidence of Trump business negotiations with Russian officials conducted in the heat of the 2016 presidential campaign. He indicted a Trump confidant, Roger Stone, for lying about his contacts with Wikileaks, the organisation he says was the conduit through which Russia injected its purloined material into the American political bloodstream. Former Trump adviser Roger Stone is among those indicted in connection with the inquiry The special counsel could be building a prosecutorial path that leads to the White House, with the final stones about to be set. Court-watchers note multiple sealed indictments have been filed in the federal courts used by Mr Mueller's team over the past few months. Those could be political and legal bombs, with their fuses lit. Or they could be duds. Hardly. Even if the Mueller investigation closes up shop and there is no ""report"", there are no new indictments and the attorney general's public pronouncements provide few details, it's not the end of the story. There are a number of cases initiated by the special counsel - involving Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn and deputy campaign aide Rick Gates - that still await final sentencing. Former campaign chairman Paul Manafort has been jailed for fraud and for conspiracy related to illegal lobbying. Long-time Trump adviser Mr Stone has yet to go to trial on his charges of lying to Congress, witness tampering and obstruction of justice. Mr Mueller has handed this prosecution over to government lawyers. There's also a special counsel case against Concord Management and Consulting, which Mr Mueller has charged with assisting Russia's 2016 social media election-meddling campaign. Meanwhile there's a plethora of other ongoing investigations that are being run independently of the special counsel's office. Federal investigators in New York are looking into possible election-law violations by the Trump campaign and his businesses and misconduct by the Trump inaugural committee. The US attorneys in Washington and Virginia also have their hands full, with the espionage case involving Russian Maria Butina and an unregistered foreign lobbying prosecution of Mr Flynn's business associates. There are also state-level investigations of Mr Trump's charitable foundation and Trump Organization tax filings, as well as an ongoing lawsuit by Maryland and the District of Columbia alleging that the president, through his business dealings, is violating a constitutional rule prohibiting the acceptance of money from foreign governments while in office. Mr Mueller may exit the stage, but the drama will continue. Bernie Sanders runs for president again Bird steals the show at Sanders rally.

"Girl, 17, stabbed to death in park","Police said Jodie Chesney died at the scene A 17-year-old girl has been stabbed to death at a park in east London. Jodie Chesney's grandmother said in a Facebook appeal that the stabbing - on Friday night in Harold Hill, Romford - had been an ""unprovoked attack"". Jodie died at the scene, in St Neots Road, at about 21:30 GMT. The Metropolitan Police confirmed Jodie's identity, but no arrests have yet been made. Jodie's next-of-kin have been informed and post-mortem tests are due to be held. Jodie was found dead in a park on Friday night On Facebook, Jodie's grandmother Debbie Chesney wrote: ""How have we come to this point where kids can't have a walk in a park without suffering an unprovoked attack? ""If anyone knows anything about this please contact the police with information. We don't want anyone else to go through what our family is suffering right now. This has to stop, there are too many young people having their lives cut short by needless violence."" A playground in the park has been the focus of forensic invesitgations Jodie's death comes less than a week after 20-year-old ChÃ© Morrisonwas stabbed to death outside Ilford train station in east London. Police have sealed off the park and forensic officers are at the scene. One resident, whose flat overlooks the park, said she rushed out after her family heard a commotion and tried to help Jodie as she lay bleeding. A small group of people cried and hugged each other after laying a bunch of flowers at the cordon with the message ""we love you forever in our hearts."" Another message attached to a floral tribute said: ""You are so strong. We will always remember you."" Flowers were left at the scene, with one message reading 'RIP Angel' Hairdresser Ellie Best, 17, said she and her family had moved to Harold Hill from east London for the ""good strong community"". She said: ""No-one should have to get a call to say that their child has been killed. ""It is becoming more and more like central London here. Children did not fight or anything and you did not hear of people being mugged. There has never been knife crime here before - it is just in the last six or seven months. ""I worry for the younger youths. Police need to talk to them about the dangers of carrying knives because the message is not getting through."" Miss Best said the park was used by local children to ""just hang out"". One woman told the BBC the stabbing highlighted ""one of the issues we have in Havering - community are not reporting what they're seeing, therefore Havering is not seen as an area of concern"". Under-reporting of crime was an issue in Havering, one woman said Jodie is the first teenage girl to die in a homicide in the capital this year. She became the 18th person to be killed in London this year, and the fifth teenager to die. Last year, two 17-year-old girls and one 18-year-old woman were murdered in London. London killings: All the victims of 2018 Can knife crime be stopped before it starts? Knife crime in the capital: Can Chicago's model cure the violence? Acting Det Ch Supt John Ross, of the Met, described the latest death as a ""tragedy"" and said police would carry out extra patrols around Harold Hill ""in the coming days"". Police officers search near the scene on St Neots Road in Harold Hill, Romford He also said there had been a reduction in knife crime since the middle of last year, particularly in relation to people aged under 25. ""But we are not complacent, bearing down on violent crime in the streets of London is a top priority for the Met,"" he said. Urging potential witnesses to come forward, he added: ""Your information could take a knife off the street or save a life."" London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""devastated"" by the stabbing. Mr Khan, who has a 17-year-old daughter himself, urged members of the community to contact police. This video can not be played London Mayor Sadiq Khan said he was ""devastated"" at the news Councillor Paul McGeary, who represents the Gooshays ward where the killing happened, arrived with fellow councillor Tele Lawal to lay flowers at the scene. The park is known locally as Amy's Park, with a playground in the centre, which has been the focus of forensics investigations. Both councillors said they and their families had used the park, which is in a residential area. Mr McGeary spoke of his ""shock and horror"" that it had happened in the semi-rural outer London borough. He said: ""This is not something that happens here and I am just completely surprised."" He could not say if it was gang-related, but described it as ""tragic"". He added: ""It is very shocking for the whole community. I think people will be talking to each other and hopefully providing support to the relatives of the unfortunate person who died."" Ms Lawal, 22, said: ""It is not an area where you will frequently see violence like this. ""It is going to shock our community but it just shows the strain that is happening with young people, with our police and the resources we need in our community to tackle violence like this.""

SpaceX capsule demo flight lifts off,"This video can not be played SpaceX has launched the Falcon 9 rocket and capsule The demonstration of a new US system to get astronauts into orbit is under way. The SpaceX company has launched a capsule designed to carry people from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The mission is uncrewed for this flight, but if it goes well, the American space agency is likely to approve the system for regular astronaut use from later this year. SpaceX founder Elon Musk said this could be the first step towards opening space travel to commercial customers. Not since the retirement of the shuttles in 2011 has the US been able to put humans in orbit. The billionaire who wants to fly to the Moon OneWeb launches pathfinder satellites It has been paying to use Russian Soyuz vehicles instead. SpaceX's Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon crew capsule lifted off from Kennedy's historic Pad 39A at the precise planned time of 02:49 EST (07:49 GMT). The 11-minute ascent put the Dragon on a path to rendezvous with the International Space Station (ISS) on Sunday. Because this is just a demonstration, there are no astronauts aboard - but there is a ""test dummy"". Dressed in a spacesuit and sitting next to a window, this anthropomorphic simulator is fitted with sensors around the head, neck, and spine. It will gather data on the type of forces that humans will experience when they get to ride in the spacecraft. SpaceX has nicknamed the dummy ""Ripley"" - after the Sigourney Weaver character in the Alien movies. Ripley has a microphone next to ""her"" ear to record the sounds astronauts would hear For the California company, this mission is a key milestone in its short history. Mr Musk, a technology entrepreneur and engineer, set up the organisation with the specific intention of taking people into space. ""It's been 17 years to get to this point, from 2002 to now. To be frank, I'm a little emotionally exhausted because it was super stressful,"" he told reporters immediately after the launch. ""Our focus has been on serving Nasa's needs but once Dragon is in regular operation, I think we will seek commercial customers of which the Nasa administrator, and Nasa in general, has been very supportive."" This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk? Meet the meme-loving magnate behind SpaceX and Tesla...published in 2021 Mr Musk said those customers could include private citizens going to the ISS, just as they have done on Soyuz vehicles in the past. Separately, the entrepreneur is developing a much bigger system - which he calls the Starship and Super Heavy rocket - to transport people to the Moon and Mars. Spectators turned out in the early hours in Florida to watch the launch The Dragon crew capsule is a variant on the ISS cargo freighter flown by SpaceX. Upgrades include life-support systems, obviously; and more powerful thrusters to push the vessel to safety if something goes wrong with a rocket during an ascent to orbit. It also has four parachutes instead of the freighter's three to control the return to Earth. Dragon crew capsules will splash down in the Atlantic not far from Kennedy. Artwork: The crew ship will approach the station from the front and dock automatically Nasa is essentially now contracting out crew transport to SpaceX. Whereas in the past, Nasa engineers would have top-down control of all aspects of vehicle design and the agency would own and operate the hardware - the relationship with industry has been put on a completely new footing. Today, Nasa sets broad requirements and industry is given plenty of latitude in how it meets those demands. Agency officials still check off every step, but the approach is regarded as more efficient and less costly. Nasa chief, Jim Bridenstine, stressed on Saturday that the re-introduction of American crew transport did not mean an end to cooperation with Russia. ""We want to make sure that we keep our partnership with Russia which has been very strong for a long period of time, going all the way back to the Apollo-Soyuz era,"" he said. ""But we also want to make sure we have our own capability to get back and forth to the International Space Station, so that we can have this strong partnership where they can launch on our rockets and we can launch on their rockets."" After being taken to orbit, the Dragon makes its own way to the station using onboard thrusters. One of the big differences between this mission and standard cargo flights is the mode of approach and attachment to the ISS. Freighters come up under the orbiting lab and are grappled by a robotic arm and pulled into a berthing position. On this occasion, we will see the crew version of Dragon approach the station at the bow and dock automatically, using a new design of connection ring. Arrival is set for 11:00 GMT on Sunday. ISS astronauts will be watching closely to see that the capsule behaves as it should. The Dragon is expected to stay at the station until Friday. The current plan has it undocking, firing its thrusters to come out of orbit, and splashing down at roughly 13:45 GMT. Kirk Shireman, the manager of Nasa's ISS programme, said: ""You'll hear us talk about this being a flight test; it absolutely is, although we view it also as a real mission, a very critical mission. ""The ISS still has three people onboard so this mission coming up to the ISS for the first time has to work; it has to work."" Nasa is also working with Boeing on crew transport.

Billionaire who wants to go to the Moon,"Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa first entered the public eye as a drummer in a hardcore punk band. He went on to make a fortune as an online fashion tycoon, and is best known outside Japan for spending tens of millions of dollars at record-breaking art auctions. Mr Maezawa's ambitions now stretch beyond Earth. He hopes to be the first civilian passenger to fly to the Moon, as part of an ambitious project with Elon Musk's SpaceX. The colourful executive wants to take a group of artists with him on the flight slated for 2023. Mr Maezawa, 42, has not revealed how much he paid for the trip, which brings together two eccentric billionaires who are not averse to being in the global spotlight. The Japanese entrepreneur began selling rare CDs and records in 1998 through a company he founded called Start Today. The mail-order catalogue business moved online at the turn of the millennium and added clothes to its offering. ""I was president of my company while touring around the country with the band,""he told the Japan Times earlier this year.,external""When it became physically impossible to handle both, I chose my company - that was around when I was 25 or 26."" He launched fashion e-retailer Zozotown in 2004, and by the time he was in his mid-30s, he was a billionaire. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Forbes magazine now lists him as the 18th richest man in Japan with a personal wealth of $2.9bn (Â£2.2bn). His company recently made headlines after it launched a bodysuit that customers can use to upload their exact body measurements to the clothes shopping site. He has splashed his cash at high-profile contemporary art auctions and paid $110.5m (Â£84m) last year for a large piece by Jean-Michel Basquiat - a record for the late US artist. At the time he said he planned to put it on display eventually at a museum in Chiba, his hometown. In 2016, he paid $57.3m for another Basquiat work - Devil's Head. He said in a statement he ""felt shivers"" when he first saw it. ""Regardless of its condition or sales value, I was driven by the responsibility to acknowledge great art and the need to pass on not only the artwork itself, but also the knowledge of the artist's culture and his way of life to future generations,"" he said. Yusaku Maezawa posted an image of Devil's Head in 2016 with the caption: ""Jean-Michel Basquiat is coming to Japan"" Now, the billionaire plans to use his trip around the Moon to inspire new ""masterpieces,"" created by the artists he chooses to accompany him. ""They will be asked to create something after they return to Earth. These masterpieces will inspire the dreamer within all of us,"" the future amateur astronaut told reporters. The art project called #dearMoon,externalwas presented in a video released shortly afterhe and Mr Musk announced the Moon flight. The price Mr Maezawa agreed to pay for his ticket to space has not been disclosed, but according to Mr Musk it's ""a lot of money"". Still, doubt remains over whether or not Mr Maezawa and his art troupe will make it to orbit the Moon. The launch relies on a rocket yet to be built, and Mr Musk himself said it was not ""100% certain we can bring this to flight"".

The 'gravity-defying' art that washes away,"Landscape gardener Sam Bennett makes beautiful sculptures from raw materials he finds on beaches. Stones and driftwood are the foundations of his work near his home in Torquay, Devon. The 26-year-old started making the sculptures about 12 years ago while still at school. ""I never had an X-box and I am always happy when I'm outside,"" he says. ""I read some books about [British sculptor] Andy Goldsworthy and it just became a hobby. ""Growing up, I was infatuated by making a living from nature. ""Even when I was doing exams at school I still wanted to go to the beach and build something."" The tides may wash away his work but he says its ephemeral nature is key to why he does it. ""It's there for a moment and gone the next, I'm just moving nature around,"" he says of his art. ""I like that because if it's not perfect the tide will take it and I will try again tomorrow. ""And there's an element of excitement about seeing the tide coming in and in a couple of hours it has been destroyed."" Mr Bennett shares pictures of his beach art onInstagram,externaland fans of his work sometimes visit the beaches where he is working. They include children who cannot resist the temptation to knock the work over before the tide comes in. ""I would rather see the sea destroy it, but I would have done the same when I was kid"" he says. Mr Bennett has been working at some beach spots so long that he even remembers some of the pebbles. And he destroys his own sculptures before leaving if they are on a popular beach to avoid anyone being injured. ""Most of the places are so remote it's not a problem,"" he says. He is at the beach most days for several hours. ""Some people said I am ruining the beach but I'm not hurting anyone and I'm not littering and in a few hours it will be gone. ""I read the news and there's a lot of pain in the world. If I did not do what I do it would all get too much for me. ""We live in a world that we are destroying and if I can add something beautiful even for five minutes it brings happiness to people.""

"Johnny Depp sues ex-wife over articleHe says Amber Heard's reference to domestic violence is defamatory and a ""hoax"".US & Canada","The couple met when both starred in the film The Rum Diary in 2010 The actor Johnny Depp has launched legal action against his ex-wife Amber Heard, accusing her of defamation. In December,Ms Heard, also an actor, wrote an article for the Washington Post,externaldescribing the backlash she faced due to speaking out about domestic violence. Mr Depp's lawsuit says he ""never abused Ms Heard"" and the claims are ""part of an elaborate hoax"" to advance his ex-wife's career. He is seeking $50m (Â£38m) in damages. Ms Heard first accused Mr Depp of domestic violence in May 2016, the year after they were married.Mr Depp was ordered to stay away from herandthe couple divorced in 2017. Photo evidence from 2016 of the injuries Amber Heard claimed were caused by Johnny Depp's domestic violence In her piece for The Washington Post, Ms Heard does not name Mr Depp but describes her experience of speaking out against domestic violence, stating she ""faced our culture's wrath"". She said she had lost a role in a film, was dropped by a major fashion brand and witnessed ""how institutions protect men accused of abuse"". Mr Depp's defamation claim says the article worked on the ""central premise that Ms Heard was a domestic abuse victim and that Mr Depp perpetrated domestic violence against her"" and states that she was in fact the perpetrator. The lawsuit claims her allegations lost him his lucrative role as Jack Sparrow in the Pirates of the Caribbean. The couple faced an Australian court for failing to declare their two dogs when entering the country in 2015 Ms Heard's attorney Eric George told People magazine thatMr Depp's legal action is an attempt to silence his ex-wife,externalbut ""she will not be silenced"". He said Mr Depp's actions ""prove he is unable to accept the truth of his ongoing abusive behaviour"", but that Ms Heard's legal team would ""prevail in defeating this groundless lawsuit"". In response, Mr Depp's attorney Adam Waldman told the magazine ""we hardly intend to silence Ms Heard"" but ""look forward to holding the overwhelming video, photographic and eyewitness evidence we finally possess up against Amber Heard's (so far silent) attempts to explain the inexplicable"".
